30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,051
20-320 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

31
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:26,132
Be it resolved that the city administration give us an update on the policy dealing with public parking during this trying time.

32
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:27,712
Councilor Scarpelli.

33
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,840
Thank you, Mr. President.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,121
I appreciate everybody for being here.

35
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:53,150
I know I've talked to the chief of staff about this a few weeks ago, but again, I've been getting phone calls about Republic Parking and whether they're, you know, the question, the misconception that they're not in the business district or they are in the business district, that they're, are they essential?

36
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,330
Are they non-essential?

37
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,159
I'll give you a few examples.

38
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,394
It's seeing that what I'm hearing is that they're going into the neighborhoods.

39
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:22,578
and really bearing down on neighborhood parking where some parking issues, as I talked to some constituents, have never been an issue for years, and they're coming down and ticketing certain areas, and it doesn't limit to one area of the city.

40
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:28,963
I hear in West Medford, I hear in South Medford, I hear in North Medford that, so really, if we can,

41
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:43,991
is really, if we can get Mr. Rodriguez, if you can, look into really defining and putting something out there so our constituents understand what the process is.

42
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:48,397
Because I think there is a misconception that it's not essential and it shouldn't be out there.

43
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:59,181
They are essential, but they're not doing the business district, but they are obligated to go into the communities, into the neighborhoods.

44
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:07,824
I think that's what I've been hearing, and if we can get that concern taken care of or addressed, that'd be greatly appreciated.

45
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:08,204
Thank you.

46
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:11,145
Okay.

47
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,985
Any of the councillors like to speak on this?

48
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:18,707
Okay, Claude Hernandez, do you have any emails?

49
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,967
Mr. President, I do not have any emails on this topic.

50
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,247
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli.

51
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,448
Second, Mr. President.

52
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,229
Second by Vice President Caravaglio.

53
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:30,809
Please call the roll.

54
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:35,951
Councilor Behrs.

55
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:36,811
Yes.

56
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:38,392
Vice President Caravaglio.

57
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:38,952
Yes.

58
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,132
Councilor Knight.

59
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:40,672
Yes.

60
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:41,953
Councilor Marks.

61
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:42,953
Yes.

62
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,274
Councilor Morrell.

63
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:44,954
Yes.

64
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,194
Councilor Scarpelli.

65
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:46,754
Yes.

66
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:47,955
President Falco.

67
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,996
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

68
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:54,525
20-321 offered by Consuelo Scarpelli.

69
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,429
Be it resolved that the city administration give us an update dealing with the census.

70
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,690
Consuelo Scarpelli.

71
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:01,588
Thank you again, Mr. President.

72
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:30,183
With what's going on in our time today and the fear of budget decreases and the downfalls we're looking to have possibly, adding the lack of information gathered by the census and losing any sort of federal money because we haven't done our due diligence as a leadership and a community,

73
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:50,938
I know that if we can, I want to make amendment, if we can reach out to state delegates to see if there is, I know there was talk about an extension, when they were going to, actually the kickoff I believe was April 1st, and now it's, I haven't heard, we haven't heard much about it.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:04,628
is could the city administration, could we look at non-essential employees that are getting paid, that aren't working at City Hall?

75
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:15,956
Is there a way we can put a team together that can reach out right now via phone or other avenues to get people interested, get them involved in returning their census forms?

76
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:30,418
I think that while there is a lull in one facet of government, I think that maybe we can look at a way to take advantage of our educated and capable employees within City Hall.

77
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:41,584
to really mount an attack and get the information out that's needed to get the information back that we're going to need for our schools and our police stations and fire stations and DPW.

78
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,826
It's going to be massively important.

79
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:52,092
And I know that we did talk about it, but I just wanted to gather some information with that.

80
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:52,453
Thank you.

81
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,486
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

82
00:06:54,586 --> 00:07:02,691
And if I may really quick, Neil Osborne, who is basically the point person, I believe, for the city with regard to the census.

83
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:17,261
We were going back and forth before coronavirus, trying to set up a committee, the whole meeting, just to give everyone an update as to what the plans were with regard to what the city was gonna do and how things were going to operate with regard to the census.

84
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:20,964
And once coronavirus happened,

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,768
everything kind of went off track.

86
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,650
So I'm going to try to schedule a committee the whole meeting.

87
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,974
I'm not sure if Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez had mentioned previously that Neil might be on the call.

88
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,315
Do we know if Neil's on the call?

89
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:35,436
I just checked with him.

90
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,417
He's not on the call right now.

91
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,178
And I just checked with him.

92
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:40,199
I haven't heard back.

93
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,680
OK, no problem.

94
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,841
It doesn't sound like he's on the call.

95
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:50,166
But I will schedule a committee the whole meeting with Neil to set up a Zoom call so we can actually specifically talk about the census.

96
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,767
But Councilor Scott, it looks like you

97
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,348
I think if we can, I appreciate that, that'd be a great start.

98
00:07:55,388 --> 00:08:01,411
I think if we can invite the, I know each community has a representative from the Census Bureau.

99
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:08,234
If we can invite them also, I don't know if Mr. Rodriguez could pass that along to Neil Osborne.

100
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:14,617
I know that each, like I said, each community has someone that works for the Census Bureau as a

101
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:24,124
contact person, if we can find out who that is and invite them to that committee, the whole meeting, to see what they're doing at the federal level too.

102
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,065
So, thank you.

103
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:26,146
Thank you.

104
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,949
Are there any questions regarding this resolution?

105
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,330
Any comments from the council?

106
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,053
Any comments in general?

107
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:37,055
Okay.

108
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,199
Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, did you have a comment you wanted to make?

109
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,400
Yeah, just the one thing.

110
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:51,106
I do know that Neil has been continuing his work with the Complete Count Committee and the community liaison, so she was in the office right before all this jumped off, so she has been working with that.

111
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,750
I did check on our self-community response rates before the meeting tonight.

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,911
And Medford has a self-response rate of 58.5%.

113
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,771
Massachusetts overall has a 55.8%.

114
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:05,172
So we're a little bit above the state average.

115
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,612
A little bit behind Somerville, they're at 58.8.

116
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:11,053
Malden, we're ahead of Malden and Everett.

117
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,313
Malden's at 50.8.

118
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,333
Everett is at 42.7.

119
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,634
And we're lagging behind Winchester and Arlington.

120
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,695
Arlington's at 69% and Winchester is at 71.7.

121
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,354
It's kind of all over the place, but we are above the state average.

122
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:33,678
And I do know Neil has been working hard to try to re-understand the importance, like Councilor Scarpelli said, about this is how everything happens.

123
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:35,619
This is how all the formulas get written.

124
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,040
This is how all the numbers get derived.

125
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,340
So we understand the importance.

126
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,802
We want to drive up these numbers to get the most accurate, complete count we can.

127
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:42,622
Excellent.

128
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,003
Thank you.

129
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:43,983
Thank you.

130
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:44,703
Councilor Morrell.

131
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,164
Thank you, Mr. President.

132
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:50,006
I was just curious how often we could get updates on that percentage response rate.

133
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:53,780
They're available online all the time, so they're done in real time.

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,302
I can email the link to the councilors, and you can see how we're measuring up to everybody else.

135
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:01,125
If you could, I'd greatly appreciate that.

136
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:01,645
Councilor Beers?

137
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:09,951
Yeah, and I think one other thing that's on that website is that our final self-response rate in 2010 was 68%.

138
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:13,894
So obviously, we want to get above that, given that

139
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,235
all the people who don't do the self-response, someone comes to their door, and that's gonna be a whole other set of circumstances given what's going on.

140
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,576
So a really big push is good.

141
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:32,241
And I think also Chief of Staff Rodriguez, the communities you outlined and the difference in the response rates are pretty clear why that's happening, right?

142
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,903
The richer neighborhoods and towns have a higher response rate.

143
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:41,367
So I think a really important effort on reaching out to folks who we may not always reach is gonna be important.

144
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:44,997
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

145
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,938
Any other questions or comments?

146
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,422
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by- Second, Mr. President.

147
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,084
Vice President Carviello, Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

148
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:00,486
Councilor Beers?

149
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:01,187
Yes.

150
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:02,788
Vice President Carviello?

151
00:11:03,348 --> 00:11:03,568
Yes.

152
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:04,769
Councilor Knight?

153
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:05,690
Yes.

154
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,750
Councilor Marks?

155
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:07,751
Yes.

156
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:08,812
Councilor Morrell?

157
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:09,632
Yes.

158
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:10,673
Councilor Scarpelli?

159
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:14,669
Councilor Scarpelli.

160
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:16,190
Sorry about that, yes.

161
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,431
President Falco.

162
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,212
Yes, and the affirmative is zero.

163
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,313
Zero in the negative, the motion passes.

164
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:22,514
Mr. President.

165
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,316
That was with Councilor Scarpelli's amendment?

166
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:27,798
Yes.

167
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,240
As amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

168
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,680
Got it.

169
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:36,405
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 20316 that was tabled from last week.

170
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:37,325
Second.

171
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:38,766
Second.

172
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:42,489
On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight to take

173
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,761
2-0, 3-1-6.

174
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,501
From the table.

175
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:51,564
All those in favor.

176
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:53,785
Get a vote, roll call.

177
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,526
Clerk Hernebies, please call the roll.

178
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,868
This is to suspend to take 3-1-6.

179
00:11:59,188 --> 00:11:59,388
Yes.

180
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:00,609
Councilor Behrs.

181
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:01,389
Yes.

182
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,150
Vice President Carabiello.

183
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:03,770
Yes.

184
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,651
Councilor Knight.

185
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:05,411
Yes.

186
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,312
Councilor Marks.

187
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:07,192
Yes.

188
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:08,433
Councilor Morrell.

189
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:09,213
Yes.

190
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:10,334
Councilor Scarpelli.

191
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:10,934
Yes.

192
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:11,975
President Falco.

193
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,681
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

194
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:35,258
20-316, April 16th, 2020, to President John Falcone, honorable members of the Memphis City Council, from Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern, regarding loan order city sidewalks, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

195
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:40,061
City method loan order citywide sidewalks, be it ordered that the sum of $500,000 be hereby

196
00:12:43,361 --> 00:13:12,095
is appropriated to pay the cost of repairing, constructing, and reconstructing various sidewalks throughout the city, including engineering and design services, and for the payment of all costs incidentally related thereto, that to meet this appropriation, the city treasurer, with approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow said sum under Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 7.1, as amended and supplemented or pursuant to any other

197
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:17,238
and to issue bonds or notes of the city thereof.

198
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:41,196
Therefore, any premium received upon the sale of any bonds or notes approved by this order, lest any such premium applied to the payment of the cost of issuance of such bonds or notes may be applied to the payment of costs approved by this order in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 20, thereby reducing the amount authorized to be borrowed

199
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,188
to pay such costs by a like amount.

200
00:13:44,668 --> 00:14:04,224
If further order, that the city treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Municipal Finance Oversight Board to qualify into Chapter 44A of the general laws, any and all bonds or notes of the city authorized by this vote or pursuant to any prior vote of the city and in connection.

201
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:16,629
therewith to provide such information and execute such documents as the Municipal Finance Oversight Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require, very truly yours, Mayor Brianne Alago-Kern.

202
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,050
So last week, this paper came before us.

203
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:25,233
There were a number of questions that the councilors had for the administration.

204
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,255
We received some responses earlier today from

205
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,133
Let's see he's from my chief of staff Dave Rodriguez.

206
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:45,129
They were forwarded to us by Club her to bees did everyone have a chance to read those or what we can do is I can actually go through the questions and read up the answers so everyone can I

207
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,813
see what the responses were from the administration.

208
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,415
Vice President Cabello had the first question.

209
00:14:52,435 --> 00:15:06,202
He offered an amendment requesting information on whether the mayor and the DPW have looked into the pilot program mentioned in January to repair sidewalks for less money than it costs to replace them and whether method reached any agreement with Walden.

210
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:16,108
The answer, I assume that this question is regarding the request from the council that the administration explore the option of utilizing a method of sidewalk repair that involves grinding

211
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,853
and not full replacement.

212
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:29,277
The requested funding is for the continuation of a previously procured contract with an existing contractor, La Rovere Construction.

213
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm not aware of any negotiations or discussions that have been had by the administration with the city of Malden regarding sidewalk replacement.

214
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,042
We will look into the feasibility of the sidewalk repair method vendor in future contracts.

215
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,543
So that was the answer to the first question.

216
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,765
Second question was asked by Councilor Marks.

217
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,487
Council Marks offered an amendment requesting the answer to the following question.

218
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,608
Is the administration working from a list?

219
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,089
The answer, yes.

220
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:12,437
While the pavement condition index, the PCI project is set to begin this summer, the mayor has asked the DPW commissioner and city engineer for a list based on their experience of sidewalks that are in the most need

221
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:21,372
of replacement, the sidewalks to be replaced and selected by using the following criteria in no particular order.

222
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,652
One, age of the request.

223
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,473
Two, condition of the surrounding sidewalks and driveway aprons.

224
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:35,915
Three, geography, an attempt is made to spread it out equitably throughout the city.

225
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:46,083
Part B to the question, if there is a list, what percentage of the work on this list is being done with this $500,000?

226
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,906
The answer, it depends on the on the ground conditions for each sidewalk.

227
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:54,309
The hope is to stretch the work as far as possible.

228
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:01,995
Last year, the city was able to replace 232 sidewalks of varying lengths under the current contract in 2019.

229
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,937
Part C, is there a priority list?

230
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,780
The answer is yes, based on the criteria above.

231
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,717
Part D, when will the work take place?

232
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,938
Answer, upcoming construction season.

233
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:20,262
Number three, Councilor Morrell offered an amendment requesting answers to the following questions.

234
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:27,505
A, can the administration please clarify what phase three is and are there additional phases?

235
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:35,849
B, does the administration anticipate making another request for funding sidewalk repairs and to when does that carry us?

236
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,090
The answer is,

237
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,520
that this is the second part of a two-year contract.

238
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,046
Sidewalk repair replacement is constantly needed and subject to availability of funds.

239
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:52,991
Number four, Council appears off an amendment requesting answers to the following question.

240
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:58,697
How does this project in its funding fit into the COVID-19 impact on city finances?

241
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:02,000
And does this funding request need to be pared back?

242
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:12,445
Answer, the administration is currently working on understanding the extent of COVID-19 we'll have on our city finances for current and future fiscal years.

243
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,087
A request has been put forth to complete a current contract.

244
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:23,109
The city's finance team believes that this is within our capacity at this time.

245
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,770
Question five, what is the current free cash balance?

246
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,171
The answer is approximately $12 million.

247
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,920
Number six, what is the city's current bonding capacity?

248
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,985
The answer, the city is authorized to borrow up to 5% of the equalized values in the community.

249
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:44,269
City is currently borrowing less than 1% of the EQB.

250
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,832
The city's borrowing capacity currently exceeds $500 million.

251
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:57,560
So those are questions that the administration, well actually these are the questions and answers, the answers from the administration.

252
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,174
At this point in time, I'll recognize Councilor Marks.

253
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,655
Thank you, Mr. President.

254
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:06,996
I want to thank Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez for his timely response.

255
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:16,840
The question I do have, and maybe I didn't pose it correctly last week, I'm trying to figure out how existing sidewalks are on our list currently.

256
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,115
So I have the list, I have the full list.

257
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,076
I had meant to scan the full list for my office.

258
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,157
It's probably about this thick of all the sidewalks in the city.

259
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:34,519
And as complaints come through from different sources, they come from counselors, they come from to the mayor's office through C-Click Fix, that data is collected on that list.

260
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,660
And then people go out to make assessments based upon the need for replacement.

261
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,901
So I can certainly, it's just a large list.

262
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:44,262
I'm happy to provide you with a copy and scan that to you.

263
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,542
It is a very large file though.

264
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:48,603
That's why I didn't send it around, but I can certainly make that available.

265
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:55,948
Okay, in the past, Dave, we were able to get a list of sidewalk repairs.

266
00:19:57,388 --> 00:20:08,873
And by a number of criteria, the date it was requested, the type or condition of the sidewalk, when it was reported,

267
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,876
uh, when, when it's scheduled to be done.

268
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,177
So there was a list that it was, uh, you know, available in the past.

269
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm just trying to get a handle on, uh, knowing that in 2019, we did roughly 232 sidewalks.

270
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,043
Um, what percent of, uh, this year's money will get us through what list we have.

271
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:36,225
So if we have a thousand on the list, is it safe to say we're going to do a quarter of the sidewalks or roughly?

272
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:40,517
Well, it's hard to tell because when we get out there, we take a look at what the surroundings.

273
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:43,498
So we take a look at the sidewalks next to it, the sidewalks to either side.

274
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,379
We took a look at the driveway, we take a look at the curbing.

275
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,760
So different sidewalks can take, can cost different amounts of money.

276
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,522
So chewing through the money, it could, that number could go up and it certainly could go down depending on conditions on the ground.

277
00:20:56,007 --> 00:21:00,410
So we certainly try to stretch the money out as far as we can to get as many sidewalks done as we possibly can.

278
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:08,374
But it's hard to tell until we actually get out on the ground and we start evaluating the exact conditions that we're going to face when we start replacing.

279
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:09,995
Right.

280
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:18,360
So based on the criteria information, one of the criteria is the age of the sidewalk and the other is condition.

281
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,521
And I think there's a couple of other criteria.

282
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:24,784
So are all these sidewalks that are currently on the list

283
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,262
I'm just trying to pin down exactly what you're saying.

284
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,327
you're looking for, and I want to give you the best info possible.

285
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:58,529
But the list in itself is about 117, 120 pages of sidewalks throughout the city.

286
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,650
And they are very, very in condition.

287
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,330
Right.

288
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,973
So as one member of the council, it would be helpful to find out, first of all, the number.

289
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,094
And that could be sent to us in an Excel spreadsheet very easily.

290
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:10,534
Sure.

291
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,283
the number of sidewalks that are on the list ranked by condition.

292
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,664
So just say it's one through four.

293
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:29,710
If four is a very problem trip hazard safety concern, it'd be interesting to know we have out of a thousand sidewalks, 800 of these compared to a level three or level two or level one.

294
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:37,295
So that way, to me, it would be easier to make a judgment on whether or not we're actually moving forward on our sidewalks.

295
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:41,859
Because after 20 years of doing this, I don't see us moving forward.

296
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,861
And that's not a reflection on the current administration.

297
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:50,705
But to say how we've handled it over the years, we've never really gotten ahead of the current.

298
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:52,947
And I want to make sure

299
00:22:53,387 --> 00:23:10,988
whether it's the request of which Councilor Scott Pelley and many Councilors have talked about, creating our own sidewalk crew, or just to continue the way we've done business with throwing a half a million dollars at a time at the problem and never really getting

300
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,874
to a point where we can say, you know what?

301
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,134
We'll make it some headway.

302
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,416
Because I've been on the council 20 years.

303
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,477
I don't know if we're making headway.

304
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,738
I'd be surprised if any other councilors could tell me otherwise.

305
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,140
I could tell you from residents' standpoint, they don't believe we're making any headway.

306
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:30,663
And a lot of them that have been on the list for five, six, seven, eight years feel the same way.

307
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,584
So I just want to make sure we're moving in a direction.

308
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:36,306
And I know this administration's interested in doing so.

309
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:53,295
Provides results for us and gives us a clear direction Whether or not we're making some headway and I don't think I've been able to accomplish that over the many years Start now And say hey, you know what moving forward.

310
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,517
Is this the direction we want to continue?

311
00:23:56,417 --> 00:24:00,199
We want to keep on throwing money at this or do we want to maybe take this in-house?

312
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,141
And I think this is gonna be the year for me to make that decision

313
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:11,001
Sure, and I don't think we'll ever run out of sidewalks to fix, but I do agree with the sentiment of trying to make headway.

314
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:15,362
What you described in ranking condition of sidewalks is exactly what a PCI will do.

315
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:26,405
And as you index them appropriately, you're going to be able to say that we were able to do 55 level 4s, 50 level 3s, 25 level 2s, and be able to work through your list that way.

316
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:29,826
The problem with you have to do that classification first.

317
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,967
I don't know if we have them classified in that ranking yet.

318
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,648
but that's part of what that program is going to do.

319
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:39,029
So we have, we do have a list and we know certain conditions and age of requests.

320
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,270
So we're basing it on the best criteria we have.

321
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,191
And I can certainly get you that Excel spreadsheet from DPW.

322
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:48,772
I have it as a hard list, but I can, I have to track it down for as an electronic list that I can share with you.

323
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,332
That'd be helpful.

324
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,393
Thank you, Jason.

325
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:51,373
Thank you.

326
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:53,494
Councilor Morrell.

327
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:55,254
Thank you, Mr. President.

328
00:24:55,574 --> 00:25:01,396
So just clarifying that the 232 pieces of sidewalk that were accomplished in 2019, that is with the 500,000, that was the amount of money?

329
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,601
That was from the first half of the $1 million contract, so yes.

330
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:06,802
Right.

331
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:07,202
So $500,000.

332
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:07,802
OK.

333
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,003
Thank you.

334
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,045
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

335
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,486
Vice President Carvio.

336
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:13,967
Thank you, Mr. President.

337
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:16,570
I support Councilor Marks on this.

338
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:24,276
I don't think we'll ever make any headway by throwing $500,000 in the whack at this.

339
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:31,622
I mean, I've been there for several years now, and 200 sidewalks a year isn't very many.

340
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:43,257
Again, I would think half a million dollars would get us a crew that would work from April to November nonstop doing sidewalks.

341
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:46,717
Like I said, you'll never run out of sidewalks to fix.

342
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:58,980
And you can take those crew once you're able to stop doing the sidewalks, you can take them and you can put them onto the city side for powering or whatever else the city needs on that end.

343
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,520
So again, going forward,

344
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,543
I don't know if I'm going to support another money thing to fix sidewalks again.

345
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:13,806
My next question is, I don't know if this is for Chief of Staff Rodriguez or Treasurer Pompeo.

346
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,967
What is the rate we're borrowing money at right now?

347
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:17,947
I know it's fairly low.

348
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,716
Dave, is that a question you can answer?

349
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:23,496
Is that a question for Fred?

350
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,237
Yeah, Fred can answer as well.

351
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,137
I do know that these are competitive bonds.

352
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,858
So then the bond market isn't currently in flux.

353
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:34,940
So we won't really know what the rate that we'll borrow it until we go into market to sell the bonds.

354
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,041
But Fred can also expand on that as well.

355
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:41,322
Fred, what is the rate like right now?

356
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:50,905
We're 2.6 and 3.4, so we're probably still in that same range right now.

357
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:54,447
I don't have an exact rate.

358
00:26:54,647 --> 00:27:02,309
You don't get an exact rate until you actually issue it, but I would say that's a comfortable range right now in the twos to the low threes.

359
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,290
Are we doing this at a 10-year or a 20-year?

360
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,491
Well, that hasn't been decided yet.

361
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:12,633
I mean, where it's not that much a big amount of money, would a 10-year be more feasible?

362
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:17,365
Well, but you also look at the budget, you know, you're looking at your future budgets.

363
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,186
How do you want to spread out your money over the years?

364
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:29,331
So, yeah, that would be, we were working with Alicia on that until, you know, she took health, but, so we haven't really finalized that.

365
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:30,371
Yeah.

366
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:33,113
And I understand the money's going to be a little tight this year for some stuff.

367
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:37,815
So I understand that'll be a decision you'll probably make at budget time.

368
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:38,436
All right.

369
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:39,056
Thank you very much.

370
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,136
Thank you.

371
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:41,117
Thank you.

372
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,789
Thank you, Vice President Carvio.

373
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,250
Thank you, Treasurer Papio.

374
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,332
Adam Knight, did you have a question, Councilor Knight?

375
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:56,058
Okay, it looks like we lost Councilor Knight.

376
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:57,299
Councilor Beers.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,981
Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,362
And thanks for your answers, Dave.

379
00:28:02,502 --> 00:28:04,824
I know you said- I did, John Falco, Mr. President, I did.

380
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:08,787
This contract was put up to be correct.

381
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:10,648
Correct.

382
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,325
Councilor Knight, are you still there?

383
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:25,427
Okay, it sounds like Councilor Knight might have a connection issue.

384
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,228
Councilor Pierce, if you could please continue.

385
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,028
I'm still here.

386
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:29,848
I don't know what's going on.

387
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,669
I can see everything you've got doing.

388
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:35,249
Okay.

389
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,930
Are you ready to speak, Councilor Knight?

390
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,230
He has been.

391
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:43,631
Okay.

392
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,832
Councilor Knight, are you ready to speak?

393
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,993
I think so, Mr. President.

394
00:28:55,514 --> 00:29:00,096
My first question was whether or not this contract was put out to bid and when.

395
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:06,420
It was put out to bid prior to the 2019 construction season.

396
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,201
It's my understanding

397
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:23,862
We can't hear you, yeah.

398
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:26,764
Mr. President, can I make a suggestion?

399
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:27,844
Yes.

400
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:36,049
Maybe Councilor Knight could call in on his cell phone, or his house phone, where he can ask a question and still watch.

401
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:37,370
It might be easier for him.

402
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:44,054
I might just hang up and just say this is not working for me anymore, and I'm not doing it anymore, and we can get back to reality sometime soon too.

403
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,174
I hope so.

404
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:46,495
I'm sorry, buddy.

405
00:29:48,620 --> 00:30:00,910
But so I get the question I have is if this contract was put out to bid contract supposed to be appropriated and funded when signed.

406
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:03,852
Correct.

407
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,674
It was correct and I was a budget decision that was made last year.

408
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:11,098
We're filling in the gaps from last year's last year's contract signing.

409
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:19,147
Councilor Knight?

410
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,549
That's it for now, Mr. President.

411
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,151
Okay, thank you.

412
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:25,773
Councilor Beers, thank you for waiting patiently.

413
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,634
No, no worries.

414
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:28,895
So two questions.

415
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:37,022
Given that this was a, would this be the process that would be followed going forward?

416
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:41,226
Is this the, would it be issuing, putting out to bid another contract in the future?

417
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,928
Are you planning to do this differently?

418
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,931
So this will probably be built as part of a larger capital investment program.

419
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,433
It's currently underway.

420
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:58,618
So we're doing a bridge CIP for 2021 that's currently under development.

421
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:00,940
And then we'll have a five-year plan to issue after that.

422
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:06,145
Generally, this will be put onto that list that'll say, we want to do X amount of money in sidewalk replacement.

423
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,607
This is how much we're going to spend, and this is what our funding source is going to be.

424
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,790
So you'll be able to map it out a little bit more.

425
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:20,214
You can use bonding, you can use free cash, you can use some other cities and towns use capital stabilization funds or budgeted line items for this.

426
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:27,917
Bonding or bond anticipation note or some sort of other borrowing seem to be the most prudent way to move forward on this.

427
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:34,780
Working with Fred, working with Alicia, working with our financial advisors, that was the decision that was made.

428
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,421
All right, and just one other question.

429
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:40,663
I know you answered that

430
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:41,844
this is doable.

431
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:45,829
You think the team thinks this is doable given the COVID-19 impacts?

432
00:31:47,651 --> 00:32:00,005
I guess the only other kind of the side question to that is, are we planning on issuing bonds for any other emergency expenditures related to COVID-19 and would this impact the potential to issue those?

433
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:03,045
No, we wouldn't have to issue bonds for any emergency funding.

434
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,647
So we've been tracking our expenses very, very closely.

435
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,689
A lot of that's gonna be reimbursable through the state and federal governments.

436
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,230
So we have been tracking that.

437
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:20,197
If we do run into deficit, we are able to amortize our debt that is incurred as a response to COVID-19 over the three subsequent fiscal years.

438
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,361
So I'd like to have the outside auditor or Alicia kind of explain what that means a little bit more.

439
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,463
They're way smarter than I am when it comes to that.

440
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:35,385
but we were not anticipating doing any, you know, revenue anticipation notes or any borrowing that's directly related to COVID-19.

441
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:39,326
We think there's gonna be other mechanisms for us to fund that response.

442
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:46,728
So if there was an expense like needing computers for distance learning, that kind of thing, this would not crowd that out is what you're saying?

443
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:47,609
No, absolutely not.

444
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,489
Yeah, all that is being accounted for separately.

445
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,491
We did have to purchase some technology on the city side for the Board of Health, for contact tracing activities,

446
00:32:56,651 --> 00:33:09,923
our RUOK program, masks, PPE, all sorts of stuff we had to purchase, you know, linens for emergency housing, cleaning for emergency housing, cleaning for the public facilities.

447
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:14,787
This is all being accounted for and will largely be reimbursed by the state and federal governments.

448
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,130
Great, thanks, and I'm looking forward to that meeting too.

449
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,951
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

450
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,832
Councilor Scott Pelley.

451
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:31,479
Thank you, and I hate to keep beating a dead horse, Mr. President, but I appreciate Mr. Rodriguez talking about the capital plan.

452
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:43,223
But again, I would love to make an amendment that we ask the city director of DPW to do an analysis to see what it would cost to start a crew.

453
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:49,065
I know I worked with the former commissioner who's now passed, God bless him,

454
00:33:50,626 --> 00:34:01,253
stand Cody who helped me put together a plan where it was three full-time employees, the truck and the equipment, plus what the cement would look like, a hot top would look like.

455
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:19,327
And I tell you, other than the upfront costs of maybe $500,000 the first year to get that going, it really started a program that even if it is part of the capital plan, and we do correct 80% of our sidewalks, which is great, and streets, let's say that's

456
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:27,296
you know, if that works, but the hope is we still need a process moving forward that we're not going to fall back into that.

457
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:28,938
Always maintaining.

458
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:36,987
I think that's one thing we haven't done here in a long time with our infrastructure and our buildings and our facilities, that once we

459
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:47,874
once we correct something, having a maintenance plan in place that we're correcting things before a $1,000 problem turns into a $15,000 problem.

460
00:34:48,174 --> 00:35:00,042
So I think this is what, like I said, I hate to keep beating on it, but I think it's something that I need to see from the director of DPW that can tell me, George, no way, this is why.

461
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:13,633
Because the way I run my home, if I needed to fix something, if I can patch it for $2,000 for 10 years, instead of an upfront cost of $10,000, I'll find a way to do that at $10,000 if the means say.

462
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,142
At least I weigh it.

463
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,663
I don't think we weight this.

464
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:21,864
We keep talking about it.

465
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:29,248
This is now year five and we're saying the same thing in my time here on the council.

466
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,129
So I appreciate everybody's hard work.

467
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,830
I think the questions were well thought out.

468
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:39,853
I thought that the biggest issue I have is that this was a contract from last administration.

469
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,534
It's a two year contract.

470
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:46,877
There was confusion when I talked to administration about how it was

471
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,598
separate and why it was separated.

472
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:54,499
There was some confusion there, but I can understand where we are right now.

473
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,159
So thank you.

474
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,320
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

475
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,501
Any other questions?

476
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,623
Mr. President, Mr. Rodriguez has his hand raised.

477
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,170
Missed that, sorry.

478
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,811
Just an FYI, Neil Osborne has jumped on the call if we want to return back to the census item.

479
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,992
He can provide some insight to that, just FYI.

480
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:17,572
Thank you.

481
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:22,152
We'll finish up with this here.

482
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:26,413
If I can, Mr. President, can I make that amendment to B paper?

483
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:28,394
Sure, we can do that.

484
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,074
Thank you.

485
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:32,674
Okay, any other questions regarding this issue?

486
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:36,275
Councilor Beers.

487
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:44,653
What, as this is a contract that's been signed, what would be the impact if the vote were not to be in favor?

488
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:47,595
I don't know.

489
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:48,715
That's a legal question.

490
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:52,178
We'd have to circle back with the solicitor as to the legal ramifications of that.

491
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:52,938
All right.

492
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:57,041
Counselor Knight.

493
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:01,465
I think it works better with my camera off, Mr. President.

494
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:07,635
I, as one member of the council, am a firm believer in getting the shovels in the ground.

495
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:16,023
I think we do need to get this sidewalk work done and I think we need to live up to our contractual obligation that we made some time ago.

496
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:19,866
So I certainly have no problem supporting the funding for this paper this evening.

497
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:29,895
I've continuously held true to my position that I do believe we need to focus on eliminating the extensive use of private contractors and

498
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:36,777
really turning this work in-house because I feel as though what we're doing is we're really in a race to the bottom.

499
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:42,160
We're not investing in our own personnel and our own institutional knowledge.

500
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,782
We're giving all the control and direction to a private company that we're throwing money at.

501
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:54,748
We've all spoken at length about when a private company gets a public contract, how they feel as though they've hit the lottery.

502
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,738
and the work product sometimes isn't as good as we'd like.

503
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:03,142
And we've also seen that there's not much pride in workmanship.

504
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:18,617
When you have an individual that comes to work every day, 365 days a year, like our DPW workers have been doing, especially during these trying times with COVID-19, I think we understand how valuable a resource our DPW is.

505
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:28,413
So, with that being said, I do think we do need to take a long, hard look at continuing to reinvest these privately spent funds, these bonded funds especially.

506
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:36,337
I mean, ultimately, if you look at it, we're going to spend $500,000, we're going to pay it off over 15 years, and we're going to get 200 sidewalks out of the deal.

507
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:46,242
We could save $500,000, and we could hire employees, and we could have them work for us for the next 30 years, the same amount of time we paid off the bond for just these 230 sidewalks.

508
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:53,433
So I do think it's important that we do look at that issue, but this evening I am prepared to vote in favor of funding the contract.

509
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,194
Thank you, Councilor Light.

510
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:56,995
Any other questions?

511
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:02,960
Okay, so what we'll do is first we will take up the B paper.

512
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,023
Clerk Hernandez, can you please read back the language to the B paper?

513
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:16,351
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli's B paper is to ask the DPW director to see what it would cost to start a crew to do this work.

514
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:19,434
Okay.

515
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,276
On Councilor Scarpelli's B paper, seconded by?

516
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:24,656
Second, Mr. President.

517
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,896
Vice President Caravaglia.

518
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:27,077
Clerk, please call the roll.

519
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,018
Councilor Behrs?

Yes.

521
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,499

Yes.

523
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,740
Councilor Knight?

524
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,540
Yes.

525
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,601
Councilor Marks?

526
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:37,461
Yes.

527
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:38,541
Councilor Morrell?

528
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:39,262
Yes.

529
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:40,582
Councilor Scarpelli?

530
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:41,142
Yes.

531
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:42,323
President Falco?

532
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:42,983
Yes.

533
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,344
I have the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

534
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:47,545
On the main paper,

535
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:54,439
for the request for the bond of $500,000.

536
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,541
Clerk Herterbeast, please call the roll.

537
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:01,263
Mr. President, I just want to clarify, this is for first reading, correct?

538
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:02,323
Yes, correct.

539
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,945
This is for the first reading pertaining to this bond.

540
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,547
Who had the original motion for approval?

541
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,849
The motion of, I'll make the motion.

542
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:16,831
Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

543
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,096
Okay, for first reading.

544
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:22,956
Yes.

545
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:23,217
Yes.

546
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:23,317
Yes.

547
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:23,637
Yes.

548
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:25,519
Yes.

549
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:26,500
Yes.

550
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,680
Yes.

551
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,780
Yes.

552
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:26,980
Yes.

Yes.

556
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:52,749
Mr. President, while we're under suspension, reports from committees?

557
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,109
Yes.

558
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:02,231
While we're under suspension, reports from committees 19-659 and 20-098, which was a subcommittee on zoning that occurred on April 22nd, 2020.

559
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:05,692
That was Vice President Carriello's subcommittee on zoning.

560
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,379
Vice President Caviello, could you give us a brief synopsis of the meeting?

561
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,441
Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:45,293
We had another meeting Wednesday night, which we presented the final draft to the committee and to the administration to have KP law just go over and to make sure that we are compliant with all state regulations pursuant to the marijuana ordinance.

563
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,031
And we did report it favorably out to a committee of the whole meeting.

564
00:41:49,652 --> 00:42:05,284
So hopefully you can schedule that soon and maybe we can get this done before the summer and this will bring some needed funds into our city coffers right now.

565
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:07,926
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

566
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:11,969

Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

585
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:49,368
20-300 and 20-302, April 22nd, 2020.

586
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:58,055
There was a subcommittee on elderly and housing affairs, and that subcommittee is chaired by Councilor Zach Beers.

587
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:01,417
Councilor Beers, can you give us a brief synopsis of that meeting?

588
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:03,439
Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

589
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:08,082
I wanna thank Vice President Caravaglio and Councilor Marks for a great meeting.

590
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:15,985
We were able to hear from residents on what they'd like the city to see the city do regarding housing stability.

591
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:24,728
And we were also able to hear, I think, which was helpful, some of the great work that city officials, members of city boards and commissions and others were doing.

592
00:43:25,288 --> 00:43:27,288
So that was good.

593
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:36,211
We agreed to keep the paper in committee and also request that the acting city solicitor write

594
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:39,619
a draft ordinance for a housing stability task force.

595
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:50,868
And we also are planning to hold another subcommittee meeting to discuss, hopefully, a draft ordinance as well as some of the actions that we could potentially support at the state level.

596
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:53,050
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

597
00:43:54,611 --> 00:43:56,472

598
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:57,894
Second.

00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:00,836

Vice President Caraballo?

603
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:08,940

Yes.

612
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:16,824
President Falco?

613
00:44:17,184 --> 00:44:17,404
Yes.

614
00:44:17,544 --> 00:44:20,106
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

615
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:23,147
Okay.

616
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,571
On the motion of

617
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:33,619
Motion to refer it back to regular business, Mr. President.

618
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:39,702
On the motion of Vice President Caravaglia to report back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

619
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:42,104
Clerk, please call the roll.

620
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:44,705
Councilor Behrs?

621

Yes.

622
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:46,786
Vice President Caravaglia?

623
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:47,366
Yes.

624
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:48,287
Councilor Knight?

625
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:50,528
Yes.

626
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:51,368
I heard a yes there.

627
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:52,129
Yes.

628
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:53,169
Councilor Marks?

629
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:53,970
Yes.

630
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:54,970
Councilor Morrell?

631
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:55,670
Yes.

632
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:56,811

Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

636
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,877
We will now revert back to the regular order of business.

637
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:05,718
20-322.

638
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:11,161
So what I'll do is these are a number of condolence resolutions.

639
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:12,421
So what I'll do is I'll read them.

640
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:16,284
If anybody wants to speak on them by all means, please let me know.

641
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:20,466
We will take a vote and then we'll take a moment of silence at the end.

Vice President Carviello.

644
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,771
Thank you, Mr. President.

645
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:45,473
As we all know, Representative Garberlee, his dad passed away this week from the COVID virus, another victim of the dreaded disease.

646
00:45:45,553 --> 00:45:50,435
And I'd just like to send a note off from the City Council and the City of Medford

647
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:55,819
uh, to Sean and, uh, and his family and, and, uh, in his time of need, Mr. President.

648
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,904
Thank you, vice president Carviello.

649
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:08,551
On the motion of, uh, vice president Carviello seconded by council night, please call the roll.

Yes.

652

664
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:29,025
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

665
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:40,794
2-0-323 offered by Vice President Carabiello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Maurice Del Vendo on the passing of his mother at the age of 102.

666
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:44,772
Thank you again, Mr. President.

667
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,072
Thank you again, Mr. President.

668
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:49,373
Many of us know Maurice from the community.

669
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:55,295
He's one of the liquor board, ABCC, a lot of volunteer in the community, a lot of thing.

670
00:46:55,735 --> 00:47:02,497
His mom also passed away at 102 this week from the dreaded disease again.

671
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:10,460
And again, the numbers just keep growing and growing and hopefully we'll see a downturn at some point, Mr. President.

672
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,321
But again, my condolences

673
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:16,845
to Maurice's family and their time of need also.

674
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:21,367

675
00:47:21,947 --> 00:47:22,207
Second.

676
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:22,607
Second.

677
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:25,929
Councilor Marks, please call the roll.

678
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,570

Vice President Carabiello?

681

Councilor Scarpelli?

689
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:38,094
Yes.

690
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,075
President Falco?

691
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:43,160
Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

692
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:56,909
Offered by Vice President Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council sends its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Christine Spencer, mother of long-term, long-time law department secretary, Janice Spencer.

693
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,290
Vice President Caviello.

694
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:00,632
Again, thank you again, Mr. President.

695
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:06,916
I don't like putting these on, but you know, again, they just keep, they just keep seeing the coming these days.

696
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:10,424
Again, Janice has been with the city for many, many years.

697
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:14,267
And I got to meet her mother a couple of times, nice woman.

698
00:48:14,747 --> 00:48:16,648
Again, she passed away this week also.

699
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:21,932
So my condolences to Janice and her family during their time with me too.

700
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,975
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

701
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:31,359
On the motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

702
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:35,534
Councilor Behrs?

703
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:36,435
Yes.

704
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:37,776
Vice President Caravaglia?

705
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:38,336
Yes.

706
00:48:38,837 --> 00:48:39,337
Councilor Knight?

707
00:48:39,737 --> 00:48:39,978
Yes.

708
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:40,918
Councilor Marks?

709
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:41,739
Yes.

710
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:42,660
Councilor Morrell?

711
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,340
Yes.

712
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,021
Councilor Scarpelli?

713
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:45,622
Yes.

714
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:46,682
President Falco?

715
00:48:47,483 --> 00:48:47,643
Yes.

716
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:49,404
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

717
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:50,425
The motion passes.

718
00:48:52,106 --> 00:48:57,310
If I may, there's two other condolences that are under suspension.

719
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,953
And they're basically for the same person.

720
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:03,274
They're offered by myself and by Councilor Knight.

721
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:10,847
Councilor Scarpelli has asked to join Councilor Knight's resolution as well.

722
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:16,209
We'll take them all at once if that's all right.

723
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,330
It's for the same person, correct?

724
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,510
Yes, you are correct.

725
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:26,233
So 20-325 is offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli.

726
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:32,984
20-326, if you don't mind, from the chair that's offered by me, President Falco.

727
00:49:33,644 --> 00:49:41,227
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of James Maturana on his recent passing.

728
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:44,448
Councilor Knight.

729
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:46,509
Mr. President, thank you very much.

730
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,590
We all know that the Maturanas are a great Methodist family.

731
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:55,112
They've been around for a long time, whether it be with Pop Warner or right now with our very own licensing commission.

732
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:01,282
Jimmy comes from a great group of people and a great family, and he will be sorely missed.

733
00:50:01,823 --> 00:50:12,845
However, Mr. President, I think that I would be remiss in speaking before Counselor Scott Pelley on this, especially whereas he and Jimmy grew up together, when Morris and Park played around kids together.

734
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,406
So with that being said, I defer to Counselor Scott Pelley.

735
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:20,881
Well, thank you, Council Knight, but I think that Jimmy was a little, a few years younger than me.

736
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:35,630
I graduated with Dave and grew up with David and hanging around the Taft Street home and being around the Maturana family, you realize that when Mr. Maturana died, when Guy died, you realize that a true legend left Medford and you could feel it.

737
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:42,855
But what he did is he left a legacy of great, great, great children and, you know,

738
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:47,681
And Jimmy was no different.

739
00:50:47,701 --> 00:50:49,343
Jimmy was just a great young man.

740
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:59,032
If you remember Jimmy, when I started coaching and Jimmy was still playing football in Medford High School, you realize what kind of an aura he brought.

741
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:01,114
People loved to be around Jimmy.

742
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:04,337
And Jimmy was the type of kid that loved everybody.

743
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,261
When the world loses somebody like that, it really hurts.

744
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:11,602
I know that Jimmy's left.

745
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:26,049
And as I talked to David this week, and we've read multiple Facebook posts and videos being sent from all over the world, sending their condolences, you realize what a real impact he's made.

746
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:34,533
And he has two wonderful young boys and a beautiful wife that have sent out some really moving memories.

747
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:39,929
and words and Jimmy's behalf.

748
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:48,396
And Jimmy left a little note for everybody and telling us to keep smiling and keep moving forward.

749
00:51:48,636 --> 00:51:56,022
And you realize how great Medford is when you see the people that are coming back and supporting the Maturana family.

750
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,126
Jimmy will always be missed, but Jimmy will never be forgotten.

751
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:07,934
You know, everybody talks about what kind of a great athlete Jimmy was and what an impact he made in Medford High School sports.

752
00:52:08,414 --> 00:52:11,877
And they were huge, but what he did leave

753
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,983
He's left an empty hole in a lot of people's hearts, and he's left nothing but a positive memory.

754
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:28,027
I know he graduated my sister Lisa, and as soon as she heard the word, it was instant tears, because you knew that we lost a good one.

755
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:36,611
I know that losing someone has been very difficult, especially today in society, but losing Jimmy Maturana is a huge, sad loss.

756
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:49,001
something that I will do moving forward is always keeping Jimmy in light here in Method and Mustang country and keeping his memory alive for his sons to understand his legacy.

757
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:56,107
And we send condolences to the family, the whole Maturana family and his wonderful wife and kids.

758
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,629
So again, thank you.

759
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,071
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

760
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,333
Councilor Ioannidis, I'm sorry, did you want to speak further?

761
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:09,205
I don't think I could do any justice compared to what Councilor Capelli just said, Mr. President.

762
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,206
Thank you, Councilor.

763
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,207
Vice President Carviello.

764
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:13,928
Thank you, Mr. President.

765
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:25,756
Again, I think all my councilors have said it all, you know, the Moderanos are a family that bleeds blue and white in the city of Bedford, right from the father all the way down to all his kids.

766
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,477
They all have a legacy in this community.

767
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:32,620
And like I said, another one, a sad death at this time.

768
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:35,646
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

769
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:36,387
Councilor Marks.

770
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:38,009
Thank you.

771
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:39,170
Thank you, Mr. President.

772
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,835
And I want to thank Councilor Scott Pell and Councilor Knight and yourself for putting this on.

773
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:48,000
As was stated, the Maturana family have been in the city for many, many decades.

774
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:51,524
One better than the next, to be quite honest with you.

775
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,488
And, you know, Jimmy fought a terrible illness

776
00:53:54,992 --> 00:54:01,140
So for a long time, and not many people knew about it cause he kept it to himself and he didn't pity himself.

777
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:07,087
Um, and, uh, you know, he will be as council Scott Pelley mentioned, uh, truly missed.

778
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:10,732
And, uh, I hope, uh, all the siblings, uh, can.

779
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:17,040
uh, take some solace from the fact that, um, he led such a great life with such great family men.

780
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:30,148
And, uh, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, we'll leave a legacy in this community, uh, not just as a sportsman, which they all were, they're all great athletes, but as a family man and as a person.

781
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,290
Um, and that I think goes much further than anything else.

782
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:39,274
Um, so, uh, I'd like to dedicate this meeting, Mr. President, in Jimmy Maturana's honor.

783
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:40,524
Absolutely agree.

784
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:41,685
Thank you.

785
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,265
Thank you.

786
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:42,945
Got so much.

787
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:55,989
Um, and if I may, uh, you know, I, I remember Jimmy is, so I'm a couple of years older than Jimmy, but I remember, uh, my earliest time playing baseball at the car park.

788
00:54:56,729 --> 00:55:01,211
And, uh, Jimmy was a few years younger than me, but he was the best kid on the team.

789
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,752
He was just such an amazing athlete and amazing talent.

790
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:08,939
Um, and I played little league with him at car park and Gillis park.

791
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,340
And he was just a great, I would say great kid.

792
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:17,584
Um, but I remember playing high school with him at football, playing football with him at Medford high years later.

793
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:19,646
And I was a junior at the time.

794
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:22,348
His brother, Dave was the senior.

795
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:23,248
He was a quarterback.

796
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:27,051
Jimmy was a sophomore and he started, he was that good.

797
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,492
And he came in as a soft.

798
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,253
Actually, I think he might've started as a freshman.

799
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,774
Actually, he was that good.

800
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:34,196
I mean, he was always a talented athlete.

801
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,071
great athlete, but more than that, he was just a great person.

802
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:46,753
Someone that was always fun to be with, always great to talk to, and he comes from an absolutely fabulous family.

803
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:51,035
All the moderators have been, they're just fabulous people.

804
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:54,636
They're all great, they've all had a lasting impact on this community.

805
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:58,357
I graduated with Jimmy's wife,

806
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:03,987
Suzanne and she's another fantastic person.

807
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:07,748
And it's really tough to lose Jimmy.

808
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:15,811
He's such a, just an amazing person and our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family tonight.

809
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:20,873
So at this point in time, why don't we all- Mr. President.

810
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:32,512
If we could also have a moment of silence for the people that have passed away and admitted that we don't even know about the many, you know, the many, many seniors that have passed.

811
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:39,079
So we could also hold a moment of silence for the people that we don't even know that have passed away, but that passed away to this disease.

812
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,040
Thank you.

813
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,663
At this time, why don't we all rise for a brief moment of silence.

814
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:06,783
Thank you.

815
00:57:09,747 --> 00:57:17,075
And on the motion of council, and I seconded by Councillor Kelly, Clerk Hurtubise, do you please call the roll?

816
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,600
That was in the final condolence.

817
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:22,622
Yep.

818
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:25,064
Councillor Behrs.

819
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,260
Yes.

820
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:26,920
Yes.

821
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,060
Yes.

822
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,180
Yes.

823
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,340
Yes.

824
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,641
Yes.

825
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:28,261
Yes.

826
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:28,841
Yes.

827
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:46,949
So at this point, we have a member of the public that would like to speak under public participation.

828
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:55,336
On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, that we suspend the rules to move to public participation.

829
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,517
Clerk Urnavis, please call the roll.

830
00:57:56,537 --> 00:58:05,545
I believe it's the next item on the agenda, isn't it, Mr. President?

831
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,666
Do we need to suspend the rules, too?

832
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:11,009
Actually, no, we don't, you're right, because that was the last resolution.

833
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:14,529
So at this point, we'll take up public participation.

834
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:17,550
Is Eric on us?

835
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,010
Mr. Von Berg?

836
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:19,490
Yes.

837
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,410
Okay.

838
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,251
If we could please have your name and address for the record.

839
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:23,991
Okay.

840
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:28,072
It's Eric Von Berg, 369 High Street.

841
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:36,593
Thank you for giving me a chance to speak tonight.

842
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:42,422
I hope all of you councillors are healthy and well at this point.

843
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:48,807
I want to talk about the use of face masks in the city of Medford.

844
00:58:49,147 --> 00:59:00,471
As I watch people walking, running, bicycling past my house on High Street, I see that there's less than 50% of the people are wearing face masks.

845
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:09,815
I feel the suggestion that we wear face masks is not effective enough in slowing the spread of COVID-19.

846
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:18,468
As the numbers keep rising in Medford, Middlesex County, and Massachusetts, we need to take more serious action.

847
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:33,560
We need to institute an order making it mandatory for everyone to wear masks when they are out in public, whether you are in a business or out on the street.

848
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:36,823
This should apply to all above

849
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:41,030
the age of two, walkers, runners, and bicyclists.

850
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,633
Without compliance, we will be extending the shutdown endlessly.

851
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:53,479
We need to mandate the wearing of face masks for the safety of all Medford residents.

852
00:59:55,861 --> 01:00:04,167
And I hope that the city council will consider acting in favor of mandating the wearing of face masks while out in public.

853
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,558
Thank you for the chance to speak.

854
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:09,858
Thank you very much.

855
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
Vice President Caviel.

856
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:16,641
Thank you, Mr. President.

857
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:19,842
Thank you, Mr. Bromberg, for bringing this up.

858
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:24,103
You know, I don't know what to say to people anymore.

859
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:28,545
I mean, you go out there and you see people all over the place without masks and

860
01:00:29,204 --> 01:00:31,206
And you say, do you not watch television?

861
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,808
Do you not listen to the news?

862
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:35,090
I mean, I just don't understand people.

863
01:00:35,471 --> 01:00:37,493
It isn't just Memphis, it's like everywhere.

864
01:00:38,053 --> 01:00:41,116
And I say, I don't know if people just, maybe they just don't get it.

865
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:46,182
I mean, you're not, just because maybe you're a younger person, it doesn't make you immune.

866
01:00:47,403 --> 01:00:53,166
I mean, the city has it, where everybody has to go in stores, wear it.

867
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:58,870
And I've been in stores and I see people come walking in, no mask.

868
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:07,135
Again, I don't know what to say, people just don't understand, they don't get it.

869
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:15,000
I mean, we're trying to get a handle on this and every little thing that we do helps it.

870
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:16,498
But, you know, you're right, 100%.

871
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:20,362
I mean, I don't know if we can force people to wear them.

872
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,566
I know some of them have just done it, and some other cities have done it.

873
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:29,572
And even over there, I've driven through some of them, and I see people walking around with no masks on.

874
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:36,360
Again, you just can't understand people, you know.

875
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:39,441
They have all the information.

876
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:41,744
No matter where you go, you're seeing it.

877
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:42,585
It's on the news.

878
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:43,606
It's everywhere.

879
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:48,192
I wish I had an answer for you to the way people think.

880
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:55,874
Okay.

881
01:01:56,594 --> 01:02:03,236
I think that a lot of people, you know, think their freedom is being impinged upon by this.

882
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:07,737
But I think, you know, freedom comes with responsibility.

883
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:15,378
And I think that we really need to look to find a way to get this to happen.

884
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:24,120
Because this is a danger to all of us and even more heavily to our elder citizens.

885
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:33,088
So I think that we need to dig into this and try and find a way that we can do something about this.

886
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:35,929
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

887
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,451
Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:47,295
I mean, I think one thing that's clear is that if one person's wearing a mask and one person isn't, the effectiveness goes down significantly.

889
01:02:47,355 --> 01:02:53,518
But if both people in an interaction or in a space are wearing a mask, it significantly helps to reduce the transmission rate.

890
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,968
I'm really glad that we're doing this in the businesses.

891
01:02:56,488 --> 01:03:08,614
But I agree with Eric, I think, you know, setting this as you know, we're never going to get everyone I think Councilor Garviela is right about that, you know, but if we can say as a city, this is what we should do.

892
01:03:09,194 --> 01:03:13,276
Set the example be the role model and say, you really need to be wearing a mask out.

893
01:03:13,816 --> 01:03:14,516
I think we should do that.

894
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:17,158
Thank you Councilor Peers.

895
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:17,818
Councilor Morrell.

896
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:19,423
Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:03:19,523 --> 01:03:22,266
I want to thank Mr. Rundberg for bringing this up.

898
01:03:22,286 --> 01:03:25,028
I have heard from other constituents having the same concerns.

899
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:30,033
I think there's a number of factors, obviously, to Vice President Carviello's point.

900
01:03:30,213 --> 01:03:32,075
Some people just maybe don't care.

901
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,835
They're not thinking.

902
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,956
They don't think they're in danger.

903
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:35,958
But, you know, there's access to masks.

904
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:38,280
Not everyone has the financial means, the access.

905
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,103
I know anything can be a mask, but not everyone has that.

906
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:44,689
privilege time to even think about that when they're running out the door.

907
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:50,973
And I think it's also just a challenge for our local businesses that have had to pivot so much.

908
01:03:51,113 --> 01:04:01,859
And I see the signs in West Bedford Square requiring people to wear masks, but I think there's just a challenge there as far as now they're pivoting their business to adjust to these closures.

909
01:04:01,919 --> 01:04:08,403
And also now they have to act as a sort of police to kick people out of their store, ask them to do certain things.

910
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:29,651
perhaps it is going that full extent to have this further requirement that if we go this level, perhaps we'll catch at least a little bit more people trying to put these, getting these masks on for the protection and so that we can continue to flatten the curve and, you know, ideally reopen and get some sense of normalcy back in the future.

911
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:31,151
Thank you.

912
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:33,192
Councilor Morrell, thank you very much.

913
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,913
Councilor Scarpelli.

914
01:04:34,953 --> 01:04:35,754
Thank you, Mr. President.

915
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,814
Um, I was in meetings all day today.

916
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:51,643
I work in Somerville and, um, you know, I would hope that, you know, as I talked to our administration, I know we had put in place, uh, some order of, um, masks, but can you hear me?

917
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:52,444
Yes.

918
01:04:53,482 --> 01:05:02,248
for some order of mass, but where, um, and we, unfortunately we can't make any amendments or resolutions off this because it has to be posted.

919
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:08,672
But I think it might be something that we look into and, uh, moving this and more of a, um, um,

920
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:17,242
strategic way in asking the city administration to assist some of our residents that can't afford to find the masks, that we can help.

921
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:25,229
I know that in Somerville, we're distributing over 100,000 masks first to our senior citizen population.

922
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:34,397
So I think that, unfortunately, the way of the world, being in the recreation world, being in the world of grouping and stuff,

923
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:43,892
We've talked about today, the state's going to be mandating that we're going to have employees and kids coming to our camps and clinics that it looks like they'll have to be wearing masks.

924
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:47,115
And unfortunately, I think that's just the way of the world.

925
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:57,962
So the quicker we as a community understand how serious this is in the sense that it's needed to be safe for yourself and others, I think that

926
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:09,491
we need to make a move as a council, hopefully by next week and working with the city administration and our health department that we put some mandates in place.

927
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:12,713
So I thank Mr. Von Berg again for bringing this forward.

928
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:24,561
And I know that I've had some constituents, you know, as we're talking, I was getting texts by one constituent who we love and know, but he's, you know, we're nervous.

929
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:27,743
And I think that again,

930
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:38,768
One thing that as we're going in my field, a lot of it is education and communication so we can go forward with making sure as we live our new life.

931
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:48,781
coming forward when we get into phase two and phase three, we all have to understand there are going to be mandated changes that people aren't going to like.

932
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:56,067
And whether their freedom has anything to do with it, we have to have mandates in place and rules in place that people have to do it.

933
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,750
And again, with the sensitivity that Councilor Morrell spoke of,

934
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:13,194
uh having the means to assist those constituents that really don't have a means to get to have them get a mask and um you know as we talked to some of our low-income constituents and

935
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:15,885
What one resident told us is easy.

936
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:23,427
She actually downloaded a Facebook post to our recreation site and how to make a mask with her T-shirt into elastic.

937
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:25,008
So there is effort.

938
01:07:25,448 --> 01:07:39,311
I think there is a way to really accomplish this, but I think this is something that sounds simple, but this has to be a monumental task by all the stakeholders here to start changing our thought process.

939
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:40,711
So thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:42,592
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

941
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:43,532
Vice President Carvillo?

942
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:46,438
Thank you, Mr. President.

943
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:53,964
I've noticed that the biggest violators of this seem to be the food service delivery drivers.

944
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:56,686
I see them.

945
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:01,369
They're all walking into stores and picking up their orders with no mask and walking right out.

946
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:08,655
And that's really where I've seen the biggest amount of violations when I'm in these places.

947
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:09,775
And these guys just walk in.

948
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:13,018
They think because they're only in there for a second that they're OK.

949
01:08:14,077 --> 01:08:19,059
And again, I would think that was to be something that the stores need to clamp down.

950
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:22,581
It's all these guys, you're not picking your order up until you get a mask on.

951
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:37,073
One information, just so I don't forget, Mr. President, I just did get a text that thanks to the mayor, they are providing our seniors with masks.

952
01:08:37,153 --> 01:08:40,855
So they've already taken steps in that direction.

953
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:43,296
So kudos to the mayor and the city administration.

954
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:45,117
This is the direction we have to go to.

955
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:45,557
So thanks.

956
01:08:45,637 --> 01:08:47,098
Apologize, Councilor Baez.

957
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:49,920
No worries, no worries.

958
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:55,282
Actually, if I may really quick, since we have our chief of staff on the line, is there any,

959
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,367
Thought of mandating this across the board?

960
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:12,638
Mr. President, unmute him.

961
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:13,179
I did.

962
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:17,502
He's still muted.

963
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:19,864
He wasn't a second ago.

964
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:23,927
It says mute.

965
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,070
It says he's unmuted on my side.

966
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:30,866
Yeah, I mean out.

967
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:31,587
Yeah.

968
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:33,369
Okay.

969
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:45,623
So, we spent an enormous amount of time spot talking on this issue today with the board of the director of public health internally within the mayor's office about what the next step should be because we all talk among cities and towns.

970
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,004
among what each other are doing.

971
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:59,811
The decision was, we were one of the first, the mayor was one of the first mayors around to sign an order that required face coverings within essential businesses and for essential workers that are there.

972
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:01,512
That's been in place for over two weeks.

973
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:05,255
And we do encourage folks to follow the CDC guidelines.

974
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:10,500
that say if you cannot engage with social distancing that you should have a face covering on.

975
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:17,983
But we're not quite at the point yet where the mayor wants to step into the mandated 100% universal wear policy.

976
01:10:18,903 --> 01:10:19,924
Councilor Scarpelli is right.

977
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,685
We do have an order of masks that are on route.

978
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,166
We're waiting to receive them.

979
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:36,435
probably tomorrow where we did a regional buy with some other cities and towns in order to supply those, and we're working on a system in order to get those to vulnerable populations as soon as we can.

980
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:39,197
Although I do like the clerk's mask.

981
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:46,282
He's taking the wear policy very seriously, so kudos to the clerk.

982
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:48,123
Thank you, Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

983
01:10:48,864 --> 01:10:49,464
Councilor Beers?

984
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:53,156
I'm good, thanks.

985
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:54,697
Okay, Councilor Marra.

986
01:10:55,397 --> 01:10:56,317
Thank you, Mr. President.

987
01:10:56,417 --> 01:11:01,359
If Chief of Staff Rodriguez could speak to as far as enforcement of the current orders.

988
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,120
That's the hardest part.

989
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:10,081
So universally, and that's one of the real sticking points when it comes to a mandatory wear policy is enforcement.

990
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:13,703
And generally these orders are all enforced by agents of the Board of Health.

991
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:17,724
So the Board of Health has taken the extraordinary step of like spanning their agents

992
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:23,426
making code enforcement agent, building inspectors, all agents of the Board of Health to be able to increase.

993
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,727
We did that for different reasons.

994
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,148
We're involving more safety plans and construction sites.

995
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:32,910
But expanding that, the enforcement of these orders is extraordinarily difficult.

996
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,693
And you have to, we get 100 calls and emails a day about people not wearing masks in places.

997
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:39,933
You have to see them do it.

998
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:42,755
You have to actually engage with them as it's happening.

999
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:45,576
So it's very, the enforcement is the most challenging part.

1000
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:49,819
And we don't want to necessarily put our orders for the sake of putting out orders.

1001
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:58,605
We'd rather put out guidance, focus on education, tell folks that this is in their best interest instead of mandating orders that we can't necessarily enforce.

1002
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:04,149
So our focus, and just like Councilor Scarpelli said, a huge focus on education.

1003
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:10,334
You will see this as every part of our messaging going forward, is make sure you have a face covering when you go into a central business.

1004
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:20,362
and make sure that you're following CDC guidelines, that if you cannot engage in responsible social distancing, stay more than six feet apart, you should have a face covering on.

1005
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:22,324
And that doesn't necessarily have to be a mask.

1006
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,446
Save the medical grade masks for the first responders.

1007
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:27,588
Thank you.

1008
01:12:27,948 --> 01:12:28,629
Thank you, Council Member.

1009
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:29,510
Council Member Marks.

1010
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:31,528
Thank you, Mr. President.

1011
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:39,631
I want to thank Mr. Varnberg for bringing this issue up, because I know we've all been contacted by Meffitt residents that are equally as concerned.

1012
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:46,293
I need to say over the last three or four weeks, this issue has evolved many times.

1013
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:52,235
And I think originally, if we all remember, the issue was don't wear mask.

1014
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,875
Remember when it first came out, they said mask won't help you.

1015
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:59,617
And don't wear mask and leave the mask for the health care professionals.

1016
01:13:00,163 --> 01:13:09,813
the first responders, and then it evolved into, as more information came in, that it is helpful to have a mask and to reduce the risks like Councilor Beers mentioned.

1017
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:21,344
I think there's a lot of misinformation out there that people believe if they, as long as they stay a social distance of six feet, in particular outside, there's no need for a mask.

1018
01:13:21,824 --> 01:13:24,247
And I think that's where a lot of the misinformation lies.

1019
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:32,354
that now that has also evolved and your footprint, so called footprint is left behind.

1020
01:13:33,095 --> 01:13:34,476
And that's critical.

1021
01:13:34,837 --> 01:13:38,540
I just want to say to that mask is one aspect of PPE.

1022
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:40,062
There's also gloves.

1023
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:47,627
The disease is transmitted through droplets and so forth, but it's also transmitted through touch.

1024
01:13:48,467 --> 01:14:00,210
And you could be somewhere with a mask on, touch a surface, and then put that fingers to your eyes, to your nose, to your mouth after the fact.

1025
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,031
and catch to the disease.

1026
01:14:02,451 --> 01:14:06,793
So if you don't protect your hands as well as your face, you're equally as vulnerable.

1027
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:09,594
So whatever we do, I think we have to look at all aspects.

1028
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:17,398
And in my opinion, I think it should be the wearing of gloves as well, the rubber gloves when you're out in public for now.

1029
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:21,900
So I think education, as the chief of staff mentioned,

1030
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,420
is extremely important.

1031
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:30,783
The fact that Councilor Morrell and Councilor Caviello mentioned that not everyone, I had to make homemade face masks.

1032
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:32,804
And it took quite some time to do it.

1033
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:35,825
Everyone says, oh, look online, you make a quick, easy one.

1034
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,106
They're not quick, easy, at least for me.

1035
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:39,907
And I consider myself pretty handy.

1036
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:41,307
They're not quick and easy.

1037
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:45,108
And they don't fit right, they push your nose in, you can't breathe.

1038
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:48,830
So there's a lot more than just making a quick homemade mask.

1039
01:14:49,330 --> 01:15:00,179
And I think if we can get these masks out to the general public, like was mentioned in Somerville and so forth, I think that'll go a long way for people that will have them near their front door, like I do.

1040
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:03,882
Every time I go out, boom, it goes on automatically because it's right there.

1041
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:07,525
But if I didn't have one in the house, who knows?

1042
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:13,190
So I think the first thing for prevention is to make sure that these are out there.

1043
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:17,999
And I don't know what we can do to get these masks and rubber gloves out there.

1044
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,220
But I think that should be our first thing.

1045
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,661
I don't like the concept of penalizing people, to be quite frank.

1046
01:15:25,261 --> 01:15:29,422
I know some communities of 200, 300 old fines for not wearing a mask.

1047
01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:32,303
I don't like that concept.

1048
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:38,572
I think you have to get people to comply in a way that you reason with them and say, hey, you know what?

1049
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,314
This is a concern for safety, concern for health.

1050
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:54,219
Now we're hearing over in England and so forth that they're saying that kids are coming down with some sort of disease from the COVID that they didn't

1051
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:55,944
think they were susceptible to.

1052
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,366
This is brand new and they're starting to get cases over there.

1053
01:16:00,266 --> 01:16:03,768
You hear animals now, dogs, cats, you know.

1054
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:09,097
So this is something that we really have to take the initiative.

1055
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:16,440
I personally think it should be done through an executive order, because I think that's the way it should be initiated from the governor on down.

1056
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:21,903
If the governor decides not to do it, then it's up to local cities and towns to take the responsibility.

1057
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:32,888
So I'd like to see the mayor take, I know she's taken a lot of leadership on this, but I think the next logical step is to mandate that if you're out, that you should wear a mask.

1058
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:38,117
And then if you're talking about enforcement, do we have the capability of enforcing it?

1059
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:41,964
Probably not, but I think you'll see people comply.

1060
01:16:42,628 --> 01:16:48,591
if, you know, they're reasoned with and provided the mask.

1061
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,992
So that's my two cents, Mr. President.

1062
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:52,973
Councilman Knox, thank you very much.

1063
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:56,215
And Mr. Bob Byrd, thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

1064
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:57,875
A very important issue.

1065
01:16:58,496 --> 01:17:06,940
I know myself, I carry a mask wherever I go, you know, and I would recommend the same for everyone and anyone that's out there.

1066
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:12,189
always have a mask nearby, extremely valuable to have to prevent the spread.

1067
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:14,270
Councilor Scott probably would like to speak.

1068
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:15,571
Just real quick.

1069
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,732
I know that Councilor Mox brought it up with the gloves.

1070
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:31,438
I think that, I also want to, let's educate the public in understanding that those people that are wearing the gloves and then they discard it all over the streets, have a little compassion for the people that are cleaning those, picking those gloves up because

1071
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:45,514
You're putting their lives in danger and catching the virus too if you can't do something simple as take the gloves off like I do and as you leave, put them into a dispenser or take them home and throw them in the garbage.

1072
01:17:45,554 --> 01:17:48,738
But we're seeing too many left all over the streets.

1073
01:17:51,327 --> 01:18:00,337
If you don't care about what it looks like in your community, at least have a little compassion and understanding that the people that are picking those up, you might be putting them in harm's way.

1074
01:18:00,918 --> 01:18:02,159
And that's how you have to look at things.

1075
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,021
So I just wanted to add to that.

1076
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:06,444
That's my two cents, Mr. President.

1077
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:06,805
Thank you.

1078
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:08,767
Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

1079
01:18:09,528 --> 01:18:10,749
Let's see, Matt Hughes.

1080
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:16,228
Thank you, Mr. President.

1081
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:21,533
I wanted to speak on a few points.

1082
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:30,000
In response to Councilor Mark's proposal that gloves should potentially be required, I wanted to oppose that.

1083
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,181
Gloves are substantially like

1084
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:42,769
To tie this back to something that Councilor Morrell said earlier in the evening, the accessibility of gloves is substantially less than facial coverings.

1085
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:48,132
So it would be much, much harder to be able to provide folks gloves.

1086
01:18:49,073 --> 01:18:53,816
Additionally, gloves are really helpful for preventing cross-contamination of different

1087
01:18:56,305 --> 01:19:10,094
different things, but hand-washing may be a better way, and educating the public about the importance of hand-washing may be a more effective means of preventing the concern that you bring up around surfaces.

1088
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:17,219
I also wanted to address Councillor Karygiela.

1089
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,261
I sympathize with your having seen

1090
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:29,027
uh folks who are who are delivering food and having to experience that really counterintuitive like Really?

1091
01:19:29,107 --> 01:19:49,643
You're not gonna protect uh protect other the people who you're delivering food for uh by keeping yourself from uh by wearing a mask yourself um I also wanted to to bring up that i've i've also seen uh members of the medford police department uh out directing traffic and not wearing masks and that I had a similar reaction of saying like

1092
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:50,783
really?

1093
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,904
Is this actually promoting public safety?

1094
01:19:53,884 --> 01:20:05,046
So the third point that I wanted to make is that if we wanted to act on this like more quickly or more concisely, like focusing... What information, Mr. President?

1095
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:19,430
I appreciate Mr. Hughes bringing that up, but I think the police are a little bit different when you're talking about if they're in a traffic situation where they need to direct people in a safety situation, that they have to know who they're directing.

1096
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:21,551
the conversation, too.

1097
01:20:21,591 --> 01:20:25,234
I think it's important that we understand that, too, as a community.

1098
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:25,715
So thank you.

1099
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:29,358
Matt Hughes, please continue.

1100
01:20:30,178 --> 01:20:42,769
Yeah, I just wanted to propose that requiring the use of masks among public safety personnel may be a quicker and easier thing than doing a full mandate.

1101
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:44,390
Thank you.

1102
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:45,551
Thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:20:45,972 --> 01:20:46,232
Thank you.

1104
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:52,725
Okay, any further comments on public participation?

1105
01:20:52,745 --> 01:20:54,707
Okay.

1106
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,530
Mr. President, I see John Costas.

1107
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,491
Yeah, I'm making my way with it now.

1108
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:03,653
John Costas.

1109
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:08,336
Yeah.

1110
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:12,612
Hello, can you hear me?

1111
01:21:13,392 --> 01:21:14,093
Yes, we can.

1112
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:15,773
Hey, good evening.

1113
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:17,814
Hey, just a quick note about the gloves.

1114
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:19,814
I'm not opposed to them.

1115
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:25,516
But I think if you want to have gloves on anybody, you need to do the proper training.

1116
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:28,217
Because I've been watching people with gloves.

1117
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:30,657
And they're kind of useless.

1118
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:34,898
I was in a restaurant, and I'm not going to tell you which restaurant I was in.

1119
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:40,700
But they were handing money and product and dealing with customers with the same set of gloves.

1120
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:46,762
I see people with gloves outside and they just touch everything.

1121
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:51,766
They touch their car and they take their gloves off and they touch the car again.

1122
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:56,949
So the transfer or whatever is kind of like, what is the point of gloves?

1123
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:05,296
Unless you're going to touch something, take them off, throw them away, put on a fresh pair of gloves, touch something and get rid of them.

1124
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:07,538
I agree with somebody that said,

1125
01:22:08,432 --> 01:22:16,379
Why don't, what I like to do is when I'm handling food and stuff is I just have the clean, the disinfectant with me.

1126
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:22,624
And every time I want to touch something, I clean my hands first, touch it, then clean my hands again.

1127
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:25,486
I mean, it beats some gloves away.

1128
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:33,172
So if you're going to push gloves onto people, I think you need to push the education, the proper use of gloves.

1129
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:34,053
Thank you.

1130
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:34,794
Thank you.

1131
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:36,115
Okay.

1132
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,252
Well, Mr. Von Berg, thank you for bringing that forward tonight.

1133
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:39,952
We appreciate it.

1134
01:22:43,995 --> 01:22:45,156
Okay.

1135
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:51,241
Next item on the agenda is the minutes, I'm sorry, the records.

1136
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,872
Of course, I misplaced that page of the agenda once again.

1137
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:14,748
The records of the meeting of April 21st, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1138
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:18,050
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1139
01:23:21,252 --> 01:23:22,512
In order to move for approval.

1140
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:24,474
Second.

1141
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:26,275
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1142
01:23:27,015 --> 01:23:30,177
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll for the approval of the records.

1143
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:33,139
Councilor Behrs?

1144
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:33,999
Yes.

1145
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:35,720
Vice President Caravaglia?

1146
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,360
Yes.

1147
01:23:36,821 --> 01:23:37,301
Councilor Knight?

1148
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:39,273
Yes.

1149
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:40,494
Councilor Marks?

1150
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:41,555
Yes.

1151
01:23:41,915 --> 01:23:42,556
Councilor Morrell?

1152
01:23:43,056 --> 01:23:43,317
Yes.

1153
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:44,498
Councilor Scarpelli?

1154
01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:45,138
Yes.

1155
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:46,419
President Falco?

1156
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,282
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1157
01:23:49,322 --> 01:23:51,584
The motion passes and the records are approved.

1158
01:23:53,725 --> 01:23:59,590
Before we adjourn, I'm just gonna read a quick announcement that came in just as we started the meeting from the DCR.

1159
01:24:01,992 --> 01:24:04,915
It's a DCR traffic advisory for Fellsway West.

1160
01:24:06,187 --> 01:24:24,477
Starting on Monday, May 4th, 2020 and continuing through June 11th, 2020, excluding weekends, the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the DCR, will implement lane closures and parking restrictions along Fellsway West in the City of Medford from Salem Street to St.

1161
01:24:24,557 --> 01:24:31,301
Francis Street outbound in I-93 and Salem Street inbound to accommodate paving operations

1162
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:35,444
During this time, work will fluctuate between day and evening operations.

1163
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:43,089
Additionally, a police detail will be on site, traffic patterns will be marked, and signage regarding parking restrictions will be posted.

1164
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:51,054
This will be from Monday, May 4th, 2020 through Thursday, June 11th, excluding weekends.

1165
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:52,455
Bellsway West.

1166
01:24:53,478 --> 01:24:56,140
the city of Medford from Salem Street to St.

1167
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:02,545
Francis Street that's going outbound and inbound it's going to be I-93 to Salem Street inbound.

1168
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:06,168
So just to let everyone know that came in just as we started the meeting tonight.

1169
01:25:09,391 --> 01:25:19,799
Let's see, so as we adjourn this meeting tonight, we're going to adjourn the meeting in the memory of Jimmy Maturano who passed away recently and those that have

1170
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:23,116
passed away to the COVID-19 virus.

1171
01:25:23,356 --> 01:25:23,997
Mr. President?

1172
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:25,538
Councilor Marks.

1173
01:25:26,138 --> 01:25:33,745
Mr. President, we do have Neil Osborne that's joining us and maybe he can give us just a brief overview of the census.

1174
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:38,008
Yeah, Neil, if I may.

1175
01:25:38,068 --> 01:25:38,729
Neil, are you there?

1176
01:25:40,075 --> 01:25:50,997
I mentioned earlier in the meeting when this came up that we had tried to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss it, and then all of a sudden COVID-19 happened.

1177
01:25:51,397 --> 01:26:00,199
So I'll probably still schedule a committee of the whole just because I'm sure there'll probably be plenty of questions once you get going.

1178
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:03,280
Amy, if you want to make a quick comment, that's fine.

1179
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:09,859
I think the Committee of the Whole will probably be better for a more robust discussion, I guess.

1180
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:10,939
Perfect.

1181
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:22,963
I guess the quick comment I will make is it's helpful for you as city councilors to mention to residents the importance of getting it done early, because if people fill it out early, no one comes to knock on their door.

1182
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:28,165
But please invite me back, Committee of the Whole, when we have a chance to answer questions and let you know how we're doing.

1183
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:29,757
We'll do it sooner than later.

1184
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:34,800
I'll send you an email tonight and we'll coordinate a time and we'll move forward on this as soon as possible.

1185
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,480
Perfect.

1186
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:36,320
Great.

1187
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,921
Okay, thank you.

1188
01:26:41,844 --> 01:26:45,806
Clerk Hertoghese, if we could please take the vote to adjourn the meeting.

1189
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:50,089
Yes, Mr. President, we need a motion and a second to adjourn.

1190
01:26:50,349 --> 01:26:50,949
Yes, we do.

1191
01:26:51,209 --> 01:26:55,452
On the vote, Vice President Capiello, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1192
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:57,593
Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll.

1193
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:00,068
This is to adjourn.

1194
01:27:00,669 --> 01:27:01,309
Council bears.

1195
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,310
Yes.

1196
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:03,770
Vice President care of yellow.

1197
01:27:04,151 --> 01:27:05,191
Yes, that's a night.

1198
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:09,073
That's a night.

1199
01:27:10,114 --> 01:27:11,074
I think he's dropped off.

1200
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,215
Okay, Council marks.

1201
01:27:13,716 --> 01:27:13,976
Yes.

1202
01:27:14,676 --> 01:27:15,297
Council Morrell.

1203
01:27:15,717 --> 01:27:15,977
Yes.

1204
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:17,638
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1205
01:27:18,538 --> 01:27:19,939
Mr. Council.

1206
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:24,216
Adam did text me, he lost his service, so.

1207
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:24,857
Okay.

1208
01:27:24,897 --> 01:27:27,120
Apologizes, yes.

1209
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,042
Okay, President Falco.

1210
01:27:29,523 --> 01:27:34,168
Yes, that's six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, meeting adjourned.

1211
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,310
Thank you very much, everyone.

1212
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,311
Have a good night, stay safe.

1213
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:36,972
Stay safe, everyone.

1214
01:27:37,312 --> 01:27:37,713
Thank you.

1215
01:27:37,873 --> 01:27:38,214
Thank you.

1216
01:27:39,035 --> 01:27:39,295
