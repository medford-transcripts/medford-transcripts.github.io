    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=55.603s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 30A, Section 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=64.317s">in</a>  the governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=71.382s">This</a>  meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=77.507s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and your parties with the right annual requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=93.518s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=101.8s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=113.464s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post this on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=120.947s">website</a>  and audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=134.269s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=135.89s">20-320</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=140.091s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city administration give us an update on the policy dealing with public parking during this trying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=146.832s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=148.819s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=150.0s">I</a>  appreciate everybody for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=152.161s">I</a>  know I've talked to the chief of staff about this a few weeks ago, but again, I've been getting phone calls about Republic Parking and whether they're, you know, the question, the misconception that they're not in the business district or they are in the business district, that they're, are they essential? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=173.29s">Are</a>  they non-essential? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=176.191s">I'll</a>  give you a few examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=178.259s">It's</a>  seeing that what I'm hearing is that they're going into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=182.985s">and</a>  really bearing down on neighborhood parking where some parking issues, as I talked to some constituents, have never been an issue for years, and they're coming down and ticketing certain areas, and it doesn't limit to one area of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=202.599s">I</a>  hear in West Medford, I hear in South Medford, I hear in North Medford that, so really, if we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=209.674s">is</a>  really, if we can get Mr. Rodriguez, if you can, look into really defining and putting something out there so our constituents understand what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=224.972s">Because</a>  I think there is a misconception that it's not essential and it shouldn't be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=229.718s">They</a>  are essential, but they're not doing the business district, but they are obligated to go into the communities, into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=240.381s">I</a>  think that's what I've been hearing, and if we can get that concern taken care of or addressed, that'd be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=247.864s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=250.504s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=251.325s">Any</a>  of the councillors like to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=253.005s">Okay,</a>  Claude Hernandez, do you have any emails?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=262.066s">Mr.</a>  President, I do not have any emails on this topic.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=288.235s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=292.163s">20-321</a>  offered by Consuelo Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=294.545s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city administration give us an update dealing with the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=298.889s">Consuelo</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=300.527s">Thank</a>  you again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=302.788s">With</a>  what's going on in our time today and the fear of budget decreases and the downfalls we're looking to have possibly, adding the lack of information gathered by the census and losing any sort of federal money because we haven't done our due diligence as a leadership and a community, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=330.958s">I</a>  know that if we can, I want to make amendment, if we can reach out to state delegates to see if there is, I know there was talk about an extension, when they were going to, actually the kickoff I believe was April 1st, and now it's, I haven't heard, we haven't heard much about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=353.04s">is</a>  could the city administration, could we look at non-essential employees that are getting paid, that aren't working at City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=365.088s">Is</a>  there a way we can put a team together that can reach out right now via phone or other avenues to get people interested, get them involved in returning their census forms? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=377.577s">I</a>  think that while there is a lull in one facet of government, I think that maybe we can look at a way to take advantage of our educated and capable employees within City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=390.896s">to</a>  really mount an attack and get the information out that's needed to get the information back that we're going to need for our schools and our police stations and fire stations and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=402.005s">It's</a>  going to be massively important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=404.366s">And</a>  I know that we did talk about it, but I just wanted to gather some information with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=412.132s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=413.185s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=414.586s">And</a>  if I may really quick, Neil Osborne, who is basically the point person, I believe, for the city with regard to the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=423.872s">We</a>  were going back and forth before coronavirus, trying to set up a committee, the whole meeting, just to give everyone an update as to what the plans were with regard to what the city was gonna do and how things were going to operate with regard to the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=437.481s">And</a>  once coronavirus happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=442.567s">everything</a>  kind of went off track. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=443.788s">So</a>  I'm going to try to schedule a committee the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=446.71s">I'm</a>  not sure if Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez had mentioned previously that Neil might be on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=452.994s">Do</a>  we know if Neil's on the call?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=454.775s">I</a>  just checked with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=455.476s">He's</a>  not on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=457.877s">And</a>  I just checked with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=459.238s">I</a>  haven't heard back.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=460.659s">OK,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=461.76s">It</a>  doesn't sound like he's on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=463.861s">But</a>  I will schedule a committee the whole meeting with Neil to set up a Zoom call so we can actually specifically talk about the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=470.266s">But</a>  Councilor Scott, it looks like you</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=472.587s">I</a>  think if we can, I appreciate that, that'd be a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=475.388s">I</a>  think if we can invite the, I know each community has a representative from the Census Bureau. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=482.031s">If</a>  we can invite them also, I don't know if Mr. Rodriguez could pass that along to Neil Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=488.514s">I</a>  know that each, like I said, each community has someone that works for the Census Bureau as a <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=496.478s">contact</a>  person, if we can find out who that is and invite them to that committee, the whole meeting, to see what they're doing at the federal level too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=504.144s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=505.765s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=506.166s">Are</a>  there any questions regarding this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=510.009s">Any</a>  comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=513.712s">Any</a>  comments in general? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=515.073s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=518.977s">Chief</a>  of Staff Dave Rodriguez, did you have a comment you wanted to make?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=521.419s">Yeah,</a>  just the one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=522.42s">I</a>  do know that Neil has been continuing his work with the Complete Count Committee and the community liaison, so she was in the office right before all this jumped off, so she has been working with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=531.947s">I</a>  did check on our self-community response rates before the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=536.39s">And</a>  Medford has a self-response rate of 58.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=540.291s">Massachusetts</a>  overall has a 55.8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=541.911s">So</a>  we're a little bit above the state average. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=545.752s">A</a>  little bit behind Somerville, they're at 58.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=548.912s">Malden,</a>  we're ahead of Malden and Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=551.133s">Malden's</a>  at 50.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=552.833s">Everett</a>  is at 42.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=554.854s">And</a>  we're lagging behind Winchester and Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=558.654s">Arlington's</a>  at 69% and Winchester is at 71.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=562.613s">It's</a>  kind of all over the place, but we are above the state average. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=565.414s">And</a>  I do know Neil has been working hard to try to re-understand the importance, like Councilor Scarpelli said, about this is how everything happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=574.218s">This</a>  is how all the formulas get written. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=575.639s">This</a>  is how all the numbers get derived. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=577.08s">So</a>  we understand the importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=578.38s">We</a>  want to drive up these numbers to get the most accurate, complete count we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=582.322s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=582.642s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=583.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=584.023s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=585.384s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=586.284s">I</a>  was just curious how often we could get updates on that percentage response rate.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=590.898s">They're</a>  available online all the time, so they're done in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=593.84s">I</a>  can email the link to the councilors, and you can see how we're measuring up to everybody else.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=597.803s">If</a>  you could, I'd greatly appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=601.145s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=602.866s">Yeah,</a>  and I think one other thing that's on that website is that our final self-response rate in 2010 was 68%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=610.672s">So</a>  obviously, we want to get above that, given that <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=614.83s">all</a>  the people who don't do the self-response, someone comes to their door, and that's gonna be a whole other set of circumstances given what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=622.435s">So</a>  a really big push is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=624.596s">And</a>  I think also Chief of Staff Rodriguez, the communities you outlined and the difference in the response rates are pretty clear why that's happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=632.341s">The</a>  richer neighborhoods and towns have a higher response rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=635.943s">So</a>  I think a really important effort on reaching out to folks who we may not always reach is gonna be important.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=644.116s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=645.577s">Any</a>  other questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=649.279s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by- Second, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=653.862s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=957.349s">The</a>  answer, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=959.13s">While</a>  the pavement condition index, the PCI project is set to begin this summer, the mayor has asked the DPW commissioner and city engineer for a list based on their experience of sidewalks that are in the most need <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=972.87s">of</a>  replacement, the sidewalks to be replaced and selected by using the following criteria in no particular order. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=981.992s">One,</a>  age of the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=984.092s">Two,</a>  condition of the surrounding sidewalks and driveway aprons. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=987.593s">Three,</a>  geography, an attempt is made to spread it out equitably throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=998.677s">Part</a>  B to the question, if there is a list, what percentage of the work on this list is being done with this $500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1006.963s">The</a>  answer, it depends on the on the ground conditions for each sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1011.347s">The</a>  hope is to stretch the work as far as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1014.389s">Last</a>  year, the city was able to replace 232 sidewalks of varying lengths under the current contract in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1022.976s">Part</a>  C, is there a priority list? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1025.378s">The</a>  answer is yes, based on the criteria above. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1028.616s">Part</a>  D, when will the work take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1030.957s">Answer,</a>  upcoming construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1034.639s">Number</a>  three, Councilor Morell offered an amendment requesting answers to the following questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1041.062s">A,</a>  can the administration please clarify what phase three is and are there additional phases? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1047.805s">B,</a>  does the administration anticipate making another request for funding sidewalk repairs and to when does that carry us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1056.43s">The</a>  answer is, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1057.857s">that</a>  this is the second part of a two-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1061.16s">Sidewalk</a>  repair replacement is constantly needed and subject to availability of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1068.547s">Number</a>  four, Council appears off an amendment requesting answers to the following question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1073.632s">How</a>  does this project in its funding fit into the COVID-19 impact on city finances? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1078.837s">And</a>  does this funding request need to be pared back? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1082.702s">Answer,</a>  the administration is currently working on understanding the extent of COVID-19 we'll have on our city finances for current and future fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1092.485s">A</a>  request has been put forth to complete a current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1096.767s">The</a>  city's finance team believes that this is within our capacity at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1103.149s">Question</a>  five, what is the current free cash balance? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1106.19s">The</a>  answer is approximately $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1109.697s">Number</a>  six, what is the city's current bonding capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1113.76s">The</a>  answer, the city is authorized to borrow up to 5% of the equalized values in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1119.525s">City</a>  is currently borrowing less than 1% of the EQB. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1124.309s">The</a>  city's borrowing capacity currently exceeds $500 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1129.673s">So</a>  those are questions that the administration, well actually these are the questions and answers, the answers from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1138.293s">At</a>  this point in time, I'll recognize Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1141.674s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1142.695s">I</a>  want to thank Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez for his timely response. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1148.297s">The</a>  question I do have, and maybe I didn't pose it correctly last week, I'm trying to figure out how existing sidewalks are on our list currently.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1159.715s">So</a>  I have the list, I have the full list. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1161.155s">I</a>  had meant to scan the full list for my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1163.136s">It's</a>  probably about this thick of all the sidewalks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1166.657s">And</a>  as complaints come through from different sources, they come from Councilors, they come from to the mayor's office through C-Click Fix, that data is collected on that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1174.999s">And</a>  then people go out to make assessments based upon the need for replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1179.18s">So</a>  I can certainly, it's just a large list. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1180.941s">I'm</a>  happy to provide you with a copy and scan that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1184.282s">It</a>  is a very large file though. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1185.562s">That's</a>  why I didn't send it around, but I can certainly make that available.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1189.545s">Okay,</a>  in the past, Dave, we were able to get a list of sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1197.388s">And</a>  by a number of criteria, the date it was requested, the type or condition of the sidewalk, when it was reported, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1209.615s">uh,</a>  when, when it's scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1212.276s">So</a>  there was a list that it was, uh, you know, available in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1215.837s">I'm</a>  just trying to get a handle on, uh, knowing that in 2019, we did roughly 232 sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1223.68s">Um,</a>  what percent of, uh, this year's money will get us through what list we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1230.083s">So</a>  if we have a thousand on the list, is it safe to say we're going to do a quarter of the sidewalks or roughly?</p>
