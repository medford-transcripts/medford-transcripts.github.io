33
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate everybody for being here.

35
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:53,150
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I've talked to the chief of staff about this a few weeks ago, but again, I've been getting phone calls about Republic Parking and whether they're, you know, the question, the misconception that they're not in the business district or they are in the business district, that they're, are they essential?

36
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they non-essential?

37
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,159
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give you a few examples.

38
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,394
[SPEAKER_18]: It's seeing that what I'm hearing is that they're going into the neighborhoods.

39
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:22,578
[SPEAKER_18]: and really bearing down on neighborhood parking where some parking issues, as I talked to some constituents, have never been an issue for years, and they're coming down and ticketing certain areas, and it doesn't limit to one area of the city.

40
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:28,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear in West Medford, I hear in South Medford, I hear in North Medford that, so really, if we can,

41
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:43,991
[SPEAKER_18]: is really, if we can get Mr. Rodriguez, if you can, look into really defining and putting something out there so our constituents understand what the process is.

42
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:48,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think there is a misconception that it's not essential and it shouldn't be out there.

43
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:59,181
[SPEAKER_18]: They are essential, but they're not doing the business district, but they are obligated to go into the communities, into the neighborhoods.

44
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:07,824
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's what I've been hearing, and if we can get that concern taken care of or addressed, that'd be greatly appreciated.

45
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:08,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

46
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:11,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

47
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Any of the councillors like to speak on this?

48
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:18,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Claude Hernandez, do you have any emails?

49
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I do not have any emails on this topic.

50
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli.

51
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Second, Mr. President.

52
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,229

00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

59
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:40,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

60
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:41,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

61
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:42,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

62
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell.

63
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:44,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

64
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

65
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:46,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

66
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:47,955
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco.

67
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

68
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:54,525
[SPEAKER_16]: 20-321 offered by Consuelo Scarpelli.

69
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the city administration give us an update dealing with the census.

70
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Consuelo Scarpelli.

71
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:01,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

72
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:30,183
[SPEAKER_18]: With what's going on in our time today and the fear of budget decreases and the downfalls we're looking to have possibly, adding the lack of information gathered by the census and losing any sort of federal money because we haven't done our due diligence as a leadership and a community,

73
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:50,938
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that if we can, I want to make amendment, if we can reach out to state delegates to see if there is, I know there was talk about an extension, when they were going to, actually the kickoff I believe was April 1st, and now it's, I haven't heard, we haven't heard much about it.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:04,628
[SPEAKER_18]: is could the city administration, could we look at non-essential employees that are getting paid, that aren't working at City Hall?

75
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:15,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a way we can put a team together that can reach out right now via phone or other avenues to get people interested, get them involved in returning their census forms?

76
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:30,418
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that while there is a lull in one facet of government, I think that maybe we can look at a way to take advantage of our educated and capable employees within City Hall.

77
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:41,584
[SPEAKER_18]: to really mount an attack and get the information out that's needed to get the information back that we're going to need for our schools and our police stations and fire stations and DPW.

78
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,826
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be massively important.

79
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:52,092
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that we did talk about it, but I just wanted to gather some information with that.

80
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:52,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

81
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

82
00:06:54,586 --> 00:07:02,691
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may really quick, Neil Osborne, who is basically the point person, I believe, for the city with regard to the census.

83
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:17,261
[SPEAKER_16]: We were going back and forth before coronavirus, trying to set up a committee, the whole meeting, just to give everyone an update as to what the plans were with regard to what the city was gonna do and how things were going to operate with regard to the census.

84
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:20,964
[SPEAKER_16]: And once coronavirus happened,

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,768
[SPEAKER_16]: everything kind of went off track.

86
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,650
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to try to schedule a committee the whole meeting.

87
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,974
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez had mentioned previously that Neil might be on the call.

88
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know if Neil's on the call?

89
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:35,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I just checked with him.

90
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,417
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not on the call right now.

91
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just checked with him.

92
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard back.

93
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,680
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, no problem.

94
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,841
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't sound like he's on the call.

95
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:50,166
[SPEAKER_16]: But I will schedule a committee the whole meeting with Neil to set up a Zoom call so we can actually specifically talk about the census.

96
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,767
[SPEAKER_16]: But Councilor Scott, it looks like you

97
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if we can, I appreciate that, that'd be a great start.

98
00:07:55,388 --> 00:08:01,411
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if we can invite the, I know each community has a representative from the Census Bureau.

99
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:08,234
[SPEAKER_18]: If we can invite them also, I don't know if Mr. Rodriguez could pass that along to Neil Osborne.

100
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:14,617
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that each, like I said, each community has someone that works for the Census Bureau as a

101
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:24,124
[SPEAKER_18]: contact person, if we can find out who that is and invite them to that committee, the whole meeting, to see what they're doing at the federal level too.

102
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,065
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you.

103
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:26,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

104
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any questions regarding this resolution?

105
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Any comments from the council?

106
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Any comments in general?

107
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:37,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

108
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, did you have a comment you wanted to make?

109
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just the one thing.

110
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:51,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that Neil has been continuing his work with the Complete Count Committee and the community liaison, so she was in the office right before all this jumped off, so she has been working with that.

111
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check on our self-community response rates before the meeting tonight.

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And Medford has a self-response rate of 58.5%.

113
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts overall has a 55.8%.

114
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:05,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're a little bit above the state average.

115
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit behind Somerville, they're at 58.8.

116
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:11,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden, we're ahead of Malden and Everett.

117
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden's at 50.8.

118
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Everett is at 42.7.

119
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're lagging behind Winchester and Arlington.

120
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Arlington's at 69% and Winchester is at 71.7.

121
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of all over the place, but we are above the state average.

122
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:33,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do know Neil has been working hard to try to re-understand the importance, like Councilor Scarpelli said, about this is how everything happens.

123
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:35,619
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how all the formulas get written.

124
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,040
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how all the numbers get derived.

125
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So we understand the importance.

126
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,802
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to drive up these numbers to get the most accurate, complete count we can.

127
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:42,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

128
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

129
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:43,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

130
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:44,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morrell.

131
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

132
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:50,006
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just curious how often we could get updates on that percentage response rate.

133
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:53,780
[SPEAKER_05]: They're available online all the time, so they're done in real time.

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I can email the link to the councilors, and you can see how we're measuring up to everybody else.

135
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:01,125
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could, I'd greatly appreciate that.

136
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:01,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers?

137
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:09,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I think one other thing that's on that website is that our final self-response rate in 2010 was 68%.

138
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:13,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously, we want to get above that, given that

139
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,235
[SPEAKER_13]: all the people who don't do the self-response, someone comes to their door, and that's gonna be a whole other set of circumstances given what's going on.

140
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,576
[SPEAKER_13]: So a really big push is good.

141
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:32,241
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think also Chief of Staff Rodriguez, the communities you outlined and the difference in the response rates are pretty clear why that's happening, right?

142
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,903
[SPEAKER_13]: The richer neighborhoods and towns have a higher response rate.

143
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:41,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think a really important effort on reaching out to folks who we may not always reach is gonna be important.

195
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:40,061
[SPEAKER_16]: City method loan order citywide sidewalks, be it ordered that the sum of $500,000 be hereby

00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:17,238
[SPEAKER_16]: and to issue bonds or notes of the city thereof.

199
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,188
[SPEAKER_16]: to pay such costs by a like amount.

200

[SPEAKER_16]: therewith to provide such information and execute such documents as the Municipal Finance Oversight Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require, very truly yours, Mayor Brianne Alago-Kern.

202
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,050
[SPEAKER_16]: So last week, this paper came before us.

203
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:25,233
[SPEAKER_16]: There were a number of questions that the councilors had for the administration.

204
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,255
[SPEAKER_16]: We received some responses earlier today from

205
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see he's from my chief of staff Dave Rodriguez.

206
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:45,129
[SPEAKER_16]: They were forwarded to us by Club her to bees did everyone have a chance to read those or what we can do is I can actually go through the questions and read up the answers so everyone can I

207
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,813
[SPEAKER_16]: see what the responses were from the administration.

208
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Cabello had the first question.

209
00:14:52,435 --> 00:15:06,202
[SPEAKER_16]: He offered an amendment requesting information on whether the mayor and the DPW have looked into the pilot program mentioned in January to repair sidewalks for less money than it costs to replace them and whether method reached any agreement with Walden.

210
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:16,108
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer, I assume that this question is regarding the request from the council that the administration explore the option of utilizing a method of sidewalk repair that involves grinding

211
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,853
[SPEAKER_16]: and not full replacement.

212
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:29,277
[SPEAKER_16]: The requested funding is for the continuation of a previously procured contract with an existing contractor, La Rovere Construction.

213
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:38,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not aware of any negotiations or discussions that have been had by the administration with the city of Malden regarding sidewalk replacement.

214
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,042
[SPEAKER_16]: We will look into the feasibility of the sidewalk repair method vendor in future contracts.

215
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,543
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was the answer to the first question.

216
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Second question was asked by Councilor Marks.

217
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Marks offered an amendment requesting the answer to the following question.

218
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the administration working from a list?

219
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,089
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer, yes.

220
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:12,437
[SPEAKER_16]: While the pavement condition index, the PCI project is set to begin this summer, the mayor has asked the DPW commissioner and city engineer for a list based on their experience of sidewalks that are in the most need

221
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:21,372
[SPEAKER_16]: of replacement, the sidewalks to be replaced and selected by using the following criteria in no particular order.

222
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,652
[SPEAKER_16]: One, age of the request.

223
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Two, condition of the surrounding sidewalks and driveway aprons.

224
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:35,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Three, geography, an attempt is made to spread it out equitably throughout the city.

225
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:46,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Part B to the question, if there is a list, what percentage of the work on this list is being done with this $500,000?

226
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,906
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer, it depends on the on the ground conditions for each sidewalk.

227
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:54,309
[SPEAKER_16]: The hope is to stretch the work as far as possible.

228
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:01,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year, the city was able to replace 232 sidewalks of varying lengths under the current contract in 2019.

229
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Part C, is there a priority list?

230
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,780
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer is yes, based on the criteria above.

231
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Part D, when will the work take place?

232
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Answer, upcoming construction season.

233
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:20,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Number three, Councilor Morrell offered an amendment requesting answers to the following questions.

234
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:27,505
[SPEAKER_16]: A, can the administration please clarify what phase three is and are there additional phases?

235
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:35,849
[SPEAKER_16]: B, does the administration anticipate making another request for funding sidewalk repairs and to when does that carry us?

236
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,090
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer is,

237
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,520
[SPEAKER_16]: that this is the second part of a two-year contract.

238
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Sidewalk repair replacement is constantly needed and subject to availability of funds.

239
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:52,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Number four, Council appears off an amendment requesting answers to the following question.

240
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:58,697
[SPEAKER_16]: How does this project in its funding fit into the COVID-19 impact on city finances?

241
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:02,000
[SPEAKER_16]: And does this funding request need to be pared back?

242
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:12,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Answer, the administration is currently working on understanding the extent of COVID-19 we'll have on our city finances for current and future fiscal years.

243
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,087
[SPEAKER_16]: A request has been put forth to complete a current contract.

244
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:23,109
[SPEAKER_16]: The city's finance team believes that this is within our capacity at this time.

245
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Question five, what is the current free cash balance?

246
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,171
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer is approximately $12 million.

247
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Number six, what is the city's current bonding capacity?

248
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,985
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer, the city is authorized to borrow up to 5% of the equalized values in the community.

249
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:44,269
[SPEAKER_16]: City is currently borrowing less than 1% of the EQB.

250
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,832
[SPEAKER_16]: The city's borrowing capacity currently exceeds $500 million.

251
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:57,560
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are questions that the administration, well actually these are the questions and answers, the answers from the administration.

252
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,174
[SPEAKER_16]: At this point in time, I'll recognize Councilor Marks.

253
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

254
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:06,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez for his timely response.

255
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: The question I do have, and maybe I didn't pose it correctly last week, I'm trying to figure out how existing sidewalks are on our list currently.

256
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have the list, I have the full list.

257
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I had meant to scan the full list for my office.

258
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably about this thick of all the sidewalks in the city.

259
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:34,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And as complaints come through from different sources, they come from counselors, they come from to the mayor's office through C-Click Fix, that data is collected on that list.

260
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people go out to make assessments based upon the need for replacement.

261
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can certainly, it's just a large list.

262
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:44,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to provide you with a copy and scan that to you.

263
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,542
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very large file though.

264
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:48,603
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I didn't send it around, but I can certainly make that available.

265
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:55,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, in the past, Dave, we were able to get a list of sidewalk repairs.

266
00:19:57,388 --> 00:20:08,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And by a number of criteria, the date it was requested, the type or condition of the sidewalk, when it was reported,

267
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,876
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, when, when it's scheduled to be done.

268
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a list that it was, uh, you know, available in the past.

269
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to get a handle on, uh, knowing that in 2019, we did roughly 232 sidewalks.

270
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what percent of, uh, this year's money will get us through what list we have.

271
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:36,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have a thousand on the list, is it safe to say we're going to do a quarter of the sidewalks or roughly?

272
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:40,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's hard to tell because when we get out there, we take a look at what the surroundings.

273
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take a look at the sidewalks next to it, the sidewalks to either side.

274
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,379
[SPEAKER_05]: We took a look at the driveway, we take a look at the curbing.

275
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So different sidewalks can take, can cost different amounts of money.

276
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So chewing through the money, it could, that number could go up and it certainly could go down depending on conditions on the ground.

277
00:20:56,007 --> 00:21:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So we certainly try to stretch the money out as far as we can to get as many sidewalks done as we possibly can.

278
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:08,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard to tell until we actually get out on the ground and we start evaluating the exact conditions that we're going to face when we start replacing.

279
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:09,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

280
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So based on the criteria information, one of the criteria is the age of the sidewalk and the other is condition.

281
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a couple of other criteria.

282
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:24,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So are all these sidewalks that are currently on the list

283
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to pin down exactly what you're saying.

284
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: you're looking for, and I want to give you the best info possible.

285
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:58,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But the list in itself is about 117, 120 pages of sidewalks throughout the city.

286
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are very, very in condition.

287
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

288
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So as one member of the council, it would be helpful to find out, first of all, the number.

289
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could be sent to us in an Excel spreadsheet very easily.

290
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:10,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

291
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,283
[SPEAKER_06]: the number of sidewalks that are on the list ranked by condition.

292
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So just say it's one through four.

293
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:29,710
[SPEAKER_06]: If four is a very problem trip hazard safety concern, it'd be interesting to know we have out of a thousand sidewalks, 800 of these compared to a level three or level two or level one.

294
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:37,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, to me, it would be easier to make a judgment on whether or not we're actually moving forward on our sidewalks.

295
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:41,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Because after 20 years of doing this, I don't see us moving forward.

296
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not a reflection on the current administration.

297
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:50,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But to say how we've handled it over the years, we've never really gotten ahead of the current.

298
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:52,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to make sure

299
00:22:53,387 --> 00:23:10,988
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's the request of which Councilor Scott Pelley and many Councilors have talked about, creating our own sidewalk crew, or just to continue the way we've done business with throwing a half a million dollars at a time at the problem and never really getting

300
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,874
[SPEAKER_06]: to a point where we can say, you know what?

301
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make it some headway.

302
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've been on the council 20 years.

303
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we're making headway.

304
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be surprised if any other councilors could tell me otherwise.

305
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell you from residents' standpoint, they don't believe we're making any headway.

306
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:30,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of them that have been on the list for five, six, seven, eight years feel the same way.

307
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,584
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure we're moving in a direction.

308
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:36,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know this administration's interested in doing so.

309
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:53,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Provides results for us and gives us a clear direction Whether or not we're making some headway and I don't think I've been able to accomplish that over the many years Start now And say hey, you know what moving forward.

310
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the direction we want to continue?

311
00:23:56,417 --> 00:24:00,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to keep on throwing money at this or do we want to maybe take this in-house?

312
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is gonna be the year for me to make that decision

313
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, and I don't think we'll ever run out of sidewalks to fix, but I do agree with the sentiment of trying to make headway.

314
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:15,362
[SPEAKER_05]: What you described in ranking condition of sidewalks is exactly what a PCI will do.

315
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:26,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you index them appropriately, you're going to be able to say that we were able to do 55 level 4s, 50 level 3s, 25 level 2s, and be able to work through your list that way.

316
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with you have to do that classification first.

317
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have them classified in that ranking yet.

318
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,648
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's part of what that program is going to do.

319
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:39,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, we do have a list and we know certain conditions and age of requests.

320
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're basing it on the best criteria we have.

321
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can certainly get you that Excel spreadsheet from DPW.

322
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:48,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it as a hard list, but I can, I have to track it down for as an electronic list that I can share with you.

323
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,332
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be helpful.

324
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jason.

325
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:51,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

326
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:53,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morrell.

327
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:55,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

328
00:24:55,574 --> 00:25:01,396
[SPEAKER_15]: So just clarifying that the 232 pieces of sidewalk that were accomplished in 2019, that is with the 500,000, that was the amount of money?

329
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That was from the first half of the $1 million contract, so yes.

330
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:06,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

331
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:07,202
[SPEAKER_15]: So $500,000.

332
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:07,802
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

333
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

334
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

335
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Carvio.

336
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:13,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

337
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:16,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I support Councilor Marks on this.

338
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:24,276
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we'll ever make any headway by throwing $500,000 in the whack at this.

339
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:31,622
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I've been there for several years now, and 200 sidewalks a year isn't very many.

340
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:43,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I would think half a million dollars would get us a crew that would work from April to November nonstop doing sidewalks.

341
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:46,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, you'll never run out of sidewalks to fix.

342
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:58,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can take those crew once you're able to stop doing the sidewalks, you can take them and you can put them onto the city side for powering or whatever else the city needs on that end.

343
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,520
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, going forward,

344
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I'm going to support another money thing to fix sidewalks again.

345
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:13,806
[SPEAKER_12]: My next question is, I don't know if this is for Chief of Staff Rodriguez or Treasurer Pompeo.

346
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,967
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the rate we're borrowing money at right now?

347
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:17,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's fairly low.

348
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave, is that a question you can answer?

349
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:23,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a question for Fred?

350
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Fred can answer as well.

351
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that these are competitive bonds.

352
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So then the bond market isn't currently in flux.

353
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So we won't really know what the rate that we'll borrow it until we go into market to sell the bonds.

354
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,041
[SPEAKER_05]: But Fred can also expand on that as well.

355
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:41,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Fred, what is the rate like right now?

356
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:50,905
[SPEAKER_14]: We're 2.6 and 3.4, so we're probably still in that same range right now.

357
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:54,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have an exact rate.

358
00:26:54,647 --> 00:27:02,309
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't get an exact rate until you actually issue it, but I would say that's a comfortable range right now in the twos to the low threes.

359
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we doing this at a 10-year or a 20-year?

360
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that hasn't been decided yet.

361
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:12,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, where it's not that much a big amount of money, would a 10-year be more feasible?

362
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:17,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, but you also look at the budget, you know, you're looking at your future budgets.

363
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,186
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you want to spread out your money over the years?

364
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:29,331
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, that would be, we were working with Alicia on that until, you know, she took health, but, so we haven't really finalized that.

365
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:30,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

366
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:33,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand the money's going to be a little tight this year for some stuff.

367
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:37,815
[SPEAKER_12]: So I understand that'll be a decision you'll probably make at budget time.

368
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:38,436
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

369
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:39,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

370
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

371
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:41,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

372
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Carvio.

373
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Treasurer Papio.

374
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Adam Knight, did you have a question, Councilor Knight?

375
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:56,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it looks like we lost Councilor Knight.

376
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:57,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And thanks for your answers, Dave.

379
00:28:02,502 --> 00:28:04,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you said- I did, John Falco, Mr. President, I did.

380
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:08,787
[SPEAKER_10]: This contract was put up to be correct.

381
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

382
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, are you still there?

383
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:25,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it sounds like Councilor Knight might have a connection issue.

384
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Pierce, if you could please continue.

385
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still here.

386
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:29,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's going on.

387
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see everything you've got doing.

388
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:35,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

389
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you ready to speak, Councilor Knight?

390
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,230
[SPEAKER_12]: He has been.

391
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:43,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

392
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, are you ready to speak?

393
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so, Mr. President.

394
00:28:55,514 --> 00:29:00,096
[SPEAKER_10]: My first question was whether or not this contract was put out to bid and when.

395
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:06,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It was put out to bid prior to the 2019 construction season.

396
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding

397
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:23,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't hear you, yeah.

398
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:26,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, can I make a suggestion?

399
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:27,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

400
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:36,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe Councilor Knight could call in on his cell phone, or his house phone, where he can ask a question and still watch.

401
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:37,370
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be easier for him.

402
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:44,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I might just hang up and just say this is not working for me anymore, and I'm not doing it anymore, and we can get back to reality sometime soon too.

403
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

404
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:46,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, buddy.

405
00:29:48,620 --> 00:30:00,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But so I get the question I have is if this contract was put out to bid contract supposed to be appropriated and funded when signed.

406
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:03,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

407
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It was correct and I was a budget decision that was made last year.

408
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:11,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We're filling in the gaps from last year's last year's contract signing.

409
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:19,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

410
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for now, Mr. President.

411
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

412
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:25,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers, thank you for waiting patiently.

413
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,634
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no worries.

414
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:28,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So two questions.

415
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:37,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Given that this was a, would this be the process that would be followed going forward?

416
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:41,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this the, would it be issuing, putting out to bid another contract in the future?

417
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you planning to do this differently?

418
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will probably be built as part of a larger capital investment program.

419
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,433
[SPEAKER_05]: It's currently underway.

420
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:58,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing a bridge CIP for 2021 that's currently under development.

421
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll have a five-year plan to issue after that.

422
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:06,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, this will be put onto that list that'll say, we want to do X amount of money in sidewalk replacement.

423
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,607
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how much we're going to spend, and this is what our funding source is going to be.

424
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll be able to map it out a little bit more.

425
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use bonding, you can use free cash, you can use some other cities and towns use capital stabilization funds or budgeted line items for this.

426
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:27,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonding or bond anticipation note or some sort of other borrowing seem to be the most prudent way to move forward on this.

427
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:34,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Working with Fred, working with Alicia, working with our financial advisors, that was the decision that was made.

428
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,421
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, and just one other question.

429
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:40,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you answered that

430
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:41,844
[SPEAKER_13]: this is doable.

431
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:45,829
[SPEAKER_13]: You think the team thinks this is doable given the COVID-19 impacts?

432
00:31:47,651 --> 00:32:00,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess the only other kind of the side question to that is, are we planning on issuing bonds for any other emergency expenditures related to COVID-19 and would this impact the potential to issue those?

433
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:03,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we wouldn't have to issue bonds for any emergency funding.

434
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been tracking our expenses very, very closely.

435
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,689
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of that's gonna be reimbursable through the state and federal governments.

436
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have been tracking that.

437
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:20,197
[SPEAKER_05]: If we do run into deficit, we are able to amortize our debt that is incurred as a response to COVID-19 over the three subsequent fiscal years.

438
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to have the outside auditor or Alicia kind of explain what that means a little bit more.

439
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,463
[SPEAKER_05]: They're way smarter than I am when it comes to that.

440
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:35,385
[SPEAKER_05]: but we were not anticipating doing any, you know, revenue anticipation notes or any borrowing that's directly related to COVID-19.

441
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We think there's gonna be other mechanisms for us to fund that response.

442
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:46,728
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there was an expense like needing computers for distance learning, that kind of thing, this would not crowd that out is what you're saying?

443
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:47,609
[SPEAKER_05]: No, absolutely not.

444
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all that is being accounted for separately.

445
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have to purchase some technology on the city side for the Board of Health, for contact tracing activities,

446
00:32:56,651 --> 00:33:09,923
[SPEAKER_05]: our RUOK program, masks, PPE, all sorts of stuff we had to purchase, you know, linens for emergency housing, cleaning for emergency housing, cleaning for the public facilities.

447
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:14,787
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all being accounted for and will largely be reimbursed by the state and federal governments.

448
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thanks, and I'm looking forward to that meeting too.

449
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

450
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

451
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:31,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, and I hate to keep beating a dead horse, Mr. President, but I appreciate Mr. Rodriguez talking about the capital plan.

452
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:43,223
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, I would love to make an amendment that we ask the city director of DPW to do an analysis to see what it would cost to start a crew.

453
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:49,065
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I worked with the former commissioner who's now passed, God bless him,

454
00:33:50,626 --> 00:34:01,253
[SPEAKER_18]: stand Cody who helped me put together a plan where it was three full-time employees, the truck and the equipment, plus what the cement would look like, a hot top would look like.

455
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:19,327
[SPEAKER_18]: And I tell you, other than the upfront costs of maybe $500,000 the first year to get that going, it really started a program that even if it is part of the capital plan, and we do correct 80% of our sidewalks, which is great, and streets, let's say that's

456
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:27,296
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, if that works, but the hope is we still need a process moving forward that we're not going to fall back into that.

457
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:28,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Always maintaining.

458
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:36,987
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's one thing we haven't done here in a long time with our infrastructure and our buildings and our facilities, that once we

459
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:47,874
[SPEAKER_18]: once we correct something, having a maintenance plan in place that we're correcting things before a $1,000 problem turns into a $15,000 problem.

460
00:34:48,174 --> 00:35:00,042
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think this is what, like I said, I hate to keep beating on it, but I think it's something that I need to see from the director of DPW that can tell me, George, no way, this is why.

461
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:13,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the way I run my home, if I needed to fix something, if I can patch it for $2,000 for 10 years, instead of an upfront cost of $10,000, I'll find a way to do that at $10,000 if the means say.

462
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,142
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I weigh it.

463
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we weight this.

464
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:21,864
[SPEAKER_18]: We keep talking about it.

465
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:29,248
[SPEAKER_18]: This is now year five and we're saying the same thing in my time here on the council.

466
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,129
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate everybody's hard work.

467
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,830
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the questions were well thought out.

468
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:39,853
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that the biggest issue I have is that this was a contract from last administration.

469
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,534
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a two year contract.

470
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:46,877
[SPEAKER_18]: There was confusion when I talked to administration about how it was

471
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,598
[SPEAKER_18]: separate and why it was separated.

472
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:54,499
[SPEAKER_18]: There was some confusion there, but I can understand where we are right now.

473
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

474
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

475
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

476
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, Mr. Rodriguez has his hand raised.

477
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Missed that, sorry.

478
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an FYI, Neil Osborne has jumped on the call if we want to return back to the census item.

479
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,992
[SPEAKER_05]: He can provide some insight to that, just FYI.

480
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:17,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

481
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:22,152
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll finish up with this here.

482
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:26,413
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can, Mr. President, can I make that amendment to B paper?

483
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:28,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, we can do that.

484
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

485
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:32,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, any other questions regarding this issue?

486
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:36,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers.

487
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:44,653
[SPEAKER_13]: What, as this is a contract that's been signed, what would be the impact if the vote were not to be in favor?

488
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:47,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

489
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a legal question.

490
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:52,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have to circle back with the solicitor as to the legal ramifications of that.

491
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:52,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

492
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:57,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor Knight.

493
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:01,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it works better with my camera off, Mr. President.

494
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:07,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I, as one member of the council, am a firm believer in getting the shovels in the ground.

495
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we do need to get this sidewalk work done and I think we need to live up to our contractual obligation that we made some time ago.

496
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:19,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So I certainly have no problem supporting the funding for this paper this evening.

497
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:29,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I've continuously held true to my position that I do believe we need to focus on eliminating the extensive use of private contractors and

498
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:36,777
[SPEAKER_07]: really turning this work in-house because I feel as though what we're doing is we're really in a race to the bottom.

499
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:42,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not investing in our own personnel and our own institutional knowledge.

500
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,782
[SPEAKER_07]: We're giving all the control and direction to a private company that we're throwing money at.

501
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:54,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all spoken at length about when a private company gets a public contract, how they feel as though they've hit the lottery.

502
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,738
[SPEAKER_07]: and the work product sometimes isn't as good as we'd like.

503
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:03,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've also seen that there's not much pride in workmanship.

504
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:18,617
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have an individual that comes to work every day, 365 days a year, like our DPW workers have been doing, especially during these trying times with COVID-19, I think we understand how valuable a resource our DPW is.

505
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:28,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, I do think we do need to take a long, hard look at continuing to reinvest these privately spent funds, these bonded funds especially.

506
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:36,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, ultimately, if you look at it, we're going to spend $500,000, we're going to pay it off over 15 years, and we're going to get 200 sidewalks out of the deal.

507
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:46,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We could save $500,000, and we could hire employees, and we could have them work for us for the next 30 years, the same amount of time we paid off the bond for just these 230 sidewalks.

508
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:53,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think it's important that we do look at that issue, but this evening I am prepared to vote in favor of funding the contract.

509
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Light.

510
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:56,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions?

511
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:02,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so what we'll do is first we will take up the B paper.

512
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Hernandez, can you please read back the language to the B paper?

513
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:16,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli's B paper is to ask the DPW director to see what it would cost to start a crew to do this work.

514
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:19,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

515
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,276
[SPEAKER_16]: On Councilor Scarpelli's B paper, seconded by?

516
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:24,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Second, Mr. President.

517
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caravaglia.

00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:27,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk, please call the roll.

519
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,018

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

521
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caravaglia?

522
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:33,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

523
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

524
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

525
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

526
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:37,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

527
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:38,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell?

528
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:39,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

529
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:40,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

530
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:41,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

531
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:42,323
[SPEAKER_04]: President Falco?

532
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:42,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

533
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

534
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:47,545
[SPEAKER_16]: On the main paper,

535
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:54,439
[SPEAKER_16]: for the request for the bond of $500,000.

536
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Herterbeast, please call the roll.

537
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:01,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just want to clarify, this is for first reading, correct?

538
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:02,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, correct.

539
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,945
[SPEAKER_16]: This is for the first reading pertaining to this bond.

540
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Who had the original motion for approval?

541
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,849
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion of, I'll make the motion.

542
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:16,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

543
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, for first reading.

544
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:22,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

545
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:23,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

546
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:23,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

547
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

548
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:25,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

549
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:26,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

551
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:26,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

553
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

554
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

555
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:27,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

556
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:52,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, while we're under suspension, reports from committees?

557
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

558
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:02,231
[SPEAKER_16]: While we're under suspension, reports from committees 19-659 and 20-098, which was a subcommittee on zoning that occurred on April 22nd, 2020.

559
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:05,692
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Vice President Carriello's subcommittee on zoning.

560
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviello, could you give us a brief synopsis of the meeting?

561
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:45,293
[SPEAKER_12]: We had another meeting Wednesday night, which we presented the final draft to the committee and to the administration to have KP law just go over and to make sure that we are compliant with all state regulations pursuant to the marijuana ordinance.

563
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did report it favorably out to a committee of the whole meeting.

564
00:41:49,652 --> 00:42:05,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully you can schedule that soon and maybe we can get this done before the summer and this will bring some needed funds into our city coffers right now.

565
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:07,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

566

00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, you are correct.

725
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:26,233
[SPEAKER_16]: So 20-325 is offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli.

726
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:32,984
[SPEAKER_16]: 20-326, if you don't mind, from the chair that's offered by me, President Falco.

727
00:49:33,644 --> 00:49:41,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of James Maturana on his recent passing.

728
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:44,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

729
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

730
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,590
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know that the Maturanas are a great Methodist family.

731
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:55,112
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been around for a long time, whether it be with Pop Warner or right now with our very own licensing commission.

732
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:01,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Jimmy comes from a great group of people and a great family, and he will be sorely missed.

733
00:50:01,823 --> 00:50:12,845
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Mr. President, I think that I would be remiss in speaking before Counselor Scott Pelley on this, especially whereas he and Jimmy grew up together, when Morris and Park played around kids together.

734
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I defer to Counselor Scott Pelley.

735
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:20,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you, Council Knight, but I think that Jimmy was a little, a few years younger than me.

736
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:35,630
[SPEAKER_18]: I graduated with Dave and grew up with David and hanging around the Taft Street home and being around the Maturana family, you realize that when Mr. Maturana died, when Guy died, you realize that a true legend left Medford and you could feel it.

737
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:42,855
[SPEAKER_18]: But what he did is he left a legacy of great, great, great children and, you know,

738
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:47,681
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jimmy was no different.

739
00:50:47,701 --> 00:50:49,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Jimmy was just a great young man.

740
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:59,032
[SPEAKER_18]: If you remember Jimmy, when I started coaching and Jimmy was still playing football in Medford High School, you realize what kind of an aura he brought.

741
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:01,114
[SPEAKER_18]: People loved to be around Jimmy.

742
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:04,337
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jimmy was the type of kid that loved everybody.

743
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,261
[SPEAKER_18]: When the world loses somebody like that, it really hurts.

744
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:11,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that Jimmy's left.

745
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:26,049
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I talked to David this week, and we've read multiple Facebook posts and videos being sent from all over the world, sending their condolences, you realize what a real impact he's made.

746
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:34,533
[SPEAKER_18]: And he has two wonderful young boys and a beautiful wife that have sent out some really moving memories.

747
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:39,929
[SPEAKER_18]: and words and Jimmy's behalf.

748
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:48,396
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jimmy left a little note for everybody and telling us to keep smiling and keep moving forward.

749
00:51:48,636 --> 00:51:56,022
[SPEAKER_18]: And you realize how great Medford is when you see the people that are coming back and supporting the Maturana family.

750
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Jimmy will always be missed, but Jimmy will never be forgotten.

751
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:07,934
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, everybody talks about what kind of a great athlete Jimmy was and what an impact he made in Medford High School sports.

752
00:52:08,414 --> 00:52:11,877
[SPEAKER_18]: And they were huge, but what he did leave

753
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,983
[SPEAKER_18]: He's left an empty hole in a lot of people's hearts, and he's left nothing but a positive memory.

754
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:28,027
[SPEAKER_18]: I know he graduated my sister Lisa, and as soon as she heard the word, it was instant tears, because you knew that we lost a good one.

755
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:36,611
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that losing someone has been very difficult, especially today in society, but losing Jimmy Maturana is a huge, sad loss.

756
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:49,001
[SPEAKER_18]: something that I will do moving forward is always keeping Jimmy in light here in Method and Mustang country and keeping his memory alive for his sons to understand his legacy.

757
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:56,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And we send condolences to the family, the whole Maturana family and his wonderful wife and kids.

758
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,629
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, thank you.

759
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

760
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Ioannidis, I'm sorry, did you want to speak further?

761
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I could do any justice compared to what Councilor Capelli just said, Mr. President.

762
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

763
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Carviello.

764
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:13,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

765
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:25,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think all my councilors have said it all, you know, the Moderanos are a family that bleeds blue and white in the city of Bedford, right from the father all the way down to all his kids.

766
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,477
[SPEAKER_12]: They all have a legacy in this community.

767
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:32,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, another one, a sad death at this time.

768
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:35,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

769
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:36,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

770
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:38,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

771
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:39,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

772
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Councilor Scott Pell and Councilor Knight and yourself for putting this on.

773
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:48,000
[SPEAKER_06]: As was stated, the Maturana family have been in the city for many, many decades.

774
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:51,524
[SPEAKER_06]: One better than the next, to be quite honest with you.

775
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Jimmy fought a terrible illness

776
00:53:54,992 --> 00:54:01,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So for a long time, and not many people knew about it cause he kept it to himself and he didn't pity himself.

777
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, you know, he will be as council Scott Pelley mentioned, uh, truly missed.

778
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:10,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I hope, uh, all the siblings, uh, can.

779
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:17,040
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, take some solace from the fact that, um, he led such a great life with such great family men.

780
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:30,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, we'll leave a legacy in this community, uh, not just as a sportsman, which they all were, they're all great athletes, but as a family man and as a person.

781
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that I think goes much further than anything else.

782
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:39,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, uh, I'd like to dedicate this meeting, Mr. President, in Jimmy Maturana's honor.

783
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:40,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely agree.

784
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:41,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

785
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

786
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:42,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Got so much.

787
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:55,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and if I may, uh, you know, I, I remember Jimmy is, so I'm a couple of years older than Jimmy, but I remember, uh, my earliest time playing baseball at the car park.

788
00:54:56,729 --> 00:55:01,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, Jimmy was a few years younger than me, but he was the best kid on the team.

789
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,752
[SPEAKER_16]: He was just such an amazing athlete and amazing talent.

790
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:08,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and I played little league with him at car park and Gillis park.

791
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,340
[SPEAKER_16]: And he was just a great, I would say great kid.

792
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:17,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but I remember playing high school with him at football, playing football with him at Medford high years later.

793
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:19,646
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was a junior at the time.

794
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:22,348
[SPEAKER_16]: His brother, Dave was the senior.

795
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:23,248
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a quarterback.

796
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:27,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Jimmy was a sophomore and he started, he was that good.

797
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,492
[SPEAKER_16]: And he came in as a soft.

798
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I think he might've started as a freshman.

799
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, he was that good.

800
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:34,196
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, he was always a talented athlete.

801
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,071
[SPEAKER_16]: great athlete, but more than that, he was just a great person.

802
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:46,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone that was always fun to be with, always great to talk to, and he comes from an absolutely fabulous family.

803
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:51,035
[SPEAKER_16]: All the moderators have been, they're just fabulous people.

804
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:54,636
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all great, they've all had a lasting impact on this community.

805
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:58,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I graduated with Jimmy's wife,

806
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:03,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Suzanne and she's another fantastic person.

807
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:07,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's really tough to lose Jimmy.

808
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:15,811
[SPEAKER_16]: He's such a, just an amazing person and our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family tonight.

809
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:20,873
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point in time, why don't we all- Mr. President.

810
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:32,512
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could also have a moment of silence for the people that have passed away and admitted that we don't even know about the many, you know, the many, many seniors that have passed.

811
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:39,079
[SPEAKER_12]: So we could also hold a moment of silence for the people that we don't even know that have passed away, but that passed away to this disease.

812
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

813
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,663
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time, why don't we all rise for a brief moment of silence.

814
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:06,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

815
00:57:09,747 --> 00:57:17,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the motion of council, and I seconded by Councillor Kelly, Clerk Hurtubise, do you please call the roll?

816
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,600
[SPEAKER_16]: That was in the final condolence.

817
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:22,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

818
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:25,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Behrs.

819
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

820
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

821
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

822
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

823
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

824
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

825
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:28,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

826
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

827
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:46,949
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point, we have a member of the public that would like to speak under public participation.

828
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:55,336
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, that we suspend the rules to move to public participation.

829
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Urnavis, please call the roll.

830
00:57:56,537 --> 00:58:05,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's the next item on the agenda, isn't it, Mr. President?

831
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to suspend the rules, too?

832
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:11,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, no, we don't, you're right, because that was the last resolution.

833
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:14,529
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point, we'll take up public participation.

834
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:17,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Is Eric on us?

835
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Von Berg?

836
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

837
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

838
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,251
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could please have your name and address for the record.

839
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:23,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

840
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:28,072
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Eric Von Berg, 369 High Street.

841
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:36,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for giving me a chance to speak tonight.

842
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:42,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope all of you councillors are healthy and well at this point.

843
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:48,807
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to talk about the use of face masks in the city of Medford.

844
00:58:49,147 --> 00:59:00,471
[SPEAKER_17]: As I watch people walking, running, bicycling past my house on High Street, I see that there's less than 50% of the people are wearing face masks.

845
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:09,815
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel the suggestion that we wear face masks is not effective enough in slowing the spread of COVID-19.

846
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:18,468
[SPEAKER_17]: As the numbers keep rising in Medford, Middlesex County, and Massachusetts, we need to take more serious action.

847
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:33,560
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to institute an order making it mandatory for everyone to wear masks when they are out in public, whether you are in a business or out on the street.

848
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:36,823
[SPEAKER_17]: This should apply to all above

849
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:41,030
[SPEAKER_17]: the age of two, walkers, runners, and bicyclists.

850
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Without compliance, we will be extending the shutdown endlessly.

851
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:53,479
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to mandate the wearing of face masks for the safety of all Medford residents.

852
00:59:55,861 --> 01:00:04,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that the city council will consider acting in favor of mandating the wearing of face masks while out in public.

853
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the chance to speak.

854
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:09,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

855
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caviel.

856
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:16,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

857
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:19,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Bromberg, for bringing this up.

858
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:24,103
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know what to say to people anymore.

859
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:28,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you go out there and you see people all over the place without masks and

860
01:00:29,204 --> 01:00:31,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And you say, do you not watch television?

861
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you not listen to the news?

862
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:35,090
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I just don't understand people.

863
01:00:35,471 --> 01:00:37,493
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't just Memphis, it's like everywhere.

864
01:00:38,053 --> 01:00:41,116
[SPEAKER_12]: And I say, I don't know if people just, maybe they just don't get it.

865
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:46,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you're not, just because maybe you're a younger person, it doesn't make you immune.

866
01:00:47,403 --> 01:00:53,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the city has it, where everybody has to go in stores, wear it.

867
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:58,870
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been in stores and I see people come walking in, no mask.

868
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:07,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I don't know what to say, people just don't understand, they don't get it.

869
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're trying to get a handle on this and every little thing that we do helps it.

870
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:16,498
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, you're right, 100%.

871
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:20,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know if we can force people to wear them.

872
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some of them have just done it, and some other cities have done it.

873
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:29,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And even over there, I've driven through some of them, and I see people walking around with no masks on.

874
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:36,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, you just can't understand people, you know.

875
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:39,441
[SPEAKER_12]: They have all the information.

876
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:41,744
[SPEAKER_12]: No matter where you go, you're seeing it.

877
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:42,585
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on the news.

878
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:43,606
[SPEAKER_12]: It's everywhere.

879
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:48,192
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I had an answer for you to the way people think.

880
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:55,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

881
01:01:56,594 --> 01:02:03,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that a lot of people, you know, think their freedom is being impinged upon by this.

882
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:07,737
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think, you know, freedom comes with responsibility.

883
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:15,378
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we really need to look to find a way to get this to happen.

884
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:24,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this is a danger to all of us and even more heavily to our elder citizens.

885
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:33,088
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that we need to dig into this and try and find a way that we can do something about this.

886
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:35,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

887
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:47,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think one thing that's clear is that if one person's wearing a mask and one person isn't, the effectiveness goes down significantly.

889
01:02:47,355 --> 01:02:53,518
[SPEAKER_13]: But if both people in an interaction or in a space are wearing a mask, it significantly helps to reduce the transmission rate.

890
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really glad that we're doing this in the businesses.

891
01:02:56,488 --> 01:03:08,614
[SPEAKER_13]: But I agree with Eric, I think, you know, setting this as you know, we're never going to get everyone I think Councilor Garviela is right about that, you know, but if we can say as a city, this is what we should do.

892
01:03:09,194 --> 01:03:13,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Set the example be the role model and say, you really need to be wearing a mask out.

893
01:03:13,816 --> 01:03:14,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should do that.

894
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:17,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Councilor Peers.

895
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:17,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morrell.

896
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:19,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:03:19,523 --> 01:03:22,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Mr. Rundberg for bringing this up.

898
01:03:22,286 --> 01:03:25,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I have heard from other constituents having the same concerns.

899
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:30,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a number of factors, obviously, to Vice President Carviello's point.

900
01:03:30,213 --> 01:03:32,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people just maybe don't care.

901
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,835
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not thinking.

902
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,956
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't think they're in danger.

903
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:35,958
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, there's access to masks.

904
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:38,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Not everyone has the financial means, the access.

905
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I know anything can be a mask, but not everyone has that.

906
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:44,689
[SPEAKER_15]: privilege time to even think about that when they're running out the door.

907
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:50,973
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's also just a challenge for our local businesses that have had to pivot so much.

908
01:03:51,113 --> 01:04:01,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see the signs in West Bedford Square requiring people to wear masks, but I think there's just a challenge there as far as now they're pivoting their business to adjust to these closures.

909
01:04:01,919 --> 01:04:08,403
[SPEAKER_15]: And also now they have to act as a sort of police to kick people out of their store, ask them to do certain things.

910
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:29,651
[SPEAKER_15]: perhaps it is going that full extent to have this further requirement that if we go this level, perhaps we'll catch at least a little bit more people trying to put these, getting these masks on for the protection and so that we can continue to flatten the curve and, you know, ideally reopen and get some sense of normalcy back in the future.

911
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:31,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

912
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:33,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morrell, thank you very much.

913
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

914
01:04:34,953 --> 01:04:35,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

915
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I was in meetings all day today.

916
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:51,643
[SPEAKER_18]: I work in Somerville and, um, you know, I would hope that, you know, as I talked to our administration, I know we had put in place, uh, some order of, um, masks, but can you hear me?

917
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:52,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

918
01:04:53,482 --> 01:05:02,248
[SPEAKER_18]: for some order of mass, but where, um, and we, unfortunately we can't make any amendments or resolutions off this because it has to be posted.

919
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:08,672
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think it might be something that we look into and, uh, moving this and more of a, um, um,

920
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:17,242
[SPEAKER_18]: strategic way in asking the city administration to assist some of our residents that can't afford to find the masks, that we can help.

921
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:25,229
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that in Somerville, we're distributing over 100,000 masks first to our senior citizen population.

922
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:34,397
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that, unfortunately, the way of the world, being in the recreation world, being in the world of grouping and stuff,

923
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:43,892
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked about today, the state's going to be mandating that we're going to have employees and kids coming to our camps and clinics that it looks like they'll have to be wearing masks.

924
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:47,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately, I think that's just the way of the world.

925
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:57,962
[SPEAKER_18]: So the quicker we as a community understand how serious this is in the sense that it's needed to be safe for yourself and others, I think that

926
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:09,491
[SPEAKER_18]: we need to make a move as a council, hopefully by next week and working with the city administration and our health department that we put some mandates in place.

927
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:12,713
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thank Mr. Von Berg again for bringing this forward.

928
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:24,561
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that I've had some constituents, you know, as we're talking, I was getting texts by one constituent who we love and know, but he's, you know, we're nervous.

929
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:27,743
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that again,

930
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:38,768
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing that as we're going in my field, a lot of it is education and communication so we can go forward with making sure as we live our new life.

931
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:48,781
[SPEAKER_18]: coming forward when we get into phase two and phase three, we all have to understand there are going to be mandated changes that people aren't going to like.

932
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:56,067
[SPEAKER_18]: And whether their freedom has anything to do with it, we have to have mandates in place and rules in place that people have to do it.

933
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,750
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, with the sensitivity that Councilor Morrell spoke of,

934
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:13,194
[SPEAKER_18]: uh having the means to assist those constituents that really don't have a means to get to have them get a mask and um you know as we talked to some of our low-income constituents and

935
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:15,885
[SPEAKER_18]: What one resident told us is easy.

936
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:23,427
[SPEAKER_18]: She actually downloaded a Facebook post to our recreation site and how to make a mask with her T-shirt into elastic.

937
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:25,008
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is effort.

938
01:07:25,448 --> 01:07:39,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there is a way to really accomplish this, but I think this is something that sounds simple, but this has to be a monumental task by all the stakeholders here to start changing our thought process.

939
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:40,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:42,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

941
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:43,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Carvillo?

942
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:46,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

943
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:53,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I've noticed that the biggest violators of this seem to be the food service delivery drivers.

944
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:56,686
[SPEAKER_12]: I see them.

945
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:01,369
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all walking into stores and picking up their orders with no mask and walking right out.

946
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:08,655
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really where I've seen the biggest amount of violations when I'm in these places.

947
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:09,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And these guys just walk in.

948
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:13,018
[SPEAKER_12]: They think because they're only in there for a second that they're OK.

949
01:08:14,077 --> 01:08:19,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I would think that was to be something that the stores need to clamp down.

950
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:22,581
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all these guys, you're not picking your order up until you get a mask on.

951
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:37,073
[SPEAKER_18]: One information, just so I don't forget, Mr. President, I just did get a text that thanks to the mayor, they are providing our seniors with masks.

952
01:08:37,153 --> 01:08:40,855
[SPEAKER_18]: So they've already taken steps in that direction.

953
01:08:40,915 --> 01:08:43,296
[SPEAKER_18]: So kudos to the mayor and the city administration.

954
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:45,117
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the direction we have to go to.

955
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:45,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks.

956
01:08:45,637 --> 01:08:47,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Apologize, Councilor Baez.

957
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:49,920
[SPEAKER_16]: No worries, no worries.

958
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:55,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, if I may really quick, since we have our chief of staff on the line, is there any,

959
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought of mandating this across the board?

960
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, unmute him.

961
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:13,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

962
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:17,502
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still muted.

963
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:19,864
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't a second ago.

964
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:23,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It says mute.

965
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It says he's unmuted on my side.

966
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:30,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean out.

967
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:31,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

968
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:33,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

969
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:45,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we spent an enormous amount of time spot talking on this issue today with the board of the director of public health internally within the mayor's office about what the next step should be because we all talk among cities and towns.

970
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,004
[SPEAKER_05]: among what each other are doing.

971
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:59,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The decision was, we were one of the first, the mayor was one of the first mayors around to sign an order that required face coverings within essential businesses and for essential workers that are there.

972
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:01,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been in place for over two weeks.

973
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:05,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do encourage folks to follow the CDC guidelines.

974
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: that say if you cannot engage with social distancing that you should have a face covering on.

975
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not quite at the point yet where the mayor wants to step into the mandated 100% universal wear policy.

976
01:10:18,903 --> 01:10:19,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli is right.

977
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have an order of masks that are on route.

978
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,166
[SPEAKER_05]: We're waiting to receive them.

979
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:36,435
[SPEAKER_05]: probably tomorrow where we did a regional buy with some other cities and towns in order to supply those, and we're working on a system in order to get those to vulnerable populations as soon as we can.

980
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:39,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do like the clerk's mask.

981
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:46,282
[SPEAKER_05]: He's taking the wear policy very seriously, so kudos to the clerk.

982
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:48,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

983
01:10:48,864 --> 01:10:49,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Beers?

984
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:53,156
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good, thanks.

985
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:54,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Councilor Marra.

986
01:10:55,397 --> 01:10:56,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

987
01:10:56,417 --> 01:11:01,359
[SPEAKER_15]: If Chief of Staff Rodriguez could speak to as far as enforcement of the current orders.

988
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the hardest part.

989
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:10,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So universally, and that's one of the real sticking points when it comes to a mandatory wear policy is enforcement.

990
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:13,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally these orders are all enforced by agents of the Board of Health.

991
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:17,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Board of Health has taken the extraordinary step of like spanning their agents

992
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: making code enforcement agent, building inspectors, all agents of the Board of Health to be able to increase.

993
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,727
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that for different reasons.

994
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: We're involving more safety plans and construction sites.

995
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:32,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But expanding that, the enforcement of these orders is extraordinarily difficult.

996
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to, we get 100 calls and emails a day about people not wearing masks in places.

997
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to see them do it.

998
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to actually engage with them as it's happening.

999
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:45,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, the enforcement is the most challenging part.

1000
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:49,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't want to necessarily put our orders for the sake of putting out orders.

1001
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:58,605
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd rather put out guidance, focus on education, tell folks that this is in their best interest instead of mandating orders that we can't necessarily enforce.

1002
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So our focus, and just like Councilor Scarpelli said, a huge focus on education.

1003
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:10,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You will see this as every part of our messaging going forward, is make sure you have a face covering when you go into a central business.

1004
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:20,362
[SPEAKER_05]: and make sure that you're following CDC guidelines, that if you cannot engage in responsible social distancing, stay more than six feet apart, you should have a face covering on.

1005
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:22,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't necessarily have to be a mask.

1006
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Save the medical grade masks for the first responders.

1007
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:27,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1008
01:12:27,948 --> 01:12:28,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council Member.

1009
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:29,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Member Marks.

1010
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:31,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1011
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:39,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Mr. Varnberg for bringing this issue up, because I know we've all been contacted by Meffitt residents that are equally as concerned.

1012
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:46,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to say over the last three or four weeks, this issue has evolved many times.

1013
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:52,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think originally, if we all remember, the issue was don't wear mask.

1014
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when it first came out, they said mask won't help you.

1015
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:59,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't wear mask and leave the mask for the health care professionals.

1016
01:13:00,163 --> 01:13:09,813
[SPEAKER_06]: the first responders, and then it evolved into, as more information came in, that it is helpful to have a mask and to reduce the risks like Councilor Beers mentioned.

1017
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of misinformation out there that people believe if they, as long as they stay a social distance of six feet, in particular outside, there's no need for a mask.

1018
01:13:21,824 --> 01:13:24,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's where a lot of the misinformation lies.

1019
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:32,354
[SPEAKER_06]: that now that has also evolved and your footprint, so called footprint is left behind.

1020
01:13:33,095 --> 01:13:34,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's critical.

1021
01:13:34,837 --> 01:13:38,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say to that mask is one aspect of PPE.

1022
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:40,062
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also gloves.

1023
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:47,627
[SPEAKER_06]: The disease is transmitted through droplets and so forth, but it's also transmitted through touch.

1024
01:13:48,467 --> 01:14:00,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could be somewhere with a mask on, touch a surface, and then put that fingers to your eyes, to your nose, to your mouth after the fact.

1025
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,031
[SPEAKER_06]: and catch to the disease.

1026
01:14:02,451 --> 01:14:06,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't protect your hands as well as your face, you're equally as vulnerable.

1027
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:09,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever we do, I think we have to look at all aspects.

1028
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my opinion, I think it should be the wearing of gloves as well, the rubber gloves when you're out in public for now.

1029
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:21,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think education, as the chief of staff mentioned,

1030
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,420
[SPEAKER_06]: is extremely important.

1031
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:30,783
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that Councilor Morrell and Councilor Caviello mentioned that not everyone, I had to make homemade face masks.

1032
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:32,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took quite some time to do it.

1033
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:35,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone says, oh, look online, you make a quick, easy one.

1034
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not quick, easy, at least for me.

1035
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:39,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And I consider myself pretty handy.

1036
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:41,307
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not quick and easy.

1037
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:45,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't fit right, they push your nose in, you can't breathe.

1038
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:48,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot more than just making a quick homemade mask.

1039
01:14:49,330 --> 01:15:00,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if we can get these masks out to the general public, like was mentioned in Somerville and so forth, I think that'll go a long way for people that will have them near their front door, like I do.

1040
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:03,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I go out, boom, it goes on automatically because it's right there.

1041
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:07,525
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I didn't have one in the house, who knows?

1042
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:13,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the first thing for prevention is to make sure that these are out there.

1043
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:17,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what we can do to get these masks and rubber gloves out there.

1044
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that should be our first thing.

1045
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the concept of penalizing people, to be quite frank.

1046
01:15:25,261 --> 01:15:29,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some communities of 200, 300 old fines for not wearing a mask.

1047
01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:32,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that concept.

1048
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:38,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you have to get people to comply in a way that you reason with them and say, hey, you know what?

1049
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,314
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a concern for safety, concern for health.

1050
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:54,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're hearing over in England and so forth that they're saying that kids are coming down with some sort of disease from the COVID that they didn't

1051
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:55,944
[SPEAKER_06]: think they were susceptible to.

1052
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,366
[SPEAKER_06]: This is brand new and they're starting to get cases over there.

1053
01:16:00,266 --> 01:16:03,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear animals now, dogs, cats, you know.

1054
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:09,097
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something that we really have to take the initiative.

1055
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:16,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally think it should be done through an executive order, because I think that's the way it should be initiated from the governor on down.

1056
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:21,903
[SPEAKER_06]: If the governor decides not to do it, then it's up to local cities and towns to take the responsibility.

1057
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:32,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to see the mayor take, I know she's taken a lot of leadership on this, but I think the next logical step is to mandate that if you're out, that you should wear a mask.

1058
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:38,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you're talking about enforcement, do we have the capability of enforcing it?

1059
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:41,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, but I think you'll see people comply.

1060
01:16:42,628 --> 01:16:48,591
[SPEAKER_06]: if, you know, they're reasoned with and provided the mask.

1061
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my two cents, Mr. President.

1062
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:52,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilman Knox, thank you very much.

1063
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:56,215
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. Bob Byrd, thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

1064
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:57,875
[SPEAKER_16]: A very important issue.

1065
01:16:58,496 --> 01:17:06,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I know myself, I carry a mask wherever I go, you know, and I would recommend the same for everyone and anyone that's out there.

1066
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:12,189
[SPEAKER_16]: always have a mask nearby, extremely valuable to have to prevent the spread.

1067
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:14,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott probably would like to speak.

1068
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:15,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Just real quick.

1069
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,732
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that Councilor Mox brought it up with the gloves.

1070
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:31,438
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that, I also want to, let's educate the public in understanding that those people that are wearing the gloves and then they discard it all over the streets, have a little compassion for the people that are cleaning those, picking those gloves up because

1071
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:45,514
[SPEAKER_18]: You're putting their lives in danger and catching the virus too if you can't do something simple as take the gloves off like I do and as you leave, put them into a dispenser or take them home and throw them in the garbage.

1072
01:17:45,554 --> 01:17:48,738
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're seeing too many left all over the streets.

1073
01:17:51,327 --> 01:18:00,337
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't care about what it looks like in your community, at least have a little compassion and understanding that the people that are picking those up, you might be putting them in harm's way.

1074
01:18:00,918 --> 01:18:02,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how you have to look at things.

1075
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,021
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to add to that.

1076
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:06,444
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my two cents, Mr. President.

1077
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:06,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1078
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:08,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

1079
01:18:09,528 --> 01:18:10,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, Matt Hughes.

1080
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:16,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1081
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:21,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to speak on a few points.

1082
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:30,000
[SPEAKER_11]: In response to Councilor Mark's proposal that gloves should potentially be required, I wanted to oppose that.

1083
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Gloves are substantially like

1084
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:42,769
[SPEAKER_11]: To tie this back to something that Councilor Morrell said earlier in the evening, the accessibility of gloves is substantially less than facial coverings.

1085
01:18:42,949 --> 01:18:48,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be much, much harder to be able to provide folks gloves.

1086
01:18:49,073 --> 01:18:53,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, gloves are really helpful for preventing cross-contamination of different

1087
01:18:56,305 --> 01:19:10,094
[SPEAKER_11]: different things, but hand-washing may be a better way, and educating the public about the importance of hand-washing may be a more effective means of preventing the concern that you bring up around surfaces.

1088
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:17,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to address Councillor Karygiela.

1089
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I sympathize with your having seen

1090
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:29,027
[SPEAKER_11]: uh folks who are who are delivering food and having to experience that really counterintuitive like Really?

1091
01:19:29,107 --> 01:19:49,643
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not gonna protect uh protect other the people who you're delivering food for uh by keeping yourself from uh by wearing a mask yourself um I also wanted to to bring up that i've i've also seen uh members of the medford police department uh out directing traffic and not wearing masks and that I had a similar reaction of saying like

1092
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:50,783
[SPEAKER_11]: really?

1093
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this actually promoting public safety?

1094
01:19:53,884 --> 01:20:05,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So the third point that I wanted to make is that if we wanted to act on this like more quickly or more concisely, like focusing... What information, Mr. President?

1095
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:19,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate Mr. Hughes bringing that up, but I think the police are a little bit different when you're talking about if they're in a traffic situation where they need to direct people in a safety situation, that they have to know who they're directing.

1096
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:21,551
[SPEAKER_18]: the conversation, too.

1097
01:20:21,591 --> 01:20:25,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important that we understand that, too, as a community.

1098
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:25,715
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1099
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:29,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt Hughes, please continue.

1100
01:20:30,178 --> 01:20:42,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just wanted to propose that requiring the use of masks among public safety personnel may be a quicker and easier thing than doing a full mandate.

1101
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:44,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1102
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:45,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:20:45,972 --> 01:20:46,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1104
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:52,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, any further comments on public participation?

1105
01:20:52,745 --> 01:20:54,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1106
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I see John Costas.

1107
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm making my way with it now.

1108
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:03,653
[SPEAKER_16]: John Costas.

1109
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:08,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1110
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:12,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, can you hear me?

1111
01:21:13,392 --> 01:21:14,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can.

1112
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:15,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good evening.

1113
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:17,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, just a quick note about the gloves.

1114
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:19,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to them.

1115
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:25,516
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you want to have gloves on anybody, you need to do the proper training.

1116
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:28,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been watching people with gloves.

1117
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:30,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of useless.

1118
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:34,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a restaurant, and I'm not going to tell you which restaurant I was in.

1119
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:40,700
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were handing money and product and dealing with customers with the same set of gloves.

1120
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:46,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people with gloves outside and they just touch everything.

1121
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:51,766
[SPEAKER_00]: They touch their car and they take their gloves off and they touch the car again.

1122
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:56,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So the transfer or whatever is kind of like, what is the point of gloves?

1123
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:05,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're going to touch something, take them off, throw them away, put on a fresh pair of gloves, touch something and get rid of them.

1124
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:07,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with somebody that said,

1125
01:22:08,432 --> 01:22:16,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't, what I like to do is when I'm handling food and stuff is I just have the clean, the disinfectant with me.

1126
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:22,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I want to touch something, I clean my hands first, touch it, then clean my hands again.

1127
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:25,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it beats some gloves away.

1128
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:33,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to push gloves onto people, I think you need to push the education, the proper use of gloves.

1129
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:34,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1130
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:34,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1131
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:36,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1132
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Mr. Von Berg, thank you for bringing that forward tonight.

1133
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:39,952
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

1134
01:22:43,995 --> 01:22:45,156

1136
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, I misplaced that page of the agenda once again.

1158
01:23:53,725 --> 01:23:59,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we adjourn, I'm just gonna read a quick announcement that came in just as we started the meeting from the DCR.

1159
01:24:01,992 --> 01:24:04,915
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a DCR traffic advisory for Fellsway West.

[SPEAKER_16]: Francis Street outbound in I-93 and Salem Street inbound to accommodate paving operations

1162
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:35,444
[SPEAKER_16]: During this time, work will fluctuate between day and evening operations.

1163
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:43,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, a police detail will be on site, traffic patterns will be marked, and signage regarding parking restrictions will be posted.

1164
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:51,054
[SPEAKER_16]: This will be from Monday, May 4th, 2020 through Thursday, June 11th, excluding weekends.

1165
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:52,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Bellsway West.

1166
01:24:53,478 --> 01:24:56,140
[SPEAKER_16]: the city of Medford from Salem Street to St.

1167
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:02,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Francis Street that's going outbound and inbound it's going to be I-93 to Salem Street inbound.

1168
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:06,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So just to let everyone know that came in just as we started the meeting tonight.

1169
01:25:09,391 --> 01:25:19,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, so as we adjourn this meeting tonight, we're going to adjourn the meeting in the memory of Jimmy Maturano who passed away recently and those that have

1170
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:23,116
[SPEAKER_16]: passed away to the COVID-19 virus.

1171
01:25:23,356 --> 01:25:23,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President?

1172
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:25,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1173
01:25:26,138 --> 01:25:33,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, we do have Neil Osborne that's joining us and maybe he can give us just a brief overview of the census.

1174
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:38,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Neil, if I may.

1175
01:25:38,068 --> 01:25:38,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Neil, are you there?

1176
01:25:40,075 --> 01:25:50,997
[SPEAKER_16]: I mentioned earlier in the meeting when this came up that we had tried to schedule a committee of the whole to discuss it, and then all of a sudden COVID-19 happened.

1177
01:25:51,397 --> 01:26:00,199
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll probably still schedule a committee of the whole just because I'm sure there'll probably be plenty of questions once you get going.

1178
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:03,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Amy, if you want to make a quick comment, that's fine.

1179
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:09,859
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the Committee of the Whole will probably be better for a more robust discussion, I guess.

1180
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:10,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

1181
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:22,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the quick comment I will make is it's helpful for you as city councilors to mention to residents the importance of getting it done early, because if people fill it out early, no one comes to knock on their door.

1182
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:28,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But please invite me back, Committee of the Whole, when we have a chance to answer questions and let you know how we're doing.

1183
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:29,757
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll do it sooner than later.

1184
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:34,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll send you an email tonight and we'll coordinate a time and we'll move forward on this as soon as possible.

1185
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

1186
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:36,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1187
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1188
01:26:41,844 --> 01:26:45,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Hertoghese, if we could please take the vote to adjourn the meeting.

1189
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:50,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. President, we need a motion and a second to adjourn.

1190
01:26:50,349 --> 01:26:50,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we do.

1192
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:57,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll.

1193
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:00,068
[SPEAKER_04]: This is to adjourn.

[SPEAKER_04]: That's a night.

1199
01:27:10,114 --> 01:27:11,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's dropped off.

01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Council marks.

[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Council.

1206
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:24,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Adam did text me, he lost his service, so.

1207
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:24,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
