36
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

37
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the phone?

38
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:37,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, as myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner, along with Alicia Hunt, who's the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

39
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that is all of us tonight.

40
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:46,837
[SPEAKER_06]: My graduate student intern now has a conflict with class, so he won't be joining us on evening CS class.

41
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:50,258
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be watching them.

42
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:53,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he'll still be doing them, so after the fact.

43
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:10,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Our first item is approval not required for review, seven grant F. I'm going to invite the proponent to present their plans for the log division.

44
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:18,970
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, if the city can actually set us up with this, and then the proponent can go ahead and continue.

45
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so this is, we've had several of these lately.

46
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:46,128
[SPEAKER_06]: an approval not required under subdivision control law, which basically says if the lock division meets the criteria to be divided, then the community development board acting as the planning board is required to endorse it.

47
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:51,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the questions you have to ask is, does it front on a right of way?

48
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it satisfy the minimum frontage?

49
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,132
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, it's 35 feet.

50
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: and is there adequacy of access?

51
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:06,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the criteria in which to review this.

52
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:21,591
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing to note is that the second lot to be created will actually be undersized, but that is not a reason to not endorse it, strangely enough.

53
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will be going to the zoning board

54
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:31,804
[SPEAKER_06]: for a variance for minimum lot size if they choose to develop that second parcel.

55
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:43,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So approval not required as reviewed by the board, we are to make sure that it meets certain criteria in which one of the criteria it does not meet as of yet.

56
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that my current correct understanding?

57
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I believe that it

58
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,581
[SPEAKER_06]: clearly meets the first two.

59
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:56,364
[SPEAKER_06]: The third one is the only one that's subjective, and I don't see why it's not met.

60
00:04:56,424 --> 00:05:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have access, adequate access from the right of way.

61
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:14,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I understand it, it meets all of our criteria, but it may, it needs a zoning variance to do something else with it along the line, but it doesn't, it meets all the criteria for the ANR.

62
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so endorsement isn't,

63
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:25,655
[SPEAKER_06]: basically an endorsement doesn't give them a variance and endorsement doesn't say that this needs zoning now.

64
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:35,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a oddity of Massachusetts subdivision law since we adopted it and didn't opt out.

65
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:44,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Still wanna look into how we can opt out so that we can just have these done by the planning director signing off.

66
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Either here or there.

67
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Attorney Cabral is here.

68
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Cabral, do you wish to share your screen or do you wish I could share my screen?

69
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fine, if you want to share your screen.

70
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

71
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:11,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you're doing that, I'm Attorney Michael Cabral on behalf of the applicant and homeowners, Michael and Elaine Orahan, 7 Grant Ave.

72
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:17,909
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see here in a second, they have a pre-existing lot that they are dividing in two.

73
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:26,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Can folks see this?

74
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So total lot area right now, the existing lot is 9,500.

75
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They're splitting the lot in two.

76
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot one is on the left side of our screen.

77
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot two is on the right-hand side of the screen.

78
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:51,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot one would be a conforming lot in that it's 5,000 square feet and meets the minimum frontage of 35 feet.

79
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 50 feet.

80
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The new lot, the lot in question for A&R approval, is lot two on the right-hand side here.

81
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,454
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 4,500 square feet of lot area.

82
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It does meet the minimum frontage.

83
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,457
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 45 feet of frontage.

84
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:16,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, it's located on Grand Ave, which is a public way, so satisfies both frontage and, I would argue, adequacy of way.

85
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:25,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Grand Ave is, again, a public way and currently paved, so suitable for vehicular travel as the law requires.

86
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:34,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as mentioned here and above Danielle, it does actually, some surveyors used to put on

87
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,152
[SPEAKER_01]: The zoning criteria, some did not boards were welcome to put on that.

88
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:45,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not quote a buildable lot until it met zoning requirements.

89
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:53,797
[SPEAKER_01]: This has actually already been laid out on a table at the top of this plan, which does show as the board mentioned that if.

90
00:07:54,417 --> 00:08:04,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Our clients would like to build on lot to the lot in question that it would require approvals from the zoning board for both lot area.

91
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1st criteria there, it is 2 asterisks next to it in a lot with as well.

92
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:13,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Short by 6.4 feet on lot with as well.

93
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So to, um.

94
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:32,916
[SPEAKER_01]: to issues of non-conformity, but in terms of the issue here this evening of A&R approval, again, we do satisfy minimum frontage, adequacy of the way, and that it's on a public way and paved for vehicular travel.

95
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to answer any questions any members of the board might have.

96
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:38,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

97
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:39,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Heidi Cabral.

98
00:08:44,772 --> 00:09:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And Madam Chair, through the chair, I just wanted to flag one more potential zoning violation you might need to address, and that's the proposed parking area that appears to be front yard parking, because if it's in front of the structure.

99
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:08,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's where the structure ends up going, then that could be an issue.

100
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

101
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:10,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We've noted that as well.

102
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:16,701
[SPEAKER_01]: This may not be the final location of both the building or the proposed parking.

103
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:23,767
[SPEAKER_01]: This surveyor does show a 20 foot curb cut, but that may not be where the parking actually goes.

104
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:31,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It may run down what I would call the side of the new lot, which would have a 20 foot drive aisle as well.

105
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

106
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions from the board at this time?

107
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:58,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So, based on the presentation by Attorney Cabral and Planner Evans has stated that it meets minimum percentage.

108
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,541
[SPEAKER_07]: There is adequacy.

109
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:08,764
[SPEAKER_07]: of the right of way, and as of right now, there's vital access to the lots provided by Parkin.

110
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So it meets all of the board's criteria.

111
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:22,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I will put forth a motion to approve 7-Grant-F for approval not required, or to recommend, is it adopt?

112
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:23,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Endorse.

113
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll endorse the plan as approval not required.

114
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Endorse the plan.

115
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Approval is not required.

116
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So much.

117
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:40,888
[SPEAKER_07]: A second motion.

118
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:42,349
[SPEAKER_07]: A second.

119
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do a roll call.

120
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice chair and we had him in.

121
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,591

[SPEAKER_07]: Annie Strain?

128
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:05,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

129
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:14,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a quorum, so in this case, Ben Lovalli would not be voting, is that correct Danielle?

130
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,687
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he can vote.

131
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:16,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

132
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,308
[SPEAKER_07]: He can vote, yeah.

133
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:21,188

00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:48,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

149
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:49,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

150
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:50,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

151
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:50,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

152
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,769
[SPEAKER_07]: The next item is approval of minutes.

153
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess we can just ask for approval of all of us.

154
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:05,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone has any objections or any corrections to any of the minutes?

155
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have one, it was minor.

156
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:22,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was the very first one and it has like typos or something like, it was an approval not required, it was an original approval not required and it was supposed to be, it says nor, nor required.

157
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiny little typos, if the city can actually look over those.

158
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would give a motion with those typos being corrected.

159
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:33,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was the June 5th meeting?

160
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, sorry for some reason,

161
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yep, I see it.

162
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll fix that.

163
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,495
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only thing that I caught.

164
00:12:55,384 --> 00:13:06,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I will go through and ask for a motion for May 5th and May 25th because at that point,

165
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:16,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe only myself, Vice Chair Hedeman, Peter Kaus, and Ari Fishman are eligible to vote on those two.

166
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:26,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would need a motion from either Vice Chair Emily Hedeman, Peter Kaus, Ari Fishman.

167
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion.

168
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:31,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

169
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:32,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

170
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's for both May 5th and May 25th.

171
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:41,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll do a roll call for ourselves.

172
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

173
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:43,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

174
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:45,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowes?

175
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:49,588
[SPEAKER_07]: He's muted.

176
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:52,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

177
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, missed the button.

178
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:56,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

179
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:57,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

180
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

181
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:00,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

182
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:14,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I will ask for a motion for July 17, 2024, which myself, vice-chair Emily Hutterman, Sabrina Alpino, Peter DeKalb, and Ari Fishman are eligible to vote.

183
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:21,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would ask- Both those sets of meetings have the same- Actually, yes.

184
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,737
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be July 17th and August 7th, 2024.

185
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would need a motion.

186
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:32,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

187
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

188
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Emily can have it.

189
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,402
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of competition today.

190
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

191
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:43,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

192
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:44,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Sabrina Alpino?

193
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:45,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

194
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:46,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Kiles?

195
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:47,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

196
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

197
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:50,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

198
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

199
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

200
00:14:54,043 --> 00:15:02,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And the third item on our list this evening, zoning overall updates are Alicia, Danielle, do you have any updates for us?

201
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't really have any updates.

202
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:17,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just tell you that we have been working through things like a green score for the city and, um, uh,

203
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't looked at design requirements, but we've looked at incentive zoning.

204
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:33,560
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be you're allowed to do this much density, and if you do additional affordable housing, you can get more density, stuff like that.

205
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working through those.

206
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,162
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions that came from the consultants should,

207
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:45,844
[SPEAKER_02]: design guidelines be part of zoning or something that's adopted by the CD board.

208
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:50,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And my recommendation is that that's adopted by the CD board.

209
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:55,857
[SPEAKER_02]: But I asked them if because they were going to kind of go hand in hand with the new zoning.

210
00:15:56,598 --> 00:16:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: If they could present both of them at the same time, so that they would actually come to this board and the city council together at the same time.

211
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:08,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we're recommending for design guidelines.

212
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's what we're recommending for the for the zoning.

213
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Design guidelines would be adopted by this board.

214
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:19,567
[SPEAKER_02]: but the zoning would be recommended by this board and adopted by the council.

215
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We are pushing those through together.

216
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:28,214
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives us more flexibility in design guidelines, so it doesn't have to go through a full zoning process.

217
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Things change and we want to have that changed.

218
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So those we are expecting drafts of those to be coming in September.

219
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:43,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually will tell you that I just received I had mentioned wanting to get files up on the website.

220
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:47,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got most of those from the zoning consultant today.

221
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping over the next few days to get those.

222
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're talking about needing a web page to put this.

223
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we do have a page from the Medford Comprehensive Plan that I'm thinking maybe we should then just actually update that to include the stuff that's coming through the zoning.

224
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to include links to the zoning meetings we've been having.

225
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to tell you guys that stuff was there.

226
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:23,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody has any questions or anything that has come up since the last time we were talking about stuff, I'm happy to answer questions.

227
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's really all I have this evening.

228
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,438
[SPEAKER_07]: The design guidelines, how would those be construed?

229
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Will we be working with a consultant or is that something done internally?

230
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:34,243
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that work?

231
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:41,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know we started this process a couple of years back when we did the zoning recodification and we didn't pick up on it.

232
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to figure out how we will move forward this time.

233
00:17:44,319 --> 00:18:03,190
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, the zoning consultant is prepared to provide us with recommended guidelines specifically for Medford, which was actually kind of the problem with the recodification that that consultant was giving us like, here's like a straw man, a stick man kind of thing.

234
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you guys make it Medford specific.

235
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: These consultants have been hired because they did our comprehensive plan.

236
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: They have talked to Medford residents and developers, and they're prepared to say, here's what we think would work in Medford.

237
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:30,399
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope is that by the time you guys get it, you'll just want little tweaks, but you'll look at it and go, wow, this was done by somebody who understands our city.

238
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,020
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to staying like, oh my gosh, now we have a lot of work in front of us.

239
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

240
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Alicia.

241
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask for a motion.

242
00:18:52,512 --> 00:19:05,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's nothing else, if there's no support, has no questions, new members, anyone you want, this is your open time before we actually ask for a motion to adjourn.

243
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:07,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any questions?

244
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:13,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, just taking it in and getting comfortable with how the meetings go.

245
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

246
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

247
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's the calm before a storm.

248
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take it.

249
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take it.

250
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:26,425
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who works on the consulting side of some of these projects, we're starting to get the storm on our end.

251
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:30,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of months.

252
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of traffic requests I sent out today.

253
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're ready for more development now that we've opened the Great American Beer Hall.

254
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,152
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ready.

255
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it open?

256
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open.

257
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

258
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:50,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at capacity all day on Saturday from noon through like closing.

259
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a line almost all the time and they were letting people in as people left.

260
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I swung by on Saturday.

261
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to come in and then I just

262
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, I just scratched that.

263
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, it's too packed.

264
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to pitch.

265
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't drink beer.

266
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:11,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a reason just to go and see, you know, hang out and have a great time.

267
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:11,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

268
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So patronize my foot.

269
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: They have wine and cider too.

270
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they do.

271
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:19,361
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.

272
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,542
[SPEAKER_02]: They are in the bar.

273
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:23,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

274
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a full bar, mixed drinks.

275
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:26,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

276
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,144
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

277
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:30,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The other place in West Med for,

278
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,191
[SPEAKER_04]: near the train station.

279
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,162
[SPEAKER_04]: This place has everything.

280
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's I will say it is lovely.

281
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: They are operating under a temp operating permit, because there are a few things they still need to complete for the city.

282
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,531
[SPEAKER_02]: The road in front dot they're still making some dot stormwater connections.

283
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:56,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're still the elevator, there's a lift to the second floor that hasn't arrived.

284
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:01,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second floor is closed, they do not have occupancy permit for the second floor.

285
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:03,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And like they don't have their

286
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm railing around the balcony of the deck.

287
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:14,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't obviously you can't go on the second floor and you can't use the deck yet.

288
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:16,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is coming.

289
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still expanding their menu.

290
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:23,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for the food, um, but, and, but I want to pass along something.

291
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brian, you will remember was here a couple of times.

292
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things he said to me on Saturday was, you know what, Alicia, I did not want to put in bike parking and you made me do it.

293
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were right.

294
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how full that bike parking is.

295
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So just passing along that that was, that was a community development board thing was to put in the bike parking.

296
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:47,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.

297
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:55,056
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very happy and in fact, he's getting pressure to put in more bike parking because it was so full.

298
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if it continues to stay full.

299
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have EV stations?

300
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have EV?

301
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:02,627
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

302
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:07,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's putting solar on the building.

303
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:31,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We required a solar assessment, and that was so, the proposal he got was so favorable to him that he is actually not only putting solar on this building, but they own property down near Patriot's Place, and he's looking to put solar, like a solar farm there, and then make his properties up here the offtakers for it.

304
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was pretty cool.

305
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,673
[SPEAKER_02]: But he sent me the interconnection agreement to National Grid.

306
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:43,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the paperwork that he needs to do with the utility to put solar on.

307
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know he's serious.

308
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping he'll put EV in so that he puts good foot forward on that.

309
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

310
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did not because there's such

311
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this project was a real shoestring.

312
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if you might remember that I came to the board, I talked to his banker and then I came to the board and said, like, I talked with her.

313
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:14,842
[SPEAKER_02]: She was at his soft opening Thursday night and I got to meet her in person.

314
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:17,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said she was like, it was a really good experience.

315
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was glad that she had talked to me about that project.

316
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:26,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was lovely in the future for the next phase of improvements that he puts in.

317
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:29,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really important to the community.

318
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:30,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

319
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: The BJs, we asked for EV in addition with the gas station.

320
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:41,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't think this board required it.

321
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:44,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when he went to city council, they said they were doing it.

322
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have four stations that have gone in.

323
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gone over, they're not open yet.

324
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still fenced off.

325
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But from my experience, they look like high speed stations.

326
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:59,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they don't look like basic little level two stations.

327
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to see what goes in at BJ's.

328
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:09,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Great American Beer Hall, did they come in before the specialized stretch code?

329
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:10,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why they don't?

330
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:13,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Long before it, that only kicked in this summer.

331
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:23,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's how, because yeah, now you have to have at least EV ready spaces now, they go in just before.

332
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:33,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And that project was on such a shoestring to get in there that we did not require of that one.

333
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:45,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to note that board member Adam Barons have joined us and thank you so much for joining us, Adam.

334
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:50,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam, I want to let you know that we have another new board member that joined us this evening, Ben Lavallee.

335
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Ben, welcome.

336
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:58,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Adam, look forward to working with you.

337
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:10,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that actually, oh and one other thing Adam, there was a note that Alicia and Danielle had suggested that we all send our cell phones to

338
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:26,558
[SPEAKER_07]: to them so that they can compile it in case we're running late or anything, and they'll know that we, they'll reach out and see if we're coming to the meeting or whatever, so that they actually have that and we're not waiting, going forward.

339
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:32,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not so much just because, not because of your tonight, it's just to have it overall.

340
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:38,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes we don't even know who's waiting in the waiting room if it's a phone number, so we try to match it.

341
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:39,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cool.

342
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:40,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

343
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:41,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

344
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,319
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's really short meeting.

345
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

346
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:53,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion.

347
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:58,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

348
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:07,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome, then I'm going to do a roll call since my document of names opens back up.

349
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think I have it memorized.

350
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:13,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go on Jackie, you've got it.
