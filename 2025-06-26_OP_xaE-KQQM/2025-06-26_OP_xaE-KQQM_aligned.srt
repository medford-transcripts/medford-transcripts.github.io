00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:03,695
Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Metro Community Development Board.

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:05,217
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

4
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:13,166
This hearing of the Metro Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:23,774
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

6
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:34,343
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included in the meeting agenda posted on the City of Medford's website.

7
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:42,610
If despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

8
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:48,375
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:59,965
Please note that the project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, methodma.org, and you can click on current city board filings.

10
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:01,767
You can also find the link in the chat.

11
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:13,623
For starters, we want to offer one welcome to Ben Lavely, who is our new associate alternate member and can fully participate in meetings and deliberations.

12
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:14,884
Welcome, Ben.

13
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:19,908
Thank you so much.

14
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,128
I'm excited to be part of this.

15
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,209
I appreciate it.

16
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,411
It's a pleasure having you.

17
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:25,812
Thank you for joining us.

18
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:35,512
Just to note, as an associate member, Ben is eligible to vote when there are fewer than seven members present and eligible to vote.

19
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:40,194
Again, thanks for joining us, and we look forward to working with you.

20
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,856
I'm going to do a roll call of attendance.

21
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:44,777
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

22
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:46,518
Present.

23
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,019
Peter Cowes?

24
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:49,639
Present.

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,100
Ari Fishman?

26
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,081
Present.

27
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,822
Sabrina Alpino?

28
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:55,983
Present.

29
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:58,368
Adam Behrens?

30
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:06,732
No, Adam.

31
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:08,433
Annie Strang?

32
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:09,574
Present.

33
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:11,835
Ben Lavallee?

34
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:16,877
Present, minor pronunciation correction, it's Lavallee.

35
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:19,499
Lavallee, Ben Lavallee, thank you.

36
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,420
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

37
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,348
Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the phone?

38
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:37,052
Yes, as myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner, along with Alicia Hunt, who's the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

39
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:39,513
And I believe that is all of us tonight.

40
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:46,837
My graduate student intern now has a conflict with class, so he won't be joining us on evening CS class.

41
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:50,258
He'll be watching them.

42
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:53,580
I think he'll still be doing them, so after the fact.

43
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:10,083
Our first item is approval not required for review, seven grant F. I'm going to invite the proponent to present their plans for the log division.

44
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:18,970
But first, if the city can actually set us up with this, and then the proponent can go ahead and continue.

45
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,874
Yes, so this is, we've had several of these lately.

46
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:46,128
an approval not required under subdivision control law, which basically says if the lock division meets the criteria to be divided, then the community development board acting as the planning board is required to endorse it.

47
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:51,651
And that's the questions you have to ask is, does it front on a right of way?

48
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,632
Does it satisfy the minimum frontage?

49
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,132
In this case, it's 35 feet.

50
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,555
and is there adequacy of access?

51
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:06,161
So those are the criteria in which to review this.

52
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:21,591
One thing to note is that the second lot to be created will actually be undersized, but that is not a reason to not endorse it, strangely enough.

53
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,173
So this will be going to the zoning board

54
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:31,804
for a variance for minimum lot size if they choose to develop that second parcel.

55
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:43,747
So approval not required as reviewed by the board, we are to make sure that it meets certain criteria in which one of the criteria it does not meet as of yet.

56
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,067
Is that my current correct understanding?

57
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,208
I mean, I believe that it

58
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,581
clearly meets the first two.

59
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:56,364
The third one is the only one that's subjective, and I don't see why it's not met.

60
00:04:56,424 --> 00:05:02,548
It doesn't have access, adequate access from the right of way.

61
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:14,976
Yeah, if I understand it, it meets all of our criteria, but it may, it needs a zoning variance to do something else with it along the line, but it doesn't, it meets all the criteria for the ANR.

62
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,478
Yeah, so endorsement isn't,

63
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:25,655
basically an endorsement doesn't give them a variance and endorsement doesn't say that this needs zoning now.

64
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:35,457
It's a oddity of Massachusetts subdivision law since we adopted it and didn't opt out.

65
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:44,180
Still wanna look into how we can opt out so that we can just have these done by the planning director signing off.

66
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:47,961
Either here or there.

67
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,279
So, Attorney Cabral is here.

68
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:55,301
Attorney Cabral, do you wish to share your screen or do you wish I could share my screen?

69
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,382
That would be fine, if you want to share your screen.

70
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:00,062
Okay.

71
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:11,747
And while you're doing that, I'm Attorney Michael Cabral on behalf of the applicant and homeowners, Michael and Elaine Orahan, 7 Grant Ave.

72
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:17,909
You'll see here in a second, they have a pre-existing lot that they are dividing in two.

73
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:26,272
Can folks see this?

74
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,938
So total lot area right now, the existing lot is 9,500.

75
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,840
They're splitting the lot in two.

76
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,801
Lot one is on the left side of our screen.

77
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,602
Lot two is on the right-hand side of the screen.

78
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:51,447
Lot one would be a conforming lot in that it's 5,000 square feet and meets the minimum frontage of 35 feet.

79
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,428
It has 50 feet.

80
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:59,272
The new lot, the lot in question for A&R approval, is lot two on the right-hand side here.

81
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,454
It has 4,500 square feet of lot area.

82
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,716
It does meet the minimum frontage.

83
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,457
It has 45 feet of frontage.

84
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:16,424
Additionally, it's located on Grand Ave, which is a public way, so satisfies both frontage and, I would argue, adequacy of way.

85
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:25,411
Grand Ave is, again, a public way and currently paved, so suitable for vehicular travel as the law requires.

86
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:34,318
Also, as mentioned here and above Danielle, it does actually, some surveyors used to put on

87
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,152
The zoning criteria, some did not boards were welcome to put on that.

88
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:45,153
It was not quote a buildable lot until it met zoning requirements.

89
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:53,797
This has actually already been laid out on a table at the top of this plan, which does show as the board mentioned that if.

90
00:07:54,417 --> 00:08:04,264
Our clients would like to build on lot to the lot in question that it would require approvals from the zoning board for both lot area.

91
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:09,728
The 1st criteria there, it is 2 asterisks next to it in a lot with as well.

92
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:13,871
Short by 6.4 feet on lot with as well.

93
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,532
So to, um.

94
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:32,916
to issues of non-conformity, but in terms of the issue here this evening of A&R approval, again, we do satisfy minimum frontage, adequacy of the way, and that it's on a public way and paved for vehicular travel.

95
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,119
And I'm happy to answer any questions any members of the board might have.

96
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:38,961
Thank you.

97
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:39,722
It's Heidi Cabral.

98
00:08:44,772 --> 00:09:00,862
And Madam Chair, through the chair, I just wanted to flag one more potential zoning violation you might need to address, and that's the proposed parking area that appears to be front yard parking, because if it's in front of the structure.

99
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:08,006
So if that's where the structure ends up going, then that could be an issue.

100
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:10,015
Thank you.

101
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:10,956
We've noted that as well.

102
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:16,701
This may not be the final location of both the building or the proposed parking.

103
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:23,767
This surveyor does show a 20 foot curb cut, but that may not be where the parking actually goes.

104
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:31,294
It may run down what I would call the side of the new lot, which would have a 20 foot drive aisle as well.

105
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,293
Thank you.

106
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,474
Are there any questions from the board at this time?

107
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:58,621
So, based on the presentation by Attorney Cabral and Planner Evans has stated that it meets minimum percentage.

108
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,541
There is adequacy.

109
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:08,764
of the right of way, and as of right now, there's vital access to the lots provided by Parkin.

110
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,627
So it meets all of the board's criteria.

111
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:22,072
I will put forth a motion to approve 7-Grant-F for approval not required, or to recommend, is it adopt?

112
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:23,713
Endorse.

113
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,875
So you'll endorse the plan as approval not required.

114
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,017
Endorse the plan.

115
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,847
Approval is not required.

116
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,307
So much.

117
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:40,888
A second motion.

118
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:42,349
A second.

119
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,049
I'm going to do a roll call.

120
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,630
Vice chair and we had him in.

121
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,591
I Peter cows.

122
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,111
I re fisherman.

123
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:56,572
I Sabrina Alpino.

124
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,732
All right.

125
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:00,573
Adam burns.

126
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:02,922
Still not here.

127
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:04,663
Annie Strain?

128
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:05,923
Aye.

129
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:14,446
And we have a quorum, so in this case, Ben Lovalli would not be voting, is that correct Danielle?

130
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,687
No, he can vote.

131
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:16,687
Okay.

132
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,308
He can vote, yeah.

133
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:21,188
Ben Lovalli.

134
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:22,029
Aye.

135
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,470
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

136
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,536
Thank you so much, Attorney Brown.

137
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:31,376
Thank you.

138
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,358
Have a great evening.

139
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:34,238
You as well.

140
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:34,718
Take care.

141
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:35,239
Thank you.

142
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,701
And I'll have Alicia sign the Mylar before we leave the building.

143
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,282
So it'll be available for you to pick up.

144
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:42,162
Great.

145
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:42,623
Thank you.

146
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:45,965
We have another one right behind us, so I'll pick it up and file another with you.

147
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,046
Thanks everyone.

148
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:48,426
Good night.

149
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:49,627
Good night.

150
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:50,367
Thank you.

151
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:50,847
Thanks.

152
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,769
The next item is approval of minutes.

153
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,513
And I guess we can just ask for approval of all of us.

154
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:05,002
Anyone has any objections or any corrections to any of the minutes?

155
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,017
I did have one, it was minor.

156
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:22,362
I believe it was the very first one and it has like typos or something like, it was an approval not required, it was an original approval not required and it was supposed to be, it says nor, nor required.

157
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,904
Tiny little typos, if the city can actually look over those.

158
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,605
And I would give a motion with those typos being corrected.

159
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:33,007
So it was the June 5th meeting?

160
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:37,589
I believe, sorry for some reason,

161
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,272
Oh, yep, I see it.

162
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,073
I'll fix that.

163
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,495
That was the only thing that I caught.

164
00:12:55,384 --> 00:13:06,792
Actually, I will go through and ask for a motion for May 5th and May 25th because at that point,

165
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:16,880
I believe only myself, Vice Chair Hedeman, Peter Kaus, and Ari Fishman are eligible to vote on those two.

166
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:26,706
So I would need a motion from either Vice Chair Emily Hedeman, Peter Kaus, Ari Fishman.

167
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,007
I'll make the motion.

168
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:31,409
Second.

169
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:32,690
Thank you.

170
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,871
And that's for both May 5th and May 25th.

171
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:41,421
I guess I'll do a roll call for ourselves.

172
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,162
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

173
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:43,983
Aye.

174
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:45,424
Peter Cowes?

175
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:49,588
He's muted.

176
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:52,611
Aye.

177
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,873
Sorry, missed the button.

178
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:56,996
Ari Fishman?

179
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:57,856
Aye.

180
00:13:58,677 --> 00:13:59,958
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

181
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:00,159
Aye.

182
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:14,692
And then I will ask for a motion for July 17, 2024, which myself, vice-chair Emily Hutterman, Sabrina Alpino, Peter DeKalb, and Ari Fishman are eligible to vote.

183
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:21,475
And I would ask- Both those sets of meetings have the same- Actually, yes.

184
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,737
This would be July 17th and August 7th, 2024.

185
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,576
And I would need a motion.

186
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:32,777
Okay.

187
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,338
I'll second.

188
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, Emily can have it.

189
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,402
A lot of competition today.

190
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,965
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

191
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:43,026
Aye.

192
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:44,668
Sabrina Alpino?

193
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:45,549
Aye.

194
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:46,810
Peter Kiles?

195
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:47,791
Aye.

196
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,192
Ari Fishman?

197
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:50,273
Aye.

198
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,735
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

199
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:52,835
Aye.

200
00:14:54,043 --> 00:15:02,009
And the third item on our list this evening, zoning overall updates are Alicia, Danielle, do you have any updates for us?

201
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,233
So we don't really have any updates.

202
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:17,660
I will just tell you that we have been working through things like a green score for the city and, um, uh,

203
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,577
We haven't looked at design requirements, but we've looked at incentive zoning.

204
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:33,560
This would be you're allowed to do this much density, and if you do additional affordable housing, you can get more density, stuff like that.

205
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,841
We're working through those.

206
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,162
One of the questions that came from the consultants should,

207
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:45,844
design guidelines be part of zoning or something that's adopted by the CD board.

208
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:50,330
And my recommendation is that that's adopted by the CD board.

209
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:55,857
But I asked them if because they were going to kind of go hand in hand with the new zoning.

210
00:15:56,598 --> 00:16:05,524
If they could present both of them at the same time, so that they would actually come to this board and the city council together at the same time.

211
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:08,066
Here's what we're recommending for design guidelines.

212
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,727
And here's what we're recommending for the for the zoning.

213
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,990
Design guidelines would be adopted by this board.

214
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:19,567
but the zoning would be recommended by this board and adopted by the council.

215
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,609
We are pushing those through together.

216
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:28,214
That gives us more flexibility in design guidelines, so it doesn't have to go through a full zoning process.

217
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,056
Things change and we want to have that changed.

218
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,243
So those we are expecting drafts of those to be coming in September.

219
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:43,346
And I actually will tell you that I just received I had mentioned wanting to get files up on the website.

220
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:47,608
I just got most of those from the zoning consultant today.

221
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,370
So I'm hoping over the next few days to get those.

222
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,152
I think we're talking about needing a web page to put this.

223
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:08,575
Although we do have a page from the Medford Comprehensive Plan that I'm thinking maybe we should then just actually update that to include the stuff that's coming through the zoning.

224
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,378
And I'd like to include links to the zoning meetings we've been having.

225
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,619
Just wanted to tell you guys that stuff was there.

226
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:23,005
And if anybody has any questions or anything that has come up since the last time we were talking about stuff, I'm happy to answer questions.

227
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,547
But that's really all I have this evening.

228
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,438
The design guidelines, how would those be construed?

229
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,582
Will we be working with a consultant or is that something done internally?

230
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:34,243
How does that work?

231
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:41,050
Because I know we started this process a couple of years back when we did the zoning recodification and we didn't pick up on it.

232
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,713
So I'm trying to figure out how we will move forward this time.

233
00:17:44,319 --> 00:18:03,190
In this case, the zoning consultant is prepared to provide us with recommended guidelines specifically for Medford, which was actually kind of the problem with the recodification that that consultant was giving us like, here's like a straw man, a stick man kind of thing.

234
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,111
Now you guys make it Medford specific.

235
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:10,614
These consultants have been hired because they did our comprehensive plan.

236
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:20,536
They have talked to Medford residents and developers, and they're prepared to say, here's what we think would work in Medford.

237
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:30,399
My hope is that by the time you guys get it, you'll just want little tweaks, but you'll look at it and go, wow, this was done by somebody who understands our city.

238
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,020
As opposed to staying like, oh my gosh, now we have a lot of work in front of us.

239
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,141
Okay.

240
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,830
Thank you, Alicia.

241
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,472
I'm going to ask for a motion.

242
00:18:52,512 --> 00:19:05,897
So if there's nothing else, if there's no support, has no questions, new members, anyone you want, this is your open time before we actually ask for a motion to adjourn.

243
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:07,898
Do you have any questions?

244
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:13,499
Nope, just taking it in and getting comfortable with how the meetings go.

245
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,139
So thank you.

246
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,160
Awesome.

247
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,920
I feel like it's the calm before a storm.

248
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,682
I'll take it.

249
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,102
I'll take it.

250
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:26,425
As someone who works on the consulting side of some of these projects, we're starting to get the storm on our end.

251
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:30,547
So a couple of months.

252
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,648
The number of traffic requests I sent out today.

253
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,532
Because we're ready for more development now that we've opened the Great American Beer Hall.

254
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,152
We're ready.

255
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:41,513
Is it open?

256
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,074
It's open.

257
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,214
It's amazing.

258
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:50,137
It was at capacity all day on Saturday from noon through like closing.

259
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:55,019
There was a line almost all the time and they were letting people in as people left.

260
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,380
Yeah, I swung by on Saturday.

261
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,801
I was going to come in and then I just

262
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,156
I, you know, I just scratched that.

263
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,616
I was like, yeah, it's too packed.

264
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,277
I would love to pitch.

265
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,057
I don't drink beer.

266
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:11,698
That's not a reason just to go and see, you know, hang out and have a great time.

267
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:11,959
Right.

268
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,579
So patronize my foot.

269
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,280
They have wine and cider too.

270
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,681
Oh, they do.

271
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:19,361
They do.

272
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,542
They are in the bar.

273
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:23,823
Yep.

274
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,163
They have a full bar, mixed drinks.

275
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:26,844
Oh, okay.

276
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,144
All right.

277
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:30,305
The other place in West Med for,

278
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,191
near the train station.

279
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,162
This place has everything.

280
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,141
Oh, it's I will say it is lovely.

281
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:43,906
They are operating under a temp operating permit, because there are a few things they still need to complete for the city.

282
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,531
The road in front dot they're still making some dot stormwater connections.

283
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:56,956
And they're still the elevator, there's a lift to the second floor that hasn't arrived.

284
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:01,279
So the second floor is closed, they do not have occupancy permit for the second floor.

285
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:03,881
And like they don't have their

286
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:10,233
I'm railing around the balcony of the deck.

287
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:14,321
So you can't obviously you can't go on the second floor and you can't use the deck yet.

288
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:16,304
That stuff is coming.

289
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,388
They're still expanding their menu.

290
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:23,875
Um, for the food, um, but, and, but I want to pass along something.

291
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,697
So Brian, you will remember was here a couple of times.

292
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:35,681
And one of the things he said to me on Saturday was, you know what, Alicia, I did not want to put in bike parking and you made me do it.

293
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:36,962
And you were right.

294
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,203
Look at how full that bike parking is.

295
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:45,966
So just passing along that that was, that was a community development board thing was to put in the bike parking.

296
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:47,847
Um, yeah.

297
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:55,056
He's very happy and in fact, he's getting pressure to put in more bike parking because it was so full.

298
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,959
We'll see if it continues to stay full.

299
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:00,804
Do they have EV stations?

300
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,366
Do they have EV?

301
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:02,627
No.

302
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:07,392
But he's putting solar on the building.

303
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:31,501
We required a solar assessment, and that was so, the proposal he got was so favorable to him that he is actually not only putting solar on this building, but they own property down near Patriot's Place, and he's looking to put solar, like a solar farm there, and then make his properties up here the offtakers for it.

304
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:34,689
So I thought that was pretty cool.

305
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,673
But he sent me the interconnection agreement to National Grid.

306
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:43,095
So like the paperwork that he needs to do with the utility to put solar on.

307
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,977
So I know he's serious.

308
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:53,203
I'm hoping he'll put EV in so that he puts good foot forward on that.

309
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:53,963
Right.

310
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,885
I think we did not because there's such

311
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,519
It was this project was a real shoestring.

312
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,900
Actually, if you might remember that I came to the board, I talked to his banker and then I came to the board and said, like, I talked with her.

313
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:14,842
She was at his soft opening Thursday night and I got to meet her in person.

314
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:17,822
And she said she was like, it was a really good experience.

315
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,663
And she was glad that she had talked to me about that project.

316
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:26,864
So she was lovely in the future for the next phase of improvements that he puts in.

317
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:29,105
It's just really important to the community.

318
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:30,106
Yes.

319
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:38,051
The BJs, we asked for EV in addition with the gas station.

320
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:41,053
And then I don't think this board required it.

321
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:44,836
But then when he went to city council, they said they were doing it.

322
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,318
And they have four stations that have gone in.

323
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,299
I haven't gone over, they're not open yet.

324
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,360
They're still fenced off.

325
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,343
But from my experience, they look like high speed stations.

326
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:59,969
Like, they don't look like basic little level two stations.

327
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,890
So I'm curious to see what goes in at BJ's.

328
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:09,232
Was Great American Beer Hall, did they come in before the specialized stretch code?

329
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:10,132
Is that why they don't?

330
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:13,313
Long before it, that only kicked in this summer.

331
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:23,016
Okay, so that's how, because yeah, now you have to have at least EV ready spaces now, they go in just before.

332
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:33,327
And that project was on such a shoestring to get in there that we did not require of that one.

333
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:45,417
Just to note that board member Adam Barons have joined us and thank you so much for joining us, Adam.

334
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:50,962
Adam, I want to let you know that we have another new board member that joined us this evening, Ben Lavallee.

335
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,067
Hey Ben, welcome.

336
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:58,990
Hey Adam, look forward to working with you.

337
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:10,937
And with that actually, oh and one other thing Adam, there was a note that Alicia and Danielle had suggested that we all send our cell phones to

338
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:26,558
to them so that they can compile it in case we're running late or anything, and they'll know that we, they'll reach out and see if we're coming to the meeting or whatever, so that they actually have that and we're not waiting, going forward.

339
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:32,541
And it's not so much just because, not because of your tonight, it's just to have it overall.

340
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:38,503
Because sometimes we don't even know who's waiting in the waiting room if it's a phone number, so we try to match it.

341
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:39,864
Yeah, cool.

342
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:40,144
Okay.

343
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:41,205
Yeah.

344
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,319
but it's really short meeting.

345
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,181
So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

346
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:53,382
I'll make the motion.

347
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:58,004
Second.

348
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:07,728
Awesome, then I'm going to do a roll call since my document of names opens back up.

349
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,884
Actually, I think I have it memorized.

350
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:13,764
Yeah, go on Jackie, you've got it.

351
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:15,445
Hi.

352
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:17,946
Peter Cowes.

353
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:19,407
Hi.

354
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:20,988
Ari Fishman.

355
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:22,008
Hi.

356
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:23,689
Sabrina Altino.

357
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:24,669
Hi.

358
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,450
Ben Lavallee.

359
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:27,971
Hi.

360
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:30,011
Adam Behrens.

361
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:30,812
Hi.

362
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:33,133
Annie Strang.

363
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:33,193
Hi.

364
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:35,614
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

365
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:37,855
I believe I got everyone.

366
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,418
Nice job.

367
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:42,116
Thank you, everyone.

368
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:43,086
Have a great evening.
