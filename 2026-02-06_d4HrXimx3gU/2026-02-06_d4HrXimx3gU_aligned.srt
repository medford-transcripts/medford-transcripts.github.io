00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:39,765
Hello everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show far and about the city of Method, and I am John Petrella.

2
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:49,111
And the purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:50,032 --> 00:01:00,038
And at Method Happenings, we're very proud to have Jason Stone, who is the Method Social Service Coordinator

4
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,785
joining us for tonight's show.

5
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:04,486
And welcome, Jason.

6
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:06,627
And really, we appreciate you coming on.

7
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:07,188
Thank you.

8
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,529
Thanks for having me.

9
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,770
I appreciate this opportunity.

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,833
OK, so we're going to get right into the questions, Jason.

11
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:15,634
We'll just move along.

12
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:25,822
So the first question we ask everybody is, you know, exactly who is Jason Stone?

13
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,644
Let our audience know who you are, what you're all about.

14
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:39,698
Locally, I like to say jokingly a little bit that first and foremost, I am not the Jason Stone that you see on the TV, especially if you watch Celtics games.

15
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:45,020
I am not the same guy as the lawyer who sponsors the Celtics games.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,183
We are not the same person and it does come up every single day, as you might imagine.

17
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:56,025
Yes, I am, in fact, the social services coordinator for the city of Medford.

18
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,006
I have been in this position since November of 2024.

19
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:06,329
Prior to that, I was the social services coordinator for the town of Wakefield for a couple of years.

20
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:16,294
Before that, I spent 20 years in the substance use disorder and community corrections fields, and eventually it was just time to

21
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:17,981
do something else.

22
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:22,163
So I entered the wonderful world of municipal social services.

23
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,144
I currently live in Wakefield.

24
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,164
I've lived in Wakefield for 23 years.

25
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:27,904
I'm married.

26
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:32,646
I have an 18-year-old daughter who is about to choose which college she's going to go to.

27
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:39,328
And I run a music website on the side, and I do podcasting and all sorts of fun stuff.

28
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:39,648
So

29
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:44,922
But yeah, that's the $0.25 version of who is this particular Jason Stone.

30
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:46,303
That's a good version.

31
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:47,824
I like that.

32
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:49,585
That's a great version.

33
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,787
And it's a $0.50 version, not $0.25.

34
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:52,207
Right.

35
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,968
Give myself credit.

36
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,535
OK, so the Method Health Department is responsible for several areas.

38
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,017
Can you give our audience briefly

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,782
discuss and identify each one of them.

40
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:12,203
There's a lot involved here.

41
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,784
There's a lot involved.

42
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,946
Medford Health Department does an awful lot.

43
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:24,472
And yes, I should have probably prefaced that I work technically under the Medford Health Department's Office of Prevention and Outreach, which is very unique, and we'll get into that after.

44
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:33,619
But first and foremost, the stuff that a traditional health department does is sort of the meat and potatoes of what Medford Health Department does.

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,902
Inspectional services, environmental health, public health nursing,

46
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:40,335
those are kind of the bread and butter of most health departments.

47
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:58,189
That is, when you think about a health department that is looking at restaurants and making sure that they're up to code, looking at housing issues and making sure that things are up to code, that people have heat, taking care of rodent issues, that sort of traditional health department inspectional services stuff.

48
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,731
We have three full-time

49
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:04,574
inspectors that are out in the community all day, every day.

50
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:09,856
We have a public health nurse too that I'm sure folks have come across.

51
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:19,301
She does traditional public health nursing stuff, vaccines, communicable, I get that word wrong every time, disease prevention, TB tests.

52
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,262
She works with the schools a lot.

53
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,343
She does blood pressure clinics.

54
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:24,984
She's over at the senior center a lot.

55
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:30,147
She does home visits for folks who can't get out and need their vaccines brought to them.

56
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:38,232
And then, of course, we have Pat, who's our animal control officer, which is sort of part and parcel again with health department stuff.

57
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:45,417
He's full-time as well, and he's out in the community all the time taking care of traditional animal control stuff.

58
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,841
And I think it's sort of important to note that we all sort of collaborate a lot.

59
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:58,604
And a lot of that collaboration comes through the Office of Prevention and Outreach, which is sort of a very unique thing for the city of Medford.

60
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:08,688
And to be truthful, it's one of the reasons that I threw my hat in the ring to come to Medford a couple of years ago, year and a half ago, because it's sort of unique and I think innovative.

61
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:17,931
So Office of Prevention and Outreach, which for folks that don't know is located primarily in room 205 at City Hall, does an awful lot of stuff.

62
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:26,965
We have under Marianne O'Connor, who's our health director, and under Catherine Dingra, who runs that office, there's

63
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,251
the really cool and fun and innovative stuff happens.

64
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,672
So I take care of the social services side.

65
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:47,378
So if folks are looking for help with, and we'll get into this a little more later as well, but if folks are looking for help getting on MassHealth, if folks are looking for help getting fuel assistance, et cetera, et cetera, they can come see me.

66
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:52,680
But we also have an outreach team that works all part-time.

67
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:59,853
out of that office, supervised by a guy called Patrick Donovan, who's one of our newest recruits.

68
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:07,058
He's technically the health equity coordinator, but he supervises that whole team of liaisons and connectors, right?

69
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:09,159
And they are embedded in the community.

70
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,400
They're residents of the community.

71
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:23,791
they represent a variety of different languages, a variety of different cultures, a variety of different backgrounds, and their goal is kind of to be a two-way conduit to and from City Hall about the things going on in the community.

72
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:35,341
The specific needs of individual communities, whether it's the senior community, whether it's the food insecure community, whether it's the Haitian or Brazilian or Arabic communities, they're out

73
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,442
holding events, holding listening sessions out in the community, reporting back to City Hall, things that are going on.

74
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:46,423
And that way we can sort of keep communication going both ways.

75
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:59,229
We also have a recovery coach who, for folks that haven't met, like, not to give you an idea for a future episode, but Chris Suma, who's our recovery coach at City Hall.

76
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,270
Wonderful.

77
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,906
Tremendous energy when it comes to early recovery, especially getting folks in the door.

78
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:20,362
We run a recovery group every Wednesday at 430 that that meeting has gone on for years and it has grown to sizes larger than we might have to move it into the city council chambers at some point because we got a bunch of people.

79
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:20,623
Yeah.

80
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,761
It's really great.

81
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,922
And I can elaborate on a lot of that.

82
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:32,146
But again, Chris has that sort of energy, that sort of like magnetic energy that gets people in the door and excited about being in recovery.

83
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,968
So that's a lot of stuff that

84
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:57,258
most of it being grant funded, so not necessarily on the city role, but between Catherine and Patrick and their predecessors, Sophie and Penny, for folks that have been in Medford for a while, they hustled a lot and they got a lot of grant money to do a lot of really good, innovative things in the community to improve health equity in the community.

85
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:03,343
And I could go on and on and on and on and on about the Medford Health Department and about the OPO specifically, but...

86
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,701
Again, the 50 cent answer.

87
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:06,521
Yeah.

88
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,662
Well, no, that's that's all great.

89
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,443
I mean, I'm going to be honest with you.

90
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:13,204
I didn't realize how involved it was.

91
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:16,886
I mean, I try and, you know, know what's going on and method.

92
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:21,328
And I'm really I'm I'm so happy you're on the show because that's a lot.

93
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,829
I mean, you guys really do cover a lot.

94
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:28,944
And I know the department has gotten bigger, and it's great that you're getting grants and everything else.

95
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:32,288
And the bottom line is you're really doing a great service for the city.

96
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,390
And that's what it's all about, really.

97
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,151
We're trying.

98
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,712
Yeah, we're trying.

99
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,374
That's what it's all about.

100
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,517
And it's for the whole city, which is nice.

101
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:43,740
So, you know,

102
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:52,006
we see on the website under the Office of Prevention and Outreach, you know, there's basically what I see is three groups.

103
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,346
I'm just going to read them quick.

104
00:08:53,506 --> 00:09:00,428
And you got social services, mental health and substance abuse under one group.

105
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:05,549
And then the Method Connects community engagement team.

106
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:09,250
And then we have prevention and wellness.

107
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,810
Well, I'm sorry.

108
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,371
So can you know, can you give us another

109
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:15,368
Yeah.

110
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:22,646
Description, I'm very interested, like, of what each of these roles are, what they do.

111
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:33,102
And I'll actually start at the bottom, the prevention and wellness part, because I unceremoniously left that out in my preamble there.

112
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:36,725
But we do prevention and wellness work primarily with schools.

113
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,468
So we have a new prevention and wellness coordinator.

114
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:40,348
Her name is Matisse.

115
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:41,309
She's awesome.

116
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:50,577
She's also got a great energy and I think can relate to the kids on their level, but also has a lot of background in doing outreach work and doing prevention work.

117
00:09:51,017 --> 00:10:04,992
So they're working in the schools, especially in the high school, about doing prevention-related stuff and creating activities and creating resources for kids so that they don't, it's sort of upstream stuff, right?

118
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:12,120
So you put in the protective factors upstream, so when their kids are school age, so that hopefully either they don't end up needing

119
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:17,598
my services someday.

120
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,842
Or at least if they do end up needing them someday that they know kind of what's out there.

121
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,674
So they're doing a lot of cool things in the school.

122
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:32,138
Again, Matisse is probably another good person to eventually talk to to really get into the weeds of some of that stuff.

123
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:42,667
And I say to Catherine, so Catherine Dingra, who oversees our office, she was in Wakefield for a long time as well and worked in prevention, worked in the health department in Wakefield.

124
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,850
She jumped ship and came to Medford probably

125
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,631
six or eight months before I did.

126
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,553
And then I followed her here from Wakefield.

127
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:53,016
But we sort of joke that like she's the macro person.

128
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:57,219
She's the, like see the grants and report on deliverables and all that stuff.

129
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,840
And I don't do that.

130
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,502
My brain doesn't function with macro level stuff.

131
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:08,388
Much easier for me to be out in the community or dealing with folks one-on-one and helping them navigate their issues.

132
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:14,473
So that's sort of the social services, mental health, substance use stuff all gets thrown under that umbrella.

133
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:25,603
Because my predecessor, Alicia, who was in this role for the City of Medford for a long time, she cut her teeth in the recovery coach world and then became a social worker.

134
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:32,389
So she sort of had that background, and my background is very similar to hers, so I kind of stepped into that role.

135
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:40,355
And then the Connects team, the community engagement team, that's our liaisons and our connectors.

136
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:44,418
That's our Haitian Creole connectors, Portuguese, Brazilian connectors.

137
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:45,839
We have a mass health connector.

138
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,701
We have a senior services connector.

139
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:49,182
We have a food systems connector.

140
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,663
I always forget a couple.

141
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:52,284
We have a couple Arabic connectors.

142
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,006
We have a couple that focus on financial literacy.

143
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:55,447
We have

144
00:11:56,027 --> 00:12:04,700
ELL connectors so that if folks in the community are new here and they need to get into ELL classes, well, we have an ELL coordinator who

145
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,079
tells them where to go.

146
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,421
We run community events at the library.

147
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,583
We help sponsor ELL classes at the library.

148
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:18,589
We'll throw community events to get people out so that they know that Medford is a welcoming place for everybody.

149
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,851
I mean, that's the goal, right?

150
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:25,094
To make sure that everybody knows that they're welcome here and there's people there to help you if you need it.

151
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:34,084
It sounds like you've got a lot of specialized, I call them specialized like services, people working.

152
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,024
Yeah.

153
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:35,685
Yeah.

154
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:36,845
Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:41,467
And I think especially because some of the stuff that we have to navigate is so complicated.

156
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:47,409
And so that's kind of, that's partially where I come in, right, to help people navigate some of that stuff.

157
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,250
And that

158
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:57,873
I always say to people, I understand why people are overwhelmed trying to navigate MassHealth or trying to navigate Medicare or trying to navigate housing applications.

159
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,554
It's complicated for me and I do it for a living.

160
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,655
I'm not going through a crisis at that point.

161
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:17,781
So I can only imagine if you've got language issues, if you've got learning difficulty issues, if you've got homelessness issues, if you don't have a phone to be able to check a list periodically, it's completely overwhelming.

162
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:24,707
My goal is to help make those connections and do it with people, not for them, but do it with them.

163
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:25,628
Right.

164
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,811
I mean, you take a lot of stress off them.

165
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:34,397
They're in a stressful situation as it is, and you're there to help them, and I'm sure that's a relief to them.

166
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:40,904
Yeah, and sometimes I feel like the only, and we'll get into this later in the list of questions,

167
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:47,005
But sometimes I feel like the best thing I can do is just be an ear to listen to people.

168
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:54,067
Sometimes I'm the one who picked up the phone first and actually listened to somebody as a human and had a conversation.

169
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,707
And to me, that seems like a low bar.

170
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,228
But sadly, it's not, as you probably know.

171
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:01,008
Right.

172
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,188
No, I do know.

173
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,328
Yeah.

174
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:03,769
I know.

175
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:05,629
All right.

176
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:10,030
So this is kind of one of those questions.

177
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:17,870
I have to ask it, what is your role as a social services coordinator?

178
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:22,173
And then I'm very curious, how do you triage issues?

179
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,475
I mean, like you just said, you get the phone call.

180
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:28,737
I mean, it's got to be difficult.

181
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:31,258
And then how do you triage it?

182
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,699
What's the next process?

183
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,993
Triage is actually a really good word to use in that situation.

184
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:47,297
And Chris, our recovery coach, and I were just joking the other day, or not even joking, but commenting that, like, I've gotten into watching that show, The Pit, recently, and I don't know if you guys have seen The Pit.

185
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:48,577
Phenomenal show.

186
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:51,218
And a lot of what they do is triage.

187
00:14:51,278 --> 00:15:01,162
Like, they're in an emergency department, so people come at them all day, every day, with everything under the sun, and it's their job to not necessarily do the work, to sort of put out the fire in the short term,

188
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:05,584
and connect them with the actual like longer term treatment.

189
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:08,286
Some ways that's kind of what our role is.

190
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:19,893
So Chris more hyper focused on the recovery stuff, but he'll even tell you that like the more conversations you have about recovery with people, that might be a place to start.

191
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,834
But that's really just the tip of the iceberg for a lot of people.

192
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:27,077
When you get them in the door to talk about, hey, let's go to an AA or NA meeting,

193
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,664
And then you kind of lower their guard a little bit.

194
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:32,826
And then they talk to you about this, that, and the third that's going on with them.

195
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:36,188
And you start to realize that, okay, there's other help out there.

196
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:43,592
So my job, I always say to people is to be a resource connector, not a resource provider.

197
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,613
I am not your social worker.

198
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:50,655
I'm not your therapist, your psychiatrist, your counselor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

199
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:53,937
It's kind of my job to get you connected to those things.

200
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:57,099
So a lot of times when folks call me,

201
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:17,423
They call me because they don't really know where to even ask the question of, but somebody told them, and especially now that I've been here for a little over a year, my name gets out there, my phone number gets out there, and if you help somebody, then they tell their neighbor, or they tell somebody at the senior center, or they tell somebody at the library, and then it kind of spreads word of mouth like that.

202
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:21,526
And so that also means that no two phone calls are exactly the same.

203
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,307
Oh, I'm sure.

204
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:23,967
Yeah.

205
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,368
Don't imagine.

206
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:35,990
Yeah, and so I try to figure out pretty quickly what the actual issue, what I think the issue is, but more importantly, what the person thinks the issue is.

207
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:40,312
Because like all of this is voluntary, right?

208
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,694
So anything that I do with people is because they called me and they want help.

209
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:45,775
So let's figure out what you want help with.

210
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,257
Now, sometimes because of my background or because of the experiences I've had,

211
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:57,941
I know kind of that there's something else under the surface there, but we have to build up that rapport in order to figure out what that is.

212
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:05,252
And it also includes phoning a friend an awful lot.

213
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:13,296
One of the best things about this world is there's very few communities around that have municipal social services people.

214
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,978
These positions really kind of only started during COVID.

215
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:30,947
Particularly when communities had money, the ARPA money, that's kind of the origin of a lot of these sort of positions is communities said, well, we've been talking about getting a social worker, a human services person for a while,

216
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:37,873
never really made sense necessarily to put on the tax roll, but now we have the ability to do that because we have ARPA money.

217
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:44,460
So now's the time to do that because schools have always had school counselors and adjustment counselors and therapists, et cetera.

218
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:51,307
And the senior center has the senior center and the social workers there, and they're wonderful, but there's kind of a gap in the middle.

219
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,349
So I viewed myself as

220
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:55,832
the gap in the middle.

221
00:17:56,012 --> 00:18:02,257
Now, obviously there's some back and forth there, but to help people navigate the services that they maybe don't know how to navigate.

222
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:15,507
And yes, every single phone call is different, but we have created this little working group of other municipal social services people in the sort of greater Mystic Valley area.

223
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,349
We all know that we don't know everything.

224
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,230
None of us pretend to have all the answers.

225
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,493
We just kind of know what the right questions are sometimes.

226
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:46,943
And if I don't know, but I know that Tracy in Stoneham has a particular set of skills, or I know that Denise in Arlington or Bridget in Medford in Malden has a particular skill, then we'll all trade ideas back and forth and back and forth because none of us are reinventing the wheel, except that we are all kind of put into these positions and told to reinvent the wheel.

227
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,303
It doesn't make sense.

228
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:51,045
We're all doing the same work, so let's lean on each other.

229
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:57,807
And that's a good, that's a good thing that you have all these people and you can lean on them and super helpful.

230
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,649
Yeah, it is.

231
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,990
Yeah.

232
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:02,711
Okay.

233
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:04,793
You know, mental health.

234
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:07,475
It's an emerging area.

235
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,698
And, you know,

236
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:17,346
Social services, this is my opinion, but it's also what I see.

237
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm just seeing, I would describe it as a significant surge in mental health area.

238
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,590
What do you think is the cause?

239
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,811
I mean, what is this increase?

240
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:33,351
Why?

241
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:36,172
And any ideas, anything you can offer us?

242
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:41,910
Yeah, I mean, this could probably be a whole series.

243
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,133
Yes, we could do three shows on it.

244
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:48,914
Yeah, right.

245
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:52,876
I think that a way to boil it down is a couple things.

246
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,398
You can take pre-COVID and post-COVID.

247
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:05,283
But I think particularly if you look at the data from NAMI or if you look at the data from SAMHSA at the federal level,

248
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:17,786
There was a marked increase in the number of people, both adults and seniors and kids, between 2008 and 2017 that accessed mental health services.

249
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,566
There's a variety of reasons for that.

250
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:23,488
Increased funding for services means that more people can access services, right?

251
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:24,808
So that is certainly part of it.

252
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:31,010
Increased awareness, especially at the early levels, is certainly a part of it.

253
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,316
Does that mean that prior to COVID that those problems didn't exist?

254
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:41,965
No, it means that we were maybe a little bit better at catching them early and providing treatment.

255
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:45,830
There was funding out there for treatment and for outreach and things like that.

256
00:20:46,805 --> 00:21:04,913
So that kind of, when you do the work, and this is true of the addiction field as well, which is sort of obviously a subset of mental health, but when you do the work, particularly in Massachusetts, like we're super lucky in Massachusetts that we've had these campaigns to reduce stigma and to increase access to helplines and things like that.

257
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,375
Whether that means that the actual problems got worse, we don't know.

258
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,917
We know that more people are able to access those problems.

259
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:22,912
post 2020, obviously, there's been numerous reasons that there's been an uptick in mental health.

260
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,974
COVID changed the game for a lot of people.

261
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:33,078
COVID brought a lot of issues to the surface that maybe had been bubbling below before.

262
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:37,901
Funding levels have changed in both positive and negative and sort of muddy directions.

263
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:44,385
And the sort of general unrest in the world has created

264
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:46,115
A lot of that.

265
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:53,439
Again, I do think we're still better, we try to be better about diagnosing issues and making treatment available.

266
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:05,684
I mean, if folks have noticed, there's been a couple of mental health counseling agencies that have opened in Medford or are opening in Medford within the next couple, one that opened like two weeks ago, one that's opening next month.

267
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:08,786
So there's more services generally available for people.

268
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:16,854
We've done, we try to do a lot of work to continue to decrease that stigma about accessing services.

269
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:26,144
We know that there's a population of people that probably had what we would call depression, that probably had what we would call bipolar disorder, that probably had what we would call

270
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,533
post-traumatic stress disorder through the 50s, through the 60s, 70s.

271
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:36,416
But you didn't reach out for services like that.

272
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:37,737
A, they weren't available.

273
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:41,440
And B, you managed things in other ways.

274
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:51,347
So again, that's not to say that those problems didn't exist, but I think that our awareness campaigns have done a lot about getting people to the point where now I'm going to reach out.

275
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,990
Hopefully that is a very, very

276
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,401
scaled down answer of the real answer.

277
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:04,166
And again, it could be like an entire podcast itself about emerging mental health trends.

278
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:04,486
Yeah.

279
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:12,231
No, I mean, I like that answer, because I know, you know, when I was growing up, it was different.

280
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:13,252
I mean, you didn't have a

281
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,763
You didn't have the access that you have today.

282
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:17,625
That's a good point.

283
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,807
I never thought of it that way.

284
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:19,969
Yeah, you didn't have the access.

285
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:26,662
You didn't have the diagnoses that you would have kids in your school that nowadays might be diagnosed with.

286
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:28,786
a variety of different things.

287
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:36,988
And back then they might've been like put in a special classroom or whatever, or hidden away, or they were the troublemakers, or they didn't last in school very long.

288
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:53,011
So this sort of points back to those prevention factors, like the increasing the awareness and the ability for people to access services earlier, mainstream, a lot of things that can be mainstreamed and hopefully they don't become problems for when you're in your forties or fifties or seventies.

289
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:55,472
And now it's maybe too late to address them.

290
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,571
Right, yeah.

291
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:57,812
No, I hear you.

292
00:23:58,212 --> 00:23:59,273
That's a good answer.

293
00:23:59,353 --> 00:23:59,953
I like that.

294
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:03,656
I appreciate that, put it that way.

295
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:04,117
I really do.

296
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:04,397
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:06,018
Yeah, that makes sense.

298
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:14,625
All right, so I'm going to go back to, you know, the community, you know, the Connects, the engagement team.

299
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:18,048
Can you briefly tell us more about them and

300
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,761
you know, your prevention and wellness groups.

301
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:28,985
I know that there's different roles, you know, what separates them from your group?

302
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,407
I mean, it's really complicated.

303
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:38,251
It is, but I think that the important takeaway is that it's all collaborative, that we might have a

304
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,785
one or two Haitian Creole connectors, right, or liaisons, rather.

305
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:49,630
There is a difference between liaisons and connectors, and I joke that I get it backwards all the time.

306
00:24:49,970 --> 00:25:00,501
We have community liaisons, who are people that are out in the community that are liaisons for a particular population of people, whether it's Brazilian Portuguese, whether it's Spanish, whether it's Arabic.

307
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,743
And then we also have

308
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:03,823
connectors.

309
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,985
So the connectors are exactly that.

310
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:13,168
They are the people who connect, the liaisons kind of bring people in and the connectors connect them to the other things out there.

311
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:21,292
And I kind of help when there's stuff that kind of a little bit below the surface level or things that are a little too complicated.

312
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:27,155
So we have Haitian Creole liaisons, we have Brazilian, Portuguese, Spanish and Arabic liaisons.

313
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:29,076
And they do a lot

314
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:36,310
you'll notice from time to time that there'll be like a Brazilian Independence Day celebration.

315
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,071
There'll be a Haitian flag day celebration.

316
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:44,237
Our Black History Month celebration sort of falls in part under that.

317
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,380
Events at the senior center.

318
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:53,487
And a lot of that is sort of the public facing stuff to say, hey, we're here as, whether it's part time or full time or grant funded or

319
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,442
like city role funded, like we're here as the city.

320
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,324
And these are the things that are available.

321
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:02,486
Let's have an event that just gets you in the door sometimes, right?

322
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:08,290
That gets you to see City Hall is a cool building, but it can be a little formidable for some people.

323
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:11,713
And so it gets you like access to City Hall that way.

324
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:15,936
And then if there are more specific needs, then the liaisons can help

325
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:19,539
really tailor some of those events to the specific needs.

326
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:40,498
So they'll do events at the library around immigration or around financial literacy or around they'll team up with the folks at MassHire and do a collaborative event that gets people to sign up for MassHire so that they know what MassHire is, so that they know they'll do them with DTA, so people know how to access DTA.

327
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:42,960
So they try to really connect

328
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:49,307
Like once the people have already been brought in, right, then we try to connect them to the other things that are available.

329
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:50,608
Prevention and wellness.

330
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:54,449
So Matisse does a lot of that stuff at the school level.

331
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,631
So a lot of Matisse's groups are in the schools.

332
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:07,535
She works with middle school and high school in putting together groups, putting together one-on-one sort of activities.

333
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,056
And then our wellness group is probably

334
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:18,799
would be like our recovery group, our 430 Wednesday night recovery group that has been in existence at City Hall for a long time.

335
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,223
It's generally in room 201, so second floor.

336
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:29,590
And that is, the way Chris runs it is the terminology in the halls is a checkup from the neck up.

337
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,953
Like you can be, if you say you're in recovery,

338
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:32,853
Good.

339
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:33,573
You're in recovery.

340
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:33,993
Come on in.

341
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:35,474
We got a stack of pizzas.

342
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:36,354
We got some salads.

343
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:37,314
We got chicken fingers.

344
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:38,474
We'll sit down.

345
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,815
We'll break bread and talk about what's going on.

346
00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:44,676
Sometimes that is like, how was your week?

347
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:45,796
What's going on in your week?

348
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:46,776
How's things at home?

349
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:47,977
How's things with the kids?

350
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:55,138
Like what is going on that either is a stressor to you, but you managed it successfully, or do you need a little more help?

351
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:57,779
Do you need to find like additional resources?

352
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,039
And if you do, Jason's right down the hall.

353
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,680
Yeah.

354
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:13,868
So you're becoming, you know, you mentioned all these events, so your presence is there at all these events that are going on.

355
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:16,410
To the best of my ability.

356
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:23,315
We've always got people from the Connectors and the liaisons that are out, and to the best of my ability I'm there too, but they know where to find me if not.

357
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,438
So I'll get calls from our Connectors and liaisons all the time about, hey,

358
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:39,932
I ran into so-and-so at Target and I gave him your card or can you go meet so-and-so at the housing authority or because like they're all always out there and I don't like to be chained to a desk.

359
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:44,413
So I'm happy to go meet folks out in the community where they're at if they don't want to come to City Hall.

360
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:45,393
Yeah.

361
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:48,094
And I have a feeling you're not chained to a desk.

362
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,354
I don't like to be.

363
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:50,534
No, I like my office.

364
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:51,494
I have a feeling you're not.

365
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:52,615
I have a feeling you're not.

366
00:28:55,154 --> 00:29:01,495
am out in the woods, I am under train bridges, I am along the river, I'm at the library.

367
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:01,795
Yeah.

368
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:03,816
I like you're where you need to be.

369
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:04,976
Yeah.

370
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:08,017
But I've always got my phone on and people can call me and we'll get into that after.

371
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:08,677
Yeah.

372
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:16,139
No, like I said, I think this is, you know, this is one of the reasons this is an, to me, it's an awesome show.

373
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,359
And I know

374
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:28,654
Myself and the guys that do this, you know, it's all volunteers for us, but where I can't tell you how happy we are that you know, you decided to come on and we're really proud of getting this out there because.

375
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:34,547
You know, I still, I know a lot of people are finding out about you, but there's still a lot of people that need to know.

376
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,087
That's all.

377
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:35,807
Absolutely.

378
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:41,049
And you think that you kind of like spread the word as much as you can, but you don't know who you don't reach.

379
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,550
You don't know who doesn't know about you.

380
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:52,614
And like I said, part of the reason I came to Medford is the work that they were already doing here and knowing that I could have a place in like helping to support and lift that.

381
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:54,958
You're actually doing something, and that's great.

382
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,302
Okay, so now here's another question I have for you.

383
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:03,645
That's the way my mind works.

384
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:17,256
At what point, okay, do you decide that something is beyond your group's resources, and maybe the residents should just call 911?

385
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:21,459
I mean, I know you've got to get some really tough situations,

386
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:22,371
Oh, sure.

387
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:22,712
Yeah.

388
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:37,130
So, so when, when, when, I mean, is there any way you can sort of explain to us, like, what might, you know, why you may call a 911 or, you know, what something needs to be handled immediately so on and so forth.

389
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:43,286
Yeah, I think that safety of the individual and safety of the community are always paramount, right?

390
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:46,347
And so, and we do this, which is a good point.

391
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:57,553
And this is not under the umbrella of the health department, but it is worth pointing out that in Medford, embedded in the police department, we have a couple of mental health clinicians.

392
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,715
There are two of them right now, Rachel and Jose, and they're awesome.

393
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,255
They're wonderful.

394
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:04,156
They're fully trained mental health clinicians.

395
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:04,757
And so,

396
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:06,839
they are co-response.

397
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:19,032
So if the PD gets a phone call that somebody's got a mental health crisis going on, they'll go out with the PD and they'll sort of triage the situation that way.

398
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:25,620
And as long as the officers that respond realize that there's no weapons involved, there's not an immediate

399
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,482
imminent danger to a person or the community, then they'll sort of pull back a little.

400
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:37,884
They'll still be a presence, but they'll pull back and they'll let the clinicians sort of actually take the pulse of the situation.

401
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:41,365
I kind of view my job and the calls that I get the same way.

402
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:46,107
If somebody calls me in a situation is really an emergency,

403
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,761
then I help figure out what kind of an emergency it is and who should call.

404
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,781
Sometimes it is the PD by calling 911.

405
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:59,963
Sometimes it's the non-emergency line because it's still critical, but it may not be emergency, emergency.

406
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:04,224
Sometimes it means calling protective services, like elder protective services.

407
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:15,647
If you've got somebody who, like a senior who had a pipe burst and has got nowhere to go and no resources to get there, then sometimes protective services has to get involved.

408
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:23,011
And that's not to be negative, but sometimes like that's the resource that's available.

409
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:33,158
So the way that I always handle them, if I think that a person is in jeopardy of harming themselves or someone else, then that's above my pay grade.

410
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:40,303
If they're not in imminent danger of harming themselves or somebody else, then okay, let's figure it out from there.

411
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:46,072
And triage, again, is sort of the right word as long as it's not in a crisis.

412
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:54,016
If it's a crisis that a person has to get to a mental health counseling center or to a shelter, then we'll do that and then follow up afterwards.

413
00:32:55,251 --> 00:33:00,715
But if the person's safety or the community's safety, that's always going to be paramount.

414
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:05,419
And so the rest of this is all trying to, like, rising tide lifts all boats, right?

415
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:08,642
So the rest of the work is trying to raise the tide.

416
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:18,430
So as long as there's not an immediate danger, then I can come in and make the phone calls and go from there.

417
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,131
It's good to know you guys are working with the police department too.

418
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:22,812
Yeah, they're great.

419
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:27,398
Police works with us, fire works with us, the new ambulance provider works with us.

420
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:32,123
I mean, I know it's been only a couple of weeks, but they've been really responsive so far.

421
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:35,948
They've been, they kind of hit the ground running and they've been real communicative.

422
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:37,229
So it's nice to have.

423
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,772
Yeah, well, what you're doing is very important.

424
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:43,374
So it's nice to have you guys, you know, yeah.

425
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:45,536
And sometimes you're not appreciated enough.

426
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:46,337
That's for sure.

427
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,198
No, I mean, you're just not.

428
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,360
I know.

429
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:52,322
All right.

430
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:55,984
So, you know, you've covered a lot of stuff here tonight.

431
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:58,887
There's a lot more.

432
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:03,911
Boy, I can go on and on with you a lot more questions, but we can't.

433
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:05,532
Yeah, you got a certain

434
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:23,012
But, you know, one of the things I wanted to know is, you know, and you obviously have a lot of challenges that you guys deal with, all of you, I mean, not just, so, you know, what is the biggest challenge, like you would say your operation faces?

435
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:24,072
Is it funding?

436
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:27,993
You know, I don't know, like employee retention?

437
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:34,195
You know, what, I mean, aside from helping people and doing all you do,

438
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:41,630
What about the, you know, I kind of look at like the internal operation, there's gotta be challenges for you, right?

439
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:56,582
Yeah, I mean, I think that the most frustrating thing or the most challenging thing for me, and I've thought a lot about this over the last couple of days and figuring out like, what's the best answer to a question like this, right?

440
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:01,486
And I think that when there's a situation where there's not an immediate fix,

441
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:02,348
right?

442
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:07,871
When somebody actually reached out and called you because they were finally ready to get help with whatever.

443
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:12,533
And when there isn't an immediate fix, right?

444
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:17,435
When the help that's available and the help that they're looking for aren't the same.

445
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:23,417
Now, sometimes funding is obviously the biggest issue and it has been and it always will be.

446
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:29,380
And that's not just at the city level, that's at the state level, that's at the nonprofit level, that's in the private sector.

447
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:35,049
There's never enough money to go around for all the services that we need.

448
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,193
And so, I mean, if we wanted to paint with a broad brush, right, it's always that.

449
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,794
We always need more resources.

450
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:44,457
And the more resources that we have, the more resources that we need.

451
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:51,603
The more people like me, or the connectors, or the liaisons, or the recovery coach that we have, telling people, hey, look, there's help available.

452
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:55,387
Like, we have to make sure that there is something available when we ask that.

453
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,008
Otherwise, it's empty, and then we look

454
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:59,383
we look back, right?

455
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,226
Yeah, you can't do outreach and say, hey, come to this group, and then the group doesn't exist.

456
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:06,088
Or, hey, apply for this grant, but the grant doesn't exist.

457
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:20,499
When there's not an immediate fix, and when the system is just bogged down with a sheer volume of cases, sometimes it's not usually staffing on our end, but staffing at other nonprofits.

458
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:24,982
Folks are historically understaffed, and have been since COVID, right?

459
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:27,024
That changed the math for a lot of people.

460
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:37,569
And so the reality is that if somebody calls today because they need X, Y, and Z, hopefully I can at least connect them to some letter of the alphabet.

461
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:47,514
It may not be X, Y, and Z. And so really the biggest challenge is when you've exhausted the options, right?

462
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:52,277
And that it's really just hurry up and wait for something to open up.

463
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,201
again, probably another thing that could be a series of podcasts, right?

464
00:36:57,261 --> 00:37:02,802
It's like, how do we fix the various different issues?

465
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:07,243
And it's not just funding, like funding is the easy way to explain it.

466
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:14,265
But that has to be targeted at the right places and spent in the right ways and developing the right programs.

467
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:14,805
And so

468
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:19,207
Those are the things that frustrate me.

469
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:25,929
It's one thing to reach out to a person, to do outreach, and say, hey, there's stuff available if you need it.

470
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,871
And if they tell me they're all set, they're all set, fine.

471
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:31,152
You know where I am if you need me.

472
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:44,823
if and when they come to me and say, okay, now I need, especially if it's housing, like whatever, I could stand on the tallest soapbox in Medford and scream it as best I can.

473
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:48,607
We don't have enough housing and there's not enough housing that folks can afford.

474
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,110
And a lot of the calls that I get are about

475
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:56,042
like, I can't find immediate short term, immediate cheap, immediate housing.

476
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,684
Like, it's like, yep, no.

477
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,486
And that's the sad reality.

478
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:00,026
It's sad.

479
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:01,448
It's been going on for a while.

480
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:05,131
And, you know, I don't have the answers.

481
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,753
I don't pretend to have the answers.

482
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:13,580
But that that's got to be, I know a few people personally that had some problems with that.

483
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,581
It really is.

484
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:15,402
That's the worst

485
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:20,333
Yeah, and I trust... It's a tough thing to try.

486
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:20,693
It is.

487
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:28,725
And part of sort of what I appreciate about doing things like this is that maybe it gets somebody to pick up the phone earlier.

488
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:37,612
rather than, you know, I'm being evicted tomorrow, or my lease is up tomorrow, or the movers came 12 hours ago, now I need help.

489
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:45,858
Well, like we're kind of like, it's gonna be, it's a miracle to find something in the short term.

490
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:56,546
But so hopefully what it says is that, you know, somebody realizes that six months from now their lease is up, their landlord is selling the house, or they know that their job is ending or whatever.

491
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:58,588
And so now's the time to sort of,

492
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:05,793
to sort of make a plan for when that happens, so that then whatever happens, like you've got things you can do.

493
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:06,934
You've got steps.

494
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,175
We've already made the phone calls.

495
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,057
We've made the connections.

496
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,098
The earlier, the better.

497
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:11,358
Yeah.

498
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:11,878
Yeah.

499
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:12,699
So you have time.

500
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:13,199
Yeah.

501
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,461
I mean, that's the right way to do it.

502
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,123
There's never enough time.

503
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:20,245
But the more time we can get, the better.

504
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:27,649
The early, starting things early is always better.

505
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,630
And I know the housing is probably one of the toughest ones.

506
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:35,513
I keep hearing about all this affordable housing coming, but then when you

507
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,836
I don't even know what affordable housing is anymore.

508
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:40,517
That's for another show.

509
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,738
It is, it is.

510
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:51,084
I have said this before that a lot of the folks that I interact with, and this was true in Wakefield, this was true here, this is true of my colleagues across the region.

511
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:55,586
There's a lot of folks that come to us, have resources at some level, right?

512
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,247
They have enough

513
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:06,214
coming in so that they don't qualify for a lot of the programs that are out there, but they don't have enough money to make ends meet, to pay whatever it is.

514
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:11,756
So then it becomes, okay, how do we chip away at some of that?

515
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,457
Let's sort of put a plan together.

516
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:18,419
Let's connect you with the people that can put a plan together and like chip away.

517
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,660
If we can't get this,

518
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:25,314
maybe we don't need this, but let's get this and this and this and sort of like piece it together.

519
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:31,999
Yeah, a lot of times it is that, you know, maybe get them help with heating for the winter, whatever it is.

520
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,081
Yeah, I hear you.

521
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:40,826
There are people that make, you know, I would say decent money, but the rents and things, the affordable housing,

522
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:43,736
I mean, like I said, I don't know what it is anymore.

523
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,217
I have no idea.

524
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:46,898
Yeah.

525
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:48,719
I shake my head a lot.

526
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:49,379
Yeah.

527
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,901
No, I don't know what it is.

528
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:52,241
Yeah.

529
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:52,682
Right.

530
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:53,202
Yeah.

531
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:54,843
All right.

532
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:58,386
So now the most you know, we're going to have you back on the show.

533
00:40:58,626 --> 00:40:59,006
Of course.

534
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:00,487
I mean, we're coming near the end.

535
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:01,127
Yeah.

536
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:04,830
And believe me, I would have loved to go another hour or so.

537
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,570
Yeah.

538
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:07,812
From this, I have a lot more questions.

539
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,113
But on the same

540
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,665
On the other hand, you did a great job.

541
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:16,548
I want to thank you because you answered a lot of questions.

542
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:24,172
And we really reached out and we try to get questions that are going to help people.

543
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,733
And you did a great job.

544
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:26,794
I appreciate that.

545
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:28,515
I wish we could give you more time.

546
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,815
We're going to have you back.

547
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:31,876
We'll have a part two and a part three.

548
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,017
Yeah, sure.

549
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:33,818
We're going to.

550
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:34,438
We're going to.

551
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:44,018
So, you know, probably of all the shows we do, this is probably the most important thing, you know, as far as you, your organization.

552
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:48,059
And I personally want to thank you because you do great work.

553
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:48,719
You really do.

554
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:49,539
And I mean that.

555
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,499
I appreciate it.

556
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,681
And it's it's it's a great feeling to know that you're out there doing that.

557
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,801
It makes me feel good.

558
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:58,442
So.

559
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:00,862
Here we go.

560
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:03,083
How do people reach you?

561
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:13,113
And, you know, like a website, phone number, I mean, we wanna, I mean, we'll put that out there, but we really wanna put it out there, you know?

562
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:17,619
Yeah, people can always go to the Medford website under the health department.

563
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,342
All that information is there.

564
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,657
There's a lot of information on the website.

565
00:42:22,937 --> 00:42:24,098
You can always just call me.

566
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:32,539
I'm in room 210 at City Hall, so if you're in City Hall, if you're looking at the chambers, I'm immediately to the left of Council Chambers.

567
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:37,860
People can call my cell, which is, you know, I'm sure it'll be in the literature.

568
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,400
781-654-5635 is my cell.

569
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,300
My office number is 781-475-5646.

570
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,461
Yes, I do have to read that because

571
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:50,104
my cell and my office numbers are too close to each other.

572
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:53,247
I always transpose it.

573
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,850
You can email me jstone at medford-ma.gov.

574
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,933
I do office hours at the library every Wednesday from 10 to noon.

575
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:04,296
I'm in study room one every Wednesday.

576
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,498
You're at the library every Wednesday.

577
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:09,060
Every Wednesday, 10 to noon, study room one.

578
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:11,042
It's open office hours.

579
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,585
Come in, hang out, talk about what you want to talk about.

580
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:18,990
Sometimes that's a little more palatable for people than coming to City Hall for whatever reason.

581
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:21,232
We have a great library.

582
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:21,913
They can

583
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:33,714
you know, if they're on Facebook, the community engagement team has a Facebook page that they're always pumping out literature about what's available and what they're doing.

584
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,596
And I can't keep track of all the events that they're doing.

585
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:40,719
So check the Facebook page, especially because Samia keeps that pretty up to date.

586
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:40,979
Yeah.

587
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,500
OK, that's nice to know.

588
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,221
That's good to know.

589
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:44,281
There's a lot of different

590
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,132
places people can hook up with you.

591
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:49,973
Usually because of where I am at City Hall.

592
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:54,774
So if folks just come into City Hall and come up to the second floor, they kind of don't really know where they are.

593
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:57,034
And they'll look around and I can see them from my office.

594
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,855
So I'll go out in direct traffic.

595
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:00,695
Yeah.

596
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:04,336
So even that way, if you're lost, just come into City Hall.

597
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:04,816
I'll find you.

598
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:07,496
I appreciate it.

599
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:09,197
I mean, this is good.

600
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:09,897
People know.

601
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:14,378
I mean, you know, hopefully it

602
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,123
It works out for people, that's all.

603
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:23,404
I think knowing, I mean, I'll be honest, I didn't know where your office was.

604
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:25,025
I hate to admit it, but I did.

605
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:26,005
Now I do.

606
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:28,906
So, and it's good to know, you know?

607
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:32,147
And I'll be giving out information, that's for sure.

608
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:32,787
Yeah, please do.

609
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:33,527
Please do.

610
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:36,388
So, listen, I can't thank you enough.

611
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,149
We'll call it a show now.

612
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:41,450
And I am, we're gonna have you back on.

613
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,050
Yeah, please do.

614
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,991
This was, I think this is a,

615
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,832
You know, we're doing a service to Method by having you on.

616
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:52,014
You do a great service to Method, and that's what this is all about.

617
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:52,655
Absolutely.

618
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:52,875
Yeah.

619
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:55,096
It's a great place to be able to do the work.

620
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:57,698
So I thank you for this opportunity.

621
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:00,420
Thank you so much for joining us, Jason.

622
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,242
And if I need a lawyer, I'm not going to call you.

623
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:05,864
You better phone Stone, but you better not call me.

624
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:07,685
All right.

625
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:08,686
Have a great night.

626
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:09,607
Thank you so much for coming on.

627
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:10,047

00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,830
You know, I want to take a minute

631
00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:19,214
Now, I want to thank Jason again.

632
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:22,516
