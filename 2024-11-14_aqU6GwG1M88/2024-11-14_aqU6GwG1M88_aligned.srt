1
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:34,676
I ended up at City Hall and it's here to Anna setting up zoom right now.

2
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:38,338
Oh geez.

3
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh no I was here anyway.

4
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,561
But I think maybe apologies to Anna.

5
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:47,883
I had a meeting here at five.

6
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,446
Councilor Scarpelli is also on his way.

7
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,225
know if he's going to be attending in person.

8
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:59,826
He's on his way.

9
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,107
He's on his way virtually.

10
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,288
Okay.

11
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:43,609
If they know if Scott's going to be attending building commissioner.

12
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,074
I don't know the answer to that question.

13
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,582
I can walk down the hall and get you the answer if you'd like.

14
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:20,628
My understanding was that he had some recommendations for changing some stuff about the green score to make it not conflict with the building code.

15
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:29,832
But if we already have that written down somewhere so that it could be amended during the meeting, then that would be fine too.

16
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,385
He has them, sorry, he sent them to Paula.

17
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:36,366
Paula's gonna present them.

18
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,628
Okay, cool.

19
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,052
And I will, I will, I have already all the modification seen.

20
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:49,735
Okay, okay, just as long as you see what's happening.

21
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:54,639
Adam, any word on when Councillor Scarpella is gonna show up?

22
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:00,374
Or did he give you any indication of that?

23
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:05,997
I know that he was logged in a minute ago, but I will text him.

24
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,658
You have a quorum, I believe.

25
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:09,499
So you can start regardless.

26
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:10,980
All right, let's do that.

27
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:18,824
So welcome to the planning and permitting committee of November 13th, 2024.

28
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:27,264
During this meeting, we're just going to we are going to go over mainly the proposed green zone.

29
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:34,468
Green score zoning ordinance at the end of the meeting, we'll have a short presentation.

30
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:40,491
I mean, very short on the Salem street corridor, which is going to be coming up the next regular.

31
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,433
meeting of the City Council.

32
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:55,821
Just as a reminder, if you would like to be recognized and speak, please raise your hand on Zoom first and I'll recognize you.

33
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:08,310
But the goal of this meeting is to refer out the green score by the end of it for the regular City Council meeting next week.

34
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:25,286
And with that being said, I will turn it over to Paola, unless any of my colleagues on city council have anything they'd like to say first, feel free to raise your hand really quickly.

35
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:29,851
Oh, Adam.

36
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,417
Mr. Chair, I need to call, because this is on Zoom, I need to do a roll call.

37
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,397
Oh, okay, sorry, I thought that.

38
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:43,438
That's all right, and any votes you take tonight also have to be roll call, because this is a Zoom meeting.

39
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:46,158
Okay, sorry, that was- That's okay, don't worry about it.

40
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,318
Yep, yep.

41
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,018
Don't worry about it.

42
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,479
Go ahead, go ahead and take a roll.

43
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,519
Okay, President Behrs.

44
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,499
Present.

45
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,360
Councilor Callahan.

46
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,020
Present.

47
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,501
Councilor, actually, Chair Lemme, I'm gonna call last, sorry.

48
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:02,561
Councilor Scarpelli.

49
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:05,096
I know he's on his way.

50
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:07,598
I will mark him present and let you know when he shows up.

51
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,000
Vice President Collins?

52
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,823
She is absent.

53
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:13,924
Okay.

54
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,506
And then Chair Lenning?

55
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:17,527
Present.

56
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:19,149
Great.

57
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:20,129
Good to go.

58
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,330
Thank you.

59
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:28,737
So do any of my colleagues on City Council have anything they'd like to say first?

60
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:30,579
No?

61
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:35,572
All right, in that case, Paola, take it away.

62
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:38,973
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

63
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:43,734
So I'm here representing Innes Associates.

64
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:48,815
I'm the senior planner and designer from Innes Associates.

65
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,056
And I'm also with my colleague, Jimmy Rocha.

66
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:57,017
And I'm going to start presenting the green score document.

67
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:01,522
Let's see.

68
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,022
Are you able to share?

69
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:08,384
Yes, I am.

70
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:13,605
So I'm going to go by sections.

71
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,726
I will do only the outline and just point important things.

72
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:25,767
I have some comments from the building commissioner, and they have been also included in here.

73
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,228
And I will mention every time that I have

74
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:36,448
something that has been modified from the one that we sent by the comments from the building commissioner.

75
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:45,013
First thing that I want to say is that the green score, we will review it several times.

76
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:53,358
We are doing this, we are going forward with each of the districts that we are going to study and analyze.

77
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:53,958
district.

78
00:12:53,978 --> 00:13:03,866
So for the moment, we only have here the districts to of the mystic Avenue corridor that we have, uh, implemented in the previous meeting.

79
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:04,807
Um.

80
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:11,953
So this we will go back and forth every time that we have a new district because we will

81
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,953
And we will also review the site plan review.

82
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,075
So we will go back as well to amend that.

83
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:31,441
So what I want to make everyone very clear is that we will review this several times for the next year.

84
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:34,924
So all that you see here is not set in stone.

85
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:40,429
We can still mold it as we think it should be.

86
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,992
So the purpose of the green score

87
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,701
or I will start with what the green score is.

88
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:55,578
It's an environmental zoning regulation that will establish a set of standards for the landscape and the site design.

89
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:10,372
So that being said, what it does is that we want to provide flexibility in this performance standards and we will see how we want environmental functional landscapes.

90
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:22,955
And what we have done is with this tool, we can approach the different goals that have been set in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan that was released in the 2022.

91
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:31,739
With this is improving flood resilience, heat mitigation, storm infiltration, water and soil quality improvement.

92
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,582
So all these things are being tackled by the Green Score.

93
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:49,646
Also, it offers a lot of free ecosystem services, including the mitigation of pollution, shade, energy savings, recreational opportunity, and also important enhanced property values and quality of life.

94
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:54,049
So this is something that I wanted to read to be very clear on this.

95
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,311
Sorry for this.

96
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,775
And then I will go quite faster from this.

97
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:09,862
In the overview, we're given a definition, we explain and present that this is a landscape elements menu.

98
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,063
So this is a menu

99
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:24,038
of landscape elements that what gives us a lot of flexibility for developers to choose which ones are best and fit best their projects.

100
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:30,360
So they don't have to use all these landscape elements, just the ones that they need to get to the minimum score.

101
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,252
Now, each of these landscape elements has a different value.

102
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:46,701
And this value is given according to what is their standard performance, environmental performance, meaning if they are better doing their job, they're going to have a higher value.

103
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,684
And what we call this value is multiplier, and we will see it later on.

104
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,589
So what is the applicability where this is going to,

105
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,151
where it's going to work, when it's going to have to go through green score.

106
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,452
So every new principal building or major renovation.

107
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:10,313
And there are two things.

108
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,754
One is the one that is located on the FEMA areas.

109
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,534
And I will explain a bit this further.

110
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,755
And second, if it has to go through site plan review.

111
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:28,757
So if we have these two conditions or only the Saipan review, then it has to go through Green Score.

112
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,734
This is one of the modifications that we did according to the building commissioner comments.

113
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:45,518
And we just wanted to specify that when we refer to FEMA areas, we are asking for both zonings.

114
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:53,542
So the zone AE that has this 1% annual chance flood and hazard, and the zone X that is the 0.2%.

115
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:04,337
And so basically what we have is any new development, we have to make two questions.

116
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,959
And the first is, is it located in a FEMA area?

117
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,380
Yes, then it has to go through Green Score.

118
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,382
No, then we do the next question is, does it go through site plan review?

119
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,744
Yes, then it goes through Green Score.

120
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:22,607
No, then we have other environmental standards that will be the minimum pervious surface.

121
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:30,781
This is in your documents.

122
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:39,486
Another thing that we are also studying with the building commissioner, and we are talking about it, is how to define major renovations.

123
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:46,191
At the moment this is the latest one that we have, but we are still working on this.

124
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:59,255
This is still ongoing and we need maybe a bit more conversation with the building commissioner about if this is at the moment the good one and if we will review it later on.

125
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:04,040
Are there any questions at this point?

126
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,137
Okay, then I will.

127
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:25,349
Sorry, should we just settle the language for the major renovation because we all agreed on major renovation conceptually we just need the language that is appropriate for Massachusetts building code.

128
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,234
yeah so that is the that's what we are trying to do, but there are many different.

129
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:35,375
major renovation definitions in Massachusetts.

130
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:37,736
He's here.

131
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:40,197
So why don't we just have him answer the question now?

132
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:41,057
Oh, yeah, sure.

133
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:44,558
So I've used the one that was like recommended.

134
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:49,619
And yeah, I would love to hear his comment, his answer.

135
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
So building commissioner.

136
00:18:53,963 --> 00:19:02,197
I think he's a reminder it's generally it's generally only acceptable if the chair recognizes folks from the floor, but go ahead.

137
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:07,206
Okay, I'm not real good with the formality sometimes so it's.

138
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:19,623
Two comments, the FEMA National Flood Hazard Area would like to see the designated by the X and AEs because that's how surveys are going to come in.

139
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,865
X and AEs are not going to be that specific language.

140
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:25,966
So that gives us a basis to fall back on X and AE.

141
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,987
I think we have some A zones too.

142
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:38,852
I tried to trigger the major renovation based on how we typically evaluate a building

143
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:44,817
in terms of its level of renovation, which is the international existing building code.

144
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:49,598
It provides nine levels of review from repair through others.

145
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:57,819
So this language, it's based primarily in the concept of a work area and the concept of the level of repair or renovation.

146
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:05,121
So I tried to capture both of those languages into this definition.

147
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:20,316
and trying to stay away from some undefined things because I've had many arguments over the years about undefined things and they become crutches for people to work around the regulations.

148
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:29,482
So I don't want to give us to have to think any more than we have to and stick with something we can refer to for further clarification if I need to dig into it.

149
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:30,422
That's where this comes from.

150
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,724
It's right out of the building code.

151
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:37,442
you.

152
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:38,763
Yes.

153
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,324
Thank you, Mr Chair.

154
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:41,485
Um.

155
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:46,509
So I'm going to continue, um, with the rest of the sections.

156
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,472
Oh, counselor Council President bears.

157
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:52,473
Just to clarify.

158
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,696
So this language for the major renovation.

159
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,058
This is the language from the building code that the

160
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:11,019
Great, and then for the X and the AE for FEMA, does X correspond to the 1% chance?

161
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,600
Does AE correspond to the 0.2% chance?

162
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,660
Just where would those fit in?

163
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,681
Yes, I will add them.

164
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:29,445
So the zone one is, it has, are very different zones in MEDFAR's A and AE, and then the 0.2 is the zone X, but I will add that to the final language.

165
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:30,845
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:32,946
Thank you.

167
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:36,754
that's on.

168
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:37,555
Yes.

169
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:40,837
Um so then we have this own districts.

170
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:47,361
This is the table that it would be updated every time that we present a new district or we review a new district.

171
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,923
So there are many to be determined.

172
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:50,564
For now.

173
00:21:50,604 --> 00:21:53,586
We have the ones that are in Mystic Avenue.

174
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:56,387
So mixes 123 and commercial.

175
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:58,349
So we have been

176
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:20,280
So how was working the green score if it was very difficult or where were the problems and they mentioned the affordable housing to be a bit of a problem because of the cost that they have and

177
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:25,872
Um, so to get to the minimum requirements, sometimes it's a bit difficult.

178
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:35,621
And that's why in, uh, we have, um, place that projects with affordable housing, maybe reduce the minimum required green score to 20.

179
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:38,723
This is something that we will continue to work on.

180
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:49,649
And especially whenever we have other districts that are more residential or that will have more affordable housing, we will look into it more because we will start to have different numbers.

181
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,831
And so the 20 might not be the one that will fit.

182
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:57,173
So maybe we have a percentage reduction, but this is what we have at the moment.

183
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,314
And that's why we have it in this way.

184
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,794
Then we go to the calculation.

185
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:05,495
I'm not going to read this.

186
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:18,003
What I'm going to do is to present that we have elaborate an Excel worksheet so that the personnel from the city or the developers are able to use this, and it's a lot easier.

187
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,866
So do you see the Excel now?

188
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:26,389
We don't see the Excel.

189
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:27,169
Oh, yep, now we do.

190
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:27,910
I see it.

191
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:34,155
So we have created this Excel to make it a lot easier, the calculations.

192
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:41,259
And we have some instructions in order to where you need to fill the numbers and what you need to do.

193
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:45,821
We also created comments in each of the cells.

194
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:56,109
So if they have a red triangle and you hover over it, you see extra information about different requirements and standards that they have.

195
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:01,413
And then we have the final score will appear automatically.

196
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:13,003
So all these calculations are, you can enter new ones and then the calculations we immediately update.

197
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:19,258
So these will be also one of the deliverables that they will need to hand in.

198
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:34,328
There are also different requirements, that is, for example, that the E elements, which is the permeable paving, and the F, which is at the moment enhanced tree growth systems, this can only be the sum of these two.

199
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:36,970
need to be less than one third.

200
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:43,935
And that's something that will appear here and will pop out if it's more than the 30%, 33%.

201
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:49,820
And so it cannot work.

202
00:24:51,261 --> 00:25:01,569
So it's all prepared so that city staff and also the developers, well, it's easier to do these calculations.

203
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,586
Um, so going back

204
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:12,463
So we have then is the list of the table of all the landscape elements by categories.

205
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:23,468
And as I said, you see their multiplier, their value, according to how good they do their job, vegetative walls, permeable paving.

206
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:32,292
Then we have the table of equivalency, because all the plants needs to be calculated in an equivalent square feet.

207
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,853
So it's easier to do these calculations.

208
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:36,754
It's also here, but this is done

209
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:43,519
directly into the Excel worksheet, so we don't have to worry about this, but it's there.

210
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:53,386
We also have all the bonus that we can sum in our calculations and are also on the Excel.

211
00:25:54,347 --> 00:26:00,031
Something that is important for the calculation is to know that we can stack a lot of these elements.

212
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:05,315
In the same area, you have the soil depth that you take into account, you have the ground covers that you also

213
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:12,004
take into account and sum the credit and then all the shrubs and trees that are on the same area can count.

214
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:27,249
For example, with the green roofs, you will count not the soil and the ground cover, that is like a package that goes with the value itself, but you can count all the trees and all the shrubs that you're going to implement, that you're going to plant on top.

215
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:35,996
So it's interesting, it's important to know that a lot of these elements are stackable, and so it's easier to reach the minimum.

216
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,231
And then we have a lot of different standards.

217
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:45,352
First, we start with the general that apply to all of the green, all of the landscape elements.

218
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:49,433
And then we go into more specific.

219
00:26:50,874 --> 00:27:06,278
So planted areas, all the plantings, the shrubs, the large shrubs, all the sizes and categories of the trees, installation, spacing, so all the requirements that they need.

220
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,099
are in these standards.

221
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,819
I'm not going to go through them.

222
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,720
If you have any questions, let me know.

223
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:23,843
And there is another of the comments that we got from the building commissioner, and it's about the porous alpha asphalt and pervious concrete.

224
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:31,125
So these are their work if they are well executed, their work if they are well maintained.

225
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:38,987
So what we want is to make sure that people understand that these are medium and high maintenance elements.

226
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:48,390
And so that's why we have in here that we recommend for light traffic only and that maintain long term performance.

227
00:27:50,291 --> 00:28:06,606
It is recommended that the surface infiltration rates be inspected annually during rain events to observe that any changes of effectiveness in infiltrating the stormwater and also to remove any soil debris that prevent the clogging of the pavement.

228
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:10,469
So it's recommended that the porous asphalt pavements be vacuumed

229
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,030
two to four times a year or power washed.

230
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:20,691
So we wanted to keep this in the standard so that it's clear that these are a bit more highly maintained.

231
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:33,774
And then we have also the different standards and then in section eight we have all the bonuses that can be applied and some in the as an extra.

232
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:58,513
So for example, the landscape that consists of native adaptive non-invasive plant species, if the 50% of the annual irrigation are met using harvest rainwater, if the landscaping is visible from adjacent public right-of-way or public open spaces, this is a very easy one to get, or if it's foot cultivation.

233
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,276
So certain standards as well for those bonuses.

234
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:07,256
I'm going to stop here and ask if there are any questions in these sections.

235
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,359
If there are any questions, feel free to raise your hand on Zoom.

236
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,220
Director Hunt.

237
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,022
Thank you.

238
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:19,002
Thank you, Paula.

239
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,283
I just wanted to clarify something.

240
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:30,388
When you were going through the part about under-zoned districts, there is an asterisk that projects with affordable housing may reduce the minimum required green score to 20.

241
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:49,895
I thought from our conversations we were saying that projects that are 100% affordable would reduce the green score to 20 because we're requiring that any project with 10 or more units have at least one unit of affordable housing.

242
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:51,256
So I wasn't

243
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:58,933
clear that the argument was that if they had even one unit of affordable housing, they couldn't afford to do the whole green score.

244
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:03,215
So I just thought we should clarify that.

245
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,440
Yes, that's a very good point.

246
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,581
And it should be something that is

247
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,718
more than the minimum at least.

248
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:30,006
So we will need to figure it out how much is that minimum or if it's 100% affordable housing.

249
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:35,270
I think that it might be not the 100, but way more than the minimum.

250
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,511
So we need to study that better.

251
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,553
Thank you, Director Hunt.

252
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:41,394
Any other questions?

253
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:44,376
All right, continue.

254
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:44,917
Thank you.

255
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:46,838
Yes.

256
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:47,438
Thank you.

257
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:52,040
Um wait, uh, President Barry's, uh, I was later.

258
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,080
No, that was me.

259
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,940
I was late on that one.

260
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,500
Um.

261
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:03,063
I would just throw out the idea of maybe a 25% at least 25% affordable, um, as a minimum threshold.

262
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:03,723
Um.

263
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:06,384
I also just had a question about how.

264
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:10,565
This interfaces with the solar ordinance.

265
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:11,546
Um.

266
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,647
You know, because I think if we're talking about some.

267
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,983
you know, relatively large buildings with relatively small side setbacks.

268
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:25,526
And we also have the solar ordinance requiring solar on the rooftop.

269
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:33,892
I'm just wondering how much that limits the green roof type solution.

270
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:43,178
So the green roof can be applied with solar.

271
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:46,200
It's actually, sorry, it's actually

272
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,591
better if it's with solar because of the temperature.

273
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:54,133
It's lowering the temperature that it needs and it doesn't overheat.

274
00:31:56,133 --> 00:32:13,267
maybe we can do later on if it's when we study the communal solar approach and that we can see if that is also getting less of the green score, some kind of percentage reduction as affordability.

275
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:19,012
I think that these are things that we will come back later when we do the final cleaning.

276
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:22,215
and see better.

277
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:37,985
If it's a project that does something for the community, how can we reduce it so that we don't step over and the projects that we want to happen don't stop them because of green score?

278
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:44,890
So these are things that we are hearing, and we will consider it whenever we do these other pieces.

279
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:46,251
Great.

280
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:46,731
Thank you.

281
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:50,614
All right.

282
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:51,772
Thank you.

283
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:52,254
Keep going.

284
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:54,681
Yes.

285
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:58,613
And so now we'll go to the... Sorry.

286
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:03,517
the last amendments, and these are the amendment sections that we do for the site plan review.

287
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:12,782
So we will need to modify the requirements because now we are also asking requirements for the green score.

288
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:23,269
So this is about all the deliverables that need to be also hand in in order to review the green score and that everything is

289
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:25,251
according as it should.

290
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:37,263
So all these plans need to be prepared by a registered architect, landscape architect, or professional engineer, and they need to do all this following information.

291
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:40,727
The score sheet, but also

292
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:56,824
landscape drawings, typical drawings of the site plan, demolition, materials, grading, plantings, and certain details, photographs of the trees that are meant to be preserved, and specifications.

293
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:00,227
And then we will also

294
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:20,109
at some modifications and as builds, this as builds is so that in a way we are enforcing this with the signature of the professionals so that we don't have to check every of these projects.

295
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:29,294
So this is a way of enforce it that we make sure that everything that it says and is on the plans will be as built.

296
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,532
And then we also added a waiver.

297
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:41,558
So upon request, the site plan review authority may waive the requirements of green score in the interest of the design flexibility and overall project quality.

298
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:49,944
And upon a finding of consistency of such variation with the purpose of the green score and the relevance zoning districts overall purpose and objectives.

299
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:56,729
This is something also that we have add that you didn't have in the previous document, this waiver.

300
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,767
and this is the end of the document.

301
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:11,208
Thank you.

302
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:18,409
Any other input from anybody else on the call?

303
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:26,771
Councilor Callahan.

304
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:28,672
I just appreciate all the work.

305
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:29,593
It's very thorough.

306
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:37,275
Thanks so much for adding in things that like vegetative walls, remembering suggestions that we made quite a while ago.

307
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,035
So really appreciate the work.

308
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,375
Thank you.

309
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:43,757
Mr. Commissioner.

310
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:47,638
Yep.

311
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:51,437
I just ask you to unmute.

312
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:52,178
Thank you.

313
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:53,159
Thank you.

314
00:35:53,779 --> 00:36:02,547
I guess the question I have is knowing that building schedules and planting schedules don't often come together.

315
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:14,138
Is there anything that should be built into this to address that issue of a project ends up in November, but it's not time to complete the plantings?

316
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,140
And how do we address that?

317
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:22,206
Um, that is a good question.

318
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:27,853
I haven't seen anything in the other green scores from different communities that I've seen.

319
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:31,176
Director Hunt?

320
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:32,218
Sorry.

321
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:38,505
I might have mistaken that pause as a... No, no, it's okay.

322
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,507
Yeah.

323
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,308
Director Hunt?

324
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:52,160
So I would think of it as so when we do site plan review, we do require certain things sometimes now like trees and some plantings and we have

325
00:36:54,477 --> 00:37:11,265
recommended that we only issue a temporary occupancy, just like if they're looking to pour concrete in December, they can use the building, but that's still just a temporary occupancy permit that then is annoying and has to get followed up with.

326
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:16,788
But I'm aware that we do, it's what we would do now.

327
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:31,428
In my experience, we've often sought bonds to cover that.

328
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:37,411
Temporary occupancy permits are not the catch-all tool you'd like them to be.

329
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,292
They're a little tricky sometimes, especially the longer they go on.

330
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:50,477
We're not really supposed to be issuing them for potentially four to six months if we're between seasons, and they're not as enforceable as one would love them to be.

331
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:58,016
Because I really don't want to come back four months later and try to revoke somebody's occupancy on a project for plantings.

332
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,377
It's going to go over very poorly.

333
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:10,841
It's up to the planning board, I suppose, but bonds or other things are the type of mechanisms that carry more teeth.

334
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,406
Um, yeah, I will look into this.

335
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:18,868
I think that's a great question.

336
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:22,570
So we will do some research, uh, about this.

337
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:36,522
All right, so Council President Bears.

338
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:38,503
Thanks.

339
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,565
Um, and on that front, I think

340
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:50,966
It seems like we're kind of getting this in, the framework in, and there's just a couple of things that we're gonna work through as we adopt more districts and we're able to do the research on the community solar.

341
00:38:52,948 --> 00:39:00,333
But I just was wondering, maybe it's a question for Paula, looking at other ordinances, or maybe a question for the building commissioner.

342
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:10,961
Are there other places or other zoning requirements where we use the same approach that you described, Mr. Commissioner, with the bond question versus a temporary occupancy permit?

343
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:14,465
Scott?

344
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,668
I'm not aware of any off the top of my head.

345
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:29,732
I just know that in my experience, bonds carry more strength because they ultimately carry the idea that if you can't perform, we will perform for you.

346
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:31,793
And it's not uncommon for

347
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:37,674
developers at the end to get a little light in the budget to complete their work.

348
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:50,501
So I just don't want to be in a position of having to try to revoke somebody's occupancy, which means I have to shut a business down over landscape plantings and green score compliance.

349
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:56,525
It just, it's definitely very awkward and probably doesn't a great idea.

350
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,527
Whereas if they have a cash bond out there,

351
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:03,397
they're in a different position.

352
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,081
And if I may, Mr. Chair.

353
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:08,842
Go ahead.

354
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:20,933
It sounds to me like the concern is if they finish up in November, they're not doing plantings till the spring, if they already have all the permits and approvals they need from the city, maybe they just never follow through with their landscaping plan.

355
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:24,817
Is that essentially the concern we're trying to correct for?

356
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:37,801
Yes, and I just think if that's the route you wanna go to ensure a conformance, it wouldn't be bad to try to build it into the ordinance so they're aware of that as a condition for completing.

357
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,842
It's just a common thing with landscaping.

358
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:41,783
Got it, thank you.

359
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:42,864
Planner Evans.

360
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:45,245
Thank you.

361
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:47,126
Yeah, I'm just gonna say that

362
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:59,775
I don't really see the difference between compliance with green score and compliance with approved landscaping on plans because they shouldn't be getting final CEOs if they haven't complied with that.

363
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:04,479
I think bonds are fine.

364
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:12,566
I think the issue with bonds is if they don't follow through that it's often more expensive for the city to

365
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:18,038
to do the work that it is for the private developer.

366
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:36,504
So the bond, I think, would have to be, there'd have to be some multiplier that, in effect, so that we make sure that the bond is actually worth what it would take for the city to hire someone to do the work.

367
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:41,285
And then how do we, or is it just a we'll keep your money kind of threat?

368
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:44,555
Mr. Commissioner.

369
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,100
Again, it is usually is a multiplier.

370
00:41:50,401 --> 00:42:02,433
Considering that fact, it also becomes landscaping becomes a, you know, things die over the winter that make it planted, you kind of need a longer period of warranty and coverage and timing than you do for the building.

371
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,295
And as KP law will tell you,

372
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,102
By law, I get a little bit constrained about holding occupancy for things outside the basic building.

373
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:19,803
It becomes contentious and also something that can go to other authorities to override me.

374
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:29,326
So I just want to make sure we're taking it the best way you can and putting something in the language that tells people that information.

375
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:33,367
You don't have to put it in language, I guess, but it just seems like a good idea to me.

376
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:53,021
Personally, I'm thinking that a lot of these points can be, I mean, a lot of these do seem to be relatively minor changes at this point.

377
00:42:53,462 --> 00:43:01,849
And, sorry, I was looking at Zach to see if, and I think that,

378
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:12,585
This is likely subject to the building commissioner's previous changes that he recommended.

379
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:18,988
This is still likely able to be referred to regular council.

380
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:32,714
And if the Planning Department and the building commissioner do come up with any recommendations over the next week, we could incorporate those during a regular meeting.

381
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:36,453
Council President Behrs.

382
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:41,138
Yeah, they could also be incorporated during the CD board hearing.

383
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:44,662
Yeah.

384
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:50,869
So with that, is there any further discussion?

385
00:43:53,317 --> 00:44:12,746
you know, I do think like these are important technical points, but they can also be done between the consultants and the staff and sort of hammered out during some of the, during some longer meetings between individuals and recommended to the council or the CD board later.

386
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:17,789
With that, is there any other comments from

387
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:23,312
staff or city councilors?

388
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:30,677
No.

389
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:32,298
Do we have any motions on the floor?

390
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:41,063
Councilor Lemming, I believe there's a resident that has their hand up.

391
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:43,765
I'm aware of that.

392
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,245
Okay, thank you.

393
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:46,866
I'll get to that.

394
00:44:47,147 --> 00:44:47,627
I'll get to that.

395
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:53,406
I'll just I'll make a motion to refer out to the regular meeting pending the discussion.

396
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:53,486
Yep.

397
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:55,808
Okay.

398
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,650
Motion to refer out to the regular meeting pending discussion.

399
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,711
And I did.

400
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:04,096
Sorry.

401
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:05,597
Do we have a second on that?

402
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:07,679
That was that was me seconding.

403
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:08,625
Thank you.

404
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:13,471
And with that, I do see that Mr. Fjord's hand is raised.

405
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:16,855
So we will move to public comment.

406
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:22,161
Just to check, because this was a little bit unclear, like it was kind of a last minute switch to Zoom.

407
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:28,889
President Behrs or Councilor Callahan, can you verify that there is, is there anybody physically in the audience at the hall right now?

408
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:30,314
No.

409
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:40,059
Okay, in that case, we'll move on to public comment and I'm going to ask Mr. Fuhrer to unmute.

410
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,722
Mr. Fuhrer, if you'd be able to provide your name and address for the record.

411
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:46,382
Thank you, Chair Lehmann.

412
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,423
Gaston Fury 61 Stigny Road.

413
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:51,544
I just had a question regarding cool roofs.

414
00:45:51,605 --> 00:46:00,548
Unfortunately, I don't have access to this document, so maybe it talks about it and I just couldn't read it, but I was wondering whether there are any points given to cool roofs.

415
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:05,230
So in California, for example, in the LA area,

416
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:09,067
They require a minimum SRI by code.

417
00:46:09,888 --> 00:46:12,592
So I was wondering whether something like this was considered.

418
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:14,756
The second question that I had is that

419
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:25,904
related to what President Behrs said, I would like to see more information regarding solar panels and their interaction with green roofs.

420
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:38,409
So I haven't read about it, so I don't know, but I was wondering in terms of natural irrigation, rain, whether it affected the green spaces in the roof or not.

421
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,410
And the third question that I was wondering is,

422
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:46,997
So I know that we're talking about the Mystic Avenue corridor and then Salem.

423
00:46:47,017 --> 00:47:06,581
So those are kind of like high structures, but for something a little bit lower, if this extended to other areas of the city, I was wondering whether there should be some consideration in the zoning related to tall trees, new ones that are planted and their location within the lot.

424
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,782
So as to, for example, not plant

425
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:36,137
or at least not give the same number of points on the planting of trees, for example, that face south that could occlude any solar panels that could potentially be put on the roof and give extra points to put those tall trees on the north side of the lot so as to not occlude any solar panels that could go on top of the roof.

426
00:47:37,885 --> 00:47:43,667
Because otherwise, I think we should also try to incentivize the installation of solar panels.

427
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:56,951
And, you know, I always pay attention, for example, tall trees on the sidewalk, like if there's any new trees to try to get them away from roofs that face out so as to not prevent people from installing solar panels.

428
00:47:56,971 --> 00:48:04,474
So I was just wondering whether there could be some writing sort of incentivize any new tall trees that are planted to sort of like to not occlude

429
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:07,217
solar panels that would phase out.

430
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:07,838
Thank you so much.

431
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,681
I was taking notes on what you just said.

432
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:19,152
So you're wondering if the effects of irrigation on green roofs, zoning related to tree height and their ability to affect solar panels.

433
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,775
And could you just rephrase your first question again?

434
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:24,459
So the first one was related to cool roofs.

435
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:27,723
So I think I sent that email a while back.

436
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:37,294
So cool roofs are roofs that are actually painted with paints that reflect the sun rays and make the roof cooler.

437
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:45,401
If this is in a downtown area with tons of buildings, it actually decreases the heat island effect.

438
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:54,630
And in areas where the climate is a lot hotter than what we have here in New England, then this is actually required by code, for example, California.

439
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,394
And it's a much cheaper way to just paint the flat roof, for example.

440
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,236
So it's much cheaper than having a green roof.

441
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:12,671
Okay, so inclusion of cool, is there inclusion of cool roofs in the green score inclusion of the effects of irrigation on green roofs or anything about that zoning related to tall trees?

442
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:21,577
I do know that there is some work being done with regards to the tree that there is some work being done on the tree ordinance.

443
00:49:21,617 --> 00:49:30,183
I think that was, that's primarily Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan who are doing or

444
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:32,324
spearheading a lot of the work on that.

445
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:56,191
If Councilor Cowlin, if you have any information related to trees, feel free to raise your hand, but otherwise, otherwise, Paola, can you confirm whether or not there's anything related to cool roofs or anything related to irrigation on green roofs in the current draft?

446
00:49:58,431 --> 00:50:05,618
Um, so we haven't, we choose not to include, um, uh, cool groups, um, for many reasons.

447
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:10,123
Um, there are some communities that they do it, uh, New York, California.

448
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:16,629
We think that it doesn't do enough, um, for it doesn't do anything for stormwater, for example.

449
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,854
Um, and it's a lot better for heat Island effect to do, um.

450
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:28,514
to have green instead of just the concrete but being white.

451
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:39,216
And there is not a lot of proof that we have seen enough concrete so that we wanted to include it.

452
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:44,677
So we haven't chosen not to do it for those reasons.

453
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,719
Then the irrigation.

454
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:54,623
So there is absolutely no problem to put solars with green roofs.

455
00:50:56,224 --> 00:51:03,389
The green roofs do not need the irrigation unless it's a very extensive green roof.

456
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,890
Otherwise, we'll be with rainwater.

457
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:14,056
And it is very much appreciated because then they reduce the

458
00:51:15,996 --> 00:51:25,259
the temperature in the environment where the solar panels are so they don't overheat and they are maintained to the perfect temperature so that they are more effective.

459
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,101
So they are actually in many, many places.

460
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:33,502
There are many, many studies that reflect this.

461
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:45,186
So and I want to really stress that this is for the heat mitigation, but also stormwater for quality of water and functional landscapes.

462
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:49,650
So that give us a lot of other free ecosystems services.

463
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,555
And so the elements that we have in here are always treating several of these issues.

464
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:58,397
That's why the cool groups were not admitted.

465
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:01,616
Am I?

466
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:04,397
And then the tree location.

467
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:08,258
I think that landscapers should know exactly where it should be.

468
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:15,139
And if that project has solar panels, they should be very aware of where they should locate those trees.

469
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:17,259
So that is as effective as possible.

470
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:23,301
If it's public trees, then that will go through the tree ordinance.

471
00:52:23,321 --> 00:52:23,461
Yes.

472
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,781
All right.

473
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:26,581
Thank you, Paola.

474
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,341
I think that.

475
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:28,122
Thank you.

476
00:52:28,142 --> 00:52:28,702
I appreciate that.

477
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:29,882
Thank you.

478
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:36,291
All right, and not seeing any other folks here for public comments.

479
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:38,151
So Council President Behrs.

480
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:46,174
Thanks, I just wanted to note Alicia and I both posted some links to the documents.

481
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:49,195
Apologies that they weren't up on the council portal.

482
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:53,857
They went up, we got them after the final, the agenda went up online.

483
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:56,198
So I forgot to upload them, but I just uploaded them.

484
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:57,178
And I think Alicia,

485
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,384
beat me to it and had them uploaded to the city website before this meeting, so.

486
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:12,775
I also emailed it to Mr. Feuer during his public comment, so I feel like we just really rushed to get those documents all at the same time.

487
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:19,062
So there is a, there's, Director Hunt?

488
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:22,572
I just wanted to ask a clarifying question.

489
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:31,380
Paula, the version that you were reading from tonight, was that exactly the same as what's up on the city's website and the council has?

490
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:37,046
And if not, can you send it and we'll upload the current most updated version?

491
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:39,609
I just wanted to make sure that it was the exact same version.

492
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,759
So it doesn't have the comments from the building commissioner.

493
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:47,681
So those are not in the one that is updated.

494
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:51,063
I will send immediately this version so you can upload it.

495
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:53,144
Thank you.

496
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:54,065
Thank you.

497
00:53:55,426 --> 00:53:56,486
All right.

498
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:59,828
We have a motion on the floor.

499
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,290
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

500
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:09,274
Do you have the exact text of the motion, by the way?

501
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:17,865
President Behrs, the motion that I had was that President Behrs move to refer the paper out to the regular meeting pending further discussion.

502
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,047
You can take the pending further discussion part out.

503
00:54:21,147 --> 00:54:21,607
We had it.

504
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:26,049
I just wanted to make sure we didn't do it until we heard from the public.

505
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,332
And I have a second from Councilor Callahan on that.

506
00:54:33,893 --> 00:54:36,054
Great.

507
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:37,094
Here comes the roll call.

508
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:38,415
President Behrs.

509
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:44,607
Yes.

510
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:45,348
Yes.

511
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:47,869
Vice President Collins is absent.

512
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,050
Councilor Scarpelli.

513
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:49,971
Yes.

514
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:51,852
Chair Lemon.

515
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,954
Yes or yes.

516
00:54:55,735 --> 00:55:02,860
One absent the motion passes the chair is referred out to regular meeting.

517
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:10,952
And the other item on the agenda is just a quick, very quick update on the Salem Street corridor.

518
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:14,615
Is that, Paola, as well, you had that update?

519
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:17,717
Yes, I will just talk.

520
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:22,421
I will just say what the updates are.

521
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,723
So we are working on the Salem Street

522
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:30,396
Um, so now that we have mystic Avenue, we will, um, use.

523
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:47,187
Some of those districts, the ones that fit, uh, Salem street, um, like mix use one and two, and we will study which uses, um, might be added or taken out.

524
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:48,788
So we will modify it.

525
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:50,882
the dimension standards that are needed.

526
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:53,083
So we are looking into all of that.

527
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:58,385
The structure will be very similar to the Mystic Avenues zoning.

528
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:07,966
and what we are looking at is Salem Street is a different hierarchy from Mystic.

529
00:56:09,027 --> 00:56:13,008
It's more of a neighborhood kind of feeling.

530
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:25,072
So we are adapting those districts to this smaller scale of this more neighborhood kind of directed zoning.

531
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:29,894
So we are updating those and we will present it in the next meeting.

532
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,847
Wonderful, thank you.

533
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:35,370
Councillor Scarpelli.

534
00:56:37,072 --> 00:56:37,913
Thank you, Chair Lemming.

535
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:48,364
I appreciate all the hard work we're doing, and I know that I sound like a broken record, but I know as we move forward with, I know Director Hunt's on as well,

536
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:52,862
Um, I know I read what we tried to.

537
00:56:53,443 --> 00:57:03,397
We originally, when we first started this process with the RFP for, um, zoning consultants and making sure that we brought these, um,

538
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:10,796
these steps to the neighborhoods and to the communities that were rezoning step-by-step.

539
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:14,538
That's something I thought the former council really stressed.

540
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:27,987
And I think that it would help with, we can see lately a lot of misinformation going out and making sure that the right information goes out and going into those neighborhoods.

541
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:32,830
I know that one of the biggest concerns that I keep hearing is that, you know, Salem Street,

542
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:35,219
is being rezoned for 12 stories.

543
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:43,101
Now I know we're, um, you know, we're saying no, but you have people out there that are spinning a dialogue.

544
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:53,864
So we have to make sure that, um, you know, I know that one thing that we asked for in the RFP when, and it's, um, applied for it was a comprehensive plan for, um,

545
00:57:54,713 --> 00:57:55,954
meeting with the community.

546
00:57:56,254 --> 00:58:17,507
And I know that we've said that we've had multiple meetings with in this setting, and I don't disagree, but again, I really would recommend that we look at that process and bring it to the neighborhoods where the neighborhoods can really share what they want their neighborhood to look like.

547
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:20,429
I think like we've talked about when we rezoned

548
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:46,198
many as a as a department head in Somerville I was directly involved in the rezoning of different areas in the community where we use this example back a few years ago why we thought it was so important um chair lemming that we had um different city departments like recreation police fire um dpw where

549
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:59,252
as you put these plans out and these zoning reforms out, that people really felt that they were part of the process and they were helping design what their neighborhoods wanted to look like.

550
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:06,334
So you can tell me I'm wrong, but I really would stress that we could follow through with that in the future.

551
00:59:06,454 --> 00:59:06,954
So thank you.

552
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:09,094
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

553
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:10,555
Council President Behrs.

554
00:59:12,055 --> 00:59:12,535
Thank you.

555
00:59:12,575 --> 00:59:12,895
Yeah.

556
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:15,996
And we definitely, you know, I hear what you're saying, George, and

557
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,993
We've had some discussions about how we're going to get the word out going forward.

558
00:59:22,013 --> 00:59:25,676
I think the first thing to say is that for Salem Street.

559
00:59:26,317 --> 00:59:42,445
The next meeting we're going to discuss, this is going to be December 11th, and the plan is to get that out through all the different city channels, an announcement, and save the date for that community meeting, digital flyer, and I believe we're going to work on a robocall for that meeting.

560
00:59:42,465 --> 00:59:49,028
And then for the meetings from January through May, the plan is to put together a full

561
00:59:50,028 --> 01:00:17,575
uh release and web page that talks about different neighborhoods that we're going to be talking about each month and my goal is also to have hopefully um along with that the meeting dates and get those out a month in advance and do uh the follow-up of the announcement um the flyer putting it out in the city newsletter and the planning newsletter and doing a robocall to those neighborhoods uh in advance of the meetings so that we can um

562
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:20,534
Get that message out more clearly.

563
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:31,911
So we talked about that after our last meeting and we want to Just get that a little cleaner and tighter so that folks know a little more in advance and that we have the

564
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:39,663
Um, all of the different city outreach tools at our disposal are used to reach folks about those meetings.

565
01:00:40,384 --> 01:00:44,745
Uh, that, that's, that's, uh, that's if I can, Mr. No, no.

566
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:45,665
Well, sorry.

567
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:48,406
We, we went over ground rules at the beginning, raise, raise hand.

568
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:54,749
And then, uh, and then, and I saw that, uh, director hunt raised her hand.

569
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:59,930
And so then I'll, uh, did you have, um, okay.

570
01:01:00,611 --> 01:01:01,251
Councilor Scarbelli.

571
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:09,922
I apologize that I missed the beginning of the meeting, but as a fitting city council play again.

572
01:01:12,027 --> 01:01:14,111
You know, my import is is.

573
01:01:15,735 --> 01:01:18,537
is, uh, a piece that's coming from our community.

574
01:01:18,577 --> 01:01:24,062
And I appreciate council beers, uh, for, uh, expanding on those efforts.

575
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:26,343
I think that's a, that's a great effort.

576
01:01:26,403 --> 01:01:32,268
And that's something that going back to those residents that have reached out to me and let them know that that's coming down the line.

577
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:37,952
I think that's going to be super helpful as we move forward to make sure everybody feels like that's part of the process.

578
01:01:37,972 --> 01:01:40,394
So thank you very much for your leadership on that.

579
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:42,196
Thank you.

580
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,697
Councilor Scarpelli, director Hunt.

581
01:01:45,236 --> 01:01:45,677
Thank you.

582
01:01:45,777 --> 01:01:49,562
I just thought I should follow up because we've been moving some of this forward.

583
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:57,653
So today mailing went to every parcel owner in on Mystic Ave.

584
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:06,715
about with the date for and about next Wednesday's Community Development Board hearing and the City Council public hearing.

585
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:09,636
And just as an FYI, that is a courtesy notice.

586
01:02:09,716 --> 01:02:16,539
It's similar, it looks similar to a legal public meeting notice, but there is no legal requirement.

587
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:25,283
So we took some liberty to make the language a little bit more user-friendly in what we sent out today, just so that it was more

588
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,601
accessible by people.

589
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,903
There is a legal notice that is posted as well.

590
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:51,600
So that went in the paper mail today, and then I met with Steve Smerti, our director of communications today, about doing a big press release that would talk about, frankly, that we're implementing the comprehensive plan with the zoning updates that would list the 20th, the meetings on Mystic Ave,

591
01:02:52,100 --> 01:03:07,963
would list the dates that we're planning to have the Salem Street here and then would have the calendar of what topics we're looking at for what months based on the most recent update email exchange I had with committee chair Collins on this.

592
01:03:08,563 --> 01:03:16,745
So I am hoping that we can actually get that press release out in the next day or two so that and it'll then be emphasized everywhere else.

593
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,886
As much as I like the idea of going into the neighborhoods and all,

594
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:40,361
I, I have to say this Somerville planning department has literally seven times the staff, we have they have 70 employees in that department and we have 10 so we are trying we try to do outreach we're trying to do communications with it, but we don't have the bandwidth.

595
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:49,679
that a community that has double our city budget and 10 times, literally 10 times the staff in the planning office.

596
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:53,481
So we're trying to do what we can with the resources we have.

597
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:56,182
Thank you, Director Hunt.

598
01:03:56,222 --> 01:03:57,103
Councilor Scarpelli.

599
01:03:58,683 --> 01:03:59,524
Thank you so much.

600
01:03:59,564 --> 01:04:01,065
That's great information to share.

601
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:04,567
And I think that's where my problem comes in, Commissioner Hunt.

602
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:13,157
Um, when we did the RFP, we we knew our limitations in your office.

603
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:20,909
And I think that's why we asked to put that in the RFP to bring in the capable staff of

604
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:25,400
and it's to come in and work with those communities.

605
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:40,278
So I find it disheartening that we knew that this isn't a secret that we don't have enough staff in your office, but this is why we asked to be put in, and this is why it's written in the RFP as a comprehensive

606
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:44,032
comprehensive plan for outreach for the community.

607
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:51,260
So I appreciate everything you've done way more than what we talked about the last couple of weeks.

608
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,682
And it's so important.

609
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:59,329
But again, I'm going to implore that we find a way to go into the neighborhoods.

610
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,471
I just don't, you know,

611
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:07,128
everybody has to have an opportunity to get involved.

612
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,310
And like I said, I appreciate what Councilor Beaz is doing.

613
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:14,976
I appreciate what your response was and how we're trying to get the information out.

614
01:05:15,397 --> 01:05:20,782
But believe it or not, there's still a big gap between the people that

615
01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:28,606
that would make it that would make an effort to come into their community and to their neighborhoods to talk about what their visions are to share those.

616
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:46,812
So again I know our limitations but again I revert back to our RFP where it's it says that it was and we were pretty clear when we started talking about the RFP as a council that this is the vision why and to all due respect um

617
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:48,903
We all agreed.

618
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:55,167
I didn't think one person didn't agree that this is the type of format that we need to go into the neighborhood.

619
01:05:55,207 --> 01:06:08,554
So I apologize to be a Debbie Downer, especially with some of the good information that we've heard tonight to get the information out, but I'm sorry, I still think that's not, it's not what we asked for.

620
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:09,714
So thank you.

621
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:12,676
Thank you, Councilor Scapelli.

622
01:06:12,996 --> 01:06:14,177
Do we have any motions on the floor?

623
01:06:23,868 --> 01:06:25,109
do you take public participation?

624
01:06:25,129 --> 01:06:32,293
Sure, yeah, let's go into public participation for this item.

625
01:06:33,294 --> 01:06:34,574
Mr. Fiore?

626
01:06:39,698 --> 01:06:43,280
Yeah, sorry Mr. Chair.

627
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,781
I just wanted to ask whether

628
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:49,413
There was any thought about having community volunteers.

629
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:53,196
I don't live in any of these two corridors, but I would still.

630
01:06:54,332 --> 01:06:57,574
try to volunteer some time to sort of do the outreach.

631
01:06:58,134 --> 01:07:15,322
I know it would be better to find residents that live in these two areas, but I mean, I love participating in what's going on in the city and then I, you know, I can substitute like city council meeting here and there and just like, you know, do some of this outreach.

632
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:17,803
So I was wondering whether there was any effort done

633
01:07:18,712 --> 01:07:33,765
into finding sort of community volunteers that could be engaged, come to these meetings, actually learn the, you know, the facts, and then go and talk to our community, talk to our neighbors, since they live there.

634
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:38,189
They will be even better than having someone from the city that, you know, they don't regularly interact with.

635
01:07:40,825 --> 01:07:45,472
and converse with their neighbors about what's going on in some of these meetings.

636
01:07:45,512 --> 01:07:55,126
I was just wondering what this was discussed or whether this could be discussed in the future, either for these zoning changes or for some other zoning changes in the future.

637
01:07:55,186 --> 01:07:55,647
Thank you so much.

638
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:11,594
Well, the city does have a number of folks who volunteer in certain service that usually they're on boards or those sorts of volunteer positions.

639
01:08:11,694 --> 01:08:14,595
So I was on the CPA.

640
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:20,377
So the city does utilize volunteers for a lot of different tasks.

641
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:25,338
I don't know if we've utilized them for that one specifically, but Council President Behrs.

642
01:08:28,248 --> 01:08:31,810
Yeah, I was, I don't think we have kind of like a neighborhoods program per se.

643
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:43,457
Um, and I'm not sure what the capacity would be to, uh, coordinate that, uh, with the communications officer, the community relations, uh, staff.

644
01:08:43,938 --> 01:08:54,464
Um, but I mean, I think that's the very least something we can try to do is also share this information out through the community liaisons and they might have, uh, through the health department, they might have some,

645
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:09,023
grounding in different neighborhoods of the city, but yeah, I don't know what the mayor's team in community relations and constituent services has in terms of volunteers around like a neighborhood program.

646
01:09:10,525 --> 01:09:14,068
Yeah, no, the community liaisons I think is a very good point.

647
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:18,653
So those are folks that are probably most similar to what

648
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:25,206
Mr. Fiora was just talking about, but you're right in terms of just strictly location-based.

649
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,887
I'm not sure if we have one of those.

650
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:27,628
Paola.

651
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:36,535
Just to clarify, so what we're doing is not a comprehensive plan.

652
01:09:36,595 --> 01:09:45,263
We are building on the comprehensive plan that was done two years ago with two years of, or something like that.

653
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:51,630
that had two years of participation and a lot of discussions with the neighborhoods.

654
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:59,019
So what we're doing is updating those things that were raised by all the residents.

655
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:05,486
We are building on that, taking that, and doing the update on the zoning.

656
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:15,749
Um, we do have in any case plan, uh, some of the budget to do, um, some participation.

657
01:10:16,169 --> 01:10:30,612
So that's something that whenever it's needed, uh, in and in the neighborhoods that are really needed, uh, we can do some of this participation process, um, or at least information.

658
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:51,248
So because we will build this 2025 schedule and program, we can start setting some of this participation more or less dates so that we can start working on this.

659
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,391
Thank you.

660
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:55,131
Thank you, Paula.

661
01:10:57,481 --> 01:11:04,744
So with that, unless someone else has entered the city hall physically, I'm not seeing it.

662
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:06,085
There's no one in the chamber, no.

663
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:13,047
Yeah, not seeing any other folks who'd like to do public participation.

664
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:14,848
So we'll close that.

665
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:18,910
And with that, do we have any motions on the floor?

666
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,350
Motion to adjourn.

667
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:21,651
We have a second.

668
01:11:26,873 --> 01:11:27,153
Second.

669
01:11:28,134 --> 01:11:28,594
Thank you.

670
01:11:29,795 --> 01:11:35,060
On the motion to adjourn by Council President Baird, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

671
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:39,103

01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:40,004
Yes.

673
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:41,525
Councilor Callahan?

674
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:42,226
Yes.

675
01:11:43,226 --> 01:11:44,567
Vice President Collins is absent.

676
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:45,808
Councilor Scarpelli?

677
01:11:46,689 --> 01:11:46,969
Yes.

678
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:48,170

679
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:49,131
Yes.

680
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:51,533
Four in the affirmative, one absent.

681
01:11:51,593 --> 01:11:52,274
Motion passes.

682
01:11:52,294 --> 01:11:53,195
The meeting is adjourned.

683
01:11:53,235 --> 01:11:56,137
