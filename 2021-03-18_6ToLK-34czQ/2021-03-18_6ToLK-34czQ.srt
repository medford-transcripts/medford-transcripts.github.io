00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

26
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:33,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am just going to read from our agenda with our introduction.

27
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:44,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So please be advised that on Thursday, March 18, 2021, from 5 to 6.30, there is a behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

28
00:03:45,214 --> 00:04:04,079
[SPEAKER_17]: The purpose of the Thursday, March 18, 2021 Behavioral Health and Special Ed Subcommittee is to address best practices and policies for creating trauma-informed schools under the behavioral health category and building community and school-based friendships for students with disabilities under the special education category.

29
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law,

30
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:15,290
[SPEAKER_17]: and the governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.

38
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:17,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

39
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:32,252
[SPEAKER_17]: So a map of our agenda today, you can expect from roughly 5 to 5.45, we'll be focusing on behavioral health and trauma-informed schools.

40
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Director of Guidance, Stacey Shulman,

41
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:52,600
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll talk with us regarding mental health and behavioral health and returning students to school, including immediate need for trauma-informed care, social-emotional health in comparison to academic recoupment, school counseling and mental health considerations for revamping the system.

42
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,541
[SPEAKER_17]: And then 545 to 630, we will discuss

43
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:02,248
[SPEAKER_17]: with the Director of Speech and Language, Susanna Campbell.

44
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:12,356
[SPEAKER_17]: She had shared some, or we had shared some online resources for use by general education, special education, English learners, and families that we'll share a little bit on.

45
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:26,666
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have an update on the Common Ground program that we've been talking about in previous meetings, an update on Medford Recreation and some conversations we've been having around building friendships and inclusive recreation.

46
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,369
[SPEAKER_17]: and an update on the inclusive playground that's in the process.

47
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,951
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's our agenda, and we'll finish at 6.30.

48
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:42,134
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to start, if I could, let me just see for a second.

49
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I have to go between screens.

50
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,756
[SPEAKER_17]: How many folks we have on?

51
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:51,099
[SPEAKER_17]: I think everyone here recognizes and knows each other, so we're not gonna do,

52
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,704
[SPEAKER_17]: introductions again if that's okay with everybody.

53
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:56,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that okay?

54
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:57,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Thumbs up?

55
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:57,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah?

56
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:58,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

57
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:11,219
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to have Stacey Shulman maybe start the conversation, if you would, Stacey, on what is happening for being trauma-informed as we're returning students to school, please.

58
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

59
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the

60
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,685
[SPEAKER_09]: the things that we've done all year and we keep advertising is the increased group counseling that we're offering for students.

61
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:35,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So specifically at the high school, we now are up to offering six different groups from a general supporting students to a focused cognitive behavioral therapy based anxiety and depression group.

62
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:36,896
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a grief group.

63
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a new students group.

64
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:55,689
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Councilors also, which is new in the last few weeks, pushing into the EL classrooms specifically because those teachers noted that English language learners were seemingly having an increase in difficulty.

65
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are some of the supports at the high school level.

66
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:04,873
[SPEAKER_09]: The middle school level has also formed groups as well, supportive groups.

67
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:12,826
[SPEAKER_09]: more gear towards 7th and 8th graders and individual supports for 6th graders as well.

68
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And elementary is case-by-case basis.

69
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of those supports are push into the classroom and lunch groups.

70
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:24,070
[SPEAKER_09]: They also have some individual counseling as well for case-by-case basis.

71
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:32,493
[SPEAKER_09]: What we are seeing is that students are acclimating pretty well to coming into the building and those students who are currently coming in

72
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:35,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We expect to continue coming in well.

73
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:45,824
[SPEAKER_09]: The challenge is for those students who have remained remote this whole time and how we're going to prepare for them next year and some of those supports.

74
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:56,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're starting to think about creative ways, specifically maintaining outreach over the summer and making sure students have an opportunity to tour the buildings before they come back in.

75
00:08:57,006 --> 00:09:00,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are some of the really basic things that we can do.

76
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:14,098
[SPEAKER_09]: for students outside of figuring out individual need for them and continuing group supports and education for all staff in terms of trauma informed classrooms.

77
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Stacey.

78
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:29,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I wanted to ask, I did have the opportunity to speak with a parent today who is interested in being engaged on the matter of sort of mental health and behavioral health and was asking just sort of about some of the

79
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:50,974
[SPEAKER_17]: social, emotional needs of our students right now and how, you know, how they might be addressed, not just through school adjustment Councilors necessarily, or even guidance, but even more so sort of just collectively in the school setting around social engagement and being able to sort of interact with each other in some ways.

80
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:59,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, I don't know if any of you had the opportunity to see the ed talk recently with the seniors, some of the seniors sharing their experience.

81
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:01,794
[SPEAKER_17]: and feelings of isolation.

82
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:09,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, it was a really poignant, I thought, presentation by the students.

83
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:17,723
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that they, you know, being the age they are and the grade they are, they're able to articulate a lot better than maybe younger kids would be.

84
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:28,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And so certainly from families, we're hearing a lot of this isolation and loneliness and sort of need for community and engagement.

85
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:43,813
[SPEAKER_17]: as a group, not just Stacey, obviously, because Stacey, I know it's not just your job, but as a group, how are we thinking about the social and emotional needs of our students and being able to sort of address that for them?

86
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:55,359
[SPEAKER_17]: So for example, somebody was saying, like, can we not do like a barbecue in the, you know, in the parking lot or just anything to sort of have them get to be able to have some social engagement with each other?

87
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,222
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought, you know, obviously it's an interesting idea.

88
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:02,584
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know everybody's super swamped right now with the return to school.

89
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:16,435
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the family engagement piece is a really important piece of it, because I think that there's a lot of community members that have some great ideas and probably would be also willing to volunteer in those projects.

90
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:20,378
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess I just want to put that out there for folks and see what the response is on that.

91
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:37,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the other things before we talk about community engagement that I should have mentioned is that the both middle school principals and the high school principal offered us graciously their meeting time in early April to restart the Sandy Hook promise campaign, which begins with start with hello.

92
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:46,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if I've mentioned this before in the summer of 2019, we signed on for an exclusive opportunity with the district attorney's office,

93
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:52,181
[SPEAKER_09]: districts in the Massachusetts were given the opportunity to sign on and partner with Sandy Hook Promise.

94
00:11:52,942 --> 00:12:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: They go through many of reviews in terms of student supports, mental health, signs to look out for, how to educate staff, how to educate students.

95
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:04,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And the opening message that they give is start with hello.

96
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're doing that the first week of April.

97
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:09,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a six through 12 program.

98
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:13,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's also some educational resources given to elementary.

99
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:24,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be providing that presentation for all of the middle and high school staff and then planning opportunities probably in the advisory and wind blocks for how to roll that out to students as well.

100
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:28,743
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really good to hear.

101
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:38,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And will that be offered or will the families or school committee members or others be invited to be part of that or?

102
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:43,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We can figure out a time for that in terms of family engagement, certainly.

103
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:47,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think that would be great.

104
00:12:47,418 --> 00:13:04,526
[SPEAKER_17]: I should also say that I think probably a lot of you know if you're in the school committee meeting, you know that Medford is one of four districts that is partnering with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education on a family and community engagement project.

105
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:09,148
[SPEAKER_17]: So we put an application in for that, and we were one of the four districts across the state chosen.

106
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,449
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's really exciting.

107
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,790
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're working with a group called School in Maine.

108
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:25,395
[SPEAKER_17]: think school and main streets and the convergence of community and school, that's sort of how they're named, school in Maine, and that's why they're named that way.

109
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:31,919
[SPEAKER_17]: And as consultants for really helping us build our family and community engagement and outreach.

110
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:43,526
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that I certainly want to continue to be putting on the table as part of the planning is the mental health component and the social emotional health component on that.

111
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,347
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll definitely be able to

112
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:46,533
[SPEAKER_17]: include that.

113
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:50,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I'm looking for sort of some recommendations or some discussion around this here.

114
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:54,354
[SPEAKER_17]: If other folks want to chime in, you can unmute yourself if you like.

115
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:57,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Melanie?

116
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Paulette, member of NDQ.

117
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:04,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I had sort of a question, comment, a little bit different than where you're going right there.

118
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:13,998
[SPEAKER_16]: But just in terms of thinking about our kids, I know that last week I had occasion to have to go down to Mass General Hospital to see a friend.

119
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:18,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, my reaction was there was all these people there.

120
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,380
[SPEAKER_16]: What were they all doing there?

121
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,882
[SPEAKER_16]: I was used to being in spaces that were very distant.

122
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,883
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of a sudden there were lots of people.

123
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:29,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's wearing masks and all that.

124
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,385
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I'm kind of wondering about kids.

125
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:37,408
[SPEAKER_16]: And Stacey kind of veered in when you mentioned, you know, all the kids who've been on remote all the time.

126
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:41,950
[SPEAKER_16]: But as we are looking for kids coming back into school who have been

127
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,475
[SPEAKER_16]: given this message over and over again to keep their distance.

128
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:52,040
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're potentially going down and you know from 6 feet to 3 feet.

129
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:58,527
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I know how I reacted I and I've talked to other people and they've had similar reactions so what about kids.

130
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:07,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so that is definitely a holistic issue for our society at large.

131
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:15,184
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an article recently and I forget specifically where it was, but it was talking about re-engagement anxiety.

132
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:25,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was sort of like people who are now noticing things such as the volume of the public inside Mass General, right?

133
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that looks like and how that sort of takes you back

134
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly I think everyone is experiencing that.

135
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:42,075
[SPEAKER_09]: What we've noticed from students is that the bulk of them have a little bit more flexibility because of their age.

136
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:54,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's sort of the benefit, especially for very young children, is that if you think about it, really little kids are constantly, and it continues up, but are constantly being told,

137
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,403
[SPEAKER_09]: to adjust what their view of the world is, right?

138
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:02,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we do this, now we do that, put this on, do this, whatever.

139
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're like, oh, now I wear a mask.

140
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:04,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I can do that.

141
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, this is a bell curve, right?

142
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:13,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are some students on either end who don't fit into that.

143
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:23,053
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we are seeing students who have difficulty thinking about coming back in the building, certainly, and who are choosing to remain remote,

144
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:40,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some hope over the social engagement that students will elect to do over the summer based on our community rates of the virus, more people being vaccinated, other things will open.

145
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:43,770
[SPEAKER_09]: They may choose to elect to participate in other things with their friends.

146
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:54,500
[SPEAKER_09]: And sort of re acclimate in that way but I certainly think we will have a good amount of students who feel very anxious, coming back to school with a large volume of students next year.

147
00:16:55,281 --> 00:17:03,830
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering about the short term the kids who are coming back in, you know, in the coming weeks to all of a sudden, you know, four day or five day learning.

148
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:11,142
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, what we're thinking about and helping them adjust to this, more bodies.

149
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,446
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I'm really thinking about the kids who are prone to anxiety already.

150
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:16,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

151
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:21,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, I mean, we certainly are offering a lot of groups now that they can elect to come to.

152
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, it's just reaching out to your Councilor.

153
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:33,421
[SPEAKER_09]: parent or student, certainly at the upper levels and elementary parents, to talk to us about challenges that students are having.

154
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:41,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we talking to teachers at all about, you know, having them be watching for this kind of anxiety?

155
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:49,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so that's part of all of the sort of Sandy Hook promise information as well, to start with hello.

156
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:55,601
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, what are you looking for symptoms that may be outside of the norm that someone is saying they need help?

157
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

158
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Heather?

159
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:01,467
[SPEAKER_18]: McKinnon?

160
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, sorry, I was having trouble unmuting.

161
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:26,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So the January, February issue of Harvard Magazine is titled Loneliness, The Psychology and Social Cost of Isolation.

162
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty terrific.

163
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:59,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The title article is really fantastic, but it touches on sort of the bigger costs of this pandemic and how maintaining closer and deeper relationships has really been the deep cost that now people are having these more surface relationships

164
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And acquaintanceships.

165
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:13,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, sort of having those in depth relationships is much harder and anxiety prone people are impact.

166
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:21,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Having more of that panic when they have to get closer and they have to go more in-depth with people.

167
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:44,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So Just to echo that I I do think these are really serious issues for our anxiety from students for any at-risk students who may have issues where they are Nervous about being in bigger groups of people where they might be afraid to be closer to people

168
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:51,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you for your work that you're doing to protect the well-being of our students.

169
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

170
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Heather, thank you for that.

171
00:19:54,672 --> 00:20:11,545
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think that like, as we're thinking about, you know, again, you know, looking out for these signs of social anxiety and loneliness among our students, you know, there's also, there are also our students who can't communicate with words and communicate with behavior.

172
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:19,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And so really being able to train staff to understand that, you know, behavior is a form of communication as well.

173
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:28,209
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I know for us this morning, just getting ready this morning, getting, helping our daughter, our 13 year old daughter, Gracie, get ready this morning.

174
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:31,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And she burst into tears quite unexpectedly.

175
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,591
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was like, you know, what's going on?

176
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:37,033
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, trying to start talking with her about it.

177
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:41,155
[SPEAKER_17]: And then she said, you know, she was able to articulate and it was so moving, she said,

178
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,178
[SPEAKER_17]: know, I want COVID to go away.

179
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:48,780
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and it was so sad, because it was like, oh, you know, yeah, of course you do, like we all do.

180
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,801
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's getting better or whatever else.

181
00:20:50,821 --> 00:21:00,066
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that the community as a whole, especially maybe with the one year mark, you know, the anniversary, I think a lot of people, I mean, everyone I'm talking to right now is feeling overwhelmed.

182
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:03,948
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, just out of sorts.

183
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,869
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think especially as we're thinking about bringing our

184
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:19,026
[SPEAKER_17]: are kids who are our most vulnerable population, whether they have, you know, a disability or don't, I mean, children are our most vulnerable population community.

185
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:23,210
[SPEAKER_17]: And so thinking about that, in a broader context, I think is so important.

186
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:34,400
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, I guess, having listened to one of our community members yesterday, too, and I hear that, you know, the social anxiety and the isolation and also sort of maybe introducing it in in

187
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,736
[SPEAKER_17]: scaffolding right like if you think about special education, you can sort of scaffold steps to before you get to the step that.

188
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:49,264
[SPEAKER_17]: You know you're hoping to achieve, but even scaffolding some of the the social and emotional around the relationships like somebody was you know, suggesting.

189
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:58,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Like why not offer hikes right instead of like even like, and this is to the next subject in our agenda, I guess, transitioning to the next subject in our agenda, which is.

190
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:03,460
[SPEAKER_17]: social emotional health versus academic recruitment, right?

191
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And sort of how those two are pulling at each other and what we're doing around that, right?

192
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:20,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if we're, everybody's so hyper-focused on academic recruitment, and we're not really looking at the social emotional and mental health, like our kids can't show up to learn if they don't have the first, you know, Maslow hierarchy of needs, right?

193
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:24,995
[SPEAKER_17]: If we don't have our basic needs taken care of, we're not gonna be able to show up for higher learning.

194
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:27,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that that's a really important piece.

195
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:44,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there was a community member who said like, why not like have a class or, you know, instead of having the class remote, which is, you know, the kids are so tired of anyway in school, um, reverse remote, like why not have an opportunity to, I don't know, make a hike in the fells or what have you.

196
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:51,231
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that's thinking outside of the conventional box of education, but I think that these are extraordinary times.

197
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:54,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm wondering sort of what people think of that idea.

198
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather, rooming up.

199
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I apologize for being late.

200
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:14,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a work emergency, but I'm just happy to be here and The I've just been thinking about this a lot.

201
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a senior and a sophomore and two older kids and my licensed social worker and

202
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,398
[SPEAKER_06]: just seeing what I see in my office.

203
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:33,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with a lot of teenagers and young adults, and it's just, I just feel like they are craving the social interaction, obviously, like not on Zoom.

204
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And anything that can be done

205
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:43,829
[SPEAKER_06]: to increase that outside or just like the fun of like the enthusiasm of school.

206
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:52,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my own kids, like my son's a senior and he's debating, like he goes because he knows it's good for him.

207
00:23:52,032 --> 00:24:01,895
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes the two days, but there aren't a lot of kids that are there and he's just craving like interacting with them and doing something fun with them besides sitting in a classroom.

208
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, whether that be, I mean, like Melanie was saying, you know, going for a hike or just having a fun day at school where maybe they just go to class and every teacher just does a, you know, it's a free day where the teachers that are doing their, you know, a hobby with them or doing yoga or bringing them for a hike or bringing them outside and, you know, just talking and, um, just they love not having homework the other day.

209
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a.

210
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:54,596
[SPEAKER_06]: yesterday I think no no homework was allowed and that for my kids was such a relief just to not have to do any work after school and just be able to totally shut down and go I mean they went outside and played basketball last night like they just need more and I think there's ways that we can think outside the box and do safe things especially with the weather getting nice that are totally interactive and

211
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:58,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Like having kids, you know, teachers go teach on the field.

212
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:05,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand there's like different restrictions, but I feel like we need to make the rest of the year as fun as possible.

213
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:07,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, to be honest, like, I'm not sure.

214
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,860
[SPEAKER_06]: like Melanie was saying, they're not going to learn if they're not enjoying school.

215
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:22,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of the kids that are staying remote are like, what's the point of getting out of bed and getting dressed and doing all this stuff if I'm just going to sit in a classroom and learn on a screen?

216
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:32,273
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think if there was some exciting things to look forward to and they could be outside a little more or they heard that things were a little more interactive, I think it would bring a lot of enthusiasm.

217
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:51,997
[SPEAKER_06]: social emotional health to the kids so I mean I have a bunch of ideas but I don't like this things like doing my son had brought up like senior assassin thing is that a possibility to do something like that or a scavenger hunt or like doing like an amazing race type activity where they

218
00:25:52,797 --> 00:26:16,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I'm on the PTO and we're happy to, like, do some of this stuff, but, like, could it be stuff that we would do during the school day and, like, teachers, almost like a field day where the teachers wouldn't be involved but have it be safe or, like, there's, like, a Where's Waldo game that you can do outside, just, I don't know, anything like that, so, or a game day.

219
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:19,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Heather.

220
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's really

221
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:26,257
[SPEAKER_17]: important for us to be thinking about the social emotional and the kids are telling us that this is what they need.

222
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:30,180
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's not like it's just that the families that are saying this, but.

223
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:34,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanine has her hand raised and then Alex, please.

224
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,388
[SPEAKER_18]: And Shanine, if you don't mind just introducing yourself.

225
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:41,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, you're muted.

226
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Introduce yourself and sort of, you know, your role here, if you would.

227
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:48,459
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

228
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:48,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

229
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So my name is Shanine Pelliquin.

230
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a recreation therapist, certified therapeutic recreation specialist and a developmental specialist.

231
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:59,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And I study children's self-directed play and inclusion.

232
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:06,631
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been working with the rec department, as well as lots of conversations with several of you over the years in various roles.

233
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to echo what Heather was saying, but add a little piece of the

234
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:19,799
[SPEAKER_08]: The research is pretty clear that the benefits of play come when it is self-directed, not when it's another adult-directed activity.

235
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:36,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we need to do is, and no way to diminish the ideas of like a scavenger hunt or whatever, but really what they need is time together on the playground without an adult saying, this is what we're playing right now, and this is how many paper butterflies we're making today, and this is the product that you're going to have at the end of it.

236
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:40,083
[SPEAKER_08]: They just need to play.

237
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the playground or a car park yesterday and I've never known so many parents at the playground at one time.

238
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:59,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's really interesting to see the different dynamics of groups and from our tiny ones to the third graders that they have lost a lot of the basic social skills.

239
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:05,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Even kids in the general ed curriculum, the general ed population who are like, they don't know how to go say, will you play with me?

240
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,721
[SPEAKER_08]: what if we did this, those negotiation skills.

241
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:16,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And that happens when there are not adults telling them what to do, but supporting them when needed.

242
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:29,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if it's training for teachers or just conversations about how to facilitate and have a very light touch when you are supporting kids play or, you know,

243
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,346
[SPEAKER_08]: having more recess, right?

244
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:44,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe that's just what we need or intentional after school time where kids can stay later on a given day and just have their classroom on the playground for a while or two classrooms mixed.

245
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:51,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what the guidelines could be, but that's what's going to help heal kids' hearts is time with their friends.

246
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not product based.

247
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,740
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

248
00:28:58,277 --> 00:28:59,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Shanine.

249
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Alex, and then member Rousseau, do you want to point of privilege, or will Alex?

250
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, Alex, and then member Rousseau.

251
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:17,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, hi.

252
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:22,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So two things that I would like to mention and I mentioned it last time I think but I want to say it again.

253
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that I really think, and I hope that we are going to rethink homework, because at least for elementary and middle school I, I feel like whatever regression my son had is not because he missed homework.

254
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:54,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that there is going to be a discussion about that because it really helped us have this time after school where he can play a little and just, you know, just be together as a family and not have that stress of rushing to do homework after my work.

255
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one point.

256
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:56,673
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is I

257
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:09,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to like the previous speaker said you know more time outside I think is going to be crucial and in elementary school, a lot of play but also in middle school and high school.

258
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:13,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that we can use maybe the after school clubs and

259
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:30,663
[SPEAKER_03]: have several of them outside and have projects and even the unified arts maybe can be thought in such a way that the kids have projects and they can interact more or they can go outside more.

260
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:35,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking a little bit outside the box to distress these kids.

261
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:39,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Alex.

262
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:40,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Ruseau.

263
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

264
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:55,220
[SPEAKER_11]: When I listen to what I'm hearing, I can't help but also think about the drumbeat of everybody's losing all this academic time.

265
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess I'm just wondering, are teachers getting a message from administration?

266
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're certainly not getting it from the governor and the Department of Ed.

267
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:07,489
[SPEAKER_11]: They're getting the message that you've got to get these kids back up to the

268
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,241
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever that bar was.

269
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:13,923
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the public conversation is.

270
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:33,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to make sure that teachers are getting the, from administration are getting the message that that actually isn't the most important thing here that like the kids need something that you may not have normally had to focus on in such an intense way.

271
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:37,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they don't get that message, then they have

272
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:38,371
[SPEAKER_11]: mixed signals.

273
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:49,717
[SPEAKER_11]: They have the, you know, your kids aren't getting through your class with the knowledge they need and teachers, you know, they're professionals who have to beat targets and all this other stuff too.

274
00:31:49,797 --> 00:32:04,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just wondering if there is an active messaging to teachers to make sure that they understand that not hitting targets that are artificial and external is okay.

275
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it has to actually be said that it's okay.

276
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:32,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know that, you know, and like, we aren't talking about AP classes right now, but I know that when school started, there were plenty of parents who were freaking out about that people were being taught in AP classes because the exam is the exam is the exam, like nothing matters other than getting your kid to the exam and passing it.

277
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:34,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And so,

278
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:40,534
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, that seemed like an unmovable situation.

279
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know much about AP.

280
00:32:43,395 --> 00:33:02,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Dr. Cushing knows plenty about it, but I'm just wondering if the teachers are getting a consistent message that this is as important, and frankly, if not, in my opinion, more important than meeting MCAS targets and other academic goals.

281
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:10,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I can talk to the AP exam if that's helpful.

282
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So the AP exam is not a requirement of the course.

283
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,611
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of that extra bonus that you can take.

284
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,111
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a cost to it.

285
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:23,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It's run and organized by the college board.

286
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:34,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you receive a certain score and go on to college, there is potential your college will accept that high school class as a full course for college.

287
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:42,695
[SPEAKER_09]: So for many students, it saves them up to a semester, if not a year going into college, which is a huge benefit.

288
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:53,212
[SPEAKER_09]: The challenge is in order to be an approved AP course, you have to submit your syllabus the summer before it's approved by the college board and there's no wavering from that.

289
00:33:53,893 --> 00:34:01,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So outside of like the standards from the school, from like curriculum directors and pacing and all that, it's sort of like a separate entity.

290
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:05,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And the college board has been pretty unwavering in that this year.

291
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:10,822
[SPEAKER_09]: There are different times to take the exams.

292
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:14,625
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a little later this year because of the late start.

293
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:18,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's an additional support.

294
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:30,897
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of pacing and progress, the college board is aggressive of keeping kids on track because ultimately what they're saying is, we want you to be able to be successful on this test.

295
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:38,925
[SPEAKER_09]: in order to provide you this ultimate bonus for your future, as well as some other extras.

296
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:42,906
[SPEAKER_09]: But some students say, I don't want to take the exam.

297
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:43,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no interest in that.

298
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:47,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll sort of do my own thing in this class.

299
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's totally acceptable too.

300
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:52,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

301
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:55,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Galussi, I just also want to point out we have about

302
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:01,311
[SPEAKER_17]: seven or so more minutes left to this behavioral health section of our meeting.

303
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:01,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

304
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to respond just at the elementary level.

305
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:15,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, two of the programs that we utilize in every school at every grade, one is through Stacy's department, but it's zones of regulation.

306
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And that program, that language that teachers and

307
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:39,161
[SPEAKER_07]: people in Stacy's department Councilors use with staff is it's utilized every day as part of morning meeting and is throughout the day and if you're not in the green zone you're not ready to learn and so that's a big focus especially k-2 but it is utilized throughout elementary.

308
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: This year we also made sure that responsive classroom was a part of every school.

309
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:58,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So, students in every elementary school are starting the day in a morning meeting, which the whole entire focus of morning meeting is on the social emotional well being of students and building a supportive culture in every classroom.

310
00:35:59,311 --> 00:35:59,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to

311
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,872
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that that continues next year.

312
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:07,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also upping the training for some train the trainers models over the summer.

313
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:24,057
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is we have grade we've done district-wide grade level common planning meetings this year and one of the things that I spoke to the CPT coordinators for is the focus on when when students are coming back from hybrid

314
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: or remote, however it is, but into full-time, that that first week really has to be the focus, really has to be on the social-emotional piece, on building that culture and those expectations all over again, with academics not being the main focus.

315
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:48,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was discussed at common planning times, which I'm also going to reiterate in a memo at the end of this week to the elementary staff.

316
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:52,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for sharing that Ms.

317
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:53,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Galussi.

318
00:36:53,677 --> 00:37:00,661
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess from a broader perspective, is there any sort of, I know that you said you have the Sandy Hook Promise program that's coming up.

319
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:13,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Stacey, is there any sort of broader training or anything that's happening around, you know, the trauma piece for the return to school specifically?

320
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:20,675
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that there are these individual programs, but there's anything, you know, addressing sort of the specific COVID

321
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:28,516
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, resulting trauma and returning to schools that you guys are aware of for the staff.

322
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:36,042
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I haven't seen any, I mean, there are certainly a lot of trainings for clinicians regarding COVID-19 care.

323
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:40,486
[SPEAKER_09]: right, and how this has affected everyone.

324
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:49,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen anything specifically broad base for school staff, teachers outside of trauma.

325
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:54,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are looking at several grants to provide additional trauma training for our staff.

326
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,464
[SPEAKER_09]: 11 of our school clinicians will be going out to become certified

327
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:07,249
[SPEAKER_09]: child and adolescent trauma specialists this spring and be able to, and from there, they'll be able to provide training to our staff.

328
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:16,395
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the best models that I've seen in terms of providing professional development on a continuous and programmatic basis is to have internal trainers.

329
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:26,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So not only do we have 12 certified child and adolescent anxiety specialists now, but we'll have 11 certified child and adolescent trauma specialists.

330
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

331
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,242
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just finishing up some notes.

332
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:53,733
[SPEAKER_17]: So next month we were talking about, you know, really sort of solidifying, you know, what recommendations the behavioral health subcommittee wants to put forward to the school committee for the May presentation.

333
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:57,996
[SPEAKER_17]: So next month would really be thinking about how our conversations and our meetings

334
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:12,206
[SPEAKER_17]: translate into policy and what we actually want to put forward as potential recommendations for, not potential, as recommendations to school committee for our March, I mean our May presentation.

335
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:14,227
[SPEAKER_17]: So that will be our next meeting.

336
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:18,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any last thoughts before we transition?

337
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

338
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirate?

339
00:39:27,943 --> 00:39:30,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheila is muted, she had her hand up.

340
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:35,885
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

341
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:46,387
[SPEAKER_01]: To bounce off what Suzanne was saying, even using the zones of regulation in the preschool, I'm one of the MEEP preschool teachers, like we start our day off with that, how the kids are feeling.

342
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:49,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also do the responsive classroom too.

343
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:52,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe that's made a huge difference

344
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:56,872
[SPEAKER_01]: this year because we start our day, you know, how does everybody feel?

345
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:59,775
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can you, how can we help you to feel better?

346
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:05,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in preschool, I mean, they get those zones and the responsive classroom has been huge this year.

347
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really seen, you know, I just feel more of a sense of community, I think.

348
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:15,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes the kids feel comfortable and safe too, to let them know that it's okay if you're in the red zone.

349
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say that all the time, you know,

350
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:43,565
[SPEAKER_01]: can we get you out of the red zone or and you know you might change you might be in the green zone now maybe in an hour you'll be in the red zone but that's okay and just to reiterate that and i think that's just making them feel more comfortable but the responsive classroom i've seen a big difference doing that too as far as the kids feeling more comfortable and more safe so i think that's been helpful yes thank you

351
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:53,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I think I'd like everyone to sort of take a moment, take a deep breath.

352
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,542
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna transition to our other identity in this subcommittee.

353
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:02,464
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want, you can reflect on what zone you're in right now.

354
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:15,090
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are going to transition over to building friendships and community for students with and without disabilities.

355
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:24,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Our topic under this from 545 to 630 will be, would love to hear from Susanna.

356
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:35,860
[SPEAKER_17]: I did, you should have received a link earlier today for the online resources that Susanna and her team and staff at our schools have helped create.

357
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,420
[SPEAKER_17]: They're really remarkable.

358
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:40,462
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe Susanna can give us an update on that in a moment.

359
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:43,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're going to talk about common ground with an update on that.

360
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:46,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford Recreation and Inclusive Playground.

361
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:58,550
[SPEAKER_17]: So Susanna, would you like to sort of start us off on the online resources a little bit, maybe the sort of origin of it and how it's working and how and whether people are accessing them?

362
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm unmuted now, thank you.

363
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:22,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so we have a lot of resources that have been collected and created by a number of educators throughout the district.

364
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:32,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, the resources that we have available are so vast that it's almost a little hard to know where to start.

365
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:36,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that what might make the most sense

366
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:50,657
[SPEAKER_10]: is for us to look at the website that I created for the disability awareness course, because all of the links to various resources are right there.

367
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:57,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And it might be the easiest for everyone to be able to access, because it's laid out in a user-friendly way.

368
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:06,646
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that what I'll do is I'll put the link to the website into the chat, if I'm able, so that everybody has it.

369
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:22,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and now I'll just share my screen so that you can all see what I'm looking at.

370
00:43:34,468 --> 00:43:34,828
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

371
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:52,049
[SPEAKER_10]: This website has a variety of resources, including all of the PowerPoint presentations and so forth that were part of the disability awareness professional development that was presented online this year.

372
00:43:52,769 --> 00:44:02,713
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also a lot of good background information that is linked throughout as well, including information about the Americans with Disabilities Act and so forth.

373
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the main page.

374
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:17,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are, you know, a number of PowerPoint presentations that people can look through, including the one that Melanie McLaughlin presented on the first day of that workshop.

375
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:19,999
[SPEAKER_10]: The second tab.

376
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:23,118
[SPEAKER_10]: on this website is labeled resources.

377
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to give you a sense of what that looks like.

378
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:31,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's really vast.

379
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that, you know, people can kind of

380
00:44:35,977 --> 00:44:43,944
[SPEAKER_10]: take it, you know, one day at a time, or, you know, one area of interest at a time, or the student who they have in front of them in the classroom.

381
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:48,548
[SPEAKER_10]: But it, you know, it starts off with just identifying what ableism is.

382
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:54,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's many, many resources, both in the folders, as well as links on the right hand side.

383
00:44:54,513 --> 00:44:56,375
[SPEAKER_10]: So the folders contain PDFs.

384
00:44:57,015 --> 00:45:02,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And the right-hand side, all of these blue, all the blue text is a hyperlink.

385
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:14,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So it goes all the way through, you know, how to avoid ableism, IEPs and transition, disability etiquette, diagnosis-specific resources, adapted books.

386
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:20,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's two things that I really want to point out that I feel like are helpful to everybody.

387
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:25,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And these were both created by the librarians in our district.

388
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first one is here with this hyperlink.

389
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And this brings you to a list of some universal design for learning resources that we have in district.

390
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:44,548
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that these are all things that people might want to be aware of in terms of

391
00:45:45,364 --> 00:45:58,694
[SPEAKER_10]: having access to different features that would help students have access to curriculum and also, you know, to things they might be reading or looking at for enjoyment as well.

392
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:03,117
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing I want to point out on that resource page is this

393
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:13,174
[SPEAKER_10]: right here where the books are is another resource that Chris Johnson, one of the librarians created.

394
00:46:13,194 --> 00:46:24,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you look at that, she has a beautiful write-up of how to create a diverse library, either in your classroom or at a school or district level.

395
00:46:24,678 --> 00:46:28,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she even went and compiled a huge number of books.

396
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,944
[SPEAKER_10]: that talk about, you know, what grade level they are, and all of these have positive representations of individuals with disabilities.

397
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:52,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And she talks about, you know, what kind of the topic is so that if, you know, teachers have a student in their classroom who might have one of those diagnoses that they would be able to kind of pick something out and maybe use it within their classroom to have a positive representation that the student could relate to.

398
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:56,230
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the resource page.

399
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:09,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last thing, the third page, Melanie had provided a link to the lesson plans from 2019, but we now have the lesson plans for 2019 and 2021.

400
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:21,587
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all in a Google Drive system, but you can just click on the link and it will take you to the 2019 options and they're organized by grade level.

401
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:27,560
[SPEAKER_10]: or you can look at the 2021 options, and they again are organized by grade level.

402
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things aren't really grade level specific, such as behavior.

403
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:42,270
[SPEAKER_10]: This was done by one of our behavior specialists at the elementary level, and nursing, some are unified arts, but in general, if it falls into a grade level, they're organized in that manner.

404
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to point that out and then if it's okay, there's one other thing that I, I'm just going to look at my fellow universal safety committee members here because there's many of you in the room.

405
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:01,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you feel like we should just look at that website since it's now live?

406
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:04,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's so many resources on there for the social stories.

407
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:05,985
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'm getting nods.

408
00:48:06,145 --> 00:48:07,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and show that too.

409
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:11,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is now on the school website

410
00:48:12,938 --> 00:48:14,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just find it.

411
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:30,264
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a, we worked on this in the Universal Safety Committee and we compiled social stories that can be used across grade levels and across situations.

412
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:36,426
[SPEAKER_10]: So it starts off very simply, you know, what is a social story and gives background on about that.

413
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:40,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all of these are categorized into COVID-19 information.

414
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:57,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Visuals to use in hallways social emotional stories, many of these were made by Stacey Shulman staff and they share those for this website, returning to the school building remote learning social stories hybrid learning zoom visuals, and then school safety.

415
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,951
[SPEAKER_10]: including things like, you know, social stories about fire drills, lockdown procedures, etc.

416
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:18,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are various social stories that have been created across the district for a number of years, but they're finally in a little bit more of a user-friendly format for anybody to look at and share.

417
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:23,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, Paul Texera, he and I have been talking about

418
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:28,776
[SPEAKER_10]: how we can incorporate some EL stories in here as well.

419
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said that his staff often create books.

420
00:49:34,377 --> 00:49:35,537
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't call them social stories.

421
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a different lens, but they create books for their students.

422
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:40,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be incorporating those on the website as well.

423
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:46,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's going to find some of the most useful for his students.

424
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:52,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And then those will be translated into various languages for kids who need those.

425
00:49:52,778 --> 00:49:54,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a little bit of an overview.

426
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:58,641
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also the friendship guide that you had shared last time, Melanie, that was put out by the ARC.

427
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:01,362
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just a little bit of a tour.

428
00:50:01,402 --> 00:50:03,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything else you wanted me to share?

429
00:50:03,263 --> 00:50:05,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Susanna, I think that's excellent.

430
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:07,686
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so exciting to see all those resources.

431
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:09,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for sharing them with us.

432
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:21,213
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really excited about the collaboration between you and Paul and getting some of these resources in various languages and thinking about how, you know,

433
00:50:22,629 --> 00:50:32,597
[SPEAKER_17]: EL and special education and general education work together and bringing down some of those silos that can typically, you know, happen in those in districts.

434
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:33,718
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm excited.

435
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:34,519
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it looks great.

436
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for all that hard work.

437
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,241
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

438
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:37,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy to share.

439
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:38,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

440
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,706
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I wanted to, sorry, bear with me one second.

441
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:50,743
[SPEAKER_17]: update on common ground.

442
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:54,004
[SPEAKER_17]: And so Mr. Skorka and Ms.

443
00:50:54,084 --> 00:51:01,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre were not able to join us today, but I wanted to share just a little bit of an update on some of the things that we have been discussing.

444
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:17,891
[SPEAKER_17]: So for folks that may not have been in previous meetings, we have been talking about, you know, a program that could be created or exist in our school that is really being mindful in terms of fostering friendships

445
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:21,109
[SPEAKER_17]: between students with and without disabilities.

446
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:39,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Because again, while they were talking earlier about play and the importance of having individualized or free play, it is also important to be able to have some guidance around building friendships for students, especially for whom that can be a little bit more difficult.

447
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:46,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I did send you all a copy of the toolkit that the Arc of Mass created.

448
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:47,595
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a friendship.

449
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:56,659
[SPEAKER_17]: um, building toolkit that I really want to think about as a foundational sort of, um, document as we're thinking about what this looks like.

450
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:08,003
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we, we had a couple of parents, um, reach out to us from the autism support group, um, Heather and, um, Marissa, uh, a year or more ago, pre COVID anyway.

451
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:14,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So another lifetime ago, actually, we, um, met with, um, best buddies.

452
00:52:14,988 --> 00:52:18,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had a conversation around what that could look like in schools.

453
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,191
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, COVID happened.

454
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:25,633
[SPEAKER_17]: And then sons have been talking about programs that already exist in our schools and what those look like.

455
00:52:25,673 --> 00:52:30,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And so Common Ground is a program at the high school that Ms.

456
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:38,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre, who is a special education teacher, and Mr. Skorka, who is a general education teacher, have been working on together in a co-taught sort of way.

457
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:55,797
[SPEAKER_17]: where they do reverse inclusion, essentially, which is bringing students without disabilities into the classroom with students with disabilities and having them foster friendships among themselves and, you know, with the syllabus and, I mean, with a goal and a sort of more coordinated effort.

458
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:58,179
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Skorka and Ms.

459
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:04,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre and others have been talking about really incorporating this as not just

460
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:06,003
[SPEAKER_17]: HAB-Charlotte Pittsburgh.:

461
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:10,286
[SPEAKER_17]: : An option, you know, something fun or interesting for kids to do, but actually HAB-Charlotte Pittsburgh.:

462
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:12,308
[SPEAKER_17]: : As a course and looking at, you know, potential syllabus.

463
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:14,590
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Joan, I know that you are from our last meeting notes.

464
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:16,292
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you said you were going to HAB-Charlotte Pittsburgh.:

465
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:16,852
[SPEAKER_17]: : Speak with Mr. delay.

466
00:53:16,872 --> 00:53:18,714
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you want to talk about that in a moment.

467
00:53:19,214 --> 00:53:21,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can also share when you're done Joan HAB-Charlotte Pittsburgh.:

468
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:25,660
[SPEAKER_17]: : Conversations I've had at the middle school level because we were talking about we have this at the high school.

469
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,645
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe expanding it beyond, you know, just an optional sort of thing into a course option and then

470
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:37,550
[SPEAKER_17]: piloting a similar idea slash program at the middle school, a common ground.

471
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So Joan, would you like to speak on this?

472
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:50,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So Carla, Jan, Susanna, a bunch of us have been getting together, Stacey Shulman as well, to talk about the logistics of Common Ground next year.

473
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:54,232
[SPEAKER_00]: The next steps are we're meeting again next week.

474
00:53:54,632 --> 00:54:01,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be meeting with Carla to discuss what the syllabus would look like, what the course description is going to look like.

475
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,499
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working out some of

476
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:16,625
[SPEAKER_00]: the logistics about how many students the elective will be able to, you know, how many students will be able to sign up for the elective, those sorts of questions that are coming up based on our discussions.

477
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:20,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to have more answers to that next week when we meet again.

478
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:32,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Carla does apologize for not being able to be here tonight, but I told her I would fill her in and then we'll all be meeting again next week to firm up what it's going to look like and then also to have it be in the course selection.

479
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:34,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

480
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:35,899
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really exciting.

481
00:54:37,420 --> 00:55:02,178
[SPEAKER_17]: And also I had a conversation just directly with Mr. Downs and Mr. Tucci based on our last meeting last month, just to sort of generally let them know about this project and gauge their interest and talk with them a little bit more about what this could look like in a middle school setting and how it might work.

482
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:04,059
[SPEAKER_17]: And so Mr. Tucci in particular,

483
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:05,905
[SPEAKER_17]: had some really great questions.

484
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:16,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that, you know, looping Mr. Tucci and Mr. Andrews in on the conversation would be really helpful for them because they were talking about, I know Carla and Mr. Skorka, Ms.

485
00:55:16,672 --> 00:55:22,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrea, Mr. Skorka had talked about, you know, it is a possibility in the middle school level in the wind block.

486
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:27,959
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that was something that Mr. Tucci seemed to think was possible.

487
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,323
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was also wondering if the students are taking this because unlike high school, when you have course selection,

488
00:55:34,912 --> 00:55:35,854
[SPEAKER_17]: In middle school, you don't.

489
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:47,115
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the students are taking this, you know, what would they not be taking, for example, so those are some of the logistics that need to be worked out to think about piloting this.

490
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,421
[SPEAKER_17]: in that way in the middle school.

491
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:58,528
[SPEAKER_17]: But so I guess, you know, so I'd be interested in hearing what folks here have to say or want to add to the conversation.

492
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:09,776
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can add to that, I think once we work out how it's going to look at the high school level, we definitely will circle back to Mr. Downs and Mr. Tucci about how

493
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:22,781
[SPEAKER_00]: it works at the high school level, and then what it, you know, if we can meet with them to discuss what we put into place, how we did it, and the, you know, any assistance that we can offer them, answer those sort of questions that they had as well.

494
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:29,783
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really exciting.

495
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, guys.

496
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:34,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm really, isn't it, Tonya?

497
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Tanya's JoJo is part of the common ground.

498
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,581
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe Tanya, do you want to speak to it for a second?

499
00:56:45,122 --> 00:56:45,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't unmute.

500
00:56:46,382 --> 00:56:46,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there I am.

501
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:48,582
[SPEAKER_14]: You allowed me to unmute.

502
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:49,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

503
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:56,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that having it at all grade levels is going to be imperative at some point.

504
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:00,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say enough about the program right now.

505
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:04,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can just imagine how it's going to be once it umbrellas into everything that

506
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:06,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Carla has planned for it.

507
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:16,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that she's seeing it at different levels, in different nuances throughout the schools.

508
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:23,776
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just right now, my son is a part of that and just enjoys it so much.

509
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:29,600
[SPEAKER_14]: He had it today and he just gets so excited when he knows it's his letter day for Common Ground.

510
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:50,524
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's amazing also to watch the kids from CCSR that are participating because you can see them learning and kind of navigating how to communicate with, you know, the kids that have disabilities and vice versa.

511
00:57:51,744 --> 00:57:53,765
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just, I mean, it's just great for everybody.

512
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:55,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Tonya.

513
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,127
[SPEAKER_17]: And the thing about it is that, you know, first I just sort of want to add that

514
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, disability is diversity, right?

515
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:02,906
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are all equity issues.

516
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:05,689
[SPEAKER_17]: And so thinking about, you know, building friendships.

517
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:13,356
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that I feel like the pandemic has really given us, if you will, is the understanding of loneliness, right?

518
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:23,385
[SPEAKER_17]: And so really, you know, for neurotypical people to really understand the loneliness too of kids with disabilities who don't have friends.

519
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:29,595
[SPEAKER_17]: and making sure that we bridge that gap for them because it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do.

520
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:30,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlotte?

521
00:58:39,545 --> 00:58:41,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, there I am.

522
00:58:41,246 --> 00:58:46,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Just two examples of this, the synergies between CCSR and Common Ground.

523
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:59,608
[SPEAKER_12]: First, Michael Skorkor said it's okay to announce that the focus of World Cafe, which is on the 27th from 3 to 4, is diversity awareness.

524
00:59:00,529 --> 00:59:04,593
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're going to be reaching out to you, Melanie and Tanya.

525
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:08,257
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be some background information.

526
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:12,129
[SPEAKER_12]: given and a panel and then discussion.

527
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:20,291
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a couple of the students are interested in learning about the history and the disability community.

528
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:28,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think if we can provide some coaching, they can be the voice of presenting the background, which is awesome.

529
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:34,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And just another example is on Arbor Day, there's a student, a CCSR student,

530
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:39,200
[SPEAKER_12]: That is partnering with a student in Carla's class, Access High School.

531
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:45,617
[SPEAKER_12]: And that student is a prolific artist.

532
00:59:46,037 --> 00:59:49,038
[SPEAKER_12]: She enjoys making birdhouses and painting them.

533
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:57,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a partnership between this student artist and a student that's organizing Arbor Day.

534
00:59:57,263 --> 01:00:07,628
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been approved by the city arborist to put up her birdhouses on the campus and also perhaps in the community too.

535
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:11,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are just nice outgrowths.

536
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:14,210
[SPEAKER_17]: That is really lovely, Charlotte.

537
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for sharing that.

538
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:23,673
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the natural course of the friendship is really sort of thinking about what it looks like.

539
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:30,495
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a client-based model where the students with disabilities are clients and the students without disabilities are giving a service.

540
01:00:30,976 --> 01:00:36,818
[SPEAKER_17]: It's authentic friendships and really fostering those, which is the goal here.

541
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:37,998
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate.

542
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:39,909
[SPEAKER_17]: you sharing those stories.

543
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:47,412
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item on our agenda is to talk about an update on Medford Recreation.

544
01:00:48,832 --> 01:01:01,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll share that Gracie started going to the adaptive bowling on Wednesday nights through Medford Recreation, and she is having a lot of fun with that.

545
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:04,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Terry's been taking her, so I haven't had the benefit of actually seeing her yet.

546
01:01:05,304 --> 01:01:09,087
[SPEAKER_17]: He's taken some pictures and shared some of the bowling with us and it's been really neat.

547
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:13,650
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a high school student that is her sort of partner in that experience.

548
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,871
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is an adaptive program.

549
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:23,676
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that we really want to do, I see Kate Quinn from Medford Recreation is in the meeting as well.

550
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:33,583
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that we really wanna do is in addition to adaptive programming for recreation, we wanna ensure that there's inclusive programming for recreation.

551
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:41,199
[SPEAKER_17]: For those who might not know, the difference adaptive is sort of modifying the recreation aspect.

552
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:50,747
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, it sort of might be more like a client based model where students are delivering a service and the kids with disabilities are receiving a service.

553
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:56,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And so inclusive recreation is sort of along the line.

554
01:01:56,371 --> 01:01:59,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Shanine was sort of helping me with this definition a little bit.

555
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:00,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Shanine.

556
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:04,720
[SPEAKER_17]: is along the lines of the same thing that we're talking about in authentic friendships.

557
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:13,003
[SPEAKER_17]: So that, you know, each partner in the relationship is gaining something from the other.

558
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:18,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I really liked, I just wanted to share this quote, and then I'm gonna open it up to you guys to talk about Medford Recreation a little bit.

559
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:23,187
[SPEAKER_17]: But I wanted to share this quote from the Arc of Masses book on friendship.

560
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:26,488
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I liked that they defined what friendship is.

561
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:30,990
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, despite its universal nature, friendship may mean different things to different people.

562
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,391
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's important that we start with a common definition.

563
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:46,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Friendship is a voluntary and reciprocal relationship in which two students exhibit mutual attachment to one another, frequent proximity and companionship, and evidence of enjoyment or affection.

564
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:55,361
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought that was really important as we talk about, you know, a reciprocal relationship, especially in terms of recreation as well.

565
01:02:56,258 --> 01:02:59,140
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think we're well on our way with our adaptive programming.

566
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,241
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm excited about that.

567
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:04,123
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm excited that our hearts are there.

568
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,044
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's really exciting.

569
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:07,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Shanine, did you want to add something?

570
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, yeah, I actually, I had an email drafted back to you about the program.

571
01:03:19,813 --> 01:03:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just sent it because I was like, oh, the definition that I was working with was right there.

572
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:31,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a recreation professional, and as Melanie mentioned, there's a continuum.

573
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:37,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's adaptive programs, which really can be an important part of identity development.

574
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:47,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess a really good illustrative story is I have a colleague who runs an adaptive sports program for people with physical disabilities.

575
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:51,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's been working really hard to get

576
01:03:53,905 --> 01:03:58,268
[SPEAKER_08]: kids who maybe use a wheelchair to be able to be on their high school track team, right?

577
01:03:58,308 --> 01:04:00,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The no cut sports.

578
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:06,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this, they've got a student who is on their high school track team and they get to go to practice every day.

579
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:08,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's amazing.

580
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:09,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is inclusive and it's great.

581
01:04:09,656 --> 01:04:18,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you get enough kids who use wheelchairs at all the different schools that now you have a wheelchair division that meets, and that is so huge and powerful.

582
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:19,843
[SPEAKER_08]: However,

583
01:04:20,582 --> 01:04:27,406
[SPEAKER_08]: because there's not likely to be a whole lot of kids who use a wheelchair and want to run track in the same school district.

584
01:04:27,846 --> 01:04:31,228
[SPEAKER_08]: That kid is still the only one running around the track at their pace.

585
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:49,117
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not likely to have coaching that actually meets their needs and teaches them how to get more power out of every push or how to position their body or how to not like cheer when you stand, you can't cheer in a racing wheelchair because you will flip over backwards and high school track coaches are not trained for that.

586
01:04:50,750 --> 01:05:00,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So an adaptive program where a whole bunch of wheelchair athletes can meet on a Saturday morning from different districts, that is an identity-based program.

587
01:05:00,654 --> 01:05:11,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It can help them with the right kind of coaching, and they get to be with kids who understand what it's like to live using a wheelchair and to have the same challenges as their cornering and all of those things.

588
01:05:13,438 --> 01:05:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But we need both.

589
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:19,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And from all of the out-of-school time research,

590
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,662
[SPEAKER_08]: it's really clear that only quality programs actually give the benefits.

591
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:32,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can't just throw something together and say, here's a program, because that's not actually gonna give the benefits that we're looking for.

592
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:38,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Kate's been really intentional in setting this up, and I know it's taking longer than a lot of parents would like to see.

593
01:05:42,628 --> 01:05:45,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Parents are desperate for anything for their kids to do, but we wanna make sure we're clear on the model.

594
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:48,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got inclusive programs, which is really a civil rights piece.

595
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:55,753
[SPEAKER_08]: is full inclusion in anything that a child wants to do based on their interests, not based on who they are as a person.

596
01:05:56,174 --> 01:06:02,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've got reverse inclusion, where you set up a program that's really going to be supportive of kids of all abilities.

597
01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:17,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you invite typically developing students in to participate, which sounds like the common ground might be a piece of that, where you're really making sure you're intentionally bringing in typically developing students to be part of that program.

598
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:20,176
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's my surface understanding of that.

599
01:06:20,316 --> 01:06:26,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's adaptive programs, which really are in some circles called segregated programs.

600
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:27,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It is segregation.

601
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they're important pieces of identity and sometimes they're just segregation.

602
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:34,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to make sure that we're conscious of those levels.

603
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:36,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

604
01:06:36,683 --> 01:06:37,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Shanine.

605
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:44,667
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, Shanine actually used to also work at EMARC, which is now Communitas, which is the North, our regions,

606
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:51,008
[SPEAKER_17]: um, that provide services to, um, children and, uh, individuals with disabilities.

607
01:06:51,729 --> 01:07:00,613
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was really interesting because I know that many of you know me and know that, um, I am and had been a really hardcore inclusionist.

608
01:07:01,373 --> 01:07:10,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and I remember, um, way back when Gracie was a baby, um, she was, yeah, she was little, but not wanting her in.

609
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,634
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, adaptive swim programming, right?

610
01:07:13,674 --> 01:07:18,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I was like, no, she needs to go to full inclusion and that's, you know, her right and everything else.

611
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:23,098
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reality was like Shanine shared with me and it was very important.

612
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:28,681
[SPEAKER_17]: She's like, you know, and with adaptive programming, we can get her to the point where she can get to full inclusion, right?

613
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:31,983
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was like the scaffolding piece of it as well, really helpful.

614
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:40,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that was, you know, that was like an epiphany for me, Shanine, to understand like, oh, and you know, and I also was denying her the right

615
01:07:41,768 --> 01:07:45,131
[SPEAKER_17]: to have friendships really with and without kids with disabilities.

616
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:51,615
[SPEAKER_17]: So it doesn't mean just with kids without disabilities, they, you know, need friendships with kids with disabilities, right?

617
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:55,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, and so thinking about that is really important too.

618
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:56,499
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Shanine.

619
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:56,839
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

620
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just, the, yeah.

621
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:08,308
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the idea with adaptive programs is that we want to make sure that anything we do is set up with the idea that it is a place where people can build skills

622
01:08:08,762 --> 01:08:10,203
[SPEAKER_08]: but that they can move out.

623
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:21,011
[SPEAKER_08]: The kinds of programs I don't wanna see here are the charity baseball things where you end up with a five-year-old and a 25-year-old on the same team just because they have a disability.

624
01:08:21,391 --> 01:08:22,172
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not okay.

625
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:26,816
[SPEAKER_08]: It reinforces ableism in really ugly ways.

626
01:08:27,576 --> 01:08:31,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wanna make sure that they're learning the real rules of basketball.

627
01:08:32,157 --> 01:08:36,060
[SPEAKER_08]: so that they can go to their local park and play with the typically developing kids.

628
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:41,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if it's just like, you can travel all over the place and do whatever you want because, oh yeah, you have a disability, isn't that precious?

629
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:47,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Like so many parks and rec departments around here, we just don't, we need to do better.

630
01:08:48,248 --> 01:08:51,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we have the possibility, the capability of doing that together.

631
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:53,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we do.

632
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:55,734
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that we do with people like Kate and you.

633
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:56,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

634
01:08:57,077 --> 01:09:00,801
[SPEAKER_17]: on board and, you know, Kevin Bailey and the mayor and the commitment to all of this.

635
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:08,647
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm excited about the possibilities in the future, because frankly, these conversations weren't even being had, you know, five years ago, three years ago.

636
01:09:08,747 --> 01:09:10,249
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's really great to see.

637
01:09:10,329 --> 01:09:10,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

638
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:20,478
[SPEAKER_17]: And to that end, I want to just talk a little bit about the inclusive playground and play space as a discussion as well.

639
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:22,459
[SPEAKER_17]: So and maybe

640
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:30,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter, you can talk about it a little bit as well, but, you know, actually Peter, would you mind talking a little bit about it first?

641
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, happy to.

642
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:46,195
[SPEAKER_13]: So about a year ago, we were awarded a research grant for, it's probably about 13 months now, a research grant to do a design study on the McGlynn playground.

643
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:53,457
[SPEAKER_13]: The McGlynn playground, for those of you who don't know, well, actually all the playgrounds at the schools had a rubberized surface

644
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:58,890
[SPEAKER_13]: and those rubberized surfaces had ended their useful life.

645
01:10:00,151 --> 01:10:13,363
[SPEAKER_13]: The McGlynn, when we went to look at it, we really came to the conclusion that given the size of that rubberized surface, I believe it's, I forget honestly the size of it off the top of my head, but it was going to cost

646
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:18,080
[SPEAKER_13]: just to replace the surface itself, well over half a million dollars.

647
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:26,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then, you've got this environmental impact of this rubberized surface going into a landfill.

648
01:10:26,826 --> 01:10:33,911
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking about 10 to 15 years of a new rubberized surface before that ends up in a landfill.

649
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:35,552
[SPEAKER_13]: There are flooding issues.

650
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:40,055
[SPEAKER_13]: You also have the fact that that existing playground

651
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:48,565
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, is dated and also is not accessible in really any manner, shape or form as we would hope in 2021.

652
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:59,411
[SPEAKER_13]: So rather than just replace the, um, the rubberized surface, we wanted to be a little bit more ambitious and then something big happened about a year ago.

653
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Oh, the global pandemic.

654
01:11:02,313 --> 01:11:04,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and so we were focused on a lot of other stuff.

655
01:11:04,834 --> 01:11:07,796
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, um, about literally about a month ago,

656
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:34,879
[SPEAKER_13]: I was able to get back on this and write the RFP that is currently working its way through the process to head out so that we can get design firms in to, let me just pull it up here, but, and I'll keep talking, to really try to get a comprehensive and inclusive,

657
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:46,009
[SPEAKER_13]: playground and sorry, the document is opening.

658
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:48,130
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

659
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:57,393
[SPEAKER_13]: So looking for a universally accessible ADA compliant playground and let me just try to get to the timeline.

660
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:06,196
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to add, Peter, one of the things that Peter and I were talking about was like ADA compliant is like the base, right?

661
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:09,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that's starting at the lowest expectation.

662
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:13,035
[SPEAKER_17]: for a playground and we've had these discussions.

663
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,996
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, that's really helpful in that.

664
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:35,208
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, one of the things, one of the stories that I share, and I know mom wouldn't mind me sharing, and I know I've shared this with Peter, but I don't know if I have with the rest of you, but we had a student here in Medford Public Schools that was a student with significant disabilities and was in a wheelchair and was not able to communicate with words.

665
01:12:36,994 --> 01:12:46,599
[SPEAKER_17]: was in a residential school and would come home for weekends and during school vacation weeks.

666
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:53,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And mom would literally have nowhere to take her because there was no place that was accessible for her.

667
01:12:53,443 --> 01:12:54,784
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no playground that she could go to.

668
01:12:54,844 --> 01:12:57,406
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no place that she could take her.

669
01:12:59,107 --> 01:13:04,750
[SPEAKER_17]: And this beautiful little girl passed away actually when she was 15 years old and she was her mom's only daughter.

670
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:13,297
[SPEAKER_17]: her mom had dedicated really her life to taking care of her and advocating for her and remained an advocate in the disability community is quite a remarkable woman.

671
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:21,482
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I've thought a lot about this little girl over the years, and the fact that, you know, we didn't have a place for her to play.

672
01:13:22,143 --> 01:13:23,324
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to make sure that

673
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:25,044
[SPEAKER_17]: we can change that.

674
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:26,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And Denise, did you want to say something?

675
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:27,405
[SPEAKER_17]: I see you waving.

676
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on one second, Peter.

677
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:31,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on.

678
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,709
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all news to me, Dr. Cushing.

679
01:13:33,749 --> 01:13:40,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I am the district's full-time physical therapist and obviously very interested in what you're saying.

680
01:13:41,274 --> 01:13:48,178
[SPEAKER_15]: We have fought the battle of accessibility on the playgrounds for the 20 some odd years that I've been in Medford Public Schools.

681
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:52,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is very interesting news to me.

682
01:13:53,502 --> 01:14:00,036
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's important certainly that in your RFP or however you're putting together the grant that you get some input from.

683
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:04,866
[SPEAKER_15]: some of the related service providers about what we need.

684
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:08,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Mrs. Heim is also who's an OT at the high school.

685
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:11,149
[SPEAKER_15]: You need, you kind of need our input.

686
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:18,432
[SPEAKER_15]: We're the ones, I mean, I'm the ones working with the children in wheelchairs and the children that have physical challenges.

687
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:25,475
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I would ask respectfully that we be consulted

688
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,304
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great, Denise.

689
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Cushing and then Shanine.

690
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:38,092
[SPEAKER_13]: So the process that the RFP is actually establishing is the study.

691
01:14:38,272 --> 01:14:41,856
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of that study is for us.

692
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:45,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just read just real quick the project scope.

693
01:14:45,705 --> 01:15:09,857
[SPEAKER_13]: So provide full design, including drainage for the proposed universally accessible playground from concept sketches through construction documents, including project doc bids, docs and specifications, create four concept renderings, provide a construction estimate, provide a construction schedule, conduct and participate in process through which playground equipment provider specified, and then develop a long-term maintenance plan

694
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:22,163
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm getting to the good stuff right now, right here, facilitate meetings with constituents of the metropolitan schools and project partners during the design process as needed facilitate up to eight public meetings workshops etc.

695
01:15:22,604 --> 01:15:26,848
[SPEAKER_13]: During the design development process to incorporate student and general public input.

696
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:29,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are the two critical pieces here.

697
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:41,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Shanine had her hand up, but what we wanted, what the vision is, a small group of us kind of met last year as this was going through the CPA process.

698
01:15:42,214 --> 01:15:53,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And the intent is for this to be connected with students through CCSR, as well as the public and members of our school community who can really provide us

699
01:15:54,813 --> 01:16:09,565
[SPEAKER_13]: a play structure and hopefully a performance space and kind of expand upon this natural green area that is behind the playground as well as the existing playground itself.

700
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:12,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Janine.

701
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:26,546
[SPEAKER_08]: My comment was just asking, so in that small group of us we had the step we were at, at the moment the COVID hit was creating a subcommittee or a temporary ad hoc committee.

702
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:33,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to be taking applications from the community of people who wanted to be part of this.

703
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:37,064
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would include the PTs and OTs.

704
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:55,380
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, again, I'll defer to you as my boss, but dear Lord, we need to be, if you're talking about, I mean, I struggle daily with access for my students on the McGlynn playground, daily.

705
01:16:57,007 --> 01:17:03,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happened, I'd be happy to, Denise, if you want, I would be happy to talk with you about what was happening up to that point.

706
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And then really everything stopped.

707
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So like Peter said, it was like, it's been a month.

708
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't been updated yet.

709
01:17:09,271 --> 01:17:11,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, no one like it's worrying about it.

710
01:17:11,732 --> 01:17:12,192
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why.

711
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:12,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

712
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:15,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And we hadn't we hadn't gone outside of the

713
01:17:16,878 --> 01:17:27,705
[SPEAKER_08]: there was an application for the CPA, and then there was a CCSR student at the middle school who wanted to do an inclusive playground, and I brought the two groups together, and we had a meeting and had this idea, and then we had a pandemic.

714
01:17:27,765 --> 01:17:30,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, it didn't get any farther than that.

715
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:37,411
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not looking to take on any more work, but it's just that, you know, I mean, I've got boots on the ground.

716
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:40,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we're gonna make sure that you guys are involved, Denise.

717
01:17:40,774 --> 01:17:41,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

718
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,395
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna make sure of that, right?

719
01:17:43,495 --> 01:17:43,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I know,

720
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:47,752
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, Dr. Cushing will make sure of that as well.

721
01:17:47,852 --> 01:18:01,441
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that, you know, just getting back to the point of the subcommittee, right, it's about building friendships between community and school for our kids and an inclusive playground, what better way to build friendships, right?

722
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:04,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is really back to the scope of what the subcommittee

723
01:18:04,574 --> 01:18:19,820
[SPEAKER_13]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Select Committee on HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator,

724
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:44,883
[SPEAKER_13]: is to identify all of the things that we need to do, including involve that committee, take applications, do all of those types of things to make sure that, you know, we have a really inclusive group of people who can then develop a playground that is available to the wide variety of students who are going to be utilizing it.

725
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:49,538
[SPEAKER_13]: so that it is exciting and enticing to everyone.

726
01:18:50,499 --> 01:19:00,686
[SPEAKER_13]: And then taking this, I think also as an opportunity, we had spoken last year in that meeting just about the fact that this is the most centrally located playground.

727
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:02,607
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very easily accessible.

728
01:19:03,007 --> 01:19:06,570
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of apartments near there.

729
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it is more than just a school playground.

730
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,358
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's just a great civic space.

731
01:19:12,658 --> 01:19:25,783
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do we take all these things and then realize that by the time this RFP is complete and we have design specs and things like that, I don't have it in front of me right now, cause I closed that window.

732
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:32,805
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be in April, hopefully December of 2021, we'll have all that type of stuff.

733
01:19:33,205 --> 01:19:38,567
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we can fundraise, identify funding sources, and then, you know, really,

734
01:19:39,143 --> 01:19:59,173
[SPEAKER_13]: do grants, write grants, approach CPA, all these other things that we're gonna need a considerable funding mechanism to support this renovation slash reconstruction, just given some of the challenges with the site, but then just the sheer costs of doing a project like this.

735
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:02,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Van der Kloot, just one moment.

736
01:20:02,115 --> 01:20:06,257
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to just respond to also just put this,

737
01:20:06,797 --> 01:20:13,758
[SPEAKER_17]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Planner & Co-Leader:" You know, little bugging or be in people's bonnet is that there's also space over by the slave while in.

738
01:20:13,838 --> 01:20:25,080
[SPEAKER_17]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Planner & Co-Leader:" West Medford and you know actually a community member and myself when I was the co chair of the CPAC had gone to the previous mayor and met with them about.

739
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:35,442
[SPEAKER_17]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Self-Directed Planner & Co-Leader:" Creating some inclusive space and some opportunity there, and so there is some you know they're going to be doing an architectural dig over there, I know, and at some point, I think they're hoping to.

740
01:20:35,906 --> 01:20:40,307
[SPEAKER_17]: make some more accessibility over there and opportunity there.

741
01:20:40,367 --> 01:20:52,570
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think getting back to just even in any of these projects that we're looking at this with both, you know, with the lens of equity and having disability as part of that conversation and diversity.

742
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,010
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say we have seven minutes left.

743
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,191
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to let member van de Kloot speak and then Shanine.

744
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:07,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to say to Dr. Cushing, it probably, so right now it sounds like the RFP is being prepared.

745
01:21:08,995 --> 01:21:13,078
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that I think the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should also hear about.

746
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:20,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Peter, did you have it?

747
01:21:20,498 --> 01:21:24,320
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe this was mentioned last year when we were going through the RFP process.

748
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:35,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically, think of the last year as just a pause in the process as other larger items were unfortunately taking precedent.

749
01:21:36,223 --> 01:21:42,545
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just saying, Peter, it's such exciting news now that it's back on the block.

750
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:47,367
[SPEAKER_16]: So at some point, think that the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should

751
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:50,129
[SPEAKER_16]: also be updated when you get the chance.

752
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,291
[SPEAKER_13]: We can definitely do that.

753
01:21:52,451 --> 01:22:05,783
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want you to think that we were not, it just literally, there was finally like a window of time for me to research some other universally accessible playgrounds.

754
01:22:06,103 --> 01:22:07,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I took a drive up to Vermont

755
01:22:08,593 --> 01:22:10,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Burlington to see a really amazing one.

756
01:22:10,654 --> 01:22:19,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll be happy to definitely have that reach out to memocrats to put that on.

757
01:22:20,558 --> 01:22:20,998
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great.

758
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:22,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Shanine.

759
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:28,381
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

760
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:42,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, I know that there's like the school committee and there's the city and it's very strange arrangement to me, but the office of community development is in the process of reaching out to designers themselves for a three-year agreement.

761
01:22:43,945 --> 01:22:51,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was able to help with the contract or the RFP itself and added wording on universal design and social impact design, et cetera.

762
01:22:54,009 --> 01:22:57,151
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the challenges, and this is the expertise

763
01:22:58,101 --> 01:23:02,405
[SPEAKER_08]: the direction that I've been heading away from the recreation provision into designing spaces.

764
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:16,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are in the process with OCD of getting the national expert on the ADA and recreation park settings to come and do a playground access audit training to teach us how to look at our current playgrounds.

765
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So that knowledge will then stay with the city.

766
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:21,944
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm waiting for confirmation on

767
01:23:23,829 --> 01:23:24,469
[SPEAKER_08]: what's happening with that.

768
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:28,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it's in the budget, but we have to schedule it, et cetera.

769
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:46,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was planning on inviting John McLaughlin to that and be open to, we need it to be a small enough group to be a manageable training, but we wanna make sure that it has broad representation as well, so that people know what a good inclusive playground looks like, because there are many that look really shiny and aren't actually fun.

770
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:51,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are several designers around here who do a terrible job

771
01:23:52,348 --> 01:23:59,093
[SPEAKER_08]: and they just go with what the playground manufacturers tell them to go with and then it's not playable.

772
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:04,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to be really cautious as to which designers we choose and their skill sets.

773
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:06,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd be happy to help with that process.

774
01:24:06,438 --> 01:24:07,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, I'll shoot you an email.

775
01:24:08,499 --> 01:24:10,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Shanine, so much for that.

776
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:17,265
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's so exciting with OCD and having the national expert come in to look at our playgrounds and be able to do an audit around inclusivity.

777
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:18,166
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's amazing.

778
01:24:18,566 --> 01:24:18,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that,

779
01:24:20,057 --> 01:24:32,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was you that shared a story with me of a playground, I don't believe it's Medford's necessarily, but of a playground where they had an accessible swing, so a wheelchair accessible swing, but there was no access to get the wheelchair to the swing.

780
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,950
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are the kinds of things that realistically happen, right?

781
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:45,098
[SPEAKER_17]: So the other thing that's really important, and I'd like to end with this in our few minutes that are left, is that the disability community has a saying, nothing about us without us.

782
01:24:45,858 --> 01:24:46,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

783
01:24:46,278 --> 01:24:52,664
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's really important that we are thinking about students with disabilities, you know, being a part of this as well.

784
01:24:52,744 --> 01:25:09,958
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think, I think even to like our wonderful presenter that Susanna has had several times, Nick Kerenge, right, who is so eloquent and amazing and, you know, also happens to use a wheelchair and other folks that I'm sure that could help give us some insight on what their experience is like.

785
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:12,120
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want people to think about that.

786
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing about us without us.

787
01:25:14,093 --> 01:25:16,375
[SPEAKER_17]: It is 6.28 p.m.

788
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:31,685
[SPEAKER_17]: So if I have no other questions or comments, I would like to just review quickly that what we discussed today, we had, you know, Stacy talked to us about immediate needs for trauma-informed care, and we spoke about some of the issues around that.

789
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:36,008
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see some of our, you'll see our minutes from next time around that and how we're moving things together.

790
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:41,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And then today we reviewed Common Ground, Medford Rec, Inclusive Playground, and Resources.

791
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:42,278
[SPEAKER_17]: online.

792
01:25:42,318 --> 01:25:46,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So we got a lot of business done in the time that we were here.

793
01:25:46,582 --> 01:25:48,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to thank you guys all for being here.

794
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:51,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I can get a motion to adjourn, that would be great.

795
01:25:53,209 --> 01:25:53,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to adjourn.

796
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:55,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

797
01:25:57,113 --> 01:25:57,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

798
01:25:58,454 --> 01:25:59,856

799
01:25:59,896 --> 01:26:00,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

800
01:26:00,736 --> 01:26:01,637

801
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:02,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

802
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Van der Kloot?

803
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:05,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

804
01:26:05,962 --> 01:26:06,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

805
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:09,605
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see you guys all April 15th, I hope with some policy ideas.

806
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:10,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so
