[SPEAKER_17]: Report of secretary.

30
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:50,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Members, what my weekly responsibilities are as secretary.

31
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:59,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Since January 10, 2018, I've been going into the finance department at city hall every Wednesday afternoon to review and sign approximately 15 to 20 batches

32
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:06,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Each batch consists of a cover letter, which contains vendor numbers, names, addresses, and amounts.

33
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: There are receipts and invoice backup attached to each batch packet.

34
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I go through each vendor line to ensure all the receipts, invoices are provided.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I audit the names, addresses, and amounts for accuracy.

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,281
[SPEAKER_03]: The process typically takes between 2 to 3 hours each week.

37
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: If questions arise while auditing, I email the Director of Finance, Christine Patterson, to ask for clarification.

38
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:41,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the batch is finally approved, I sign off for the school committee on the cover letter and the warrant runs the same week on Friday so that each vendor will receive a check for their services.

39
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:51,322
[SPEAKER_03]: At the bottom of this report is a chart of the first three billing codes so that my colleagues can reference while reviewing the payroll and transfers of the spreadsheet.

40
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:59,427
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice that 010 is budget major, 890 is student activities, 112 is state grants,

41
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:05,437
[SPEAKER_03]: 113 is federal grants, 114 is revolving accounts, 115 is trust.

42
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:12,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So please note, if you have any questions about specific vendor items, I would be happy to address.

43
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'd most likely need to email the finance department, you know, once we hear the inquiry, so that we can pull the paperwork at City Hall to, you know, to clarify your questions, because

44
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't bring the batches out of City Hall.

45
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've gone through them, but I don't, you know, kind of remember exactly week to week what items specifically, but I have an idea, and I've approved everything.

46
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you find this report helpful.

47
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:38,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Ms.

49
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Kritz, Madam Secretary.

50
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good, handy little cheat sheet to have on the board.

51
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions from the members?

52
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:48,207
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

53
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:48,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

54
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:53,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on file by Mr. Giro, seconded by Ms.

55
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:55,518
[SPEAKER_17]: The underclude.

56
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:56,579
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

57
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

58
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:57,860
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

60
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

61
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:09,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, good idea.

62
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:10,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Always thinking.

63
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:11,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, that's a good idea.

64
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Mr. Benedetto, for the tip.

65
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:19,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of committees, building and ground subcommittee minutes, January 29, 2018.

66
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:29,586
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to make a motion at the end of this meeting, so I don't know if I should just fill the report then or do it now?

67
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You could highlight the report.

68
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:31,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

69
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:40,761
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those of you who were not at our last meeting, Cheryl Rodriguez, a mother from the Roberts, had come to explain to us that she was applying for a CPA.

70
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:46,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Community Preservation Act grant for the Roberts Playground surface area, which is very torn up.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,942
[SPEAKER_15]: It would fall under both recreation and open space of the CPA.

72
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:55,326
[SPEAKER_15]: The other two categories are affordable housing and historical site.

73
00:04:56,147 --> 00:05:00,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So she was looking for us to support her in her round two of the application.

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,851
[SPEAKER_15]: She made it through the first round.

75
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:02,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Cheryl's here.

76
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not making sure everything I'm saying is right.

77
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:09,697
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was moved to our subcommittee where we, the three of us, it was,

78
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:19,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Kathy, myself, and Erin, and that we recommend that the school committee allows her to move forward with looking for these CPA funds for the Roberts.

79
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:21,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

80
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:24,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

81
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:25,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

82
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:26,617
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved by Ms.

83
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

84
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,198
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

85
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:29,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

86
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:30,499
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

87
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,739
[SPEAKER_17]: The report is adopted.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Other report of committee rules, subcommittee minutes, January 31, 2018.

89
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:37,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

90
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:37,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz, chairperson.

91
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:37,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

92
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:49,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the Medford School Committee Subcommittee on the Rules was called to order by Chairperson Kathy Kratz at 715 in the Superintendent's Conference Room at Medford High School.

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Members Michael Ruggiero, Paul Russo were in attendance.

94
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:58,045

96
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:17,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Robin Irving, Claire Flaherty, Michelle Cicillo, Gareth McFarley, and Melanie McLaughlin.

97
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:19,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We all rose to salute the flag.

98
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:32,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Chairperson stated the purpose of the meeting was twofold, review failed trip policy, review oversight guidelines for PTO, PTG, and 5013 organizations that support our public schools.

99
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:40,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent Balson explained that the subcommittee's work resulted from discussions and questions raised at our regular school committee meeting on January 22nd

100
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,992
[SPEAKER_03]: He then asked Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson to lead a discussion of the field trip policy and forms.

101
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Copies of the relevant forms were distributed.

102
00:06:50,553 --> 00:07:04,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Deputy Superintendent Nelson explained the need for revised policy and forms emanated from multiple discussions at the school committee meetings around key issues such as insurance, medical coverage, inclusivity, and curriculum alignment.

103
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:09,079
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal was to produce clear and consistent policy with streamlined forms.

104
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:11,819
[SPEAKER_03]: The policy was developed with substantial input.

105
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Key revisions were included.

106
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Change in the order of sign-off.

107
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequence of approval.

108
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Nurse to be notified when student listing is ascertained.

109
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Cost to be estimated until full student participation is determined.

110
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:33,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers Robin Irving and Patty Haas spoke about their confusion as it related to the new forms.

111
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:36,855
[SPEAKER_03]: They stressed their commitment to inclusivity.

112
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:40,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They were concerned about the curriculum director sign off.

113
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:47,239
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent exclaimed that it was new and the department director was unsure of the approval requirement in the sequence.

114
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: He explained that the curriculum director needed to ensure an alignment with curriculum.

115
00:07:57,163 --> 00:08:00,345
[SPEAKER_03]: A field trip is an alternative classroom and it must be of value.

116
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:05,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be a substitute for a day of classroom instruction.

117
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,068
[SPEAKER_03]: After alignment is determined,

118
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:13,824
[SPEAKER_03]: then participation listing must be checked out for appropriate supports, accommodations, consistent with student needs.

119
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two-step process.

120
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Supervisor Tony Vento exclaimed that Massachusetts is not a compact state and our nurses cannot supervise out-of-state trips.

121
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:29,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the administration of medications by persons needs physician's approval.

122
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:36,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It was explained that if there were specialized costs, it might be necessary to revise the per-pupil assessment

123
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:43,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if a trip was canceled for appropriate reasons, then insurance refunds should be incorporated into the planning.

124
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:51,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Melanie McLaughlin, parent of CPAC chairperson, raised various ADA issues and possible need for SPED sign-off.

125
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,612
[SPEAKER_03]: She was concerned if students were eliminated for academic reasons, also for disciplinary reasons.

126
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:04,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It was explained that special ed students were in attendance, then special ed teachers and staff would be on the trip.

127
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the school had the right to exclude

128
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,876
[SPEAKER_03]: participation for valid academic and disciplinary reasons, as long as they were legitimate, non-discriminating reasons.

129
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:18,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Student participation was shared, responsibility between home and school.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruggiero suggested that the ADA comment be added to the form.

131
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:36,513
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of the discussions, will be made to the forms in the following, ADA reference checklist, change in the order of the sign-off, nurse notification rather than approval, estimated costs rather than actual

132
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,585
[SPEAKER_03]: process will be better explained.

133
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:44,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The subcommittee then began the discussion of oversight regulations proposal by the superintendent.

134
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:50,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Russo felt that October 1 would be better than September 1st for submission of the materials.

135
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,891
[SPEAKER_03]: There were pros and cons to the date changes, but it was not decided.

136
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The discussion centered primarily on the tone of the regulations.

137
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Most were concerned that they sounded too negative and heavy.

138
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:05,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was a good give and take on why they were needed.

139
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:16,142
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent felt that greater coordination would not impinge on the autonomy of various groups, but could lead to greater resources and better coordination with the school budget.

140
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: There was concern about economic equality among the schools.

141
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:24,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen Graham volunteered to rework the regulations into a more friendly listing.

142
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:31,031
[SPEAKER_03]: The subcommittee agreed to hold any vote in absence until the new language could be reviewed.

143
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:35,314
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion, Mr. Russo seconded by Mr. Ruggiero, the meeting was adjourned at 9.30.

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:45,804
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will follow up with Superintendent Belson, and when we have the revisions, I could call another subcommittee meeting as a follow-up.

145
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:47,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

146
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

147
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto?

148
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:50,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

149
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:58,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had gotten some calls about the possibility of the process taking too long.

150
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:02,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Did the teachers and the parents at that meeting feel like

151
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:08,346
[SPEAKER_11]: the process would be quicker now that you've met and made some revisions?

152
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,488
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my feeling.

153
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be my understanding.

154
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:25,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the back of our packets, Erin, there is a, at the very back, there's a recommendation to the approval of the field trip policy and there's a checklist.

155
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:33,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the, you know, what the teachers will do is they'll follow the checklist and they'll have their forms.

156
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:39,303
[SPEAKER_03]: and they can bring them, you know, working with the checklist to the appropriate person.

157
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:56,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the bottom, it's, there's been a revision where the signature will be, the order of the signature is the principal or assistant principal in the curricular curriculum and the notification to the nurse.

158
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:00,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not, at the very bottom, there's only approval for

159
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,973
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the principal and the curriculum director, and then notification going to the nurse.

160
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there is different forms for the day trip and for the overnight trip, yeah.

161
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Beverly, yeah.

162
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:19,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson?

163
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:25,624
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't mean to barge in, but let me just try to streamline what we did here.

164
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:26,765
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't change the policy.

165
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:31,047
[SPEAKER_22]: The policy was approved by the school committee, so that was standing.

166
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,571
[SPEAKER_22]: The confusion, some of it was on basically three forms.

167
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:56,677
[SPEAKER_22]: And the checklist, again, we made that one addition that was recommended that is under prior to planning the trip, the first bullet, review the district, the teacher should review the district field trip policy, and we added, I think it was at the suggestion of Mr. Rousseau, review the ADA regulations, which is part of our policy.

168
00:12:57,097 --> 00:13:00,039
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically, the teacher is reading the policy.

169
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,379
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, Mr. Agerio.

170
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,301
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been a long day.

171
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:11,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, the teacher will read the whole policy, we hope, before they begin.

172
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:21,410
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll see all of this within the policy anyways, but we did add it because, again, as Mr. Agerio said, it was something that should be out there at the very outset.

173
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,192
[SPEAKER_22]: The second form that caused a little bit of

174
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:31,355
[SPEAKER_22]: confusion was the local day trip, field trip approval form.

175
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:37,699
[SPEAKER_22]: And what I did is I simply circled what we have changed in the new language.

176
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:47,486
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, if you go to the bottom, there was some confusion about who should sign first, the curriculum director or the principal.

177
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:55,352
[SPEAKER_22]: So a curriculum director, the teacher may give it to the curriculum director first, the curriculum director doesn't see the principal's signature,

178
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,351
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, there's some confusion.

179
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:04,414
[SPEAKER_22]: So we simply added to clarify that both signatures are required in the order that they are presented.

180
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,315
[SPEAKER_22]: Field trips start with the principal.

181
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:14,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Principal has to be aware of anything going in and out of their building, his or her building, and they have to, again, start the process.

182
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:25,365
[SPEAKER_22]: The other confusion was that doing day trips, there were teachers that thought the nurse had to sign off, that she knew all the kids going at the time of the planning,

183
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:26,345
[SPEAKER_22]: of the field trip.

184
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:32,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Now we know that that's not a reality because you put a field trip out and kids sign up for it and you really don't know.

185
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,613
[SPEAKER_22]: What we were really getting at according to what Tony Dento explained is the nurse needs some notification.

186
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:47,839
[SPEAKER_22]: So we took the nurse, again I didn't put the original form here, but it was a sign off by the principal, curriculum director and nurse, the approval.

187
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,964
[SPEAKER_22]: We took the nurse out of the approval section and we created a new section called notification.

188
00:14:55,462 --> 00:15:03,385
[SPEAKER_22]: So the nurse, the teacher would make sure that the nurse is notified that a month from now, there's going to be a field trip to the Museum of Science.

189
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:10,807
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when you have all the students who sign up, then the nurse will go through the lists and the medical issues that may have to be addressed.

190
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:15,129
[SPEAKER_22]: So that clarified that portion of it with regard to the signatures.

191
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:23,791
[SPEAKER_22]: With regard to the overnight trips, again, the items that we adjusted are circled.

192
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:24,832
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, once

193
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:32,024
[SPEAKER_22]: everyone's comfortable with all of this, we will post it to the website in the new forms without things being circled, obviously.

194
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:44,766
[SPEAKER_22]: But one of the things that was a problem is that when the overnight trips were going to be planned, they really didn't know the cost, okay, exactly.

195
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:48,927
[SPEAKER_22]: The cost is gonna really vary according to the number of students that sign up.

196
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:54,928
[SPEAKER_22]: So for example, if a trip is going to Italy and you have to hire one bus, if you have 30 students,

197
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:02,238
[SPEAKER_22]: the cost might be a little bit less than if you have 20 students, because, again, you have to hire the same boss, the same vendor.

198
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:10,200
[SPEAKER_22]: So, again, we ask that the teacher simply estimate, based on past experience, what do they think that cost will be.

199
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:16,482
[SPEAKER_22]: The other changes were pretty much similar to what we did on the day trip.

200
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:24,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, we asked the signatures to be in the order that they're listed, so it starts with the principal or headmaster, curriculum director,

201
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:28,863
[SPEAKER_22]: superintendent if it's one of the trips that have to be approved by the school committee.

202
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:36,986
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the nurse was taken out of the approval column, because once again, when you plan for a trip like to Italy, you oftentimes plan a year ahead.

203
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:46,110
[SPEAKER_22]: You do not know all the students who are gonna be going, but the nurse needs to be notified that perhaps in those few months they have to go through this list with the teacher.

204
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,371
[SPEAKER_22]: So those were pretty much the changes.

205
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:53,933
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they clarified some of the things that people were questioning.

206
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:59,045
[SPEAKER_22]: With everything new, it takes a while for people to get used to doing things.

207
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:05,210
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think, again, we reviewed all of this once the committee approved the policy with our administrators.

208
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,252
[SPEAKER_22]: But it does bear another review.

209
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,474
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a meeting on Tuesday with administrators.

210
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:15,600
[SPEAKER_22]: And I will certainly go over this as well as inform them on the changes that we made to the forms.

211
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,801
[SPEAKER_22]: And then everything will be posted.

212
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,422
[SPEAKER_22]: But the policy was not changed.

213
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:21,645
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just these forms to clarify a little bit.

214
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,635
[SPEAKER_22]: what was causing some people some concerns.

215
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,178
[SPEAKER_22]: So I take any questions, if you have any questions.

216
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:28,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Follow up, Mr. Benedetto, on that question?

217
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's part of that.

218
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:42,952
[SPEAKER_11]: The part that was concerning to me is, how do you have a list of student attendees when you haven't gotten approval and sent out to the parents, do you want to sign your children up?

219
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:48,797
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the day trips, it says, please attach a list of student attendees.

220
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:58,412
[SPEAKER_11]: So if all of seventh or eighth grade is going, are teachers able to get a list of every student in that grade level and attach it to this?

221
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they able to do that, number one?

222
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:08,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And number two, just because they're invited, that's not the list of who's going until you send home the permission slips to parents.

223
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:16,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So that seems premature to me to have that on there in encumbrance on the teachers at that point.

224
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:25,637
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe in our discussion what we were targeting here is the perspective students that you are going to invite.

225
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:31,780
[SPEAKER_22]: So for example, if a teacher is taking his or her class, it would be my class in general.

226
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:38,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you're right, we don't know who's going to opt not to go and who's going to, you know, again, just want to be in attendance.

227
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:47,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So can we clarify that piece so that list of classrooms attending, individual students' names delivered to the nurse one week before,

228
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:54,011
[SPEAKER_11]: or grade level or some generalization so they're not thinking that they have to have the exact list.

229
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:54,891
[SPEAKER_16]: For the approval.

230
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that's confusing.

231
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not on the overnight one.

232
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,754
[SPEAKER_11]: The overnight one does not have that.

233
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,415
[SPEAKER_11]: It just says estimated number of students.

234
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:16,901
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could just change that to estimated number of students and then provide the list a week before because it's noted down the bottom to provide a list to the nurse a week before.

235
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:38,087
[SPEAKER_22]: The only difference is that the local day trips usually look to a particular class, a teacher's class, to take on the trip, where oftentimes the overnight trips, like trips abroad, it's open more to students of the entire, let's say, junior and senior class.

236
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:42,387
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can see what you say about list the attach of students.

237
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,768
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe if we put language, this is on the local day trips,

238
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:56,510
[SPEAKER_22]: please attach students you are at, let's see, please attach the classes that you plan to take, something like that, without names.

239
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,791
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we add that, okay.

240
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:11,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Or estimated, even if they know it's estimated and that the final count has to be presented to either the principal, vice principal, or assistant principal, or nurse one week prior.

241
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,903
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way they have that time and they'll have the exact names by then.

242
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,853
[SPEAKER_11]: and be able to provide that.

243
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:33,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they're doing, like if the second grade all goes to the, you know, the top school fair, or apple picking in kindergarten, or whatever that they do, that some teacher might not have the list of every student in every other classroom.

244
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:34,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Not when they're planning.

245
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:39,997
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we thought, well, do we do a form for preliminary planning?

246
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:44,478
[SPEAKER_22]: I know at the request of the school committee, we wanted to streamline as much as possible.

247
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:48,206
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can do it with the language in one form, so much the better.

248
00:20:48,226 --> 00:20:49,366
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can make that adjustment.

249
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:49,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

250
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I see what you're getting at there.

251
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:51,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

252
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:52,447
[SPEAKER_22]: You're welcome.

253
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to see it when it's done.

254
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

255
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:55,768
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

256
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:56,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

257
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:56,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Kloot.

258
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:58,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just had a question.

259
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:05,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that two teachers were present, teachers Robin Irving and Patty Haas had come forward and spoke about a field trip.

260
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was to the Museum of Science, which didn't end up taking place.

261
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did it end up taking place?

262
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:12,772
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

263
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:13,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Not.

264
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:14,693
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, I think.

265
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:17,097
[SPEAKER_22]: they can regroup with this once.

266
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:24,043
[SPEAKER_22]: There was some misunderstanding because in that situation, and I'm meeting again at the request of Ms.

267
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:25,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Irving and Ms.

268
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:25,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Haas.

269
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:29,988
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm meeting them on Thursday of this week to clarify that.

270
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:33,110
[SPEAKER_22]: Because what happened, it went to two curriculum directors.

271
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:36,433
[SPEAKER_22]: And the curriculum directors were really confused as to who should sign.

272
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,415
[SPEAKER_22]: It went to the math director and the science

273
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:40,630
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a lot of confusion over that.

274
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that the kids get to go on the field trip.

275
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:48,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand it's a traditional field trip, and the kids are going to the Museum of Science.

276
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:53,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure that because of this timing with the paperwork, that they're not held back.

277
00:21:54,001 --> 00:22:02,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's a cost differential that was caused by this, that we look deep into our budget and see if we can help make that go away.

278
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,089
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

279
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I will be meeting with them Thursday.

280
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:08,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was a motion.

281
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:09,755
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

282
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:11,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Belson.

283
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,596
[SPEAKER_23]: There are two items.

284
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:14,836
[SPEAKER_23]: There's the committee report.

285
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:18,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

286
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:24,098
[SPEAKER_23]: There's the committee report, which was read, and then there's the action item on the old business.

287
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:33,520
[SPEAKER_23]: So we should look at the old business item, and that's what you're voting, not the committee report you're accepting for information.

288
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,485
[SPEAKER_23]: So we just have to make a distinction.

289
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,506
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you're going to make a reference, you have to look at this.

290
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:45,110
[SPEAKER_23]: The second thing is, is that you may know that Medford alumni Michael Bloomberg gave $50 million to the Science Museum.

291
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,013
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a funny feeling we won't have to cost it for our children.

292
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:50,333
[SPEAKER_17]: All righty.

293
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:51,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

294
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, one quick question here.

295
00:22:53,775 --> 00:23:01,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was Miss Irving, one of the teachers, mentioned that new teachers had trouble finding the forms or knowing where the forms were located.

296
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:09,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there gonna be any training provided to new teachers as they come in, like a packet with this information in particular?

297
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:21,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, again, principals, when things happen during the school year, we ask, obviously, that the principals give the information to all teachers, including new staff.

298
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:31,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Teacher orientation, we do have a week of that for new staff at the beginning of the year, and they get a lot of information, and again, we leave

299
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:37,948
[SPEAKER_22]: a lot for the principal, because we don't want to scare people away that first week, because we need those teachers to come back with those kids.

300
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:40,730
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, we really ask the principals.

301
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, again, when things are new, sometimes it takes a couple of times to go over them.

302
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,274
[SPEAKER_22]: These forms are on the website, the old forms.

303
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,194
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll be revised.

304
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Teachers have access to them.

305
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:56,818
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm looking to see, make sure they're placed properly on the website, too.

306
00:23:57,258 --> 00:24:00,079
[SPEAKER_22]: So they really should be under the section Teachers Information.

307
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:01,380
[SPEAKER_22]: So teachers have that.

308
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:14,038
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, we are, again, reviewing this with the administrators next week at their regular meetings, and I will emphasize the fact that we've made the adjustments after we make the final ones, and then we'll move forward.

309
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,181
[SPEAKER_22]: And it sometimes takes, this is all new.

310
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:28,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Schools prior to this, I tried to explain the other evening, every school had its own protocol for field trip approval, and it was very confusing to parents with kids in different schools

311
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:32,413
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was the committee that really wanted to bring some uniformity to this.

312
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:34,353
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why all of this started.

313
00:24:34,393 --> 00:24:40,574
[SPEAKER_22]: And when you do something that's as big a project, and Gail Trainor and Tony Vento deserve really all the credit for this.

314
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:41,554
[SPEAKER_22]: They worked two years.

315
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:45,035
[SPEAKER_22]: And we had administrators review it over and over again.

316
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:48,995
[SPEAKER_22]: And as you see, every time you review something, there's always something additional you can tweak.

317
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,276
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've worked with that.

318
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,776
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, there's been a lot of thought put into this.

319
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,256
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a great policy.

320
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:58,357
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we can get the forms down to where they need to be, it'll be great forms as well.

321
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:02,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Russo?

322
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:03,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

323
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know my English.

324
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:06,176
[SPEAKER_17]: You're OK?

325
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,256
[SPEAKER_17]: All righty.

326
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:08,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

327
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:09,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone?

328
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:16,042
[SPEAKER_15]: In the minutes, Michael, Member Ruggiero, suggested that the ADA be added to the form.

329
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:20,425
[SPEAKER_15]: So I see on the checklist, it says review the district trip policy and ADA regulations.

330
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:24,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So then will part of their package also add the actual list of ADA?

331
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know the ADA regulations myself.

332
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,570
[SPEAKER_22]: They're a part of all of our documents.

333
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,472
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you go to the field trip policy, it's very clearly

334
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:37,666
[SPEAKER_22]: stated, we went over the language with Kathy Medaglia to make sure that it covered all of the concerns about that.

335
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:39,667
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very clearly in the policy.

336
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:47,071
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm saying when a teacher takes this, the way to do it, the AD English isn't going to be part of this package.

337
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:50,113
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to go to the website and look up the AD regulations?

338
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, the policy speaks to that.

339
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:56,577
[SPEAKER_22]: In other words, the first thing the teacher is supposed to do is read the policy, OK?

340
00:25:57,137 --> 00:26:01,260
[SPEAKER_22]: The exact regulations, they're in the very first page of that policy.

341
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:06,563
[SPEAKER_22]: But the exact regulations, they're not listed, Kathy, because it was too...

342
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:26,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, but I'm saying if you have a checklist and all the forms that you need are part of this package, wouldn't the ADA regulations make sense just to have them part of this package so you don't have to go to a computer to look up the regulations?

343
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:32,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me just mention that at the start of every school year, all of the schools go through a series of mandated trainings.

344
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:39,258
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those trainings does relate to 504, accessibility, civil rights.

345
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:43,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a listing of probably maybe 12

346
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,963
[SPEAKER_05]: different mandated trainings that staff participate in, all within the first month of school.

347
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,927
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an accessibility requirement.

348
00:26:55,128 --> 00:27:01,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that when you plan a trip, when you plan a lesson in the classroom, you have to make it accessible for all students.

349
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:02,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the requirement.

350
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:05,655
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's fundamental.

351
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:06,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

352
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:09,258
[SPEAKER_17]: First rule of thumb, make sure the place you're going to is accessible.

353
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,900
[SPEAKER_17]: It's accessible, that the student can access the trip.

354
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:13,453
[SPEAKER_17]: from anyone.

355
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:18,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, but it's just everything else is included except just the list of the ADA regulations.

356
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,936
[SPEAKER_23]: If you were to include the ADA regulations, you have to give them a book.

357
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,717
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're not going to read the whole book.

358
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:33,580
[SPEAKER_23]: The basic premise is it's accessible, transportation is accessible, the location is accessible and supports are provided, accommodations if required.

359
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,040
[SPEAKER_23]: Three basic principles.

360
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:37,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

361
00:27:39,202 --> 00:27:39,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So this

362
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,738
[SPEAKER_09]: form that we're holding is a piece of paper.

363
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually a link on the website already, or will be.

364
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:48,742
[SPEAKER_22]: They're up there now in the old form.

365
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:49,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

366
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:56,226
[SPEAKER_22]: But once we had our discussion tonight, we make any further, approve any further edits, then they'll be all up there.

367
00:27:56,246 --> 00:28:00,088
[SPEAKER_22]: The policy's up there, and then the forms are up there as well.

368
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:05,271
[SPEAKER_22]: But we will repost them, maybe put them in a couple of places on the website.

369
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:08,073
[SPEAKER_22]: I did look around there and I thought perhaps it could be

370
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:11,424
[SPEAKER_22]: under another section, as well as where it currently was.

371
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:14,747
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll work on that once we have it finalized.

372
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:28,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And is the entire policy, like the next item on the list of links or above it or near it, or do you have to go someplace else on the website?

373
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:29,198
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all together.

374
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:29,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all together.

375
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,480
[SPEAKER_22]: The policy and the forms.

376
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:31,900
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

377
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:38,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file with the recommendations that are included in it?

378
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for Mr. Rusciro, seconded by Ms.

379
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:43,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

380
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:43,784
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

381
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:44,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

382
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:45,486
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

383
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:46,327
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

384
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:48,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

385
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:50,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Community participation.

386
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:57,652
[SPEAKER_17]: With us tonight we have Miss Judy Lonigan, who's representing the Jingle Bell Road Race Funds Committee.

387
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:00,354
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have some really good news tonight.

388
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:05,478
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, every year they hold a road race in the month of, I think it was November?

389
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,199
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually November, I think.

390
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,602
[SPEAKER_17]: And the schools participate and they raise funds for their given school.

391
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:18,164
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the dollars they raise for walkers and runners end up coming back to the school system via all the hard work of the committee.

392
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,065
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have with us tonight, Ms.

393
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:21,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Lonigan, who'd like to come up to the podium.

394
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:35,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

395
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Lonergan, how are you?

396
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:36,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, how are you?

397
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:37,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, thanks.

398
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:47,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to also introduce John Murphy, who is the co-sponsor with Lonergan Insurance and Real Estate, and John is the president of Members Plus Credit Union.

399
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:58,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are going to present these checks, and we have two trophies there for the school that had the most walker runners and the one that raised the most money.

400
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do have a group of

401
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,625
[SPEAKER_10]: involves with checks in them, we don't think there's a representative here.

402
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:10,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there is at the end, would you just come forward so we can give it to you?

403
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:21,093
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, I will give them to Mrs. Chiesa, who will in turn give them out to the coaches and the teams in schools that got them.

404
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:24,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just like to say that we are donating.

405
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:29,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Members Plus and Lonergan Insurance and Real Estate pay all the expenses for the race.

406
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:40,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Any money that the schools raise, the kids raise by running or walking or getting sponsors or selling chances or however they do it, they get 100% back to them.

407
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all those runners and walkers who do not state a school or a team goes into a pot and that pot is distributed on a percentage basis.

408
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,245
[SPEAKER_10]: The person who works the hardest gets the most money.

409
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:59,087
[SPEAKER_10]: out of that until we get down to zero.

410
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:00,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't do it.

411
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have anything to do with it.

412
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,391
[SPEAKER_10]: My name's not on anything.

413
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do have wonderful people who work with us and do this.

414
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,697
[SPEAKER_10]: This year we will be presenting $31,698.85.

415
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:29,134
[SPEAKER_10]: So that brings us to a total, I think, this is our fifth year and I think it brings us to a total of about $200,000.

416
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:39,302
[SPEAKER_10]: We just give you, we give you the activity.

417
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:48,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It's up to you, your teams, your clubs, your schools to raise the money because whatever you raise is 100% back to you.

418
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:49,650
[SPEAKER_10]: We pay for the

419
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:57,145
[SPEAKER_10]: The race facilitator, we pay for the t-shirts, we pay for whatever expenses are incurred so that you all get it back.

420
00:31:57,905 --> 00:32:06,637
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first one I'm calling on is Jen Overbrook and Hunter and Liam and who else is here from the Andrew School?

421
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:09,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Susan, I'm sorry, Susan Power.

422
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:40,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot to write it down, Susie.

423
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:50,763

00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:33,279

[SPEAKER_10]: All right, John, you can get in the background.

474
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:56,066
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the most fun.

475
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:56,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that most money?

476
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:57,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Most money.

477
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:20,846
[SPEAKER_07]: The most money raised was at the Roberts School, and that was, they raised, well, plus the proceeds that we kicked in, so they got a total of $6,935.97.

[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:40,300

[SPEAKER_10]: And before I give out the last one, I just want to make sure to remind you, we don't want to disturb this meeting all night, if you all just go out on the stairs so we can take a group picture.

498
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:18,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last one to receive that is here tonight, is there anyone here who did not receive their check?

499

[SPEAKER_16]: Judy, we have other reports to give out tonight.

507
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:04,818
Oh, OK.

508
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:06,019
All right, fine.

509
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:06,820
Thank you.

510
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:49,519
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to call up Tony Sickney, our director of fine arts, to tell us about these music awards that have honored our students for their terrific participation.

511
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:00,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

512
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:16,003
[SPEAKER_19]: We were very excited this year that all four of our high school students who auditioned for the Massachusetts Music Educators Association Northeast District Festival made it.

513
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:20,165
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's really, really something special.

514
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:23,366
[SPEAKER_19]: There are over 60 communities in our district.

515
00:44:24,147 --> 00:44:28,729
[SPEAKER_19]: It includes all the surrounding communities, Belmont, Lexington, Arlington,

516
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:37,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Winchester, Melrose, it goes as far east as Marblehead and Rockport, up north past North Andover and further up.

517
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:49,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And over 60 communities, we had 1,127 students auditioned, and fewer than 40% of the kids who did audition were accepted to the festival.

518
00:44:50,843 --> 00:45:01,834
[SPEAKER_19]: and usually it's a bittersweet event because some people make it and we're excited and then I have to give the bad news to some of the students who didn't get in but this year we were four for four so all four of our students got in.

519
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:13,865
[SPEAKER_19]: So the auditions were in November and they were

520
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:23,945
[SPEAKER_19]: And the concert itself was actually fairly recently in Wakefield at the Galvin Middle School in January.

521
00:45:24,005 --> 00:45:26,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Fantastic concert that I attended.

522
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:34,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And the four students who made it were, in the orchestra, Ficello, Justin Tsang, and Leo Pancik.

523
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:44,140
[SPEAKER_19]: String bass, Jared Ingersoll.

524
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:49,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Arden Ingersoll.

525
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,287
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, Arden Ingersoll.

526
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:56,371
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jared, I always consider his dad as part of the group.

527
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:03,817
[SPEAKER_19]: And for the band, Christopher Walsh on mallet percussion.

528
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:15,926
[SPEAKER_19]: And out of this group, Arden, out of all the bass players, came in number one.

529
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,768
[SPEAKER_19]: And he has first cheer.

530
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,233
[SPEAKER_19]: And Justin just missed first year at cellist.

531
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:26,133
[SPEAKER_19]: He is second year at cellist, but he made it.

532
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:34,356
[SPEAKER_19]: And Arden and Justin will be performing since they qualified to audition for Allstate.

533
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:40,837
[SPEAKER_19]: They also auditioned for Allstate and were accepted.

534
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:43,158
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll be playing at Symphony Hall on March 3rd.

535
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,817
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have certificates.

536
00:46:50,997 --> 00:47:02,522
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Justin Tseng, 2018 MMEA Northeast District Orchestra, 2018 MMEA All-State Orchestra on behalf of the entire school committee.

537
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:03,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations, Justin.

538
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:05,423

00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:13,547
Congratulations.

543
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,668

[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Zinkman.

546
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:30,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

547
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:30,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

548
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:49,107
[SPEAKER_17]: We're so very lucky in Medford to have such a rich music program, a great fine arts department, and we're very, very lucky.

549
00:47:49,288 --> 00:47:56,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And these kids show the hard work that goes into it and the years, the years of effort and practice and dedication.

550
00:47:56,717 --> 00:47:57,518
[SPEAKER_17]: So congratulations.

551
00:48:06,988 --> 00:48:09,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

552
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Moved.

00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:10,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Ms.

[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

557
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,718
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're very versatile as a school system.

558
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,239
[SPEAKER_23]: You just saw all the music awards.

559
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we're talking about marketing.

560
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,142
[SPEAKER_23]: We're talking about sales.

561
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,663
[SPEAKER_23]: We're talking about the economy.

562
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:35,790
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got our vocational director, our associate director, and our teacher of marketing, DECA, Frank Owisi, here to present some awards on DECA.

563
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:40,194
[SPEAKER_23]: the achievements that the students have made in their competition.

564
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:44,016
[SPEAKER_23]: Come on up.

565
00:48:44,116 --> 00:48:53,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on team.

00:48:55,742 --> 00:48:56,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

567
00:48:56,883 --> 00:48:58,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

568
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:02,906
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'd like to

569
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:13,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank everyone for acknowledging our state qualifiers for the DECA Career Development Conference coming up.

570
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:23,314
[SPEAKER_24]: And for those of you that don't know me, I'm Frank D'Aloisio, and I teach the marketing and the entrepreneurship curriculum here at Medford.

571
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:27,636
[SPEAKER_24]: And for those of you that are unfamiliar with DECA,

572
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:33,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm told 30 years ago there was a DECA chapter here.

573
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:39,217
[SPEAKER_24]: And I brought the program back in two years ago.

574
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:46,319
[SPEAKER_24]: And I use this program because it is an extension of my classroom.

575
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:48,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Now DECA does three things.

576
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,042
[SPEAKER_24]: It provides an academic opportunity for the kids to compete against the smartest kids in the state.

577
00:49:58,023 --> 00:49:58,903
[SPEAKER_24]: It allows them

578
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:10,886
[SPEAKER_24]: to apply the knowledge that we give them in the classroom and their real skills as far as presentation and communication.

579
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:20,749
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's two other things before I have the kids introduce themselves to you that you won't see tonight, but I think is important.

580
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,491
[SPEAKER_24]: When the kids introduce themselves, they're all competing in an individual event.

581
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:35,457
[SPEAKER_24]: What you won't see is two of the kids that learned a tough lesson about competing last year in a team.

582
00:50:36,397 --> 00:50:42,401
[SPEAKER_24]: So they took it upon themselves to compete individually, and here they are going to states.

583
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:48,105
[SPEAKER_24]: The second thing you won't see today is we have four qualifiers.

584
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:56,530
[SPEAKER_24]: But with the bridging of the two schools, three high school kids approached me this year that I had freshman year.

585
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:59,412
[SPEAKER_24]: And the back end is an elective.

586
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:04,334
[SPEAKER_24]: And they said, Mr. D, we've got to get this on our resume.

587
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:05,434
[SPEAKER_24]: We're juniors now.

588
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,995
[SPEAKER_24]: They saw the success we had in California last year.

589
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:16,116
[SPEAKER_24]: So the bridging is taking place, slowly but surely.

590
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:21,178
[SPEAKER_24]: But we now have an opportunity with DECA for both schools.

591
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,678
[SPEAKER_24]: So DECA provides the opportunity.

592
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:26,939
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a resume builder.

593
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,057
[SPEAKER_24]: And lastly, it's a character development.

594
00:51:31,678 --> 00:51:37,088
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm just gonna let my kids introduce themselves to you very quickly and tell you what they do.

595
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:37,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

596
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:48,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Rosalie Howard, and I'm a senior in the business program.

597
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:58,446
[SPEAKER_12]: And my DECA project was, it was a thing in entrepreneurship, and it was called Innovation Plan, so I had to come up with an idea.

598
00:51:58,466 --> 00:52:02,988
[SPEAKER_12]: And I came up with a toy to help hearing and impaired children.

599
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:09,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Because my cousin is totally deaf, he can't hear anything, so it always amazed me how there's no toys out there for him.

600
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:36,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So my whole toy is a six by six cube and it has removable sides and it will have like our letter A and it will have the letters the sign under it and once it's going to be like removable pieces like a puzzle and then once they pull it out it will have a magnetic piece in the back that will only match up with that piece and it will go in and when it goes in it will vibrate and light up to let them know they got it right.

601
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So they'll learn how to sign with

602
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:53,712
[SPEAKER_17]: The Met for Public Schools is proud to recognize Rosalie Howard, first place, Entrepreneurship Innovation Competition.

603
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:54,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, Rosalie.

604
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:02,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

605
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

606
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:06,622
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Hunter Tagnarelli.

607
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:08,944
[SPEAKER_18]: I competed in sports, entertainment, and marketing.

608
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:13,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, I'm a junior at the Medical Vocational Technical High School in the business program.

609
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:24,857
[SPEAKER_18]: For me, my first role play was based on the economy and how to increase ticket sales or how to increase TV marketing and advertisement and stuff like that.

610
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's about it for that.

611
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,291
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't really follow rules or anything.

612
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't make a revolutionary device or anything.

613
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:37,693
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to say thanks to my parents, though, for taking this little morning and everything.

614
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:42,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

615
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:46,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks to Mr. D for putting me in the right category, right?

616
00:53:46,796 --> 00:53:47,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Put me in the right thing.

617
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:51,057
[SPEAKER_18]: He taught me about how to market myself and how to be a salesperson.

618
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:52,698
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, thank you.

619
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:53,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

620
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,262
[SPEAKER_17]: We're proud to recognize Hunta Tognarelli, first place, Sports and Entertainment Marketing Competition.

621
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:09,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Marcinetto.

622
00:54:09,363 --> 00:54:33,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a junior at Metro Volk Vocational Technical High School, and I competed in quick serve restaurant management, where I had to help a restaurant get its sales back up through promotion, and I placed second place throughout that, and I would like to thank Mr. D for helping me place in the right category, because I am the first in my family to ever do something like this, and my first year at Metro Volk, and I would like to thank Mr. D.

623
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:47,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Marcio Neto, second place, quick serve restaurant management.

624
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:52,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

625
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:57,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Richard Horn, and I'm a junior in the business program.

626
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:00,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my event, I had to play a role as a catering manager.

627
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:07,231
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to cater for 750 people over a three-day period with seven different meals.

628
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I had to take a hundred test, a hundred question test for marketing.

629
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:23,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Richard Holland, Hospitality and Tourism Professional Selling.

630
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:25,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice job, Richard.

631
00:55:28,186 --> 00:55:39,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. D. Well, clearly you can see the confidence level in these young people, and it goes to a fabulous team at the Metro Vocational Technical High School.

632
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:52,410
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you get asked, is there anything going on at the Medford Public Schools, you have some remarkable stories tonight.

633
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:55,352
[SPEAKER_23]: Remarkable stories tonight.

634
00:55:56,512 --> 00:56:01,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

635
00:56:01,594 --> 00:56:03,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Moved by Mr. Agiro, seconded by Ms.

636
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:03,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

637
00:56:03,495 --> 00:56:04,275
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

638
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:05,656
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

639
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

640
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:09,177
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, report on kindergarten registration.

641
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:10,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent?

642
00:56:11,477 --> 00:56:16,458
[SPEAKER_23]: So every year, as you know, we have kindergartners who register for the Medford Public Schools.

643
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:18,538
[SPEAKER_23]: And we begin in March.

644
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:23,779
[SPEAKER_23]: We have building bridges to help parents understand the kindergarten program.

645
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:25,799
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got all the materials in front of you.

646
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:29,160
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're just doing this to announce it taking place.

647
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,561
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you want to attend and see how it goes, it's a great event.

648
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:36,941
[SPEAKER_23]: And it helps people better understand how kindergarten works in the Medford Public Schools.

649
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:39,942
[SPEAKER_23]: So without further ado, I think that's answers it.

650
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:40,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this March 5th?

651
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:43,034
[SPEAKER_23]: Maria's got a question.

652
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:44,114
[SPEAKER_17]: March 5th.

653
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:45,115
[SPEAKER_23]: March 5th.

654
00:56:46,356 --> 00:56:46,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

655
00:56:46,576 --> 00:56:49,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone.

656
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:49,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

657
00:56:50,419 --> 00:57:05,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So, in the past, people have suggested we have these at the elementary schools, the Columbus, Brooks, Roberts, and McGlynn, because parents do not have the opportunity if they have, if they come kindergarten to ever go in the schools.

658
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:16,592
[SPEAKER_15]: So two of them at the high school, which is great, but I'm just wondering if maybe next year we could have one at each of the elementary so the family can see the school their child will be attending.

659
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:21,774
[SPEAKER_23]: So part of that is the fact that some of them will exercise choice options.

660
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,736
[SPEAKER_23]: And for some reasons, they're also involved in that.

661
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:29,358
[SPEAKER_23]: But we could probably arrange a, let's say, a program that ties it together.

662
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:33,219
[SPEAKER_23]: So once a choice is made, there's an open house or activity at the school.

663
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,400
[SPEAKER_23]: That might give us the best of both worlds.

664
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:36,041
[SPEAKER_23]: OK?

665
00:57:37,693 --> 00:57:40,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, I just wanted to ask on behalf of Ms.

666
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:45,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Melanie McLaughlin, is CPAC information given during these open houses?

667
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:46,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

668
00:57:47,678 --> 00:57:49,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Kathy passes that out all the time.

669
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:51,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

670
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:51,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

671
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo.

672
00:57:54,781 --> 00:58:04,445
[SPEAKER_09]: On the page two of this, there is a reference that the lottery system is used if demand exceeds space.

673
00:58:04,465 --> 00:58:05,486
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just have a question.

674
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:12,887
[SPEAKER_09]: When there's a sibling already in the school, that is a priority.

675
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Siblings have priority.

676
00:58:14,127 --> 00:58:14,207
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

677
00:58:14,307 --> 00:58:16,948
[SPEAKER_17]: That's part of our racial balance plan.

678
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:17,088
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

679
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:17,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

680
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:20,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero?

681
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:22,690
[SPEAKER_08]: This is part of my ignorance.

682
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a little one in kindergarten yet.

683
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:30,372
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was curious, do we have like a welcome binder for parents that are coming into the schools?

684
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:33,673
[SPEAKER_23]: They have that material through the Building Bridges Program?

685
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:44,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so I'll ask you questions I can look at I'll get you more specifics is actually what they do So the registration will begin on March 5th 2018

686
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:52,175
[SPEAKER_17]: let's see, at the Parent Information Center from 7 a.m.

687
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:53,095
[SPEAKER_17]: to 3 p.m.

688
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:59,859
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also extended hours on Wednesday, March 7th, and Tuesday, April 10th, and they will go from 3 to 6.30 p.m.

689
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:06,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And over April vacation, the Tuesday through, and Wednesday, April 17th and 18th, 8 a.m.

690
00:59:06,822 --> 00:59:07,362
[SPEAKER_17]: to noon.

691
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:16,107
[SPEAKER_17]: This is all at the Parent Information Center at Medford High School, which is, if you go in the front lobby, you can't help but see the sign for Parent Info, it's right there.

692
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,386
[SPEAKER_17]: So your motion to receive this and place it on file.

693
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:20,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Moved by Ms.

694
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Mostone, seconded by Ms.

695
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:21,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

696
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:22,367
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

697
00:59:22,528 --> 00:59:22,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

698
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:23,608
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

699
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:24,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

700
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Update report on enrollments with information on 100 unit school-age students.

701
00:59:30,672 --> 00:59:40,456
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is basically a report that details the enrollment numbers we have in some of our larger housing developments, whether they be rental or owned.

702
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:41,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

703
00:59:41,793 --> 00:59:47,976
[SPEAKER_23]: So as the mayor points out, you asked that we look at housing units or complexes at 100.

704
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:50,378
[SPEAKER_23]: The last time we did it was 150.

705
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,660
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is that in-between group, and there were four of them there that we looked at.

706
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:58,522
[SPEAKER_23]: And this gives you a breakout.

707
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:01,043
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't substantially affect our enrollment in any way.

708
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:06,006
[SPEAKER_23]: We still have plenty of capacity, and this gives you an update in general enrollment in the public schools.

709
01:00:11,037 --> 01:00:11,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Mister Benedetto.

710
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:13,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

711
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for the report, Mr. Superintendent.

712
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish we had the report that you initially gave us on the 150 so we could see the differences in the numbers.

713
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:36,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, an issue that I brought up, I believe, when we initially got this report, is this just school age children or do we know how many younger children are in those buildings so that way we can plan for future moment?

714
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so we can see what areas are where we are.

715
01:00:40,025 --> 01:00:43,346
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't have access to that, so we can't really tell you that for sure.

716
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:52,089
[SPEAKER_23]: And oftentimes, the numbers of people coming and going, if they take an apartment for a short period of time, they leave before the child becomes school age.

717
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:58,851
[SPEAKER_23]: But if the pattern is consistent with what we're seeing, it's probably not that many people.

718
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:03,932
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not set up for large families, and so as a result, we don't see an impact.

719
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:09,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So the 120 student increase, is that because we went from

720
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:19,988
[SPEAKER_11]: buildings that were 150 down to buildings that included to 100, or is that an increase in the amount of students?

721
01:01:20,768 --> 01:01:27,431
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember the report we gave you was a September report, and naturally young people come in during the fall months.

722
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:34,214
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is really just the growth that would typically take place in the beginning of the school year.

723
01:01:34,314 --> 01:01:36,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Total enrollment, not just from these buildings.

724
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:41,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a breakdown of the differences from the January 150?

725
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:43,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in this report.

726
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,787
[SPEAKER_23]: If you take a look, it's broken by school.

727
01:01:44,807 --> 01:01:46,427
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see it.

728
01:01:48,928 --> 01:02:06,672
[SPEAKER_17]: So this included 48 Forest Street, which has been on our books for decades, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, 100 Station Landing, 39th Street, which has zero students, and 12 to 28 9th Street, both condominium developments that have been in the city of Medford for, I

729
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:09,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe more.

730
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:16,405
[SPEAKER_17]: So those new ones were 27, 28 students from those developments.

731
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:25,914
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you take a look on the back page, you can see, for example, if you look at 48 Forest Street, where Forest Street is generally in the Roberts District.

732
01:02:26,968 --> 01:02:27,288
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

733
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:34,234
[SPEAKER_23]: So as a result, you can, you can read, if you look at the thing, if you look at Mystic Valley Parkway, you're looking at the McGlynn primarily.

734
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:40,599
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're looking at station landing, you're probably looking at somewhere between the Roberts and the, um, and the McGlynn.

735
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,161
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, 9th Street, again, the Roberts.

736
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:46,764
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that gives you an idea of where the, where the distribution is.

737
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:51,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So for clarification, um, these are the additional ones.

738
01:02:52,376 --> 01:02:55,418
[SPEAKER_11]: From the report you gave us in September.

739
01:02:55,498 --> 01:03:00,861
[SPEAKER_23]: No, these people were included in your numbers before, but they weren't broken out because they weren't by 100 units.

740
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:07,305
[SPEAKER_23]: You asked to find out whether or not there were young people in the 100 unit departments, and this is the breakout that's there.

741
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:07,725
[SPEAKER_23]: OK?

742
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:10,707
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

743
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:11,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just pull those reports.

744
01:03:11,928 --> 01:03:13,469
[SPEAKER_11]: If I have any questions, I'll contact you directly.

745
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,709
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have any questions, we'll send you the other report.

746
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:16,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

747
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

748
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,990
[SPEAKER_17]: By Mrs. Kretz and seconded by Ms.

749
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:22,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot.

750
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,251
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

751
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:23,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

752
01:03:24,212 --> 01:03:24,852
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

753
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:25,653
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

754
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:29,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on vocational school student enrollment by shop area.

755
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:32,737
[SPEAKER_17]: So another- Mrs. Kretz requested this, I think?

756
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:33,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

757
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:38,700
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is another, you know, report that you would ask for.

758
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,061
[SPEAKER_23]: Is Chad and Jill still here?

759
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:40,201
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

760
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:43,567
[SPEAKER_15]: moment of 21 plus students.

761
01:03:44,128 --> 01:03:48,050
[SPEAKER_15]: They are two teachers except for media production TV.

762
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,211
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have 35 total enrollment.

763
01:03:59,265 --> 01:03:59,885
[SPEAKER_15]: with one teacher.

764
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:02,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just wondering, are they looking for another teacher for that?

765
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:05,068
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, remember, the media program is infancy this year.

766
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:05,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

767
01:04:05,668 --> 01:04:09,089
[SPEAKER_23]: So what you see is, you see the youngsters, you know, coming up.

768
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:11,350
[SPEAKER_23]: If we find that that requires that.

769
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, but right now it's fine.

770
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:20,374
[SPEAKER_23]: But at this point in time, you know, if they're not there 100% of the time, because the freshman numbers make up, you know, the largest portion of that.

771
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:24,236
[SPEAKER_23]: Because the freshmen are there and then the upperclassmen are only there one week on, one week off.

772
01:04:24,516 --> 01:04:24,836
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

773
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:35,525
[SPEAKER_23]: The numbers really depend on the type of SHOP program that it is and also, you know, whether they're an A-Week, B-Week, and the freshman numbers of the first column.

774
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:40,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, as I indicate in the report, 40 to 60 percent of the freshman numbers will probably stay with it.

775
01:04:40,868 --> 01:04:41,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

776
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:44,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so that number will come down, but the next class will come in.

777
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:44,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

778
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:49,833
[SPEAKER_23]: So, we expect that the vocational CTE enrollments will increase.

779
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,011
[SPEAKER_23]: But they'll still be within margins that we can work with.

780
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:55,171
[SPEAKER_23]: If we need a second teacher, we'll go there.

781
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,232
[SPEAKER_23]: If we don't need a second teacher, we'll pull it back.

782
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:01,492
[SPEAKER_23]: The one thing I did note, that auto collision is very, very low.

783
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:09,934
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a distinct possibility we'll either suspend that enrollment for going forward in the future and look at that area possibly for another type of shot.

784
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,135
[SPEAKER_23]: But we'll see how that goes.

785
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see what happens as we move forward.

786
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:16,596
[SPEAKER_17]: And would students have choice at one of the regional?

787
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:22,934
[SPEAKER_23]: The regional that we most typically use doesn't have that program, so that's a good thing.

788
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:23,334
[SPEAKER_16]: But others do.

789
01:05:23,374 --> 01:05:23,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

790
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:25,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Others do.

791
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:26,157
[SPEAKER_23]: They might.

792
01:05:27,238 --> 01:05:30,721
[SPEAKER_23]: I doubt it, considering the fact that if they wanted it, they would have signed up for it.

793
01:05:32,302 --> 01:05:32,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

794
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:33,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

795
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:35,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurtz.

796
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:42,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure, you know, seeing the numbers, and they're very impressive, the breakdown of the new freshman class, you know, going into the program.

797
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to make sure that

798
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:53,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We budget for the increase in the enrollment for all the new programs to make sure that we have enough books, tools, supplies, and seating for all the students.

799
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hear that there's a lot of students that might not have some things that they need.

800
01:05:59,765 --> 01:06:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to put it out there for the budget time that we might need to increase the budget.

801
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:06,190
[SPEAKER_23]: So budget discussion.

802
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,631
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Ruggiero.

803
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:13,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking over the list of trades here.

804
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:16,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that there was no Information about plumbing.

805
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:29,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we don't have a plumbing department here We send most of those kids to the miniman is it just there's just not as much interest in our community I think there could be some interest in the program one of the things that we were talking about although I can't

806
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:37,792
[SPEAKER_23]: say this for sure, is that if we recaptured a space such as the auto-collision space, we might convert that into something else.

807
01:06:38,172 --> 01:06:42,353
[SPEAKER_23]: The one caveat of that particular space is it's right on top of the media center.

808
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:47,015
[SPEAKER_23]: We wouldn't want the banging going on in that center.

809
01:06:47,055 --> 01:06:49,196
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd go with the flow a little bit.

810
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:51,097
[SPEAKER_23]: Did I say that?

811
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:56,679
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd probably move it to a different area near the HVAC and move something else into that area.

812
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:59,096
[SPEAKER_08]: How many students do we have right now?

813
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:00,757
[SPEAKER_08]: They're at the Minuteman for the plumbing program?

814
01:07:00,777 --> 01:07:01,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

815
01:07:01,177 --> 01:07:03,158
[SPEAKER_23]: Minuteman has about seven students right now.

816
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:05,019
[SPEAKER_23]: Essex Aggie has four.

817
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:09,321
[SPEAKER_23]: They're an agriculture school that we don't have the capacity to serve.

818
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:13,644
[SPEAKER_23]: We expect that the Minuteman number is going to drop down in half, if not more, next year.

819
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:17,065
[SPEAKER_23]: And little by little, we won't have anybody at Minuteman, I would think.

820
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:17,906
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

821
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:22,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

822
01:07:23,568 --> 01:07:25,329
[SPEAKER_17]: So moved by Ms.

823
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:26,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

824
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,450
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

825
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:28,931
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

826
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:30,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

827
01:07:30,992 --> 01:07:33,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on free reduced lunch applications, Mr. Superintendent.

828
01:07:33,974 --> 01:07:37,836
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to explain this report.

829
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:41,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, members of the committee.

830
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:48,282
[SPEAKER_25]: As provided in the summary document, this is just informational so that you know

831
01:07:49,110 --> 01:08:05,956
[SPEAKER_25]: the activity for this fiscal year based on our enrollment, which we currently have 4,377 students, and an overall free and reduced count of 1,905, which represents 43.52% of our overall population.

832
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:12,479
[SPEAKER_25]: The attachment provided identifies by school those participation rates.

833
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:15,620
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's noteworthy to indicate

834
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:26,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Where we are processing fewer applications, we are still getting a high level of participation due to the virtual gateway that is a direct certification.

835
01:08:26,456 --> 01:08:38,903
[SPEAKER_25]: So families that are receiving special services within TANF or SNAP are automatically qualified and there is no requirement for an application at that point.

836
01:08:39,443 --> 01:08:40,864
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, previously,

837
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:49,403
[SPEAKER_25]: reported if they, an application does not necessarily equate to a free or reduced capacity.

838
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:55,784
[SPEAKER_25]: It's based on eligibility that's subject to the federal guidelines each year, and it's established at the federal level.

839
01:08:55,904 --> 01:09:06,147
[SPEAKER_25]: So where we have a decent percentage, again, we're still processing over 400, and those continue on throughout the year.

840
01:09:07,618 --> 01:09:11,120
[SPEAKER_25]: are qualified for free, they get free for the entire year.

841
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:18,865
[SPEAKER_25]: If they are reduced and there's a situation that occurs, they are always welcome to establish another application.

842
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:20,826
[SPEAKER_25]: And we encourage that.

843
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:26,670
[SPEAKER_25]: So at this time, this is the free and reduced category for the district.

844
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:27,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

845
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:28,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions?

846
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

847
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for this report.

848
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:34,095
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very informative.

849
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:56,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any numbers, and it may not be you, maybe our headmaster that's in the back of the room, do we know that how many of our high school students that qualify for free and reduced lunch also take advantage of lower application rates for colleges as well as free SATs?

850
01:09:56,588 --> 01:09:57,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have those numbers?

851
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:06,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I just want to make sure that those families that are entitled to those benefits know about them and are actually taking part in that program.

852
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:10,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they qualify for free or reduced lunch, they also qualify for those programs.

853
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:11,239
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

854
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:18,345
[SPEAKER_25]: So the free and reduced qualification offers several benefits where there's no fees charged and things of that sort.

855
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:23,770
[SPEAKER_25]: With regard to do I know that count, that's outside the scope of the lunch program.

856
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,872
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't have that figure.

857
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:26,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Perella?

858
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:28,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, everyone.

859
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:42,937
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have those numbers either at this point, but I do know that the guidance department works in conjunction with the food services to provide that information to students as well as the colleges, because it is something that we focus on in the application process.

860
01:10:43,617 --> 01:10:56,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So to the superintendent, could we check those numbers just to make sure that we are getting the word out to those families and those parents of these options, and who's taking advantage of them?

861
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're not,

862
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,851
[SPEAKER_11]: then what we need to do better to really let people know that.

863
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:11,313
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm requesting that report to be added to the reports requested list on the back of our agenda for the superintendent to get back.

864
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:14,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they informed of the benefits that go along with this?

865
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:15,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like the data.

866
01:11:16,475 --> 01:11:25,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure that we know how many of our high school students are getting free SATs and free or reduced college applications.

867
01:11:26,217 --> 01:11:34,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to compare that to the free and reduced lunch, and to see if there's a gap there, and if there is a gap, what next steps we would take.

868
01:11:34,728 --> 01:11:35,649
[SPEAKER_11]: So I need the data first.

869
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:47,033
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion that we receive a report that compares those receiving free or reduced pricing for college applications, SATs, versus free and reduced lunch.

870
01:11:47,533 --> 01:11:48,213
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

871
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:49,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, is there a second, actually?

872
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:51,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Ms.

873
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

874
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:52,376
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

875
01:11:53,216 --> 01:11:53,937
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

876
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:54,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

877
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:55,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

878
01:11:56,798 --> 01:11:59,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

879
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,221
[SPEAKER_17]: By Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

880
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:01,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloot.

881
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:02,562
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

882
01:12:02,922 --> 01:12:03,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

883
01:12:03,442 --> 01:12:04,183
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

884
01:12:04,223 --> 01:12:04,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion has it.

885
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Report on state budget fiscal year 2019.

886
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:13,972
[SPEAKER_23]: So I've provided you a report on the state budget as it currently stands.

887
01:12:14,052 --> 01:12:16,956
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, House 2 is the governor's proposal.

888
01:12:17,871 --> 01:12:28,401
[SPEAKER_23]: The governor's proposal, with no disrespect to the governor, is generally dead on arrival in the legislature almost immediately because the legislature has its own view of what they want to do.

889
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:32,906
[SPEAKER_23]: Although, many elements in the governor's budget will be sustained by the legislature as well.

890
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:35,468
[SPEAKER_23]: And there are any number of things that have to go through.

891
01:12:35,508 --> 01:12:38,932
[SPEAKER_23]: But we won't really get a final budget out of the state until June.

892
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:43,533
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get a very good idea of where the House and the Senate are going with it.

893
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:48,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Primarily the Senate and the House, you know, when they get through the conference committee, probably in early June.

894
01:12:49,654 --> 01:12:52,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Probably get a pretty good idea as to what's taking place.

895
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:56,916
[SPEAKER_23]: But we won't get a real vote on it until we're into June.

896
01:12:57,476 --> 01:13:01,056
[SPEAKER_23]: But we work on estimates and we, a lot of these things are ideas and they're trends.

897
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:03,837
[SPEAKER_23]: But I want to go over some of them because they have an impact on us.

898
01:13:04,537 --> 01:13:07,958
[SPEAKER_23]: And they also have an impact on what might happen at the federal level.

899
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:19,374
[SPEAKER_23]: and what might happen with regard to the new tax laws that may or may not take place, and also, in fact, the new tax law that's been passed by the federal government.

900
01:13:19,814 --> 01:13:24,998
[SPEAKER_23]: So let's go over a couple of things so you're aware of it, because this informs our budget planning process.

901
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:37,469
[SPEAKER_23]: It also informs our lobbying efforts at the state level, as we talk to people and ask for certain supplementals and other budgets to be upgraded as we move forward through the budget process.

902
01:13:38,405 --> 01:13:47,533
[SPEAKER_23]: So the process begins every year with a consensus budget revenue estimate, which is agreed upon by the governor and the House and Senate leadership.

903
01:13:48,574 --> 01:13:52,317
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, that estimate this year went up about 3.5%.

904
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, that's nowhere near enough for all the things that people ask for, but that's where they're going right now.

905
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:11,232
[SPEAKER_23]: And the budget itself proposed a 2.6 increase to the budget of 40.9 million.

906
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:16,974
[SPEAKER_23]: The main source of education funding is Chapter 70.

907
01:14:18,214 --> 01:14:19,955
[SPEAKER_23]: Chapter 70 is done by formula.

908
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:23,876
[SPEAKER_23]: It's done by student population, by need, and all those other factors.

909
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:29,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Based on that, we are a budget, our school, city, that is above foundation.

910
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:33,436
[SPEAKER_23]: Most cities are, although there are a number of cities that are not.

911
01:14:34,196 --> 01:14:36,298
[SPEAKER_23]: If you're above foundation, you get minimum aid.

912
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:43,663
[SPEAKER_23]: The governor's proposal is $20 per pupil, which is a robust $93,000, which goes nowhere very quickly.

913
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:48,226
[SPEAKER_23]: Before we even think about it, $93,000 is out the window.

914
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:53,750
[SPEAKER_23]: The Senate and the House tend to increase that either by $5 to $10 a year.

915
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:58,220
[SPEAKER_23]: which still doesn't do that much for us, but it's still a little bit better.

916
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,885
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll be lobbying the House and the Senate to increase that particular amount.

917
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:08,211
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, the overall increase to Chapter 70 is $104.9 million.

918
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:12,435
[SPEAKER_23]: That's for 321 operating school districts.

919
01:15:12,455 --> 01:15:14,538
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see that's not a lot of money going out.

920
01:15:15,058 --> 01:15:16,560
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can imagine the big cities

921
01:15:17,897 --> 01:15:25,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Boston, Worcester, Lawrence, Lowell, Fall River, New Bedford, places like that, with high need, get the bulk of those increases.

922
01:15:29,102 --> 01:15:37,145
[SPEAKER_23]: If we move on a little bit, unrestricted local aid, which is not education aid, goes to the city, and that's up by 425,970.

923
01:15:37,326 --> 01:15:41,447
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't clap yet.

924
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:42,188
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't clap yet.

925
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:45,089
[SPEAKER_23]: You see the next line tells you that before you're through,

926
01:15:46,024 --> 01:15:51,307
[SPEAKER_23]: When you take away the assessments and you get a sheet here, we lose $17,000 in change.

927
01:15:52,248 --> 01:16:01,553
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're getting $17,000 in change less based on the ins and outs of the cherry sheet, which is included here, the estimated cherry sheet and the governor's thing.

928
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:03,934
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's tricky.

929
01:16:03,954 --> 01:16:05,195
[SPEAKER_23]: You might think you're getting your way.

930
01:16:05,235 --> 01:16:06,936
[SPEAKER_23]: When you hear people say you're getting all this money, you're not.

931
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:12,109
[SPEAKER_23]: What you're getting is you're getting a balance between assessments and revenue.

932
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:16,430
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that doesn't include things like, you know, meals tax and things like that.

933
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:21,651
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's, that's a different ball game altogether, but direct aid to the city and to the schools.

934
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:24,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, we net loss of 17,000.

935
01:16:25,512 --> 01:16:34,654
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, two major concerns in the governor's proposed budget that I want to mention is the underfunding of the charter school reimbursements.

936
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:36,874
[SPEAKER_23]: It's probably somewhere in the vicinity,

937
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:47,770
[SPEAKER_23]: of $70 million less across the commonwealth than the formula or the entitlement formula would otherwise provide.

938
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:54,235
[SPEAKER_23]: So when people still rail against charter schools and enrollment in charter schools, it's because it's underfunded.

939
01:16:54,255 --> 01:17:04,742
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no problem with kids who want to go to charter school, go, but if you have an entitlement formula funded closer to the entitlement in every year, that hasn't increased for the last four or five years, that assessment.

940
01:17:05,548 --> 01:17:07,949
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's something to pay attention to.

941
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:10,450
[SPEAKER_23]: And the other factor is the circuit breaker.

942
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:14,491
[SPEAKER_23]: The circuit breaker is for extraordinary special needs costs.

943
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:20,733
[SPEAKER_23]: The way the circuit breaker works is that four times foundation, which in this instance is probably about $44,000.

944
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:21,534
[SPEAKER_23]: Kathy, roughly?

945
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, someplace in there.

946
01:17:22,354 --> 01:17:22,834
[SPEAKER_23]: It used to be $28,000.

947
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:24,455
[SPEAKER_23]: After you hit $44,000 on a placement,

948
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:36,495
[SPEAKER_23]: The state allegedly will give us 75% back on the remaining budget.

949
01:17:36,535 --> 01:17:40,018
[SPEAKER_23]: So let's say the cost of this private school is $100,000.

950
01:17:41,358 --> 01:17:47,742
[SPEAKER_23]: Based on that, the $56,000 delta would then be eligible for 75%.

951
01:17:48,283 --> 01:17:56,768
[SPEAKER_23]: However, they funded it at 65% in this budget, which means that at this particular point in time, Medford will be short somewhere around $155,000.

952
01:18:00,329 --> 01:18:09,675
[SPEAKER_23]: By the way, going back to the charter school thing, the reimbursement's about $400,000 lower than it should be to Medford, based on the actual formula.

953
01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:15,219
[SPEAKER_23]: So it gives you an idea that, you know, we have entitlement formulas, but they don't get funded.

954
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:21,623
[SPEAKER_23]: Probably the saddest words in budget preparation is subject to appropriation.

955
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:27,027
[SPEAKER_23]: They pass a law, you have an entitlement, and then it's subject to appropriation.

956
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:33,552
[SPEAKER_23]: If the appropriation doesn't keep pace with the entitlement or the formula, you don't get what you think you're going to get.

957
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:34,994
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's always a tricky factor.

958
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:43,401
[SPEAKER_23]: There are multiple other variables that must be considered when planning a budget for fiscal 2019.

959
01:18:45,283 --> 01:18:51,165
[SPEAKER_23]: Uncertainty in the federal budget, impacting grants of Medicaid distributions to state, city, and schools.

960
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:52,765
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't know what's going to happen.

961
01:18:53,346 --> 01:18:56,707
[SPEAKER_23]: The costs of health care, always going up right now.

962
01:18:57,367 --> 01:18:58,987
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost of negotiated salaries.

963
01:18:59,007 --> 01:19:00,428
[SPEAKER_23]: We're in collective bargaining right now.

964
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:03,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever we negotiate has to be accounted for.

965
01:19:03,169 --> 01:19:08,771
[SPEAKER_23]: The impact of possible reduction in the sales tax through the initiative petition.

966
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:13,172
[SPEAKER_23]: There's an initiative petition that could make its way to the ballot if it does.

967
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:16,215
[SPEAKER_23]: It could be a reduction in the sales tax.

968
01:19:18,096 --> 01:19:22,637
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's the fair share tax, which is sometimes known as the millionaire's tax.

969
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:29,439
[SPEAKER_23]: If that were to go through, the estimate is that somewhere, the state might get $2 billion.

970
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:36,401
[SPEAKER_23]: But how it gets distributed back to the cities and towns will depend on the formula that's used.

971
01:19:37,341 --> 01:19:38,622
[SPEAKER_23]: And when, okay?

972
01:19:39,202 --> 01:19:42,523
[SPEAKER_23]: And then of course there's the increase in other service costs, whether it be transportation,

973
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:47,431
[SPEAKER_23]: energy or any of those things all have to be factored into budget planning.

974
01:19:48,112 --> 01:19:56,278
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is intended to give you a little bit of a appetizer as to how we have to look at the budget as we go forward for next year.

975
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:02,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, it's very important that we work very hard to secure our current and potential revenue.

976
01:20:02,783 --> 01:20:05,164
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of our budget is based on revenue.

977
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:08,347
[SPEAKER_23]: And we need to be aggressive about that.

978
01:20:09,127 --> 01:20:12,630
[SPEAKER_23]: We have some good possibilities, but they have to be developed aggressively.

979
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:19,275
[SPEAKER_23]: to maintain and enhance them so our educational programs and services don't get cut by reductions in aid.

980
01:20:21,156 --> 01:20:23,217
[SPEAKER_23]: The House and Senate will be preparing their budgets.

981
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:30,142
[SPEAKER_23]: The House begins in April, the Senate begins in May, typically, and the conference committee sometime towards the end of May, early June.

982
01:20:30,862 --> 01:20:33,664
[SPEAKER_23]: And we typically do budget, full budget in June.

983
01:20:34,104 --> 01:20:36,766
[SPEAKER_23]: We do pre-budgets as we go forward.

984
01:20:36,786 --> 01:20:40,428
[SPEAKER_23]: In the next couple of months, you'll start seeing pre-budgets come out as the department heads

985
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:45,247
[SPEAKER_23]: and principals and school counselors will come forward and tell you what they think their needs are.

986
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:47,048
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll have to listen to that.

987
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:52,290
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll also be in collective bargaining discussions as to what we intend to do with our various unions.

988
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,391
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a quick synopsis of the budget.

989
01:20:55,411 --> 01:21:04,936
[SPEAKER_23]: I've also given you a couple of other articles to read in the back that you might find interesting with regard to budgets.

990
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:07,197
[SPEAKER_23]: They come from local publications.

991
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:12,274
[SPEAKER_23]: It's one of them state leaders are facing trickiest budget cycle in recent years.

992
01:21:13,194 --> 01:21:17,256
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's another one back here that deals with the budget as well.

993
01:21:17,837 --> 01:21:19,837
[SPEAKER_23]: So let me see if I can give you the title of that.

994
01:21:23,339 --> 01:21:31,403
[SPEAKER_17]: So the net hit from charter schools to us is an increased $439,000 in the first round of the governor's budget.

995
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,555
[SPEAKER_17]: above what we're paying already.

996
01:21:35,036 --> 01:21:39,640
[SPEAKER_17]: So we paid 5.1 was our assessment for the current year, 5.1 million.

997
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:44,044
[SPEAKER_17]: I've scheduled to go up to almost 5.5 million next year.

998
01:21:44,565 --> 01:21:53,193
[SPEAKER_17]: With the offset, as Roy just mentioned, we got reimbursed 566,000 in fiscal 18 for the cherry sheets, and it's projected to go down to 504,000.

999
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:57,852
[SPEAKER_17]: So hit on both sides of that one.

1000
01:21:58,332 --> 01:22:06,399
[SPEAKER_23]: So the challenges that the city faces, you know, in funding schools and other city services is really characterized by this type of funding.

1001
01:22:10,022 --> 01:22:10,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Azuro.

1002
01:22:11,443 --> 01:22:13,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for putting this report together.

1003
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:15,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Nelson.

1004
01:22:15,486 --> 01:22:21,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, for people to successfully, uh, petition their government, they need to understand the issues.

1005
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:24,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm concerned about some of the points that you brought up here.

1006
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:30,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think it'd be really good for the community if we could put together a little presentation of how the state budget affects our local schools.

1007
01:22:31,624 --> 01:22:39,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, what you've done here is very informative, but it'd be nice if we could perhaps do it through the community relations subcommittee, something that could be advertised and taught.

1008
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:42,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't think most people understand that we're going to be facing cuts.

1009
01:22:43,133 --> 01:22:44,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the people need to understand.

1010
01:22:44,714 --> 01:22:48,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least if they want to petition their government representatives, they'll be able to.

1011
01:22:50,113 --> 01:23:01,155
[SPEAKER_23]: why don't we put it on an agenda for like community relations subcommittee meeting, which we can, and then possibly use our new media, you know, put it out there on the webpage and let people know the challenges the city faces.

1012
01:23:01,295 --> 01:23:05,476
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that's really, it's true of our virtually every city in town in the Commonwealth right now.

1013
01:23:06,636 --> 01:23:14,077
[SPEAKER_23]: And the good news is that Medford does do a lot of things locally to, to generate revenue, but it's a challenge more and more.

1014
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:18,598
[SPEAKER_23]: The idea when two and a half came in was, is that the state would step in and pick up.

1015
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:21,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Not always the case.

1016
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So when did you say that the budget negotiations would be happening in the House and Senate?

1017
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say May and April?

1018
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:29,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no, they'll be starting sooner than that.

1019
01:23:29,764 --> 01:23:30,064
[SPEAKER_17]: March.

1020
01:23:30,565 --> 01:23:31,565
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll start their hearings.

1021
01:23:31,946 --> 01:23:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1022
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:35,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we could move it to the agenda for the community relations.

1023
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:37,629
[SPEAKER_08]: We can start working with it.

1024
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1025
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:38,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1026
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:38,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1027
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:38,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1028
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Russo first.

1029
01:23:42,652 --> 01:23:46,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, is it possible?

1030
01:23:46,214 --> 01:23:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I know inflation isn't really known until it's already in history,

1031
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:50,350
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, until it's the past.

1032
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:58,594
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I mean, $400,000 going up to 405, everybody gets excited, but that's actually a reduction.

1033
01:23:58,654 --> 01:24:06,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any way for numbers to be presented with a projected inflation adjusted, what it really will be?

1034
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure if that's even a thing, projected inflation adjusted.

1035
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:16,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I feel like you can always do that historically and say, you know, McCope was this much then and it is this much now.

1036
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:32,756
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, whenever I see these numbers, I just feel like even if they go in the right way, even if they did, that is actually not the right direction necessarily.

1037
01:24:32,836 --> 01:24:36,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I don't, I mean, I don't even know if that's a thing to do.

1038
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:42,240
[SPEAKER_09]: a future budget's projected inflation adjusted value.

1039
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:43,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is that a thing?

1040
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:49,564
[SPEAKER_23]: We've intended to give people, you know, the inflation index numbers, you know, consumer price index, the other things.

1041
01:24:49,945 --> 01:24:55,408
[SPEAKER_23]: You give them an idea, but it really depends on what you're talking about, what the cost of a particular good and service is.

1042
01:24:55,828 --> 01:24:58,330
[SPEAKER_23]: Some things are inflationary, some things are deflationary.

1043
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:05,434
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, you have to really look at the item itself because the totality contains both inflationary and deflationary items.

1044
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:09,755
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's not easy to just simply put a simple number, but you can give people an idea.

1045
01:25:10,696 --> 01:25:11,376
[SPEAKER_23]: Give people an idea.

1046
01:25:14,098 --> 01:25:14,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1047
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:16,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1048
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Ms.

1049
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Mostone.

1050
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:19,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just interested.

1051
01:25:20,262 --> 01:25:25,806
[SPEAKER_15]: With charter schools, I feel like Mystic Valley was the one that I always heard about, probably when Quinn was starting school.

1052
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:28,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I heard about Prospect Hill, and now there's Pioneer.

1053
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:31,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any other ones that I'm missing that Medford residents go to?

1054
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:34,991
[SPEAKER_23]: There's some Cambridge activities.

1055
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:38,774
[SPEAKER_23]: Some people have gone to Advanced Science, a little bit further, Marlborough.

1056
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:45,679
[SPEAKER_23]: There are a few that's better, but the big ones, Mystic Valley, Prospect Hill, and Cambridge are probably the biggest ones.

1057
01:25:45,879 --> 01:25:46,159
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

1058
01:25:46,879 --> 01:25:48,541
[SPEAKER_23]: We can give you a listing of those at this point.

1059
01:25:48,721 --> 01:25:58,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, let's just start off by saying, because I know it's a sensitive topic, is that not necessarily against charter schools per se, it's the funding formula that needs to be sustained.

1060
01:25:59,817 --> 01:26:04,919
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if you're going to say, well, this is going to happen, then it's got to happen.

1061
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:09,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Otherwise, it's just really just taking people down the road, and communities have to bear the cost.

1062
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:14,443
[SPEAKER_23]: The state doesn't want to take on the structural deficit, so they pass it on to the community.

1063
01:26:16,143 --> 01:26:19,065
[SPEAKER_23]: That number, that $80 million, hasn't gone up in years.

1064
01:26:21,128 --> 01:26:23,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

1065
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:28,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1066
01:26:28,636 --> 01:26:29,196
[SPEAKER_08]: You could.

1067
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:30,337
[SPEAKER_17]: You could make that motion.

1068
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:38,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make a motion to approve this issue and also think about ways that we can make the budget a little bit more accessible, a little bit more being sexy.

1069
01:26:39,046 --> 01:26:40,648
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk about sexy budgets.

1070
01:26:50,047 --> 01:26:50,667
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there a second?

1071
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:51,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second, yes.

1072
01:26:51,228 --> 01:26:51,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Stone?

1073
01:26:51,808 --> 01:26:52,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1074
01:26:52,088 --> 01:26:53,288
[SPEAKER_16]: I love being sexy.

1075
01:26:54,489 --> 01:26:59,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion that this report be sent down to the subcommittee.

1076
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:01,252
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion.

1077
01:27:02,032 --> 01:27:02,752
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1078
01:27:02,972 --> 01:27:03,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1079
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:05,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion has it.

1080
01:27:05,193 --> 01:27:07,374
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you've got me in the lost of words.

1081
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:09,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Do it without laughing.

1082
01:27:09,995 --> 01:27:10,035
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1083
01:27:10,075 --> 01:27:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Negotiation of legal matters?

1084
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:11,856
[SPEAKER_17]: None?

1085
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:12,116
[SPEAKER_17]: None?

1086
01:27:15,927 --> 01:27:22,973
[SPEAKER_17]: old business, which really isn't that old, but recommendation to approve Roberts Elementary community preservation grant submission.

1087
01:27:23,093 --> 01:27:38,426
[SPEAKER_17]: As you heard earlier, there was a report by the subcommittee, and within that report, the subcommittee made a recommendation that the full body adopt and accept and sign on to the application for the Roberts School for a new rubber surfacing in their playground.

1088
01:27:38,947 --> 01:27:42,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the superintendent mentioned there's other schools that have this issue, but certainly

1089
01:27:43,529 --> 01:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_17]: We can get ourselves into that queue.

1090
01:27:46,411 --> 01:27:48,553
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a recommendation on the floor from the subcommittee.

1091
01:27:49,854 --> 01:27:51,235
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval by Ms.

1092
01:27:51,255 --> 01:27:51,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Van de Kloot.

1093
01:27:52,776 --> 01:27:53,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1094
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:58,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to be clear what next steps are for Ms.

1095
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:01,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Rodriguez who's bringing this forward to the CPA.

1096
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,782
[SPEAKER_11]: So she had some further information.

1097
01:28:06,902 --> 01:28:08,183
[SPEAKER_11]: She sent us an email today.

1098
01:28:08,243 --> 01:28:18,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to ask her to come to the podium and speak and give us an update of where she is at with moving this forward and also to offer to go to that meeting with her.

1099
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:32,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Any funds for the school and getting the beginning of our school playgrounds redone is important to all of us as this committee to make sure

1100
01:28:33,407 --> 01:28:39,152
[SPEAKER_11]: We have up-to-date facilities for our children to play on a daily basis.

1101
01:28:39,753 --> 01:28:50,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to ask the mayor if there was any other city funds coming down the pipeline towards this particular item.

1102
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:51,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1103
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:52,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Rodriguez.

1104
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:55,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1105
01:28:55,658 --> 01:29:02,963
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I went to the subcommittee meeting last week, and Mr. John McLaughlin from the Buildings and Grounds had given us an estimate.

1106
01:29:03,924 --> 01:29:05,825
[SPEAKER_13]: I ended up reaching out to that person.

1107
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:11,068
[SPEAKER_13]: During the course of the meeting, it was suggested by Mr. Belson that perhaps rubber tiles would be better.

1108
01:29:11,869 --> 01:29:15,471
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke to him on the phone, and the rubber tiles are far more durable.

1109
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:17,093
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll last us probably close to 20 years.

1110
01:29:18,113 --> 01:29:19,633
[SPEAKER_13]: They require zero maintenance.

1111
01:29:19,753 --> 01:29:30,675
[SPEAKER_13]: If we get the pour in place, if we want it to last about 12 years, we would need to invest about $10,000 five to seven years in to reseal it.

1112
01:29:30,835 --> 01:29:33,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's cheaper to actually get the rubber tiles.

1113
01:29:33,096 --> 01:29:37,737
[SPEAKER_13]: The estimate was around $85,000 as opposed to $92,000, so it would save money.

1114
01:29:38,157 --> 01:29:45,978
[SPEAKER_13]: The playground apparatus doesn't need to come out, and as was discussed, the playground apparatus is right now in very good shape compared to the

1115
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:48,910
[SPEAKER_13]: to the surfacing.

1116
01:29:50,030 --> 01:30:02,714
[SPEAKER_13]: The man also suggested, I believe his name was Travis, that we could lower the cost of the estimate by having a landscaping company, or maybe we had people within the city that would be able to take out the old rubber surfacing.

1117
01:30:02,754 --> 01:30:04,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Their estimate for that was $25,000.

1118
01:30:05,175 --> 01:30:15,658
[SPEAKER_13]: He said that was because he had high-level professionals that do the playgrounds coming in to do that, and it was something that he said could be done with a shovel that a landscaper would know how to do.

1119
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:19,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And they would probably give us an estimate of $10,000 to $12,000.

1120
01:30:20,068 --> 01:30:26,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Possibly we could even get that lower if we had a resource in the community or someone that we could reach out to.

1121
01:30:28,017 --> 01:30:34,421
[SPEAKER_13]: If the substone is in good shape, that $10,000 that was put in for that could go down or be eliminated.

1122
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:47,508
[SPEAKER_13]: So the goal for us right now is to try to make our application as lean as possible, show as much community support as we can, which would include things like getting workers in the community to help us out.

1123
01:30:47,988 --> 01:30:56,793
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the city was able, if there is a line item coming up in our budget for other playground services, if we combined more than one estimate,

1124
01:30:57,253 --> 01:31:06,260
[SPEAKER_13]: we would save additional $1 to $2 per square foot, which just for the Roberts playground would be anywhere from $5,400 to $11,000.

1125
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:10,263
[SPEAKER_13]: So it could make a significant difference.

1126
01:31:10,323 --> 01:31:19,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hoping that someone in the committee or the mayor is interested in helping work towards this application.

1127
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:19,911
[SPEAKER_13]: I am, again, just a

1128
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:23,210
[SPEAKER_13]: a parent volunteer, trying to do the best that I can.

1129
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:28,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm hoping that the Roberts can serve as the model and the first step, and we can get the other schools in place.

1130
01:31:29,034 --> 01:31:31,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the other schools do need this done as well.

1131
01:31:33,457 --> 01:31:34,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1132
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:36,299
[SPEAKER_13]: And the meeting, I'm sorry.

1133
01:31:36,459 --> 01:31:41,963
[SPEAKER_13]: The meeting is, we're meeting with the commission for the community preservation on February 13th.

1134
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:43,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Our meeting is at 7.30.

1135
01:31:43,804 --> 01:31:45,505
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an open meeting, but we don't have a room.

1136
01:31:45,545 --> 01:31:46,306
[SPEAKER_13]: It's here at City Hall.

1137
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:54,162
[SPEAKER_23]: So just to cover that, I appreciate that Cheryl's done some research, but we need to be very careful of a few things.

1138
01:31:54,682 --> 01:31:58,603
[SPEAKER_23]: When people come in and give estimates, remember, we're a public entity.

1139
01:31:58,703 --> 01:31:59,983
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to go through a bid process.

1140
01:32:00,883 --> 01:32:02,184
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to pay prevailing wage.

1141
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:09,446
[SPEAKER_23]: We have all number of things that we can't skirt around that maybe a contractor might say, you could do it for this, you could do it for that.

1142
01:32:09,946 --> 01:32:17,028
[SPEAKER_23]: We also have to concern ourselves about liability, things that are put together by people who mean well, but maybe are not professional.

1143
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,641
[SPEAKER_23]: might actually get it done, but there might be something that goes wrong.

1144
01:32:20,682 --> 01:32:23,123
[SPEAKER_23]: And if it goes wrong, we could be liable.

1145
01:32:23,203 --> 01:32:25,124
[SPEAKER_23]: So the suggestions are good ones.

1146
01:32:25,144 --> 01:32:28,886
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll look into them, but there's no silver bullet on these things.

1147
01:32:29,546 --> 01:32:37,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, people give us estimates all the time, some high, some low, but there are some other factors we have to pay attention to when we do procurement.

1148
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:40,652
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to make sure everybody understands it's not just a simple thing.

1149
01:32:41,253 --> 01:32:47,176
[SPEAKER_23]: And when we have do things, even with the best intentions, we run into liability issues if they're not properly

1150
01:32:47,822 --> 01:32:48,322
[SPEAKER_23]: put together.

1151
01:32:49,223 --> 01:32:51,145
[SPEAKER_23]: So thanks for the ideas.

1152
01:32:51,185 --> 01:32:52,966
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's look into them, but let's be careful.

1153
01:32:56,188 --> 01:32:56,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1154
01:32:56,889 --> 01:33:03,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, Mr. Wilson, do we know, is there a great issue or cause I have some farm equipment.

1155
01:33:04,054 --> 01:33:06,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I possibly could bring it to here.

1156
01:33:07,617 --> 01:33:12,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I could, if I'll, if I, all I need is a trailer and I could bring my some farm equipment.

1157
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:13,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I have like a bulldozer.

1158
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys need grading work done or,

1159
01:33:16,743 --> 01:33:27,231
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to be very careful because if you put this interlocking rubber on top of what you've got, you've got to make sure that what's below it is properly set up.

1160
01:33:27,831 --> 01:33:35,436
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have the best intentions and you do certain things, you may undercut the ability to put these things.

1161
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:40,300
[SPEAKER_23]: There may be a shortcut or two that may seem plausible at this point in time.

1162
01:33:41,572 --> 01:33:44,593
[SPEAKER_23]: I would want to make sure that it's done right because we're talking safety.

1163
01:33:44,954 --> 01:33:56,059
[SPEAKER_23]: You also have to make sure that the diameter of the rubber is at the proper thickness for the height of the structure.

1164
01:33:56,859 --> 01:34:03,683
[SPEAKER_23]: So that, I don't know what you quoted on the diameter of the rubber, but the rubber has to be a certain thickness in order to absorb shock.

1165
01:34:04,567 --> 01:34:05,708
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, that might take place.

1166
01:34:05,768 --> 01:34:08,169
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have some structures that are higher and some that are lower.

1167
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:15,695
[SPEAKER_23]: All this should be thought through professionally, because the first time something goes wrong, there'll be some sharp lawyer out there who will take us down the street.

1168
01:34:17,016 --> 01:34:24,721
[SPEAKER_17]: So between Mr. McLaughlin and our parks department, they both have had some experience with rubberized

1169
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:27,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Courts and turf etc.

1170
01:34:27,233 --> 01:34:28,594
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can work together on that.

1171
01:34:28,894 --> 01:34:35,058
[SPEAKER_13]: It was it was a seven foot fall height Which was the exact same as the estimate that mr. McLaughlin had presented for the park.

1172
01:34:35,078 --> 01:34:37,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, well, you know, let's go over together.

1173
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,063
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go, you know No, but it doesn't have to be done by hand.

1174
01:34:41,103 --> 01:34:50,370
[SPEAKER_13]: It can't be done by farm equipment He said it has to be done by shovels because we don't want to destroy the substone So that was why the estimate was so high from them.

1175
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:52,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's manual labor manual labor.

1176
01:34:53,072 --> 01:34:53,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1177
01:34:53,432 --> 01:34:53,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I

1178
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:56,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1179
01:34:56,278 --> 01:34:56,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Van de Kloot.

1180
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:03,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to thank Cheryl for all the work that she's done on this and for bringing this again to our attention.

1181
01:35:03,402 --> 01:35:06,083
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been something that we talked about the last time.

1182
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:07,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done some patching.

1183
01:35:07,984 --> 01:35:14,908
[SPEAKER_06]: But it clearly is something, it's an expensive project when we go citywide to all of the schools.

1184
01:35:15,869 --> 01:35:22,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And I certainly appreciate her work on this to try to see if some funding could be gotten for it.

1185
01:35:23,653 --> 01:35:23,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1186
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:26,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1187
01:35:26,273 --> 01:35:28,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So this meeting is next week.

1188
01:35:29,275 --> 01:35:43,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just wondering how Cheryl is going to bring forward to the CPA what's necessary without meeting with the superintendent or bringing that data forward to them to continue the application.

1189
01:35:45,066 --> 01:35:52,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there any chance that we can meet this week and go over things so she has something from the school district to present to the CPA?

1190
01:35:52,651 --> 01:35:53,792
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll have to sign off on it.

1191
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,291
[SPEAKER_23]: We sign off and send a letter of support.

1192
01:35:57,512 --> 01:35:58,213
[SPEAKER_11]: You will do that?

1193
01:35:58,293 --> 01:35:58,833
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll sign off?

1194
01:35:58,853 --> 01:35:59,734
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take a vote tonight.

1195
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:00,395
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1196
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:09,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And so she might need more information and data to present to them in order to qualify for the CPA monies.

1197
01:36:10,643 --> 01:36:11,824
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm not clear.

1198
01:36:11,984 --> 01:36:13,926
[SPEAKER_17]: What date is your final application due?

1199
01:36:13,946 --> 01:36:16,408
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's March 2.

1200
01:36:16,448 --> 01:36:16,708
[SPEAKER_17]: March 2.

1201
01:36:16,948 --> 01:36:18,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And what do you need for Tuesday night?

1202
01:36:23,451 --> 01:36:33,496
[SPEAKER_17]: So a letter from the school committee saying that we were so they want to sign off on all the applications that are that have to do with our land our property.

1203
01:36:34,256 --> 01:36:37,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So some participants have sent in submissions.

1204
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:44,301
[SPEAKER_17]: for parks and for schools, and they haven't come to the proper body to get approval to submit the idea.

1205
01:36:44,602 --> 01:36:45,602
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what Ms.

1206
01:36:45,622 --> 01:36:46,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Rodriguez is doing tonight.

1207
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:49,684
[SPEAKER_17]: She wants our approval in order to move forward with the process.

1208
01:36:50,324 --> 01:36:50,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1209
01:36:51,304 --> 01:36:53,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're going to ask me for an update on where we are.

1210
01:36:53,825 --> 01:36:54,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1211
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:54,606
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1212
01:36:55,906 --> 01:36:58,047
[SPEAKER_17]: So you want to make a motion for approval?

1213
01:36:58,127 --> 01:37:04,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I move that the School Committee approve submission of the Robbins Elementary Playground Proposal to the City Preservation Commission.

1214
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:05,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1215
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:07,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote.

1216
01:37:08,343 --> 01:37:12,388
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1217
01:37:13,068 --> 01:37:14,870
Motion passes.

1218
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:29,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Next item, recommendation to approve revised field trip forms.

1219
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:34,781
[SPEAKER_17]: We obviously spoke about this in quite detail earlier with our committee paper.

1220
01:37:34,801 --> 01:37:41,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you got the idea on some of the questions in addition to maybe what came out during the subcommittee meeting.

1221
01:37:42,428 --> 01:37:48,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll submit the final form, well, the almost final form back to us just as an informational item.

1222
01:37:48,453 --> 01:37:50,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's any questions, we'll speak to you directly.

1223
01:37:51,664 --> 01:37:52,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you need a formal vote?

1224
01:37:52,765 --> 01:37:59,067
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd like a formal vote for approval subject to the changes that were recommended in the subcommittee meeting.

1225
01:38:00,388 --> 01:38:03,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Agiro.

1226
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:04,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote.

1227
01:38:18,428 --> 01:38:20,590
[SPEAKER_17]: She's going to incorporate them and submit us.

1228
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:26,115
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the field trip form, just the form, not the policy.

1229
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:38,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1230
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:42,732
[SPEAKER_17]: The forum is approved subject to the changes that have been discussed.

1231
01:38:44,614 --> 01:38:45,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, new business.

1232
01:38:45,574 --> 01:38:46,655
[SPEAKER_17]: School committee resolution.

1233
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:51,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Grace Perella.

1234
01:38:52,098 --> 01:38:55,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Perella was a stepmother of Medford High School headmaster John Perella.

1235
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:58,162
[SPEAKER_17]: John, I'm very sorry for your loss.

1236
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:04,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of David Train.

1237
01:39:04,207 --> 01:39:07,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Train was the husband of retired teacher Mary Ellen Train.

1238
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:13,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Phyllis Bagnola.

1239
01:39:13,676 --> 01:39:17,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Bagnola was the mother of graphic arts teacher Louis Bagnola.

1240
01:39:18,341 --> 01:39:19,863
[SPEAKER_17]: All please rise for a moment of silence.

1241
01:39:32,893 --> 01:39:35,355
[SPEAKER_17]: We have lights blinking.

1242
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:37,196
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, you're good.

1243
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:38,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr Russo.

1244
01:39:38,777 --> 01:39:38,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1245
01:39:41,749 --> 01:39:56,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure if we can talk about it tonight, but it became clear that we had never discussed as a committee or as a subcommittee on the superintendent search when we could release the survey that we had approved as a committee.

1246
01:39:56,935 --> 01:40:02,657
[SPEAKER_17]: But I believe the survey was submitted to Mr. Kuchar and it's completed.

1247
01:40:02,677 --> 01:40:06,959
[SPEAKER_17]: He was attempting to translate it into different languages.

1248
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:08,179
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we were waiting on.

1249
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:10,060
[SPEAKER_23]: Paul Texera is working on different languages.

1250
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:15,828
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's no reason why the English language one can't begin to be disseminated.

1251
01:40:16,429 --> 01:40:21,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did talk to Paul on Friday.

1252
01:40:22,414 --> 01:40:25,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said he would have those by Wednesday of this week.

1253
01:40:26,237 --> 01:40:35,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So once he's completed that and I can put up the other languages, I've been working with Mr. Kuchar to complete the SurveyMonkey.

1254
01:40:35,565 --> 01:40:37,826
[SPEAKER_09]: The English language version is completed.

1255
01:40:38,607 --> 01:40:39,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just didn't want to.

1256
01:40:40,487 --> 01:40:41,488
[SPEAKER_09]: start putting it out there.

1257
01:40:41,508 --> 01:40:43,229
[SPEAKER_09]: We needed to approve that.

1258
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:44,529
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, we don't.

1259
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:45,750
[SPEAKER_09]: We can put it up.

1260
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,251
[SPEAKER_17]: We had approved the survey.

1261
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:48,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1262
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:58,957
[SPEAKER_23]: When it's ready, we'll put it up as soon as it's ready to go.

1263
01:40:58,977 --> 01:40:59,758
[SPEAKER_23]: Great.

1264
01:41:00,058 --> 01:41:00,358
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll see.

1265
01:41:00,398 --> 01:41:02,039
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to see Glenn this week anyway.

1266
01:41:02,059 --> 01:41:04,980
[SPEAKER_23]: Glenn's in Washington today, but he'll be back on this for the middle of the week.

1267
01:41:08,342 --> 01:41:08,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

1268
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:28,472
[SPEAKER_11]: the committee members so that the community is aware that those choices have been made and who's on the committee and when their first meeting is and explain how the other members of the committee, what their role is so that we're all clear what our role is.

1269
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:36,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the members of the search committee from the school committee, in addition to myself, is Mr. Paul Russo and Ms.

1270
01:41:36,072 --> 01:41:36,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Paulette Van de Gloot.

1271
01:41:37,573 --> 01:41:38,994
[SPEAKER_17]: We have as an alternate Ms.

1272
01:41:39,074 --> 01:41:40,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy Kretz, should the need arise.

1273
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:57,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Parents, we have Joanne Bell, Jenny Graham, Melanie McLaughlin, who's representing CPAC as well, Alexis Rodriguez, Alex, Jane Wright, Doug Bowen Flynn, oh, I'm sorry, to teachers now, Douglas Bowen Flynn, Sarah Grant,

1274
01:41:58,021 --> 01:42:01,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Joseph Platti, and we have Jodi Lu as our administrator.

1275
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:04,555
[SPEAKER_17]: For students, Justin Zhang.

1276
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:07,763
[SPEAKER_17]: and our diversity director, Neil Osborne.

1277
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:09,644
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a very broad group.

1278
01:42:09,784 --> 01:42:15,448
[SPEAKER_17]: I tried to look at not only the schools, but the interests that were behind the candidates.

1279
01:42:15,728 --> 01:42:16,449
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really hard.

1280
01:42:16,489 --> 01:42:18,610
[SPEAKER_17]: We got almost 70 applications.

1281
01:42:19,491 --> 01:42:29,718
[SPEAKER_17]: And I tried to make sure that every school was represented in one or two capacities, if possible, as well as just diversity, if possible.

1282
01:42:29,778 --> 01:42:31,599
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously, I'm looking at names.

1283
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,041
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know who some of these parents are.

1284
01:42:34,698 --> 01:42:38,282
[SPEAKER_17]: But I tried to incorporate that element as well, male, female, et cetera.

1285
01:42:38,863 --> 01:42:43,788
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's going to be a very broad committee and it will be doing a lot of work.

1286
01:42:44,609 --> 01:42:49,534
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a first meeting is Wednesday night, which is just a training seminar put on by Mr. Kuchar.

1287
01:42:49,554 --> 01:42:51,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I pronouncing that right?

1288
01:42:51,396 --> 01:42:51,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Kuchar?

1289
01:42:52,036 --> 01:42:52,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Kuchar.

1290
01:42:53,292 --> 01:43:02,036
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's more just to go over that it is the meetings start out in public session and then they go into executive session.

1291
01:43:02,596 --> 01:43:07,758
[SPEAKER_17]: And just a reinforcement that everyone that serves on this committee, executive session has to be followed.

1292
01:43:08,538 --> 01:43:22,584
[SPEAKER_17]: If word gets out on who candidates are or the discussions that are taking place, that person will be removed from this committee if people find out that's sanctity of the executive session until it is determined

1293
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:25,691
[SPEAKER_17]: the candidates that are going to be recommended to the full body.

1294
01:43:26,172 --> 01:43:38,482
[SPEAKER_17]: I also put in an email to all of you today that should you have any questions that you would like the three of us to incorporate into our preliminary process here, certainly submit them to me and we will incorporate them as well.

1295
01:43:38,582 --> 01:43:45,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So we want to make sure that your thoughts are being incorporated, although it can't be more than three based on public

1296
01:43:46,747 --> 01:43:48,828
[SPEAKER_17]: law to keep it into executive session.

1297
01:43:48,848 --> 01:43:59,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And also Massachusetts Association of School Committees, Mr. Kuchar will be holding focus groups the following week.

1298
01:43:59,973 --> 01:44:05,476
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that is the 15th of March, of February.

1299
01:44:07,677 --> 01:44:11,539
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can go through some of the key dates that we've established for our timetable.

1300
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:15,495
[SPEAKER_17]: So February 7th is the search committee orientation.

1301
01:44:15,555 --> 01:44:19,557
[SPEAKER_17]: February 15th, focus groups for parents, guardians, and to anyone else really.

1302
01:44:19,637 --> 01:44:29,984
[SPEAKER_17]: And he'll also be going to the various schools to talk to teachers, administrators, to determine what do they think about this whole process and how would they like to see it played out.

1303
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:41,932
[SPEAKER_17]: At the orientation, Mr. Kuchar is going to tell the committee basically certain questions that they can ask and certain questions that they're not allowed to ask, such as discriminatory questions.

1304
01:44:42,471 --> 01:44:47,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And also ask the members to try and figure out what questions they would like to ask.

1305
01:44:47,853 --> 01:44:50,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And those questions should be submitted to me by February 25th.

1306
01:44:50,474 --> 01:44:53,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I can give you all a copy of the timeline.

1307
01:44:54,116 --> 01:45:00,398
[SPEAKER_17]: February 28th is the actual application due date for those interested in applying to be a superintendent in the city of Medford.

1308
01:45:01,358 --> 01:45:09,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And then on March 1st, Mr. Kuchar and his team will be reviewing all of the applications and actually submitting to the search committee

1309
01:45:10,733 --> 01:45:16,978
[SPEAKER_17]: His recommendations, a rating system of the applicants, and that's just a recommendation.

1310
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:24,363
[SPEAKER_17]: The search committee itself will determine if we want to follow with his recommendations and or include anyone else in the interview process.

1311
01:45:25,144 --> 01:45:32,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Interviews are scheduled the week of March 10th to the 20th with hopefully recommendations to the school committee of the finalists by March 21st.

1312
01:45:34,271 --> 01:45:35,992
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a very aggressive timeline.

1313
01:45:36,733 --> 01:45:40,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone that filled out a form made note if they were available or not.

1314
01:45:40,476 --> 01:45:47,001
[SPEAKER_17]: In some cases, some people weren't considered because they weren't going to be available during key pieces of this whole puzzle.

1315
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:50,663
[SPEAKER_17]: So unfortunately, it had to be limited.

1316
01:45:51,284 --> 01:45:59,330
[SPEAKER_17]: To be controllable, really, to have 20 members of a search committee would have been an extraordinary amount of time with questions.

1317
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:01,892
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just probably would not have gotten anything done.

1318
01:46:03,515 --> 01:46:04,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep it as lean as possible.

1319
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:07,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I added an additional parent just so that all the schools are reflected.

1320
01:46:09,017 --> 01:46:10,617
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's it.

1321
01:46:10,657 --> 01:46:10,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1322
01:46:10,737 --> 01:46:11,077
[SPEAKER_17]: VanderKloop.

1323
01:46:11,758 --> 01:46:16,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a little concerned that we're doing the focus groups.

1324
01:46:17,179 --> 01:46:19,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And are there dates and times set up?

1325
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how are parents going to know about that?

1326
01:46:22,321 --> 01:46:24,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Kuchar's working with the superintendent.

1327
01:46:24,622 --> 01:46:26,562
[SPEAKER_23]: So Glenn is coming back from Washington.

1328
01:46:26,982 --> 01:46:29,923
[SPEAKER_23]: He wasn't sure how many nights we wanted to go with focus groups.

1329
01:46:30,483 --> 01:46:31,524
[SPEAKER_23]: He had set aside the 15th.

1330
01:46:32,847 --> 01:46:36,109
[SPEAKER_23]: or initially, but he's available on the 13th and the 14th.

1331
01:46:36,129 --> 01:46:46,335
[SPEAKER_23]: So when he comes back tomorrow, I'll have a discussion with him as to whether he thinks we can do two a night or two, you know, or, or three a night if it necessary or needs a couple of days to do it.

1332
01:46:47,816 --> 01:46:48,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Two a night?

1333
01:46:49,196 --> 01:46:51,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you have, you know, an hour for one group, an hour for another group.

1334
01:46:51,898 --> 01:46:54,179
[SPEAKER_23]: You are an hour and a half for one group, an hour and a half for another group.

1335
01:46:54,259 --> 01:46:54,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1336
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and like for teachers, are they during the day?

1337
01:46:58,103 --> 01:46:58,503
[SPEAKER_23]: Could be.

1338
01:46:59,064 --> 01:46:59,424
[SPEAKER_23]: Could be.

1339
01:46:59,484 --> 01:47:01,306
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be around for a couple of days.

1340
01:47:01,446 --> 01:47:02,687
[SPEAKER_23]: But Glenn's going to be around.

1341
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:07,891
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to set up a time as to when it's convenient for people who are in certain categories to meet.

1342
01:47:08,412 --> 01:47:10,553
[SPEAKER_23]: Like you'd meet with certain administrators after school.

1343
01:47:10,593 --> 01:47:12,115
[SPEAKER_23]: You could meet with teachers after school.

1344
01:47:12,815 --> 01:47:14,697
[SPEAKER_23]: I just need time to talk to Glenn.

1345
01:47:16,018 --> 01:47:18,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I spoke to him today when he was in Washington as a conference.

1346
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:18,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1347
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:23,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm particularly interested in the ones that open to the community members and to parents.

1348
01:47:23,404 --> 01:47:24,345
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably going to be the 15th.

1349
01:47:24,365 --> 01:47:25,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the evening of the 15th.

1350
01:47:25,746 --> 01:47:26,126
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the 15th.

1351
01:47:27,952 --> 01:47:28,292
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1352
01:47:29,273 --> 01:47:33,414
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll, we have to sit down and find out what he thinks is, you know, and you'll probably get that answer on Wednesday.

1353
01:47:34,154 --> 01:47:38,576
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, what he thinks is an appropriate number of people to be in a focus group.

1354
01:47:38,596 --> 01:47:46,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Cause obviously you don't need a hundred people in a room and won't, it won't give people a chance to talk, but you know, we're representative group and we have to think what that is.

1355
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:49,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

1356
01:47:51,181 --> 01:47:53,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, next week is, is the 15th.

1357
01:47:54,998 --> 01:48:03,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's very short notice for people to make arrangements for child care or whatever to be able to go to these focus groups.

1358
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:10,061
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there a timeline for when you're really going to tie this down?

1359
01:48:10,181 --> 01:48:17,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you doing a reverse informational call to every parent in the district, like a snow day call?

1360
01:48:18,345 --> 01:48:19,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be on our website?

1361
01:48:19,646 --> 01:48:20,926
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we advertising this?

1362
01:48:20,986 --> 01:48:34,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want input from the community for this, and I really don't want them to think that we didn't give them sufficient time to be ready for it, especially because the end of that week is school vacation week.

1363
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:37,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to make sure that this doesn't put all of our time on the ground.

1364
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:38,691
[SPEAKER_17]: So tomorrow the dates will be finalized.

1365
01:48:38,711 --> 01:48:39,831
[SPEAKER_17]: We know it's the 15th.

1366
01:48:40,071 --> 01:48:40,571
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, great.

1367
01:48:40,971 --> 01:48:43,332
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll have a blog entry.

1368
01:48:43,372 --> 01:48:44,652
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have a press release.

1369
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:46,893
[SPEAKER_17]: We can do reverse calls to all the schools.

1370
01:48:47,651 --> 01:48:48,912
[SPEAKER_17]: We can get the word out like that.

1371
01:48:49,212 --> 01:48:49,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1372
01:48:49,692 --> 01:48:53,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but Roy wants to work with Mr. Kucha just to make sure the time we had 7 p.m.

1373
01:48:53,514 --> 01:48:57,296
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be earlier, which would allow for maybe a dual session to happen.

1374
01:48:57,316 --> 01:49:05,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to have any opportunity for people to come before us and make statements at a school committee meeting?

1375
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:09,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Any public hearing prior to our interviews?

1376
01:49:10,828 --> 01:49:12,449
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get the results from the survey.

1377
01:49:12,489 --> 01:49:13,870
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get the results from the focus group.

1378
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:14,071
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1379
01:49:14,091 --> 01:49:19,155
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of people, well, a focus group is one way of having discussion.

1380
01:49:19,195 --> 01:49:20,296
[SPEAKER_06]: A public hearing is another.

1381
01:49:22,858 --> 01:49:26,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, you're sort of thinking about the public hearing.

1382
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the focus group says all encompass.

1383
01:49:28,983 --> 01:49:29,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And the survey.

1384
01:49:29,823 --> 01:49:29,883
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1385
01:49:29,903 --> 01:49:30,724
[SPEAKER_17]: The survey you worked on.

1386
01:49:32,385 --> 01:49:40,472
[SPEAKER_23]: So I know that the applications have gone out to superintendents and assistant superintendents and other administrators across the state because I got one.

1387
01:49:42,293 --> 01:49:42,673
[SPEAKER_23]: Just kidding.

1388
01:49:43,173 --> 01:49:44,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you apply?

1389
01:49:44,293 --> 01:49:46,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you got to apply.

1390
01:49:47,314 --> 01:49:48,594
[SPEAKER_23]: A statement of her most interest.

1391
01:49:48,934 --> 01:49:49,775
[SPEAKER_11]: She might apply.

1392
01:49:50,675 --> 01:49:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

1393
01:49:52,315 --> 01:50:04,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to be clear, and maybe we can't answer this without Glenn, Mr. Kuchar, but I mean, the focus group is not just anybody and everybody shows up and gets to just like a stadium full of people.

1394
01:50:06,132 --> 01:50:07,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a focus group.

1395
01:50:07,873 --> 01:50:08,833
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a focus group.

1396
01:50:09,413 --> 01:50:13,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if 100 people want to come to a focus group, it's 7 o'clock on the 15th.

1397
01:50:15,495 --> 01:50:17,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they can show up, but there's not going to be 100 people there.

1398
01:50:18,796 --> 01:50:22,838
[SPEAKER_23]: So a focus group of the administrators will be a collection of administrators.

1399
01:50:22,878 --> 01:50:26,699
[SPEAKER_23]: A focus group of teachers will be a collection of teachers representing all levels.

1400
01:50:27,139 --> 01:50:35,202
[SPEAKER_23]: The community is a little tougher, and I want to take some guidance from Glenn as to how we set it up elsewhere and how we've got representation probably from each school, from

1401
01:50:35,813 --> 01:50:37,314
[SPEAKER_23]: some of the other areas that have interest.

1402
01:50:38,894 --> 01:50:42,436
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, you can't have everybody in the room at the same time, or it won't be much of a discussion.

1403
01:50:43,056 --> 01:50:45,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody will get half a comment, and it'll be over.

1404
01:50:45,217 --> 01:50:46,898
[SPEAKER_23]: OK?

1405
01:50:47,678 --> 01:50:50,239
[SPEAKER_17]: But then you have, when you go to- And people can submit written comments, of course.

1406
01:50:50,459 --> 01:50:50,619
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1407
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:59,883
[SPEAKER_23]: And then when you go to the larger arena, when people have public interviews, meet the candidates, you will have opportunities for people to interact with you and give you feedback.

1408
01:51:01,083 --> 01:51:01,964
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a process.

1409
01:51:02,004 --> 01:51:05,265
[SPEAKER_23]: You're going to get increasing amounts of feedback, and I'm sure you'll

1410
01:51:05,857 --> 01:51:08,318
[SPEAKER_23]: Once names come out, you'll start to hear from people coming out anyway.

1411
01:51:10,738 --> 01:51:11,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1412
01:51:12,019 --> 01:51:19,000
[SPEAKER_17]: And one item of importance that he did mention last week before he went away was that it's all confidential.

1413
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:22,041
[SPEAKER_17]: The candidates, people that apply, it's a confidential process.

1414
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:28,883
[SPEAKER_17]: But if a candidate tells someone in the public venue that they are applying, then all bets are off for that candidate.

1415
01:51:29,318 --> 01:51:32,359
[SPEAKER_17]: becomes a public candidate, so it's tricky.

1416
01:51:33,419 --> 01:51:38,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm sure he's going to go over all the rules Wednesday night for the committee itself.

1417
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a couple.

1418
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1419
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:52,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it possible we could project a movie or provide, obviously not child care, but entertainment for kids, for parents that are not able to find babysitting on that night?

1420
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:56,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know from personal experience from knocking on doors, people would like to participate.

1421
01:51:56,523 --> 01:51:58,043
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just not able to because they have little ones.

1422
01:51:58,852 --> 01:52:01,893
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure what he's... He wants to know if childcare could be provided.

1423
01:52:01,913 --> 01:52:05,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe the kids, the family... Project a movie, have some popcorn.

1424
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:08,275
[SPEAKER_23]: We can talk to... Childcare for what event though?

1425
01:52:08,895 --> 01:52:10,956
[SPEAKER_08]: For the focus group, for the night of the focus group.

1426
01:52:10,976 --> 01:52:11,876
[SPEAKER_23]: We can try and get that.

1427
01:52:12,256 --> 01:52:13,037
[SPEAKER_23]: We can try and get that.

1428
01:52:13,437 --> 01:52:14,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd really appreciate that.

1429
01:52:14,217 --> 01:52:15,777
[SPEAKER_23]: Just a couple of other things if I can.

1430
01:52:17,058 --> 01:52:21,639
[SPEAKER_23]: Thursday night, taping, 7 o'clock at the theater.

1431
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,920
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, just so you're aware of that.

1432
01:52:24,587 --> 01:52:26,828
[SPEAKER_23]: And next week, we're going to start earlier.

1433
01:52:27,728 --> 01:52:28,829
[SPEAKER_23]: I've sent you out an email.

1434
01:52:28,869 --> 01:52:29,909
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll get a posting on that.

1435
01:52:29,929 --> 01:52:30,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Community of the Hall.

1436
01:52:30,669 --> 01:52:31,229
[SPEAKER_23]: Community of the Hall.

1437
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:32,510
[SPEAKER_23]: And it'll be across the hall.

1438
01:52:34,451 --> 01:52:34,511
[SPEAKER_23]: At 6?

1439
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:35,411
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to do it at like 6.15.

1440
01:52:35,511 --> 01:52:36,871
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what I mean?

1441
01:52:36,891 --> 01:52:38,592
[SPEAKER_17]: What time is that?

1442
01:52:38,612 --> 01:52:39,472
[SPEAKER_23]: 6.15, Monday night.

1443
01:52:39,812 --> 01:52:39,472
6.15.

1444
01:52:39,832 --> 01:52:46,975
[SPEAKER_23]: 6.15.

1445
01:52:39,852 --> 01:52:46,975
[SPEAKER_23]: So we can go over some things that are associated with the selection process so that we've got some guidance, and then we can move that forward, too.

1446
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Committee of the whole will be here.

1447
01:52:50,021 --> 01:52:50,861
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah across the hall.

1448
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:51,561
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do it here.

1449
01:52:51,601 --> 01:53:04,505
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to book 201 201 and the other pieces is that I've Suggested that in order to give us self-sufficient time that our regular meeting started 730, so we don't feel rushed You know if we want to take a few extra minutes to go over things.

1450
01:53:04,565 --> 01:53:10,927
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's important that You don't feel like you're under fire to end the discussion if you need an extra 15 minutes.

1451
01:53:10,987 --> 01:53:11,007
[SPEAKER_23]: I

1452
01:53:16,795 --> 01:53:17,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

1453
01:53:18,756 --> 01:53:32,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to be clear, school committee members that are not on the committee should not be attending the focus groups or the applique, because then it would be.

1454
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:33,880
[SPEAKER_17]: I would suggest not.

1455
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:34,480
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1456
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: We just wanted to be clear for everyone that we should just stay back and wait for them to present to us the finalists.

1457
01:53:45,272 --> 01:53:48,313
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point, if we don't like them all, we can ask you to do it again.

1458
01:53:51,974 --> 01:53:52,474
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1459
01:53:53,874 --> 01:53:54,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1460
01:53:54,074 --> 01:53:54,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Kratz.

1461
01:53:55,535 --> 01:53:56,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I should attend the training.

1462
01:53:56,695 --> 01:53:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can attend the training.

1463
01:53:57,995 --> 01:53:59,016
[SPEAKER_02]: The training would be wise.

1464
01:53:59,056 --> 01:54:00,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going forward, you wouldn't.

1465
01:54:00,656 --> 01:54:01,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least you're trained.

1466
01:54:01,516 --> 01:54:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the training on Wednesday.

01:54:04,837 --> 01:54:07,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to adjourn?
