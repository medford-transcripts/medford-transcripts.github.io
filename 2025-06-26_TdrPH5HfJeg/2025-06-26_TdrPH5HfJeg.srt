00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening everyone and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the chair of the board and I'm going to call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:12,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,251
[SPEAKER_21]: This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:29,675
[SPEAKER_21]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapters 2 of the Acts of 2023.

7
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:36,057
[SPEAKER_21]: I do understand that we do have a special accommodation at City Hall this evening, so I just wanted to flag that.

8
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:37,887
[SPEAKER_21]: for us as well.

9
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:48,530

11
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:03,293
[SPEAKER_21]: A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight's all votes will be made by roll call.

[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Annie Strang.

[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Annie.

[SPEAKER_21]: Ben LaValle and myself, chair, Emily Hedeman, is present.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the call, city staff?

33
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

34
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:10,650
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

35
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:17,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with us tonight is Alicia Hunt, the Director of PDS, as well as Sal DiStefano, the Director of Economic Development.

36
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:23,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, oh, we have Jackie Forcina, who is our Head Clerk in our office.

37
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:26,444
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that is everyone.

38
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, nice to have you all here.

39
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:34,836
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first item on our agenda this evening is an executive session.

40
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:52,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Pursuant to General Laws 30A, Section 21A3, we're going to be discussing strategy related to pending litigation known as New York Capital Investment Group, LLC, versus the City of Medford Community Development Board, et al.

41
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,657
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a case in Massachusetts Land Court.

42
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:03,179
[SPEAKER_21]: It's case number 24, MISC 000683.

43
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:12,200
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have determined that discussing this matter in an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the litigating position of the board.

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,422
[SPEAKER_21]: So just to clarify that for the public, we are discussing matters related to

45
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:26,017
[SPEAKER_21]: litigation from a private party against the Community Development Board.

46
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:34,860
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to be going into this executive session, and once we are done with the executive session, we will open up for the rest of the agenda.

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,162
[SPEAKER_21]: So during this time, I believe you all will just kind of hold steady in the Zoom meeting.

48
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:48,265
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to make every effort to be as efficient as possible and start as close to typical meeting time

49
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,628
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, things may run over.

50
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,352
[SPEAKER_21]: And now just a procedural question.

51
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I need a motion to enter into executive session?

52
00:03:59,334 --> 00:03:59,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

53
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:02,437
[SPEAKER_21]: So someone's looking for a motion.

54
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:03,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

55
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:08,342
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you like a so moved, you know, consistent with your declaration or they can restate essentially?

56
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:09,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

57
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:15,969
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just going to do the one that I'm most comfortable with, which is I'm looking for a motion to go into executive session.

58
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:18,143
[SPEAKER_25]: I moved.

59
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I have a second?

60
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:22,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

61
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:24,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

62
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,908
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

63
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:28,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Kalfs?

64
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:29,930
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

65
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

67
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:35,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens?

68
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:37,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

69
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:38,914
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

70
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:39,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,032
[SPEAKER_21]: and myself, Emily Hedeman, is also an aye.

72
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:49,437
[SPEAKER_21]: So just to reiterate, only board members, staff, and legal counsel are permitted to remain in the meeting.

73
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Others in the Zoom are gonna be placed kind of on a hold.

74
00:04:55,081 --> 00:05:02,207
[SPEAKER_21]: The meeting will still be active, but we will rejoin the meeting once we have exited executive session.

75
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:08,112
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, I'd like to welcome everybody back to the Medford Community Development Board meeting.

76
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,964
[SPEAKER_21]: We have exited the executive session.

77
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you everyone for your patience.

78
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:19,693
[SPEAKER_21]: As we went into executive session, we'll now be returning to the rest of the agenda.

79
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:29,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first item on our agenda is a non-public hearing, Mary Kenneway Subdivision.

80
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:38,141
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a request for covenant release, request for time extension to complete a new road, and approval of the security agreement.

81
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Can staff please give some background and explain this request?

82
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:46,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

83
00:05:49,690 --> 00:06:03,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Mary Kenny Way is a approved subdivision that's 10 lots off of Winthrop Street over by the high school, right below the subdivision that was just approved a couple of meetings ago.

84
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:09,919
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are requesting, let me back up a little bit more.

85
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, let me find my notes on this.

86
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so this approved in 2020.

87
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:36,168
[SPEAKER_15]: after a remand and as you know there needs to be some kind of security agreement or like some kind of surety that if the developer goes belly up there's something and they have a choice of what to do it could be a covenant, a bond, a tri-party agreement.

88
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:48,032
[SPEAKER_15]: They elected to have a covenant so there's a covenant that all 10 lots are subject to and while that covenant is in place they can't sell any

89
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:49,745
[SPEAKER_15]: selling the houses.

90
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:59,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So now they have the first home that is complete, I believe, and they wish to sell it.

91
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:11,651
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they are requesting that this lot, which is 7 Mary Kenny Way, be released from the covenant.

92
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,112
[SPEAKER_15]: We consulted with Ernie Stein, who

93
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:22,746
[SPEAKER_15]: told us that we need to have some other alternate security in place.

94
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:32,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Due to the tight timeframe, the applicant wasn't able to get a bond in place, so they wired cash instead.

95
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:45,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a security agreement that was drafted and reviewed by Robin, basically agreeing that this cash payment, which was in the amount of,

96
00:07:49,393 --> 00:08:01,342
[SPEAKER_15]: $256,786.62, which is the estimate to complete the work, to finish the road and all of that.

97
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:07,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And our engineering department reviewed that and agreed it was correct, the correct number.

98
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:17,355
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you all need to do tonight is we'll hear from the applicant, they'll explain

99
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:28,530
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, what they've done in their, the certificate of approval, what things they've completed, what things they haven't.

100
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:44,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And the question is, if you wanna release one of the lots, the one that they're trying to close on tomorrow, or a handful of them, which might save time having to come back each time.

101
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's up to four lots that they were looking to

102
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,658
[SPEAKER_15]: have released, and then there would still be the covenant.

103
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,045
[SPEAKER_15]: The remaining six would still be subject to the covenant, and that would be released at the end.

104
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:06,654
[SPEAKER_15]: And we would still have this caste security until such time that they decide to want to do something else.

105
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:07,755
[SPEAKER_15]: If they decide that they want

106
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:12,799
[SPEAKER_15]: a bond to be the security, then they can swap it out.

107
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:23,067
[SPEAKER_15]: But we always have to have some kind of security in place once you've lifted or once you've released any lot from the subdivision to comply with the law.

108
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:27,090
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is the quick summary.

109
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:39,476
[SPEAKER_21]: So at the end of this, we would be looking for a motion to release X lots, whether it's one or four, and that's subject to the board.

110
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:51,743
[SPEAKER_15]: And then agreeing or accepting or approving the security agreement, which is hot off the presses this afternoon, is dropped into your meeting packet.

111
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:57,980
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also, they're also asking for a time extension on roadway completion.

112
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

113
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,481
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I believe that there's two votes.

114
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:07,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know who here would be representing them.

115
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone, any ways.

116
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoever's representing the applicant, can you raise your hand?

117
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,666
[SPEAKER_21]: This is for the Mary Cunnyway subdivision.

118
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:24,684
[SPEAKER_16]: I see Ed Champhy, who we've been emailing with.

119
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, but I don't see a raised hand.

120
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:39,812
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if there's anybody else here.

121
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:44,594
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like there's a closing tomorrow.

122
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,756
[SPEAKER_21]: How the hell do you raise a hand?

123
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:52,398
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

124
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:53,459
[SPEAKER_31]: I was trying to raise a hand.

125
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,159
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know where the.

126
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,620
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't know where the raise hand button was.

127
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,701
[SPEAKER_15]: They keep moving it.

128
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:04,482
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, well, I got upgraded and I'm having a hard enough time, but I did log in.

129
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:06,703
[SPEAKER_31]: We can hear you.

130
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:10,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you like to give thank you on behalf of the applicant?

131
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,595
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I will.

132
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,356
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.

133
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:14,617
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Ed Champey.

134
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:26,142
[SPEAKER_31]: I live at 4 Pagos Way, Linfield, Massachusetts, and I'm the developer and the construction company for Mary Kenny Way, also known as 541 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

135
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:34,168
[SPEAKER_31]: So there are two requests before you tonight, one of which is the extension of the roadway time frame.

136
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,911
[SPEAKER_31]: And I can explain why those exist and why we're requesting it.

137
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:45,436
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not uncommon and it's a normal process in order to assure that when the road is complete, it's not torn up during construction.

138
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,618
[SPEAKER_31]: And the second is the release of the covenant

139
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,971
[SPEAKER_31]: on lot 2, which is 7 Mary Kenny Way.

140
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:59,114
[SPEAKER_31]: We posted the bond in totality just to try and make the process less arduous with one lot.

141
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,876
[SPEAKER_31]: Normally, if we posted a bond in total, we would expect all lots released.

142
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:11,640
[SPEAKER_31]: But knowing that this board doesn't do a ton of subdivisions, we figured if there's a covenant left on six of them,

143
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:17,888
[SPEAKER_31]: it will let everybody get comfortable, and we know that Attorney Stein has significant experience in this.

144
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:25,873
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, knowing Medford is in a suburban market, so to speak, we understand.

145
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:33,458
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm open to, if you'd like, I can discuss the roadway extension first, or people can ask questions.

146
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's talk through the roadway time extension.

147
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:38,556
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, terrific.

148
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:44,763
[SPEAKER_31]: So, um, when we started on the road, the primary goal was to get the utilities off a winter street prior to.

149
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,767
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, let's see if this video works.

150
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,229
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, we excuse me.

151
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:56,175
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, we, we connect the utilities off a winter street originally prior to the road being newly paid.

152
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:58,698
[SPEAKER_31]: So our 1st and foremost goal, even when we weren't.

153
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:02,719
[SPEAKER_31]: completely ready to start building the road was to get that done so we're not cutting a new street.

154
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,540
[SPEAKER_31]: And one of the conditions was the curbing on the far side over at Lorain Road.

155
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:17,163
[SPEAKER_31]: And that was, those were the first two steps done just to make sure that the newly paved road after all the neighbors had dealt with construction in that road for many years.

156
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:18,763
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyways, it wouldn't be.

157
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,946
[SPEAKER_31]: We wouldn't be cutting it right after it was complete.

158
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,107
[SPEAKER_31]: So, with that.

159
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:24,747
[SPEAKER_31]: Um.

160
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:28,211
[SPEAKER_31]: We work, we work hand in hand with engineering through the process.

161
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,993
[SPEAKER_31]: So, although this board is the 1st time.

162
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:33,497
[SPEAKER_31]: For us to meet, um, you know, and engineering.

163
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,950
[SPEAKER_31]: And prior to that, Tim, before he was promoted, were regularly involved in this.

164
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,813
[SPEAKER_31]: Tim McGovern actually prepared the first draft of the, and the draft that we worked from for the bond amounts.

165
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:51,397
[SPEAKER_31]: So we used his format from years ago and then updated it with today's pricing and the remaining of the road to be complete.

166
00:13:53,047 --> 00:14:02,834
[SPEAKER_31]: So with that said, we obviously did a significant amount of blasting on the site, and I think most of the neighbors and most of Medford is aware.

167
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,858
[SPEAKER_31]: And we cleared the space, cleared the way for the road itself to go in.

168
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:11,381
[SPEAKER_31]: All the utilities have been brought in, water, sewer, drainage, and whatnot.

169
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:17,926
[SPEAKER_31]: And the infiltration in the rear, which is for the roadway infiltration, has been installed.

170
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:21,709
[SPEAKER_31]: These are all conditions upon releasing the First Covenant.

171
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:30,052
[SPEAKER_31]: And we put a binder down and upon binder, we started requesting building permits and then building homes.

172
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:38,938
[SPEAKER_31]: So the road itself, we will our next so called phase of the road is we started immediately on the left side of the road.

173
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:44,321
[SPEAKER_31]: And part of that was because we wanted to finish the road, the houses adjacent to the right away, which run up behind us.

174
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,082
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with the road or not.

175
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,482
[SPEAKER_31]: And by finishing that, we're able to complete that side of the road, which will so those 4 houses get complete.

176
00:14:54,002 --> 00:15:01,964
[SPEAKER_31]: The sidewalk, the curbing and the street trees and whatnot all go in and then we and then we're completing clockwise.

177
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,305
[SPEAKER_31]: So, so we'll be going right around the site.

178
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:10,729
[SPEAKER_31]: The main reason for not doing the curbing is the machines are big enough on that site that if they wreck, they drive over the curbing, they crack it.

179
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,814
[SPEAKER_31]: And if you turn those machines on newly paved roads, they make a mess of it too.

180
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:27,702
[SPEAKER_31]: So generally what we'll do is we'll, when we're finished with the last foundation and backfilled it, we'll move the heaviest of the equipment off site and then we start working with machines that have rubber tracks.

181
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,479
[SPEAKER_31]: and then we'll put the final pavement down.

182
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,742
[SPEAKER_31]: Our expectation would be that, you know, that's like 18 months away.

183
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:47,552
[SPEAKER_31]: And with that, generally, before we go to a town to ask them to accept a road, the newly paved finish coat will go through at least one winter season and two or three seasons.

184
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:56,959
[SPEAKER_31]: So you'd like it to go through, like, if it can go through a summer, a fall, a winter, and a spring, then the engineers can walk the site and look for small fractures and understand

185
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,243
[SPEAKER_31]: you know, if all the testing that we did, you know, paid off, which, which it has, you know, we've never had a problem yet.

186
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,744
[SPEAKER_31]: And we've done a couple of roads recently.

187
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:09,687
[SPEAKER_31]: But I've been I've been a part of a dozen subdivisions over time.

188
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,929
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've worked on planning boards to approve them.

189
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,111
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm familiar with both sides.

190
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:21,675
[SPEAKER_31]: So with that, the general purpose of a timeline on a roadway isn't necessarily that it's supposed to be finished.

191
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,471
[SPEAKER_31]: The idea is that it comes back in front of the board for an update and extensions requested.

192
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:38,493
[SPEAKER_31]: And at that time, if it's been a long time, it might be an update in a bond amount so that there's a timeline and a completion and a bond amount that are all moving forward parallel.

193
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:50,495
[SPEAKER_31]: So if someone bonds a road 10 years ago, you don't find yourself with an insufficient bond and a developer that goes belly up and residences that are all wondering how can we finish the road.

194
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:58,091
[SPEAKER_31]: So after that three seasons, we come to you folks and eventually go to city council to get the road accepted.

195
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,893
[SPEAKER_21]: So what's the current deadline for the road?

196
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:08,216
[SPEAKER_31]: That's since that's passed since I think it was a while ago.

197
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:13,699
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, so it's probably, I think this extension should have been sought right after COVID.

198
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:20,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and we're looking for an 18 month extension starting today, essentially.

199
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,966
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I think I said 2 years, but either way coming in and giving it.

200
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,628
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that's fine.

201
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, great.

202
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:36,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the board have any questions related to the time extension to complete the new road?

203
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing none, okay.

204
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:47,021
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the other items were the covenant release and the security agreement.

205
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Champy, would you be able to speak to those?

206
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,263
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

207
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,565
[SPEAKER_31]: The security agreement is in the form of a cash bond.

208
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:57,226
[SPEAKER_31]: It's relatively simple.

209
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,328
[SPEAKER_31]: It's one page referring to the plans that are dated

210
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,314
[SPEAKER_31]: The amount, which is exhibit a in the security agreement.

211
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:10,864
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, we've reviewed and scope that work with engineering and as Daniel mentioned a minute ago.

212
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,375
[SPEAKER_31]: Owen had confirmed that those amounts were correct.

213
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:34,408
[SPEAKER_31]: So with a detailed analysis of what needs to be done and completed and engineering approving it, and then the cash bond with your clerk, that's the surety that you have that if someone buys a home and the road has to be complete, there's enough money to do so.

214
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:37,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

215
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, I see your hand is raised.

216
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Madam Chair.

217
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:52,541
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to clarify that the performance of the security agreement you'd be approving tonight is based on, is a performance secured by deposit of money.

218
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,921
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not technically a bond.

219
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,083
[SPEAKER_15]: They wired cash to us today.

220
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:05,147
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to sub out this cash deposit with a bond, I think you would have to come back.

221
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:06,708
[SPEAKER_31]: That's correct.

222
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,849
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if you,

223
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:27,276
[SPEAKER_31]: want to do a switch down the road if you want to just keep it as is or I mean ideally we prefer not to cash bond projects but but in in this case we we knew we were we were asking you know time time was running out uh so I I would expect that in the next um

224
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,925
[SPEAKER_31]: we'll go through the process of getting our bond.

225
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:37,086
[SPEAKER_31]: We actually told our bonding agent yesterday that he didn't have to stay up for the next couple of nights getting the bond.

226
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:43,368
[SPEAKER_31]: So I can follow back up with him and find out what the timeline is, but I wouldn't expect us to be back before a month.

227
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so as it is, you're fine, but you may come back before us.

228
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,035
[SPEAKER_31]: Right, the idea would be is that we prepare the bond, that your team has ample time to review it.

229
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:01,079
[SPEAKER_31]: When it's through a surety company, it's not as clean as cash.

230
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,801
[SPEAKER_31]: Let everybody get comfortable with it.

231
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:09,566
[SPEAKER_31]: And then when everybody's comfortable, we'll schedule it at the next available meeting, rather than schedule a meeting and try and make all the paperwork fit.

232
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

233
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Do any board members have any questions or comments

234
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:22,415
[SPEAKER_21]: related to the Mary Cunningway subdivision?

235
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:25,898
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't.

236
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,280
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it seems straightforward to me.

237
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:37,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, seems straightforward and legal and the planning department have confirmed that all of this is as straightforward as it sounds.

238
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:42,311
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have no objections to us raising a motion.

239
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,354
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to confirm, are we looking to

240
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:52,975
[SPEAKER_21]: release the covenant for the one lot, or are we OK with releasing the covenant for four?

241
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:56,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Terrifying question, Danielle.

242
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,979
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this technically a public hearing that we need to approve?

243
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,800
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a public hearing.

244
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,821
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, just want to make sure.

245
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:03,561
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a public meeting.

246
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:10,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I know a lot of things need to open a public comment just in case, even for regulatory moves like this.

247
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Good flag, Peter.

248
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:13,727
[SPEAKER_21]: But it sounds like we're OK.

249
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:14,888
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, great.

250
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:39,167
[SPEAKER_25]: In that case, I'm going to move to release the four lots from the covenant and grant the extension on roadway construction, unless there's something else I'm forgetting.

251
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,728
[SPEAKER_21]: As well as the approval of the security agreement.

252
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,269
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may, could you name the lots specifically?

253
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:46,690
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

254
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:57,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see there's also in your packet was a graphic of the actual lots.

255
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:08,161
[SPEAKER_31]: I can help but I don't want to speak during your motion.

256
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:10,562
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get it in a second.

257
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,870
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to have a 7, right?

258
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:35,870
7.

259
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:45,612
[SPEAKER_25]: So do we want to do 2, 3, 6, and 7, the closest to Winthrop Street?

260
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:50,013
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to check with the applicant and make sure that those are intended.

261
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I wasn't sure if we did 4, if there was

262
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:56,534
[SPEAKER_25]: if there was a particular four that we wanted.

263
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:00,336
[SPEAKER_31]: Please, if we could, Madam Chair.

264
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:01,017
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

265
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:05,780
[SPEAKER_31]: One, two, three, and four, which is Mary Kenny way three, seven, 11, and 15.

266
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,320
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

267
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:09,222
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

268
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:11,143
[SPEAKER_25]: Sounds good.

269
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:22,230
[SPEAKER_25]: In that case, going back to what I was about to start, we'll make a motion releasing units

270
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:24,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Lots.

271
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:25,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Lots.

272
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

273
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:27,649
[SPEAKER_25]: Lots.

274
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:28,749
[SPEAKER_25]: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

275
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,289
[SPEAKER_25]: Addresses 3, 7, 11, and 15.

276
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,150
[SPEAKER_25]: Marykenny Way from the Covenant, approving the security agreement and granting the extension of the roadway construction.

277
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,871
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a second.

278
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:43,611
[SPEAKER_27]: I will second that motion.

279
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,592
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

280
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Kalves.

281
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:48,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

282
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:50,973
[SPEAKER_21]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

283
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:52,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

284
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:53,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens.

285
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:54,952
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

286
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:56,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang.

287
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:57,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

288
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:01,236
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

289
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. Champey, for coming before us.

290
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:06,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like we'll see you in a couple months.

291
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,340
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, thank you very much.

292
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,522
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one more vote that they wanted.

294
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:19,227
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanted them to expressly authorize Director Hunt to sign the releases, right?

295
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:22,029
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what your legal staff wanted.

296
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:23,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

297
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:27,407
[SPEAKER_16]: To avoid all the board members having to physically sign the paper.

298
00:24:30,628 --> 00:24:41,851
[SPEAKER_31]: There will be on the security agreement, it will be a e-signature for four of you, and then one will have to be notarized, which our notary will actually travel.

299
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:45,232
[SPEAKER_31]: I just don't know who's gonna be the wet signature amongst you.

300
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:51,274
[SPEAKER_15]: And through the chair, we can discuss after the meeting, the logistics of that.

301
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,048
[SPEAKER_15]: they'll have the notary, they'll come to you.

302
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:58,930
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to confirm with Attorney Stein that Dr. Stein is okay.

303
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll just see who has the prettiest signature and then go from there.

304
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:04,391
[SPEAKER_31]: Sounds great.

305
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:11,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, so we're looking for, this is a separate motion though, because we've already voted on the first.

306
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:15,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for a new motion.

307
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:17,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, you seem queued up.

308
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,095
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'm already unmuted.

309
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:27,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to authorize Director Hunt to sign the paperwork on behalf of the board.

310
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Waiting for a second.

311
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:34,962
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll second that motion.

312
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Annie.

313
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,163
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

314
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:37,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Kalfs?

315
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:39,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

316
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:40,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

317
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:41,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

318
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens?

319
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:44,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

320
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:46,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

321
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

322
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:50,540
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

323
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:54,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we can say thank you, Mr. Champey.

324
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:57,287
[SPEAKER_21]: We will see you in a month or so.

325
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,609
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah.

326
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:00,390
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see you soon.

327
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:02,792
[SPEAKER_31]: Bye bye.

328
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:03,012
[SPEAKER_31]: Thanks.

329
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:03,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye.

330
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:12,421
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, we're moving on to our next agenda item, which is a continued public hearing for the Salem Street corridor.

331
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Zoning amendments.

332
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:18,644
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is a continued public hearing.

333
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:29,294
[SPEAKER_21]: We last discussed when the public hearing was opened at the January 22nd, 2025 Community Development Board meeting, which was continued to February 5th.

334
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:47,809
[SPEAKER_21]: At the February 5th meeting, we continued without discussion to this evening's meeting, March 5th, primarily in order to allow for more public outreach and to hold a question and answer meeting at the Roberts Elementary School, which was held on February 10th, 2025.

335
00:26:51,322 --> 00:27:07,795
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to hand it off to the staff, ask if they have any introductory comments, we're then going to pass it on to Innes Associates, and then we will move into board questions and comments, and then we will open the public comment period.

336
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:14,439
[SPEAKER_21]: I did just receive a question for where the raise hand function is.

337
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:20,183
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to get ahead of the line, feel free to raise your hand.

338
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,445
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to reorient myself with where it is.

339
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,606
[SPEAKER_25]: It's under React.

340
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:27,646
[SPEAKER_21]: React.

341
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:37,673
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you click on the React button, which is a heart, not the arrow next to React, but the React button itself, you can raise your hand.

342
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,475
[SPEAKER_21]: And I already see some hands going up.

343
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:53,545
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have questions in terms of technology, please feel free to message Danielle or Alicia, and I'll do my best to redirect you all to them.

344
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:59,976
[SPEAKER_21]: But for now, we are going to hear some introductory comments from Danielle or Alicia.

345
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:07,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chair, I don't have anything.

346
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:11,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if Dr. Hunt has anything that you'd like to say.

347
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:14,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should move on to the consultant.

348
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,405
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be a long night.

349
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:29,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and I read, I read some pretty good recaps of the meeting from some members of the public and I'm really excited to hear from Innocent Associates in terms of what comments have been incorporated.

350
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:33,035
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have Emily and Paula.

351
00:28:35,237 --> 00:28:36,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

352
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:37,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

353
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:42,603
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates, and I will be making tonight's presentation.

354
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,425
[SPEAKER_14]: With your permission, I will share my screen.

355
00:28:47,970 --> 00:29:06,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you and what we plan to do is give an update for you of what we heard of the timeline partially and then what we heard at the meeting and the changes that we made in response to what we heard at the meeting because we have made some changes.

356
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:18,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll talk a little bit about those components, and then we can also go if we need to, to the draft zoning itself, but we have summarized the changes on the slide.

357
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:23,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So, this is the timeline to date, ending up with today, March 5th.

358
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:30,346
[SPEAKER_14]: We had started working with a workshop with the Planning and Permitting Committee last July.

359
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:45,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Did sort of mystic Avenue and Salem Street and parallel and then move to finishing up mystic Avenue, moving forward with Salem Street the I think the key things here is the fact that we have held the community listening session on February 10.

360
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:48,029
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also see that here.

361
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we are today again for March 5th and we are continuing.

362
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:56,434
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the rest of the timeline just to keep you all updated.

363
00:29:57,015 --> 00:30:02,058
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been working on the neighborhood and urban residential components.

364
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:12,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Those will be coming your way, but before they do, we will have a listening session for the residential and that's going to be either March, as far as we know now, either March 20th or 27th.

365
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:21,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll also be doing a Squares and Boston Avenue community listening session because we're starting to talk about the commercial areas.

366
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,789
[SPEAKER_14]: And that right now, again, is either going to be April 10th or April 29th.

367
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:28,610
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to quickly give you an update of what's coming.

368
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:35,153
[SPEAKER_14]: But the key thing today is reporting back to you about the listening session and those changes.

369
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,314
[SPEAKER_14]: So the listening session was one room.

370
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:56,463
[SPEAKER_14]: But broken into basically two activities at the front of the cafetorium, we held a presentation, and people could ask questions and have myself, Councilor Bears, Council President Bears,

371
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:59,005
[SPEAKER_14]: and Director Hunt answer questions.

372
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:10,273
[SPEAKER_14]: At the back of the room, Danielle and my colleague Paola Ramos-Martinez had these maps, two of these maps here and two other boards that I'll show you.

373
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:16,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were able to work one-on-one with people who had questions maybe about specific properties.

374
00:31:16,198 --> 00:31:23,283
[SPEAKER_14]: So the map showed the current zoning up here at the top and then our then proposed zoning.

375
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,485
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said, there have been some changes.

376
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:32,090
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can see some of the stickies that people put on with their questions or their thoughts about the area.

377
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:35,373
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had the use tables up.

378
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,956
[SPEAKER_14]: So these were the proposed uses at the time of the meeting.

379
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:41,418
[SPEAKER_14]: We have made some adjustments based on what we heard.

380
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:50,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And we asked people to mark off if they thought the uses were appropriate or not appropriate by district or for the neighborhood as a whole.

381
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:53,625
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can see a lot of stickies here.

382
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:58,627
[SPEAKER_14]: We captured those as no's.

383
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:04,991
[SPEAKER_14]: There were quite a few uses that people did not feel were appropriate for the area, so we took that into consideration as well.

384
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:20,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe we have just transmitted, it takes a while to write all of these up in a memo format, but I believe we've just transmitted that to Director Hunt today so that we have the full write up in there, but this is a useful summary.

385
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:26,228
[SPEAKER_14]: So this was the proposal we presented to you at our last meeting together.

386
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:27,188
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see the

387
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:38,434
[SPEAKER_14]: mixed-use 1 in blue, the mixed-use 2 in red, the commercial, we have just one property that's marked commercial, and we have the multi-unit residential.

388
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:45,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're making changes to this based on what we heard at the meeting, and this is the rough outline of the changes.

389
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:56,622
[SPEAKER_14]: We're shifting a few things around, primarily, and the most important, and I do have a clean version of this map, which I'll show you, but I wanted to call out so you can see exactly what the changes are.

390
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:17,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the most important is this area around Park Street which we had originally discussed as being mix two is now at mix one and that has implications for the number of stories and the amount, the number of stories as a base but also the number of stories in terms of incentive zoning so

391
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:33,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Mixed use to was a four story base maximum base with an additional two stories available from the incentive zoning, just as a reminder for those who might not have been at the first meeting or at the listening session.

392
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:39,978
[SPEAKER_14]: The incentive zoning allows additional height, but only in return for public benefits from the developer.

393
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:49,308
[SPEAKER_14]: By changing this to a mix one, we drop down to a three story base zone with an incentive zoning of four stories.

394
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:54,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've essentially knocked one story off the base and two stories off the incentive.

395
00:33:56,595 --> 00:34:03,039
[SPEAKER_14]: The other things that we did were just sort of rationalize some of the other parcels we went in throughout this process.

396
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:11,585
[SPEAKER_14]: We've tried to listen to people and understand, you know, the ground conditions as well as the mapping analyses that we've done.

397
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:17,412
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we've moved some of these, like the parcels here that were targeted as multi unit residential.

398
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Those have actually been moved out of the district at the moment.

399
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:26,804
[SPEAKER_14]: This is in part in response to the work we've been doing on the neighborhoods and throughout the city.

400
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:28,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

401
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:42,840
[SPEAKER_14]: and then we just had a closer look at some things that were going on on these parcels here, moved this one from MX2 into MR, which is the multifamily residential, and moved this multifamily residential into MX2.

402
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:55,071
[SPEAKER_14]: So the new map looks like this, and you can see it's pretty consistently mixed-use one up along the corridor itself with a few parcels behind, also being allowed to be mixed-use one

403
00:34:56,091 --> 00:35:08,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Mixed-use 2 is concentrated up at the top, sort of planned northeast, as we call it, with the one commercial remaining, and then the MR district remaining here.

404
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:12,695
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what the impact of the map changes looks like.

405
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:15,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you go back to the previous slide real quick?

406
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:16,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, absolutely.

407
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:19,117
[SPEAKER_14]: And you want to see here as well.

408
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the original.

409
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,958
[SPEAKER_14]: These are calling out the individual changes.

410
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:33,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and these are so we changed a few these dark blues are a few changing from the multifamily residential to mix one.

411
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:39,898
[SPEAKER_14]: In some cases, for example, it's already there's 1 parcel, just as an example that already has apartments on it.

412
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:42,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it didn't make sense to leave in the one.

413
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:45,801
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, we took a parcel by parcel view of that.

414
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:51,164
[SPEAKER_14]: So, then again, you can see the changes that CMR so sort of cleaned.

415
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:56,425
[SPEAKER_14]: that up so that stays the MR there and then again the mix too.

416
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:19,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Emily, Madam Chair if I may, these changes of the so what we are going to do in this change will appear later is that the multi-residential that was for three to six units now goes down to one to three and that is why instead of having that transition we add some more

417
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:32,640
[SPEAKER_18]: We add this new from MR to mixed use one, those blue parcels that you saw before, which currently are apartment one.

418
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,143
[SPEAKER_18]: They currently are multi-family in any case.

419
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:38,685
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to make that sure.

420
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:45,290
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't placed any single family currently parcel that is in single family district.

421
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:46,938
[SPEAKER_18]: two makes one.

422
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,986
[SPEAKER_18]: These are all apartment one that are currently in apartment one.

423
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:55,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to clarify that.

424
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:55,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

425
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:18,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So the, that's, that's the big map change I think the the next thing that happens is the recommendations from city staff so again for people who may be joining this for the first time and haven't known the process, the city council sent a draft to the CD board for their review.

426
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:32,770
[SPEAKER_14]: At the January 22 meeting we presented recommendations from city staff that would change or offer amendments to the original draft I just want to quickly go over those.

427
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:39,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Since then we have another set of recommendations based primarily on what we heard and the implications of what we heard.

428
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,158
[SPEAKER_14]: at the public meeting, so I'm going to present those as well.

429
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:50,179
[SPEAKER_14]: But just as a reminder, the first one is we wanted to clarify the intent of the development incentive bonuses.

430
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:59,342
[SPEAKER_14]: There was some concern that a developer could stack all the bonuses on top of each other and achieve a height higher than what is allowed by the zoning.

431
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:04,223
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to clarify that you can only go up to that maximum height, so in the MX-1,

432
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:08,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You get three stories, you can only go up one more story.

433
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:14,079
[SPEAKER_14]: In the MX2, you get four stories, you can only go up two more stories.

434
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,406
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to clarify that you can only go up to that maximum height.

435
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:27,164
[SPEAKER_14]: I should also say here that the incentive bonus is only allowed for those parcels that directly front onto Salem Street.

436
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:36,670
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you are a parcel, say, in the MX-1 or in the MX-2 that does not front on Salem Street, the incentive bonus is not achievable.

437
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,591
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not allowable.

438
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:43,634
[SPEAKER_14]: We added definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood, medical office, and medical office.

439
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:45,635
[SPEAKER_14]: The first two we pointed to state law.

440
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:46,836
[SPEAKER_14]: The second one,

441
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:59,080
[SPEAKER_14]: changed it based on controls that governed the number of square feet, gross floor area, and no more than five employees.

442
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,761
[SPEAKER_14]: We've made an additional change since then, which I'll show you.

443
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:05,982
[SPEAKER_14]: And then medical office obviously is not restricted by those requirements.

444
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:16,365
[SPEAKER_14]: In the January 2022, we had added neighborhood medical office as a yes and medical office as a special permit from yourselves.

445
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:29,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we had in January 22, we had also added some height step back requirements to help protect the residential district.

446
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:41,672
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're requiring that the height be stepped back further from the residential district and allowing a step back waiver because at the time we were talking about a front step back and rear or side step backs.

447
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:51,944
[SPEAKER_14]: We had made, there was a typo in I think the earlier draft that had some of the adult use marijuana as a CDB special permit.

448
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:56,407
[SPEAKER_14]: We've changed that to no on January 22nd recommendations.

449
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:01,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's the end of the January 22nd recommendations.

450
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:02,852
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've seen these before.

451
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:06,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I want to show you what we've changed since the public meeting.

452
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:22,318
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first change is we are no longer allowing medical office that is the unrestricted by, by the number of square feet or the number of employees that's not being allowed anywhere in the Salem street.

453
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:44,685
[SPEAKER_14]: district, we are not allowing neighborhood medical in Mix 1, so that area around Park Street, for example, that was Mix 2, that neighborhood medical could have been in, it's now Mix 1, neighborhood medical is not allowed there, and we are allowing it as special permit by the CD board in Mix 2 and commercial, so that upper end

454
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:53,647
[SPEAKER_14]: in the RAD, and that is because we heard loud and clear from the community members who were present at the meeting.

455
00:40:54,147 --> 00:41:06,650
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a strong voice against having medical, certainly having medical around the school area and the Park Street area, but also some concern about having it at all.

456
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,811
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to balance it with people who did express

457
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:30,612
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a few that expressed an interest in having some medical in the area and also where the MX2 district is, where it's got access from parts of the city that don't have to go through Salem Street, allowing that, but allowing that with the restrictions on it and also the restriction of a special permit.

458
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:45,494
[SPEAKER_14]: It's important that people be able to access their dentists or physicians, but we wanted to make sure that it was not creating an impact on the neighborhood in terms of traffic and people coming in and out which is I think part of the concern.

459
00:41:47,352 --> 00:42:11,908
[SPEAKER_14]: On the table of use regulations, so the multi-unit residential subjects district, so we have modified this to match in for anybody who has, who's on this call, who's been following the residential discussion, we have a residential district called NR3, which is, as Paola said, it's restricted to three dwelling units, although there's a historic conversion in there.

460
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:12,288
[SPEAKER_14]: What we've

461
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:20,429
[SPEAKER_14]: done is we've lined up the multi-unit residential subdistrict here to eventually be replaced by NR3.

462
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:27,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the city councilors are well aware that at the end of this process, we're going to have to come back and sort of right size a couple of things.

463
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:30,031
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because we're doing it geographically.

464
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:40,293
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're trying to do is set up the MR to eventually become the NR3, which is when we look at the maps, it's fairly close to what's on the ground now.

465
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:53,765
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all of these changes are to make sure that the table of use regulations for the multi-unit residential subdistrict are consistent with the NR3 subdistrict, and at the end of the process, we'll just combine the two.

466
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:56,587
[SPEAKER_14]: So, those are the tweaks.

467
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:01,752
[SPEAKER_14]: The key is to make sure that it is the primarily residential district that it is now.

468
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,773
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we've tried to be very careful about that.

469
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:11,577
[SPEAKER_14]: The next thing is for MX1, MX2, and commercial, we have some additional use modifications.

470
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:18,440
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard from quite a few people in the public meeting that they did not want a hotel in the area, which is currently allowed.

471
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,562
[SPEAKER_14]: We removed the brewery or taproom for MX1.

472
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:27,804
[SPEAKER_14]: We think that's much more appropriate where MX2 is now as a use.

473
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:38,937
[SPEAKER_14]: We have created the option for taking the option for a parking area or garage that's accessory to a principal use, but it's not necessarily on the same lot.

474
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:43,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is by special permit from yourselves and MX1 and MX2.

475
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:53,908
[SPEAKER_14]: parking area or garage accessory to a principal use on the same lot as a non-conforming principal use, also special permit for MX-1 and MX-2.

476
00:43:54,588 --> 00:44:00,330
[SPEAKER_14]: We've removed distillery or winery from both, mostly because of the square footage requirements.

477
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,690
[SPEAKER_14]: The parcels in that area are quite small.

478
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:09,012
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a use that does not seem practicable in either of those.

479
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:13,434
[SPEAKER_14]: We've clarified home occupation as by special permit in MX-1 and MX-2.

480
00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:17,115
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the end of the uses.

481
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:22,516
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the dimensional requirements for the multi-unit residential subdistrict, same thing.

482
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,677
[SPEAKER_14]: We're lining those up with the NR3.

483
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:28,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Minimum height, two stories.

484
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:33,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Maximum height is because they don't have the buildings on Salem Street.

485
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:43,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Mixed one does not have the incentive zoning that, sorry, multi-unit residential doesn't have the incentive zoning that mix one and mix two do.

486
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:46,966
[SPEAKER_14]: and then the rest of that is the same.

487
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:58,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Same thing for setbacks, front 10, rear 15, side 5 feet to some to 10 feet, stormwater and landscaping, all of these are consistent with the NR3 to be.

488
00:45:02,062 --> 00:45:13,788
[SPEAKER_14]: For MX1, MX2 and commercial, we did hear from people that wanted to make sure that the buildings weren't impinging on the adjacent residential districts.

489
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:17,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have deleted the step back requirement for MX1.

490
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's step back from the street.

491
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,212
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea was the step back above the third floor.

492
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:28,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would start going up straight and then above the third floor, you'd step it back to go up further.

493
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:30,216
[SPEAKER_14]: But now MX1 is only four floors.

494
00:45:30,756 --> 00:45:39,725
[SPEAKER_14]: doesn't make sense to have a step back for a single floor, and also we want to preserve the ability to step back if necessary from the other side.

495
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:46,351
[SPEAKER_14]: We created a setback of 10 feet in MX1, MX2, and commercial for the rear lot line.

496
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,373
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard that was very important for people.

497
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:56,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we also reduce the neighborhood residential 3, the sub district for the multi unit residential.

498
00:45:56,067 --> 00:46:00,215
[SPEAKER_14]: We've reduced it down to 1 to 3 units within the area rather than 3 to 6.

499
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:06,694
[SPEAKER_14]: And the side and the rear setbacks, we just clarified the language.

500
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:11,796
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a concern at the public meeting about the fence that we had in there.

501
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:15,317
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked about it.

502
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:25,001
[SPEAKER_14]: The way the language was structured, it made it look like a fence only required a five foot setback as opposed to being halfway through the 10 foot setback.

503
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:26,901
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought it was just too confusing.

504
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're requiring that

505
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:36,888
[SPEAKER_14]: landscape buffer of at least 10 feet wide if a proposed development is adjacent to existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units.

506
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:45,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's to create a nicer buffer between anything that could someday be built along Salem Street and the adjacent neighborhoods.

507
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:50,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, are there proposed changes to amend the map that I showed earlier?

508
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:53,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's that is it for the the changes.

509
00:46:54,009 --> 00:47:00,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the listening to people's concerns at the public listening session was very helpful to us.

510
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:06,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I think that we've been able to address most of what we heard.

511
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:11,978
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm delighted to take any questions from the board and obviously listen to the public comment.

512
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:15,900
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, thank you, Emily.

513
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:25,138
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we are going to have the board ask questions, comments.

514
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:34,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paolo will respond hopefully, or be able to respond in some way.

515
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:39,892
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we'll open the public hearing just to keep everyone updated on our plans for this evening.

516
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,296
[SPEAKER_21]: So fellow board members, what do we think?

517
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:51,908
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm impressed with the changes that were made.

518
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:55,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that they reflect what we heard on the 22nd.

519
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,913
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you made some of the changes in a very strategic way.

520
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:07,157
[SPEAKER_21]: We heard a lot of comments about uses that were not appropriate in school areas.

521
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:11,539
[SPEAKER_21]: I like how those were addressed.

522
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:22,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I appreciate the kind of block by block, parcel by parcel approach and the changes made there.

523
00:48:22,556 --> 00:48:26,798
[SPEAKER_21]: So interested hearing from the board and members of the public eventually.

524
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:33,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I echo Emily's reaction.

525
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:38,770
[SPEAKER_19]: I do like many of the changes 1 set of feedback that I remember hearing and.

526
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:45,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Agreeing with part large parts of it is do we have an update to the incentive zoning?

527
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, there was discussion of.

528
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:59,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind of reweighing some of those values so that we didn't end up with, you know, a bunch of fountains and so that we really emphasized the key priorities like affordable housing.

529
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you share any updates on that list of tables and values?

530
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:04,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

531
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:11,219
[SPEAKER_14]: With your permission, Madam Chair, I'm just pulling it up so I have it in front of me.

532
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And the answer is yes.

533
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:21,564
[SPEAKER_14]: So we clarified the incentives for the affordability remained unchanged.

534
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:25,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have the option of deeper affordability or more affordable units.

535
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:31,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Or again, the max would be two additional stories.

536
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:36,770
[SPEAKER_14]: So there won't be a whole lot of change there.

537
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:51,054
[SPEAKER_14]: For the community amenities, we had clarified that I think there was some confusion that a fountain was kind of an easy thing to do.

538
00:49:51,274 --> 00:49:56,176
[SPEAKER_14]: We clarified that also meant the maintenance and repair for the life of the associated building.

539
00:49:56,896 --> 00:50:06,881
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in other words, it's not just build a fountain, you have to, you have to provide the water for it, you have to keep it in good repair, there's nothing worse than a fountain that has just been let go.

540
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:22,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we've clarified that we are certainly open to some additional options, and we've made it clear, clearer that the seeding I think people had from from some of the comments that I saw.

541
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:29,375
[SPEAKER_14]: people would assume that seating meant like a single bench, and we clarified that there was a square footage requirement.

542
00:50:29,795 --> 00:50:36,181
[SPEAKER_14]: We did have, I think, one person talk about making that an even larger requirement.

543
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:48,232
[SPEAKER_14]: We're happy to look at that more if we get more feedback on that, but we were really focused on the uses and the map changes as being the biggest things we wanted to make sure we got done.

544
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:57,720
[SPEAKER_21]: And Ari, as part of our recommendation, we may be able to recommend further analysis of that menu coming out of this meeting.

545
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

546
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I will probably ask for that near the end.

547
00:51:02,742 --> 00:51:02,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

548
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:03,802
[SPEAKER_19]: But thank you.

549
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:09,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, Adam, Annie.

550
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:15,466
[SPEAKER_25]: I would also like to echo what Emily and Ari have said.

551
00:51:15,526 --> 00:51:16,947
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is really

552
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:45,598
[SPEAKER_25]: does reflect what we saw on 22nd and the concerns there particularly I appreciate I remember hearing a lot about the area on Park Street and how people were concerned that that was uh kind of going too too dense and particularly around the uses that were allowable in in in the in the mix too and I think this did a great job of addressing that by keeping some of the density in the mix one but also then adjusting the uses to uh

553
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,330
[SPEAKER_25]: to adjust what would be allowable there.

554
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:52,471
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you.

555
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:57,936
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking through my notes from last meeting.

556
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:08,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Jane, a member of the public, brought up a bunch of different uses, breweries, methadone clinics, wine liquor store, rehabilitation clinics.

557
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:11,308
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like those have been addressed.

558
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:22,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I like what you guys are doing with the parking garages that might help with some of the parking concerns that people like Ralph brought up.

559
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:59,311
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like there's a more reasonable approach to step backs, especially if it's just going to be one extra floor.

560
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:00,672
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no need for a step back.

561
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:05,455
[SPEAKER_21]: John was the one that brought that up last time.

562
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:13,120
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

563
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:15,042
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a couple.

564
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,653
[SPEAKER_21]: couple comments that stood out to me from last time.

565
00:53:20,176 --> 00:53:26,023
[SPEAKER_21]: If we don't have any further comments or questions from the board, I would love to open it up to the public.

566
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:40,607
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm now going to open the public comment period.

567
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:44,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function.

568
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:50,415
[SPEAKER_21]: And as mentioned earlier, if you're in Zoom, there is a react button.

569
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:53,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Click right on it and you should be able to raise your hand.

570
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:59,322
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're having technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia in the chat.

571
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:03,696
[SPEAKER_21]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

572
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:08,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

573
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:18,066
[SPEAKER_21]: A reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as that's not part of the public record.

574
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:23,910
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if you do have audio or technical difficulties, you can message staff for assistance.

575
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:28,193
[SPEAKER_21]: So, no comments about the topic via chat, but

576
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:34,290
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, questions about Zoom or other technical issues, feel free to send those through chat to Alicia and Danielle.

577
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,119
[SPEAKER_21]: As with before, we're going to give each participant two minutes to speak.

578
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:42,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Each participant will have one opportunity to speak.

579
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:49,289
[SPEAKER_21]: I do also want to say that any emails that are sent in to the Community Development Board are shared with the board in advance.

580
00:54:50,049 --> 00:55:00,234
[SPEAKER_21]: We review all of those, and if you feel that you're not able to convey your full comment in the two minutes provided, please, please, please email us.

581
00:55:01,095 --> 00:55:04,356
[SPEAKER_21]: We review every note and really appreciate the

582
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:11,587
[SPEAKER_21]: the effort and the consistency that we've seen from the community to make sure that we get this right.

583
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,955
[SPEAKER_21]: What's coming out of this meeting from the Community Development Board is recommendations for the City Council.

584
00:55:20,956 --> 00:55:29,365
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Community Development Board can kind of be, as we should, an advocate for the public.

585
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:38,122
[SPEAKER_21]: for any additional process or steps or anything that needs to happen related to this process, so please keep that in mind.

586
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:52,031
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do our best to advocate and create conditions that drive action, but if you have specific actions that you would like to see, please make sure to call those out.

587
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:54,933
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very easy to say what you don't want.

588
00:55:55,394 --> 00:56:02,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes it's hard to vocalize what you do want, but that's the most valuable input for us right now, what you do want.

589
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:06,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia is going to manage the public comment queue.

590
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, I know we've received some comments.

591
00:56:11,425 --> 00:56:13,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you want to offer a high-level summary of those?

592
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we just give that at the end of the thing?

593
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:23,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

594
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:24,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

595
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:27,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I see we have some people eager to speak, and I'm eager to hear from you.

596
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:33,914
[SPEAKER_21]: So I believe David Zapner is up first.

597
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:36,614
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

598
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

599
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:42,696
[SPEAKER_21]: And Alicia or Danielle will be managing a timer.

600
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,120
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello, everybody.

601
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,540
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm David Zabner.

602
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,241
[SPEAKER_35]: I live at 107 Bowdoin Street here in Medford.

603
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:54,782
[SPEAKER_35]: I guess I'll say that I'm very excited for these changes.

604
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:57,222
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's really important that we rezone the city.

605
00:56:57,242 --> 00:57:02,883
[SPEAKER_35]: I think this is a really good step towards the progress we need to see in the city.

606
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,844
[SPEAKER_35]: Housing values are too high.

607
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:12,185
[SPEAKER_35]: My friends and family could not possibly move to live in Medford, and that's, I think, a real problem.

608
00:57:13,486 --> 00:57:23,196
[SPEAKER_35]: And the things I want are more housing, less parking, more flexibility in land use across the board.

609
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:29,222
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we should all be so lucky to live in a place where rent is affordable.

610
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:34,464
[SPEAKER_35]: And we can walk and get you know some groceries on the corner and a coffee on the other corner.

611
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:38,886
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think that this zoning represents a very real step towards that.

612
00:57:40,246 --> 00:57:43,888
[SPEAKER_35]: So mostly I'm just speaking highly in support of this.

613
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:48,330
[SPEAKER_35]: The last thing I'll speak in support of that this seems to be doing.

614
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,851
[SPEAKER_35]: is keeping the zoning as simple as possible.

615
00:57:53,391 --> 00:58:13,115
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the simpler it can be and the fewer things that need to go to the CBD or to the zoning board, the more quickly people can build things, the more quickly we can have changes, and the less expensive it is to build.

616
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:17,156
[SPEAKER_35]: I have friends and family who develop buildings.

617
00:58:18,396 --> 00:58:25,263
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's amazing the years and decades that you can spend waiting for something to be approved.

618
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:30,668
[SPEAKER_35]: And that adds a lot of expense to all of our housing that I think is really unnecessary.

619
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:32,709
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm really excited for this.

620
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,172
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'll yield my last 12 seconds back.

621
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:37,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Javid.

622
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,515
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

623
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:39,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Time is money.

624
00:58:39,836 --> 00:58:40,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So point well heard.

625
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:46,902
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that we have is Evan Glasson.

626
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:49,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

627
00:58:49,784 --> 00:58:51,566
[SPEAKER_21]: You will see a request to unmute.

628
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:53,390
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks.

629
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,231
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, everyone.

630
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:55,191
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm Evan Glasson.

631
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:59,053
[SPEAKER_30]: I am a homeowner at 16 Butler Street in Medford.

632
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:12,821
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to speak up and say that I am really very much in support of this rezoning effort, specifically in the Salem Street corridor, but also the broader citywide rezoning plan.

633
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:22,165
[SPEAKER_30]: I really appreciate the thorough work of this board and the consultants who have been a part of this and listening to the public feedback on the matter.

634
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:37,791
[SPEAKER_30]: I personally am really, really excited to make Medford a place that more people can benefit from, that more people can live in, that is more walkable, more fun to be in because of that walkability and all of the cool places that

635
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:40,032
[SPEAKER_30]: that can come as a part of this plan.

636
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:51,016
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm just really, really excited for what's ahead for Medford and the work that we are doing to help address the housing crisis that we're facing.

637
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:52,476
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you.

638
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:54,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Evan.

639
00:59:57,758 --> 01:00:01,660
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that we have is Carlene Campbell-Haggerty.

640
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record, and you will get a request to unmute shortly.

641
01:00:08,888 --> 01:00:09,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, can you hear me?

642
01:00:10,629 --> 01:00:10,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

643
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

644
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,373
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Carly Campbell Hagerty, 49 Elmont Street.

645
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:20,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm here tonight to say, first of all, thank you, Emily.

646
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:28,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that was a very long meeting that we had in February, and you did take a lot of our ideas and listen to what we had to say, so I appreciate that.

647
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:35,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not, though, I'm for good zoning.

648
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:39,160
[SPEAKER_08]: that can enhance and revitalize an area.

649
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we're quite there yet.

650
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:52,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of that reason was it took so long for the people who are going to be affected the most to be heard in February, but I'm very impressed by what happened afterwards.

651
01:00:52,988 --> 01:00:55,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two suggestions, one question.

652
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,311
[SPEAKER_08]: My question regarding is,

653
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:04,774
[SPEAKER_08]: before we finalize everything looking into traffic studies, parking studies, and shadow studies.

654
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:16,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, since we're going to be building up density, more people, more cars, more everything else, will the infrastructure, the water, the sewer be able to take all that on?

655
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:19,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one statement.

656
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:28,581
[SPEAKER_08]: My other statement would be communication to the general community needs to be improved, especially at Butters and the people directly affected by all of this.

657
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,271
[SPEAKER_08]: People have emailed the address now.

658
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:33,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping they'll use it.

659
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:42,699
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my last statement that I would like to talk about is, Emily, you said you made a lot of changes with the buy right items.

660
01:01:42,919 --> 01:01:45,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, you were talking very quickly.

661
01:01:45,061 --> 01:01:46,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really hard to see.

662
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:50,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious about the methadone dispensary.

663
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:53,525
[SPEAKER_08]: It was MX1, MX2.

664
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:56,206
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the medical center under that guise.

665
01:01:57,106 --> 01:02:00,468
[SPEAKER_08]: We at the meeting said we didn't want any new medical buildings.

666
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:09,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, was that taking off the table or not?

667
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:11,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any other questions, Carleen?

668
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:16,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because your time is up, but I think that is a very valid question for us to respond to.

669
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I have just two very quick questions.

670
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:20,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I will talk this really fast.

671
01:02:21,095 --> 01:02:32,219
[SPEAKER_08]: In the remainer, the remaining ones that you didn't touch on, like the research and testing lab, the dormitory, the shelters, the exempt architecture, is that still in the list?

672
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:37,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it only looks like things should change, not everything that was previously in that people asked to be removed.

673
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:42,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's sort of my nutshell question, and I really need answers on those.

674
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:51,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, so we're going to conclude your time for public comment, but I am going to pass it over to Emily Innis to respond.

675
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:53,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

676
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:53,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Carly.

677
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,249
[SPEAKER_14]: With your permission, Madam Chair, I'm happy to respond.

678
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to briefly share the table of uses.

679
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:07,298
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like there may be one that we thought we had caught, but we didn't, so I'm glad you brought it up.

680
01:03:07,878 --> 01:03:09,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the table of uses.

681
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,042
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the actual draft zoning itself.

682
01:03:13,182 --> 01:03:15,983
[SPEAKER_14]: MR1, MX1, MX2, commercial.

683
01:03:16,403 --> 01:03:19,303
[SPEAKER_14]: This PC is the parking requirements.

684
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:23,024
[SPEAKER_14]: We have not changed those from the existing city parking requirements.

685
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And the LC is the loading requirements.

686
01:03:27,365 --> 01:03:29,965
[SPEAKER_14]: It's primarily commercial or multiple development.

687
01:03:30,565 --> 01:03:37,107
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think what has not been changed, I'm glad you called that out, and I'm just going to highlight it for my purposes.

688
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:46,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the CD boards recommendation is dormitory fraternity or sorority house I thought we'd take I think we both thought we'd taken it out of mix one.

689
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:58,456
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still in there but we should have that lodging or boarding house is special permit senior housing facility special permit I don't believe those have changed probably you can correct me if I'm wrong.

690
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe those have changed from existing zoning.

691
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:07,081
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other ones you had asked about, I apologize for making people dizzy.

692
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:10,963
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm searching for the highlighted ones, which are the ones that we had changed.

693
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:16,566
[SPEAKER_14]: We did remove brewery from the MX1.

694
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:19,548
[SPEAKER_14]: We removed hotel from the entire district.

695
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:25,734
[SPEAKER_14]: And then here's what we did was we removed medical office from the entire district.

696
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:31,319
[SPEAKER_14]: We did remove neighborhood medical office from MX1.

697
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:38,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard there were some strong voices in the room for no medical at all.

698
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:45,248
[SPEAKER_14]: We had heard separately from a few people that liked the ability to be able to walk to their dentist, etc.

699
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:57,051
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the neighborhood medical office, I had mentioned earlier in the discussion that the neighborhood medical office is limited by the number of employees, by the square footage.

700
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:04,072
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also changed the definition, which I apologize, I forgot to mention, which limits it by the hours as well, that's in your new zoning.

701
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:09,873
[SPEAKER_14]: We had talked about it, but it had gotten crossed out accidentally, so that is back in there.

702
01:05:10,213 --> 01:05:22,975
[SPEAKER_14]: So at any rate, with those limitations and with the requirement of a special permit for the CD board, so essentially the strongest controls we can put on it, we did leave that in the Mix 2 and in the commercial.

703
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:26,756
[SPEAKER_14]: The commercial is that single parcel on the other side of the Felsway.

704
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:34,097
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mix 2 is the red, otherwise sort of planned northeast, the area where Salem Street and the Felsway intersect.

705
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,419
[SPEAKER_14]: And then let me just double check the other ones that we talked about.

706
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:51,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, apologize for the here are the changes to the parking areas, which again, MR is now consistent with neighborhood 3, which is currently on its way to the CD board.

707
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:55,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Here are the other changes to the parking area that we talked about.

708
01:05:55,225 --> 01:06:00,507
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you asked about the research labs.

709
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:02,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we'd taken that out.

710
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:02,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just.

711
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's further down.

712
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:11,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a long list of uses because this is actually your entire list.

713
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so here we go.

714
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Life science facility is not allowed in any part of the district.

715
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:19,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Food production facility not allowed in any part of the district.

716
01:06:20,148 --> 01:06:25,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Distillery or winery and light manufacturing, again, not allowed in any part of the district.

717
01:06:25,354 --> 01:06:39,251
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that takes care of everything, except the the dorms and I would recommend to the city board our apologies for missing that I thought we'd caught it, but I would recommend that to be changed and your recommendations to city council.

718
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:41,154
[SPEAKER_14]: If that is acceptable to you.

719
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:58,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to state Emily has just fallen off.

720
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,081
[SPEAKER_15]: She lost her internet connection.

721
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:01,582
[SPEAKER_15]: She just texted me.

722
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:07,746
[SPEAKER_15]: She is moving to a different location at her home where she can pick up the Wi-Fi.

723
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:13,750
[SPEAKER_15]: She asked that Peter could sub in and chair until she gets back online.

724
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,990
[SPEAKER_15]: We do still have a quorum.

725
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to state that for everyone.

726
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:19,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, okay.

727
01:07:22,551 --> 01:07:29,774
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the next person up, the name is just Navar.

728
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:36,076
[SPEAKER_25]: And you should be getting a notification to unmute.

729
01:07:36,296 --> 01:07:40,078
[SPEAKER_25]: And then if you could please state your name and address for the record.

730
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:40,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

731
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,701
[SPEAKER_25]: You're muted.

732
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:51,002
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not muted on Zoom.

733
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:53,076
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, here we go.

734
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:53,677
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that any better?

735
01:07:53,697 --> 01:07:55,138
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, thank you.

736
01:07:55,518 --> 01:07:57,600
[SPEAKER_32]: William DeVar, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

737
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:07,388
[SPEAKER_32]: My message is basically that at this point, it seems that the zoning for apartments and so on has really been reduced significantly.

738
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:10,931
[SPEAKER_32]: I find that quite disappointing.

739
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:16,907
[SPEAKER_32]: It sounds like most of Salem Street, you can't have more than three units now.

740
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:25,077
[SPEAKER_32]: And not more than four stories is I think my understanding based on the preliminary, you know, presentation at the beginning of this meeting.

741
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:28,370
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that's disappointing.

742
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:33,033
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been attending this process through the entire thing.

743
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:49,805
[SPEAKER_32]: I thought that we were at a good level of increasing the density and the proximity, the number of people we can have in our neighborhoods, the amount of housing we can have to really make sure people can find an apartment and contribute to that 222,000 unit shortage that the state government has found that we have.

744
01:08:55,731 --> 01:09:01,005
[SPEAKER_32]: And it looks like we're moving in the direction with some of these changes of not achieving that goal.

745
01:09:03,794 --> 01:09:06,295
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll continue to stay engaged with the process and see what happens.

746
01:09:06,915 --> 01:09:08,615
[SPEAKER_32]: But I do find that disappointing.

747
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:17,418
[SPEAKER_32]: So if there's any way that some of the density that the consultants proposed originally could be restored, I'd really be excited to see that.

748
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:29,041
[SPEAKER_32]: Both here and as we go forward throughout the citywide zoning process, I really hope we make sure that we're not compromising too much on that being one of our goals.

749
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:29,861
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks a lot.

750
01:09:31,784 --> 01:09:32,344
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, William.

751
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,926
[SPEAKER_25]: And it looks like Emily is back.

752
01:09:35,266 --> 01:09:37,167
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'll hand the chair back over to her.

753
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:39,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Peter.

754
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:43,070
[SPEAKER_21]: And apologies for that.

755
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I lost Wi-Fi in my apartment.

756
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:48,412
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I don't have Wi-Fi, I have no cell phone service.

757
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:49,873
[SPEAKER_21]: But thankfully, it came back on.

758
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:52,794
[SPEAKER_21]: And I apologize to members of the public whose comments I missed.

759
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:59,858
[SPEAKER_21]: But I trust that other members of the board will be able to cover comments when we come back for discussion.

760
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:08,305
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, with that, the next person that I see is Erika DeRoche.

761
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Erika, please state your name.

762
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:12,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wait.

763
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I going out of order?

764
01:10:14,508 --> 01:10:17,070
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you're one off, I think.

765
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,651
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if that's just because you dropped.

766
01:10:18,671 --> 01:10:19,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Harrison.

767
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:19,911
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

768
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:20,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Harrison.

769
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:21,773
[SPEAKER_21]: She's all out of order right now.

770
01:10:21,893 --> 01:10:24,754
[SPEAKER_21]: So Peter, maybe do you want to flag people?

771
01:10:24,774 --> 01:10:24,854
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

772
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,322
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, so Harrison, thank you for your patience.

773
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:36,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record, and you're going to get a request to unmute.

774
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:43,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't hear you, Harrison.

775
01:10:46,428 --> 01:10:51,670
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't started the timer, though, so we'll make sure we can hear you before we get going.

776
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:54,791
[SPEAKER_21]: I can hear you now, I think.

777
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:54,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

778
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:58,847
[SPEAKER_33]: Harrison green to run away road in Medford.

779
01:10:59,307 --> 01:11:02,189
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I'm excited for this process in general.

780
01:11:02,469 --> 01:11:04,931
[SPEAKER_33]: I do definitely regret not getting involved earlier.

781
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,673
[SPEAKER_33]: While not a resident of the Salem street.

782
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:14,237
[SPEAKER_33]: Corridor I am looking for Medford to develop more housing units to address the housing shortage.

783
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:14,497
[SPEAKER_33]: So.

784
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:20,743
[SPEAKER_33]: echoing the previous speaker that the reduction is disappointing for me as well.

785
01:11:21,423 --> 01:11:34,794
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm looking to get more involved in future zoning and to accelerate the zoning as it moves into especially the neighborhood that affects me the most in West Medford to add the density here that we need so much.

786
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:35,615
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

787
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:42,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Harrison.

788
01:11:46,099 --> 01:12:15,037

789
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all for hearing my comments and I do have one question at the end.

790
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:28,424
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to say that I am strongly in favor of the zoning taking place across the city.

791
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:39,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I was also strongly in favor of this, you know, I thought very like sensible approach to increasing density on the Salem Street corridor.

792
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:51,452
[SPEAKER_17]: As originally proposed, I'm really excited about what's happening in the city and all of the work, very like detailed form work that you're doing to, you know, document

793
01:12:52,693 --> 01:13:02,866
[SPEAKER_17]: The conditions in the various neighborhoods to listen carefully to residents, I think it's really important and and I applaud you all for your very comprehensive work.

794
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:08,393
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will say that based on this evening's presentations.

795
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:15,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I am a little disappointed to see that some of that density is being walked back.

796
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:25,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that I'm not disappointed at all in the response that Innes Associates has given to community feedback.

797
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,922
[SPEAKER_17]: I really appreciate how sensitively you've responded.

798
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:38,587
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the same time, I would like to see the city have a place to go from where it is currently.

799
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:49,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when I see the MR1 is now maximum of three units, that does not increase the density.

800
01:13:50,424 --> 01:13:59,388
[SPEAKER_17]: That does not allow any sort of densification for the future, for the next 30 years.

801
01:13:59,788 --> 01:14:08,431
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I see that now there's a section, that section near Park Street, understood you're responding to community concerns,

802
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:12,837
[SPEAKER_17]: But that section changed from MU2 to MU1.

803
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:15,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, now that's a maximum of three stories.

804
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:30,641
[SPEAKER_17]: That, in effect, does not increase the density because two stories are allowed, so are currently permitted, if I'm correct, if I've remembered that correctly, two and two and a half stories is

805
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:38,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically 3 stories, so that also does not increase the density and does not allow any development.

806
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:49,622
[SPEAKER_17]: or does not promote development in that section of Medford in the way that I would like it to see it moving.

807
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:55,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Real quick, Erika, I'm sorry, we didn't set a timer, but I just want to give you a thought.

808
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,426
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just wrapping up.

809
01:14:56,727 --> 01:15:07,774
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I just wanted to say, I do have like one question, which is a comment that I heard at the listening session and that I wasn't clear on

810
01:15:09,978 --> 01:15:24,470
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the community could use some clarification on why zoning changes do not include traffic, shadow, or other studies.

811
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:36,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Because as an architect, I have to submit projects for review, and there are so many components and parameters for each project that in order

812
01:15:37,677 --> 01:15:47,960
[SPEAKER_17]: there would just be an infinite number of massings and traffic patterns that could be studied for an entire neighborhood.

813
01:15:48,400 --> 01:16:06,324
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that it would be really helpful for Lanning and his associates to work to clarify that for the community, why those studies have not been conducted or have not been made available

814
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:14,027
[SPEAKER_17]: because it's just not a feasible thing and has to be done on a development by development basis.

815
01:16:14,267 --> 01:16:17,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my comment and thank you again for listening.

816
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:19,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Erica.

817
01:16:23,247 --> 01:16:25,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Erica made some comments about density.

818
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:41,439
[SPEAKER_21]: But I agree, like it's it's definitely a bummer that, you know, the the unit count has decreased in that specific part of the zoning.

819
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:47,163
[SPEAKER_21]: But I want to get some clarity in terms of like, what density may be allowed?

820
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:50,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, where are we increasing density?

821
01:16:50,885 --> 01:16:52,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily, would you be able to

822
01:16:53,665 --> 01:16:54,665
[SPEAKER_21]: to address that question.

823
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I would be happy to, Madam Chair.

824
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:58,526
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you.

825
01:16:58,586 --> 01:16:59,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that question.

826
01:16:59,486 --> 01:17:03,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to address at least some of the studies question.

827
01:17:03,187 --> 01:17:05,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's helpful as well.

828
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:06,748
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's start with the density.

829
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:16,130
[SPEAKER_14]: So I do want to clarify, and I'll just pull up the map again, if you all don't mind, just so we can see what we're looking at.

830
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:26,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So this was the proposal as of January 22nd, and you can see the red here for the Mix-2 and the red over here for the Mix-2.

831
01:17:26,534 --> 01:17:30,636
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the Park Street intersection with Salem Street at that first one.

832
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:32,697
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of things going on here.

833
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:35,779
[SPEAKER_14]: One, obviously, here it changes to Mix-1.

834
01:17:35,879 --> 01:17:39,940
[SPEAKER_14]: We leave the Mix-2 up in the northeast corner alone.

835
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:42,682
[SPEAKER_14]: That stays Mix-2, so we're not changing anything here.

836
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:51,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, yes, it's three stories with a four-story as an incentive bonus option.

837
01:17:51,925 --> 01:17:54,426
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of things to consider here.

838
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:58,028
[SPEAKER_14]: One is at least some of these buildings along here are single-story.

839
01:17:58,648 --> 01:18:09,692
[SPEAKER_14]: So where it might not be attractive to redevelop from a single-story to a two-story, a single-story to a three-story or a three-and-a-half with the incentive.

840
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:12,113
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you in a minute why I'm not saying four necessarily.

841
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:15,856
[SPEAKER_14]: that might be more attractive for somebody to redevelop over time.

842
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:23,301
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason I'm not saying for is we've actually started to do some test diagrams.

843
01:18:23,321 --> 01:18:27,064
[SPEAKER_14]: We're kind of not happy with where they are, which is why you're not seeing them.

844
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:28,685
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm happy with the quality of it.

845
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:32,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not happy that it's showing what or it's coming to the result

846
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:47,982
[SPEAKER_14]: that I think we want to be able to show and part of that is your parking regulations are acting as a significant deterrent to development here so that on some of these parcels you'll see if

847
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:50,624
[SPEAKER_14]: It lets me zoom in.

848
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Will it let me do zoom in?

849
01:18:51,864 --> 01:18:52,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it will.

850
01:18:52,845 --> 01:19:01,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see that the parcels along Salem Street, because of the way the street curves, are irregular in shape, many of them.

851
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:06,632
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got some of these with these narrow openings and the longer depths.

852
01:19:06,672 --> 01:19:08,713
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got some that are quite shallow.

853
01:19:09,253 --> 01:19:12,535
[SPEAKER_14]: They are very difficult to park under your current regulations.

854
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:14,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So while we can get

855
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:20,919
[SPEAKER_14]: On the sites that we've tested, we can get to three, but only a few of them can we get to four.

856
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:29,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to keep that in mind that although I know it's a disappointment for some people to drop from six stories to four stories,

857
01:19:29,923 --> 01:19:35,724
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, it's not easy to achieve four stories here.

858
01:19:35,764 --> 01:19:37,664
[SPEAKER_14]: We have not tried to do a six story.

859
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:44,926
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think you would end up with a good portion of the lots being parking rather than building.

860
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:51,227
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think if you're thinking of development along the street, you're going to want more building along the street and less parking.

861
01:19:51,307 --> 01:19:54,168
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly don't want empty parking lots along the street.

862
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:56,268
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's part of the balance as well.

863
01:19:56,828 --> 01:20:00,090
[SPEAKER_14]: it's listening to the community, and then it's doing those tasks.

864
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:20,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And that task brings me to another point, and I think the previous speaker had, you know, made an excellent point when thinking about doing, whether it's shadow studies, or traffic studies, or infrastructure studies, is that zoning provides options to property owners, right?

865
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:25,944
[SPEAKER_14]: When you change zoning, you're giving them a new option, and it's up to them as to whether or not they exercise it.

866
01:20:26,464 --> 01:20:37,191
[SPEAKER_14]: We have done build out studies in the past before that show what would happen if every single parcel changed to the maximum available development.

867
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:38,872
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not realistic.

868
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:49,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And to come forward and say that every parcel would change to that maximum and then build your studies on top of it, and then have a policy of investing based on those studies,

869
01:20:50,799 --> 01:20:58,625
[SPEAKER_14]: knowing that the likelihood is that most of those parcels won't change as expected, I think that that's an unrealistic exercise to put the city through.

870
01:20:59,265 --> 01:21:15,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead, what is required, and it's an appropriate place to be required, is pretty much exactly what the previous speaker described, which is at a point at which a project that meets certain thresholds comes before the CD board, that's when those studies are created.

871
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:22,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that point, you have a real project with a real number of units or a real number of square footage for commercial.

872
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:33,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is possible to calculate studies that give a true picture of what the impact will be rather than a build out scenario that might not be.

873
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:41,815
[SPEAKER_14]: accurate ever, or if it is accurate, it's so far into the future, the study that's done has no real purpose.

874
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:51,863
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing I do want to say is I know there's some frustration from some of the people who have spoken about, you know, not getting as much density as hoped.

875
01:21:51,943 --> 01:21:59,970
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's one thing that I think is critically important, and we've talked a lot about residential uses, but not so much about the business uses.

876
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:09,616
[SPEAKER_14]: And for anybody who saw the presentation at the public meeting, the vast majority of businesses along Salem Street are in fact non-conforming.

877
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:17,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the big changes this would make is to allow most of those to become conforming, that allows the business owners to invest.

878
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:27,067
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did hear from quite a few people that they enjoyed having their neighborhood commercial, being able to walk to it, being able to patronize local businesses.

879
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:31,729
[SPEAKER_14]: those local businesses are from a zoning perspective, they're non-conforming.

880
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:45,077
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they had been pre-existing before the zoning came in, and what we're trying to do is to help them out, help them continue by allowing them, in many cases, as a right.

881
01:22:45,937 --> 01:22:47,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Not all of them, but in many cases.

882
01:22:47,558 --> 01:22:51,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's an important thing that we haven't talked about in terms of the zoning.

883
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:55,523
[SPEAKER_14]: And with that, Madam Chair, I'll yield the rest of this time.

884
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:58,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

885
01:22:58,393 --> 01:22:59,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Emily.

886
01:23:04,157 --> 01:23:06,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Next would be, in my experience, Michael Chong.

887
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:11,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael, you're going to get a request to unmute.

888
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:14,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

889
01:23:14,905 --> 01:23:14,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

890
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:30,376
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Michael Chan, address is 168 Willis Avenue.

891
01:23:31,277 --> 01:23:42,663
[SPEAKER_22]: I would like to echo actually my, I just found out my neighbor down the street, Erica's request to do a traffic report on this area.

892
01:23:42,843 --> 01:23:50,367
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm hearing a lot of the kind of, but before I get into it, highly support everything that's been done here.

893
01:23:50,387 --> 01:23:51,388
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds very thoughtful.

894
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:54,350
[SPEAKER_22]: I love the idea that there's the,

895
01:23:55,686 --> 01:24:02,651
[SPEAKER_22]: The goal here is to make it a much more welcoming and walkable and community unifying area.

896
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:14,318
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm hearing a lot of ideas and dreams of this area being somewhere where businesses and neighborhoods are kind of connected together through walkability.

897
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:21,803
[SPEAKER_22]: I am curious, though, given that there was a Medford resident who was killed on the western end of Salem Street,

898
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:28,893
[SPEAKER_22]: how much of this road will actually be incorporating traffic calming measures.

899
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:37,657
[SPEAKER_22]: Especially as a bicycle commuter, I do go through Salem Street every so often.

900
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:46,780
[SPEAKER_22]: I only go every so often because it is a very busy, tight road with a lot of large vehicles, in part because there are no other

901
01:24:48,838 --> 01:24:55,420
[SPEAKER_22]: byways of connecting that rotary to the area around Target.

902
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:15,686
[SPEAKER_22]: And so, yeah, I think there is a lot of components in what would create a, you know, I think there would be an effort to make this a street that is not becoming a highway.

903
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:22,401
[SPEAKER_22]: For cars, because of, uh, you know, reducing the density of.

904
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:28,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, homes, um, you know, making the parking garments such that, um.

905
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:34,218
[SPEAKER_22]: The oops, yeah, my time is up, but yes, yeah, so, um.

906
01:25:34,742 --> 01:25:53,186
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I understand that it's a very complex problem, but I would like to really highlight the need for making sure that this effort to develop this area is not undermined by the fact that there is traffic cutting right through the center of this corridor.

907
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:55,835
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Michael.

908
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:57,156
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate your comments.

909
01:25:57,976 --> 01:26:03,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to clarify, the zoning that we're looking at is really only regulating private land.

910
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:10,482
[SPEAKER_21]: So things like roads would not fall under the jurisdiction of this zoning change.

911
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:13,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paola, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.

912
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:18,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, go ahead.

913
01:26:19,646 --> 01:26:23,848
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to confirm that my understanding is correct and kind of reiterate it for the public.

914
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:25,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that is correct.

915
01:26:26,161 --> 01:26:29,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Traffic calm because this is a strictly zoning study.

916
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:31,724
[SPEAKER_14]: This is traffic calming measures are not part of that.

917
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:45,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just to clarify for people who aren't familiar, the city's right of way, which would include the sidewalks and the street does not fall under zoning.

918
01:26:45,048 --> 01:26:48,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Zoning, as you said earlier, Madam Chair, covers the private market.

919
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:54,930
[SPEAKER_14]: And in some limited cases, the non-municipal land.

920
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:56,710
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

921
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:03,732
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, Peter, who do we have next?

922
01:27:05,872 --> 01:27:08,513
[SPEAKER_25]: Next on my screen is Zachary Chertok.

923
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:12,754
[SPEAKER_25]: And Emily, just let me know if at any point you've realigned to the order.

924
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:14,234
[SPEAKER_21]: I am not aligned at all.

925
01:27:14,254 --> 01:27:15,195
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, gotcha.

926
01:27:18,277 --> 01:27:23,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Zoom's going to be getting a user feature request pretty soon.

927
01:27:23,344 --> 01:27:24,726
[SPEAKER_26]: Gotcha.

928
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:25,727
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

929
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:29,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Zach, you're going to be getting a request to unmute.

930
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

931
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:37,991
[SPEAKER_36]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almond Street, and I totally sympathize with the Zoom thing.

932
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:38,972
[SPEAKER_36]: I have to deal with it every day.

933
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:51,716
[SPEAKER_36]: Speaking as somebody who truly lives in this corridor and whose building is actually right in the middle of it geographically, first, they do appreciate the lower density changes made to the Park Street intersection and some of the scale back and height restrictions.

934
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:53,957
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a good show of active listening.

935
01:27:54,937 --> 01:28:00,081
[SPEAKER_36]: Second, I'll reiterate, as I always have, that zoning conformity is generally a good thing and taking steps towards it is a good thing.

936
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:02,622
[SPEAKER_36]: So the overall concept, fine.

937
01:28:03,623 --> 01:28:07,405
[SPEAKER_36]: But flipping the script, I do remain in demand of the proper existing condition studies.

938
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:08,987
[SPEAKER_36]: We're not talking about build-out studies.

939
01:28:09,447 --> 01:28:11,688
[SPEAKER_36]: We're talking about the existing conditions of the neighborhood.

940
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:22,496
[SPEAKER_36]: And as codified by the ASCE and American Planning Association, as somebody trained as an engineer, they specifically call for a list of existing condition studies that go into everything in planning efforts, including land use.

941
01:28:23,336 --> 01:28:27,617
[SPEAKER_36]: This community has repeatedly asked for those and has been denied them, so we're not talking about hypotheticals.

942
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:31,939
[SPEAKER_36]: We're talking about the conditions now to inform what is and what could be.

943
01:28:32,999 --> 01:28:39,461
[SPEAKER_36]: And consequently, without those, this process is still incongruous because we don't have a bellwether to truly measure what the possibilities are.

944
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:40,722
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like opening Pandora's box.

945
01:28:41,962 --> 01:28:47,684
[SPEAKER_36]: I'd also like to restate my concerns about the density buildup on the border with Malden, which I've raised multiple times.

946
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:53,907
[SPEAKER_36]: Creating a zoning imbalance is a recipe for future disasters in Congress with the neighboring city.

947
01:28:53,927 --> 01:29:01,390
[SPEAKER_36]: And while I echo many of the other community members on issues of affordable housing, Medford is not an island and can't address that issue by itself.

948
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:10,594
[SPEAKER_36]: Speculative measures on the market right now are the leading variable in housing stock that continues to push the target for housing unit needs in the greater Boston area, even as more housing gets built.

949
01:29:10,774 --> 01:29:12,035
[SPEAKER_36]: Every year that number goes up.

950
01:29:13,016 --> 01:29:21,540
[SPEAKER_36]: Consequently, as noted by Council President Bears at my own questioning during the last planning and permitting session, it's going to take a multi-factor regional approach to solving that issue.

951
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:25,482
[SPEAKER_36]: Zoning by itself will not do it, so we have to make sure we're in congress with the neighborhood.

952
01:29:26,951 --> 01:29:37,540
[SPEAKER_36]: As noted in the last planning board session before the City Council, I also question the lack of addressing the density valley between individual quarters that are being rezoned and to date that issue still hasn't sufficiently been addressed.

953
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:49,009
[SPEAKER_36]: The densest area in Medford here without transit access continues to be squeezed to be more dense planning on a section by section basis without presenting in the context of the wider urban fabric.

954
01:29:49,810 --> 01:30:01,535
[SPEAKER_36]: At that planning and permitting meeting, that was the first time I had seen a unified map, and it clearly showed that density was being added in the most dense sections while not being sufficiently increased around transit nodes.

955
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:04,816
[SPEAKER_21]: My apologies, we didn't start a timer.

956
01:30:04,856 --> 01:30:05,516
[SPEAKER_36]: No, that's all right.

957
01:30:05,556 --> 01:30:06,757
[SPEAKER_36]: This is literally the last.

958
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,077
[SPEAKER_36]: This is the last bullet.

959
01:30:08,438 --> 01:30:08,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

960
01:30:09,158 --> 01:30:13,039
[SPEAKER_36]: That it's just not being done around the transit nodes in direct access.

961
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:19,242
[SPEAKER_36]: So in terms of transit-oriented housing, despite promises of the City Council and the intent of this, that's not being accomplished here.

962
01:30:22,444 --> 01:30:22,744
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

963
01:30:23,345 --> 01:30:24,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your thoughtful comments, Zachary.

964
01:30:26,346 --> 01:30:27,447
[SPEAKER_21]: You've shown up to a lot of these.

965
01:30:27,507 --> 01:30:31,129
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate your continued advocacy for yourself and your neighbors in the community.

966
01:30:36,113 --> 01:30:37,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Next on the list is Penny Taylor.

967
01:30:40,495 --> 01:30:42,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Penny, you're going to get a request to unmute.

968
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:44,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

969
01:30:46,491 --> 01:30:47,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, thank you.

970
01:30:47,232 --> 01:30:49,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street.

971
01:30:49,794 --> 01:30:58,103
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thrilled the zoning process is happening and I've already written in favor of ensuring robust housing opportunities throughout to be sure that we use every tool in the box.

972
01:30:58,684 --> 01:31:08,694
[SPEAKER_20]: I am deeply concerned and actually still shaking with disbelief by and ask you to reject the new proposed changes to change any multi unit residential from 3 to 6 units to only 1 to 3 units.

973
01:31:09,635 --> 01:31:17,041
[SPEAKER_20]: This does not match our needs, values, nor jive with all the other work the city is doing to encourage affordable housing development and utilize incentives.

974
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:18,942
[SPEAKER_20]: We need more housing full stop.

975
01:31:19,282 --> 01:31:24,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Hampering that by not allowing creative and maximal uses at this critical opportunity is unacceptable.

976
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:33,271
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to express some deep concern in rejecting medical facilities when close to 30% of adults in the United States have some kind of disability.

977
01:31:33,691 --> 01:31:38,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Barriers to accessing housing and medical services should be taken down, not built in.

978
01:31:38,513 --> 01:31:43,655
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm so disappointed to see a solid yes to banks and no to medical offices.

979
01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:46,136
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that's a neighborhood that any of us really want to live in.

980
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:53,661
[SPEAKER_20]: I also just put in a pitch that we all need to seriously take the call to move away from fossil fuels in the very near future.

981
01:31:53,981 --> 01:31:56,223
[SPEAKER_20]: So I love if we can plan a city for people instead of cars.

982
01:31:56,303 --> 01:31:56,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

983
01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:00,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Penny.

984
01:32:00,506 --> 01:32:11,413
[SPEAKER_25]: The next person on the list is Cheryl R. Cheryl R, you're going to get a request to unmute.

985
01:32:11,433 --> 01:32:13,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

986
01:32:16,003 --> 01:32:20,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, so I live on the corridor.

987
01:32:21,029 --> 01:32:27,236
[SPEAKER_05]: These changes that we're seeing tonight showed that there was a complete lack of planning and studies involved in writing the zoning in the first place.

988
01:32:27,697 --> 01:32:33,944
[SPEAKER_05]: If residents had it alerted and educated themselves, then this would have passed easily with the initial zoning voted to you.

989
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighbors would have only found out when the first projects went up.

990
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:42,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We have still done none of the studies called for in the comprehensive plan that Ennis helped write.

991
01:32:42,548 --> 01:32:45,209
[SPEAKER_05]: These zoning changes are reactive rather than informed.

992
01:32:45,789 --> 01:32:55,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoning should not based on opinion and what people tell you that they like, especially from those who will not be impacted as the majority of those speaking in favor are not from this area.

993
01:32:56,113 --> 01:33:08,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no real definition for high frequency transit that allows 0.8 parking spaces and the parking minimums are set to be reduced in May and was actually mentioned by Emily as a factor that is limiting this density.

994
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So the neighborhood will be severely impacted if parking levels are lowered.

995
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:26,118
[SPEAKER_05]: along with this zoning and coupled with the neighborhood zoning that places us in the densest neighborhood zone in the city of three units on 3K lots will have a significant and immense impact on our area.

996
01:33:26,478 --> 01:33:43,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The 70% reduction in lot size to 3K that somehow isn't being mentioned, the doubling of the lot coverage to 80% will create the same planned mass and just two stories lower with the changes proposed suggested tonight in the area zone blue.

997
01:33:43,472 --> 01:33:51,375
[SPEAKER_05]: The step back is eliminated despite the fact that the new max height will be 54 feet up from 35 feet which is an increase of 63%.

998
01:33:53,876 --> 01:34:00,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Methadone clinics can still come to the neighborhood medical which only limits number of employees and the size of the center.

999
01:34:03,573 --> 01:34:09,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Residents have been pointing out that the marijuana uses are in the zoning since December.

1000
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:16,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really don't want to keep hearing the excuse that they're poor zoning and lack of type proofreading is a typo.

1001
01:34:16,947 --> 01:34:21,332
[SPEAKER_05]: If by version three, you haven't changed it, then you meant to be there.

1002
01:34:22,011 --> 01:34:23,393
[SPEAKER_05]: The incentives haven't changed.

1003
01:34:23,453 --> 01:34:24,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The lots are really small.

1004
01:34:25,015 --> 01:34:26,277
[SPEAKER_05]: All the waivers are in there.

1005
01:34:26,677 --> 01:34:32,224
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning should go back to the beginning and be studied, have community input, and then be written and adjusted.

1006
01:34:32,565 --> 01:34:35,388
[SPEAKER_05]: This type of rewrite this late in the process is alarming.

1007
01:34:35,488 --> 01:34:36,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right at the end.

1008
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:38,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1009
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:42,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So this type of rewrite this late in the process is really alarming.

1010
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:49,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And for Emily's comment, the research and testing lab is on page seven of the zoning that was presented for this evening.

1011
01:34:49,555 --> 01:34:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not typos.

1012
01:34:50,896 --> 01:34:53,637
[SPEAKER_05]: These are a lack of scrutiny and attention to detail.

1013
01:34:54,177 --> 01:34:54,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1014
01:34:55,877 --> 01:34:56,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1015
01:34:58,478 --> 01:34:59,518
[SPEAKER_21]: And just two quick notes.

1016
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:07,261
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe we're proposing to change anything related to parking around this Salem Street corridor rezoning.

1017
01:35:07,321 --> 01:35:07,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

1018
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:10,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Emily.

1019
01:35:11,566 --> 01:35:21,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you madam chair at this point, I do want to recognize that at this point there are no parking requirements proposed to be changed.

1020
01:35:22,496 --> 01:35:32,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It is true that we have been asked by city council to look at parking, that will be later this spring, but because we have not looked at it yet we don't actually know what the results of that would be.

1021
01:35:32,084 --> 01:35:35,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm not completely separate process.

1022
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:44,710
[SPEAKER_14]: That's that that's part of this process, but it is not something that we're talking about now I without having looked at it.

1023
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know which direction we would go in at this point.

1024
01:35:47,112 --> 01:35:50,435
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but at this point, they are unchanged.

1025
01:35:51,115 --> 01:35:59,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so further on, you know, as a separate topic if people want to get involved, you know, I would encourage them to reach out to.

1026
01:36:00,308 --> 01:36:03,433
[SPEAKER_21]: You know their their city representation, the planning department.

1027
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:11,023
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, we've heard your comments in terms of, you know, this stuff can be communicated better so I think there's a lot of lessons learned there as well.

1028
01:36:11,865 --> 01:36:14,929
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there's been some talk about like specific uses.

1029
01:36:16,172 --> 01:36:23,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I understood that, you know, specific uses like methadone clinics could not be specifically.

1030
01:36:23,756 --> 01:36:30,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Just not discriminated might not be the right word, but those could not specifically be called out as.

1031
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:35,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Disallowed uses is that correct?

1032
01:36:35,683 --> 01:36:36,483
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct.

1033
01:36:37,064 --> 01:36:39,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we're doing as much as we can to.

1034
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:47,828
[SPEAKER_21]: basically legally reduce the chance that a methadone clinic would locate.

1035
01:36:49,448 --> 01:36:55,432
[SPEAKER_14]: You are allowed to put restrictions on the conditions on the use, essentially.

1036
01:36:55,472 --> 01:37:00,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So in this case, it's hours of operations, number of employees, square footage.

1037
01:37:00,455 --> 01:37:09,101
[SPEAKER_14]: But you cannot disallow, if you are allowing medical uses in the area, you can't disallow that one, any one particular use.

1038
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:15,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is under the American, my understanding from our legal counsel is that is under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

1039
01:37:16,306 --> 01:37:18,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's some helpful context.

1040
01:37:21,464 --> 01:37:24,066
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Peter, do you have my next in line?

1041
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:26,888
[SPEAKER_25]: Next up is Miranda Briseño.

1042
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:29,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Miranda.

1043
01:37:30,031 --> 01:37:31,832
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute shortly.

1044
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:34,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1045
01:37:36,796 --> 01:37:37,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, can you hear me?

1046
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Miranda Briseño to Taylor Street.

1047
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, thank you for saying my last name correctly.

1048
01:37:45,919 --> 01:37:48,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a renter here for six and a half years.

1049
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I love living in Medford and I love calling it home.

1050
01:37:51,304 --> 01:38:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality, however, is that as a renter who's currently trying to find an apartment that meets my changing needs, I'm finding it extremely difficult to find a suitable place that will allow me to stay in this place that I love.

1051
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: To that end, I'm disappointed to see the multi-use residential drop down from three to six units to one to three.

1052
01:38:07,016 --> 01:38:16,425
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want Medford to be affordable and people to stay in Medford, we need to allow more housing to be built and implement other measures to ensure that rental and home prices stay affordable.

1053
01:38:16,925 --> 01:38:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: This also includes whether through zoning or another mechanism, removing parking requirements and minimums and supporting transit, pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure.

1054
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:38,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, limiting only specific businesses uses limits the city's ability to generate more tax revenue, particularly with relation to dispensaries and hotels.

1055
01:38:38,276 --> 01:38:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize that the siding of a dispensary is limited by the location of schools and other things, but dispensaries have unequivocally generated immense revenue for the Commonwealth and for the communities that have worked with cannabis companies to allow for their existence.

1056
01:38:51,377 --> 01:38:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: While they may not be appropriate on Salem Street, I implore this board and residents in the future to consider this as an important benefit of allowing more businesses to be allowed.

1057
01:38:59,621 --> 01:39:11,946
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are truly committed to climate resiliency on all fronts, one of those is creating truly mixed-use areas where people can go to the grocery store, eat a meal with their friends, go to the doctor, or receive substance abuse disorder treatment.

1058
01:39:12,386 --> 01:39:16,348
[SPEAKER_02]: When we force these uses to be so far away from each other, we are forcing our neighbors to rely on cars,

1059
01:39:17,028 --> 01:39:23,153
[SPEAKER_02]: or if they have no access to a car, to simply go without access to necessary destinations, which will be detrimental and fatal.

1060
01:39:23,673 --> 01:39:32,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to see more opportunities for housing to be built with less parking allowed, more medical offices and more businesses to come to Medford in future zoning proposals for areas across Medford.

1061
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, thank you to the Board and to Inez Associates.

1062
01:39:36,263 --> 01:39:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this work is not easy and I thank you all for the work that you do.

1063
01:39:41,007 --> 01:39:44,851
[SPEAKER_21]: And likewise, we thank you, Miranda, for showing up, providing comment and feedback.

1064
01:39:45,471 --> 01:39:50,316
[SPEAKER_21]: And as a fellow renter, yeah, I empathize with you.

1065
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,262
[SPEAKER_15]: The next name is Roberta Cameron.

1066
01:39:58,803 --> 01:40:02,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Roberta, you are going to get a request to unmute.

1067
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1068
01:40:07,497 --> 01:40:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, this is Roberta Cameron.

1069
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:12,679
[SPEAKER_07]: My address is 12 North Street.

1070
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:28,064
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to thank you all for the process that you have gone through to develop this draft zoning and the community discussion that's happened up to now.

1071
01:40:28,905 --> 01:40:33,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I am strongly in favor of zoning that is going to

1072
01:40:35,587 --> 01:40:53,878
[SPEAKER_07]: bring the city into the 21st century and enable more housing development and more opportunity for investment in properties by making more of the uses that we're accustomed to living around be allowable by

1073
01:40:56,659 --> 01:41:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Under the current zoning and I echo a lot of what some of the people have said on this call earlier and that I'd like to see more.

1074
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:13,477
[SPEAKER_07]: more opportunities for housing development.

1075
01:41:13,837 --> 01:41:35,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And I support the zoning as it is, but I would love to see some of the proposed density, which is really appropriately a step above what is there now be included in the zoning that's proposed.

1076
01:41:36,129 --> 01:41:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1077
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1078
01:41:39,131 --> 01:41:39,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Roberta.

1079
01:41:41,069 --> 01:41:44,934
[SPEAKER_15]: The next person is Chris Briota.

1080
01:41:44,954 --> 01:41:46,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1081
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Chris, please state your name and address for the record.

1082
01:41:52,013 --> 01:41:52,173
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure.

1083
01:41:52,193 --> 01:41:53,153
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Chris.

1084
01:41:53,193 --> 01:41:55,434
[SPEAKER_29]: I live at 20 Mystic River Road in Medford.

1085
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:59,315
[SPEAKER_29]: I originally came here to say that I've been in favor of upzoning.

1086
01:41:59,715 --> 01:42:04,877
[SPEAKER_29]: Like a lot of the other callers, I'm disappointed in how watered down this plan has become.

1087
01:42:04,897 --> 01:42:09,759
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand it was due to public comment, which is unfortunate.

1088
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:13,700
[SPEAKER_29]: So I guess I'm here to speak in favor of what had been and what can be

1089
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,883
[SPEAKER_29]: resurrected in this project.

1090
01:42:18,484 --> 01:42:23,612
[SPEAKER_29]: We need housing and we need public transit in this city and across the region and that means density.

1091
01:42:24,393 --> 01:42:31,003
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition to that Medford's been getting by on an austerity budget for way too long, earnest up zoning that brings that density

1092
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:37,648
[SPEAKER_29]: and everything that comes with it will help bring in new property tax, make it easier for commercial property to amplify those funds.

1093
01:42:38,669 --> 01:42:49,057
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll add that if our parking minimums are getting in the way of these goals, then I'd urge this board to do what it needs to do to get those reconsidered at some point in the future.

1094
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:49,498
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1095
01:42:51,459 --> 01:42:51,940
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Chris.

1096
01:42:53,871 --> 01:43:00,116
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, we're seeing some interesting approaches to parking minimums in area communities.

1097
01:43:00,196 --> 01:43:10,025
[SPEAKER_21]: So those may provide interesting case studies for us, recognizing that Medford is not Somerville, Medford is not Cambridge, but we can learn from what's happening with our neighbors.

1098
01:43:12,107 --> 01:43:12,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's next?

1099
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:16,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Next is Ken Garrow.

1100
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:19,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Ken, please state your name and address for the record.

1101
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:20,878
[SPEAKER_34]: evening.

1102
01:43:20,938 --> 01:43:23,820
[SPEAKER_34]: Ken Yarrow, 52 Lambert Street, apartment 3.

1103
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,741
[SPEAKER_34]: Also a resident of the corridor.

1104
01:43:27,861 --> 01:43:30,402
[SPEAKER_34]: I can see Salem Street from my living room window.

1105
01:43:31,243 --> 01:43:33,084
[SPEAKER_34]: Got a wonderful view of the Target.

1106
01:43:34,464 --> 01:43:38,766
[SPEAKER_34]: By and large, I do truly support the majority of these changes.

1107
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:40,587
[SPEAKER_34]: I've been paying attention for

1108
01:43:41,667 --> 01:44:00,379
[SPEAKER_34]: but several weeks now mostly sending emails and kind of having external chats went to the roberts event considering the amount of aggression that was at that event i think emily you've done a fantastic job listening and digesting a lot of the commentary that was given there

1109
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:06,472
[SPEAKER_34]: I, while I was at that event, I actually kept quiet.

1110
01:44:06,612 --> 01:44:09,934
[SPEAKER_34]: I am pro clinics happening in the area.

1111
01:44:10,134 --> 01:44:12,755
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not that old.

1112
01:44:13,276 --> 01:44:20,780
[SPEAKER_34]: I can foresee a future where I would much rather be able to walk down the street to any of these places.

1113
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,702
[SPEAKER_34]: I would be happy that it's being kept in MX2.

1114
01:44:24,722 --> 01:44:27,184
[SPEAKER_34]: That's basically exactly where I live at the moment.

1115
01:44:29,845 --> 01:44:35,749
[SPEAKER_34]: I understand people's concerns about the methadone clinic, and I understand the city's concern about legal problems.

1116
01:44:37,391 --> 01:44:45,737
[SPEAKER_34]: I think one way to combat that would maybe slightly tweak the hours of the definition from 8 a.m.

1117
01:44:45,817 --> 01:44:47,218
[SPEAKER_34]: to 9 a.m.

1118
01:44:47,678 --> 01:44:54,103
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that, given what I understand of how clinics operate, would help assuage some of the population.

1119
01:44:56,705 --> 01:45:03,329
[SPEAKER_34]: In general, I just also want to say really quickly, was hoping that maybe we could reduce the size of the sidewalks.

1120
01:45:03,429 --> 01:45:04,350
[SPEAKER_34]: I love walkability.

1121
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:06,131
[SPEAKER_34]: I walked to the square earlier today.

1122
01:45:06,151 --> 01:45:10,074
[SPEAKER_34]: 12 feet seems a little massive in my opinion.

1123
01:45:10,374 --> 01:45:15,557
[SPEAKER_34]: If we could shrink it down to something more like 8 feet for right away, I think that would be nice for permeability.

1124
01:45:17,618 --> 01:45:24,239
[SPEAKER_34]: I would love the incentives to be a percentage of the lot minimum instead of a flat value.

1125
01:45:24,339 --> 01:45:26,340
[SPEAKER_34]: Currently, it's at 300 square feet.

1126
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,661
[SPEAKER_34]: Also, I have to say that I live in, again, one of the triple-deckers.

1127
01:45:31,841 --> 01:45:36,502
[SPEAKER_34]: It is a 3,200 square foot lot with three units.

1128
01:45:37,942 --> 01:45:41,123
[SPEAKER_34]: I have never had better community while living in this

1129
01:45:42,103 --> 01:45:44,044
[SPEAKER_34]: situation and I've lived in West Medford.

1130
01:45:44,064 --> 01:45:55,709
[SPEAKER_34]: I've lived just south of the square and here for five years so it's I understand why some people are weirded out by it but personally I love it and I look forward to living here for several more years.

1131
01:45:58,818 --> 01:45:59,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ken.

1132
01:45:59,498 --> 01:46:02,639
[SPEAKER_21]: And thanks for sharing your lived experience in terms of the lot size and the units.

1133
01:46:02,699 --> 01:46:04,239
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's helpful context.

1134
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:08,000
[SPEAKER_21]: We all see triple deckers all throughout the area.

1135
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:14,601
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's helpful to realize that that may align with some of the changes that are being proposed now.

1136
01:46:17,642 --> 01:46:18,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Next is Caitlin.

1137
01:46:20,182 --> 01:46:20,743
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Caitlin.

1138
01:46:20,843 --> 01:46:22,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1139
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Caitlin Robinson at 31 Everett Street.

1140
01:46:27,342 --> 01:46:34,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And first of all, I want to say thank you to this board and to Enos Associates for all the thoughtfulness and work that's been going into this.

1141
01:46:35,066 --> 01:46:42,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a resident of this neighborhood, and it's precisely for that reason that I am in support of rezoning and densification.

1142
01:46:43,824 --> 01:46:55,673
[SPEAKER_04]: The current built environment here, with gas stations, automotive service, drive-thrus, service parking lots, doesn't really send the message that this is a neighborhood, but rather a place to drive through.

1143
01:46:55,693 --> 01:47:04,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm in support of zoning that will make this feel more like a neighborhood with more neighbors, more businesses, increased walkability.

1144
01:47:04,799 --> 01:47:12,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a parent, and my child is too young right now, but when they are ready to leave the house,

1145
01:47:13,065 --> 01:47:15,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want them to be forced out of their community.

1146
01:47:16,106 --> 01:47:16,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more housing.

1147
01:47:19,247 --> 01:47:32,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have concern about the parking minimums, both because of the negative impacts on the ability to increase density and because of the impacts that it has on price.

1148
01:47:34,815 --> 01:47:39,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that we can look at eliminating those parking minimums.

1149
01:47:39,718 --> 01:47:43,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in support of the city regulating public parking.

1150
01:47:44,741 --> 01:47:53,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But if my family needs access to a bus and we want to live somewhere where there's a bus and we don't need empty parking spaces, the city shouldn't be forcing us to have those.

1151
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:57,568
[SPEAKER_04]: People who have cars have many more options for where to live.

1152
01:47:57,788 --> 01:48:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would like to see us have the options of having housing where people can make

1153
01:48:05,052 --> 01:48:05,713
[SPEAKER_04]: for themselves.

1154
01:48:06,233 --> 01:48:11,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, am disappointed about the rollback in density in tonight's proposal.

1155
01:48:12,318 --> 01:48:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather see at least a minimum of four feet being allowed, sorry, four stories throughout the Salem Street corridor.

1156
01:48:22,666 --> 01:48:25,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope we can look at having more density.

1157
01:48:26,129 --> 01:48:26,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1158
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:28,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Caitlin.

1159
01:48:32,354 --> 01:48:33,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Next speaker is

1160
01:48:34,202 --> 01:48:34,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave McKenna.

1161
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:48,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to quickly reiterate, we're not revisiting parking minimums this evening, but Caitlin, I do appreciate your comments and we'll keep them in mind when that topic comes up.

1162
01:48:48,186 --> 01:48:54,608
[SPEAKER_21]: And I encourage you to come back and provide more comment when we do talk about parking minimums.

1163
01:48:56,208 --> 01:48:59,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Dave McKenna, that's who's next?

1164
01:48:59,989 --> 01:49:00,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1165
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:02,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1166
01:49:03,895 --> 01:49:07,836
[SPEAKER_38]: David McKenna to Vine Street, also in the neighborhood.

1167
01:49:09,356 --> 01:49:12,696
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm also, like several other commenters, very disappointed.

1168
01:49:13,137 --> 01:49:16,097
[SPEAKER_38]: I was a big supporter of the proposal in January.

1169
01:49:16,117 --> 01:49:21,918
[SPEAKER_38]: I thought it was a very moderate increase in density in the neighborhood.

1170
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:25,539
[SPEAKER_38]: And so I understand there was a lot of comments.

1171
01:49:25,639 --> 01:49:26,859
[SPEAKER_38]: I was at the February meeting.

1172
01:49:27,099 --> 01:49:30,760
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the comments at the February meeting were not representative of the community.

1173
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,260
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'll send an email to explain why that was.

1174
01:49:34,242 --> 01:49:44,109
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, you know, one thing that we've heard tonight is the, uh, the residential really needs to be increased back up to three to six units.

1175
01:49:45,029 --> 01:49:48,312
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, that does not add any height that, you know, some people are concerned about heights.

1176
01:49:49,092 --> 01:49:57,478
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, that's just, if the lot allows, then that allows flexibility to the developer to add more, more apartments because we desperately need more house.

1177
01:49:57,578 --> 01:49:57,698
[SPEAKER_38]: So.

1178
01:49:58,682 --> 01:50:00,322
[SPEAKER_38]: I support the medical uses.

1179
01:50:01,222 --> 01:50:08,544
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, I understand the compromise that was reached, and so I support that compromise to allow the medical, you know, where the target is basically.

1180
01:50:10,124 --> 01:50:20,406
[SPEAKER_38]: On traffic, you know, there's been a lot of concerns voiced about traffic, but the 101 bus is doubling in service on commuting times and quadrupling in service on the weekends.

1181
01:50:20,526 --> 01:50:21,106
[SPEAKER_38]: That's coming.

1182
01:50:21,386 --> 01:50:22,886
[SPEAKER_38]: The MBTA has planned that.

1183
01:50:23,486 --> 01:50:27,687
[SPEAKER_38]: It's also being rerouted so that it hits the Orange Line, Green Line, and Red Line.

1184
01:50:28,432 --> 01:50:33,215
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's gonna be a dramatic increase in transit access in this neighborhood in the next five years.

1185
01:50:33,776 --> 01:50:36,077
[SPEAKER_38]: And so our zoning should take that into account.

1186
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:49,807
[SPEAKER_38]: Furthermore, any development of any significant size is gonna have to do traffic studies and pay traffic impact fees, pay sewer impact fees, and soon they'll have to pay affordable housing impact fees.

1187
01:50:50,507 --> 01:50:56,251
[SPEAKER_38]: So those fees can help other measures that will reduce traffic, improve the streetscape,

1188
01:50:58,153 --> 01:51:03,857
[SPEAKER_38]: you know, one idea would be, uh, some of this new tax revenue that's coming in, we could really expand the school buses right now.

1189
01:51:03,877 --> 01:51:07,160
[SPEAKER_38]: Most, most families in Medford are not served by the school buses.

1190
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:12,143
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, all the families in our neighborhood are too close to the schools allegedly to get the school bus.

1191
01:51:12,764 --> 01:51:18,008
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, and so, uh, I think these concerns can be addressed.

1192
01:51:18,628 --> 01:51:25,974
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, and the last thing I'll say is, um, on the Heights, there's already buildings in the neighborhood that are taller than these Heights that are being proposed.

1193
01:51:26,034 --> 01:51:26,174
[SPEAKER_38]: So,

1194
01:51:26,632 --> 01:51:35,842
[SPEAKER_38]: I understand people get scared about proposed heights, but there's already apartments on the corner of Salem and Fells Way that are taller than any of these proposals.

1195
01:51:36,542 --> 01:51:40,627
[SPEAKER_38]: The Franklin School on Central Ave.

1196
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:48,595
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, the Franklin School on Central Ave., the Swan School on Park Street are already taller than a lot of these.

1197
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:52,222
[SPEAKER_38]: proposals, and so people get nervous about the heights.

1198
01:51:52,862 --> 01:51:53,663
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm so sorry, Dave.

1199
01:51:53,683 --> 01:51:55,104
[SPEAKER_21]: You've gone 45 seconds over.

1200
01:51:55,124 --> 01:51:58,806
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have additional comments, I'd encourage you to send them to the board.

1201
01:51:59,367 --> 01:52:02,569
[SPEAKER_21]: But just in fairness for the rest of the public, we're going to move on.

1202
01:52:03,129 --> 01:52:05,311
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do appreciate you coming, you sharing your input.

1203
01:52:07,472 --> 01:52:08,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Keep coming back.

1204
01:52:09,794 --> 01:52:10,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's next, Danielle?

1205
01:52:12,295 --> 01:52:13,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Tara Shankar.

1206
01:52:13,436 --> 01:52:15,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Tara.

1207
01:52:15,878 --> 01:52:17,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1208
01:52:19,332 --> 01:52:19,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1209
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:21,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

1210
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:21,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1211
01:52:22,414 --> 01:52:22,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1212
01:52:23,295 --> 01:52:24,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Tara Shanker.

1213
01:52:24,396 --> 01:52:31,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 397 High Street, right in the heart of West Medford, and I can't wait for the zoning regulations to come here.

1214
01:52:31,922 --> 01:52:41,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I am strongly in support of densification and strongly in support of what was the original intent on Salem Street.

1215
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:54,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to agree with many of the other callers that I am disappointed that the MR1 was walked back from three to six units to one to three, assuming greater bus service by the 101.

1216
01:52:54,556 --> 01:53:08,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also would love if the parking regulations would be reviewed from 1.5 to two spaces per unit for studios and one bedrooms that would be in a three to six

1217
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:15,348
[SPEAKER_11]: type of building having one and a half to two spaces is ridiculous.

1218
01:53:16,509 --> 01:53:31,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And people should be able to, it could be incentivized through electric bike or car rental access within the building or nearby, but there could be several different kinds of incentives that could be proposed.

1219
01:53:32,082 --> 01:53:33,002
[SPEAKER_11]: to make that happen.

1220
01:53:33,763 --> 01:53:43,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also really in favor and delighted to see that it remains the co-housing and congregate housing options are still in the measure, happy to see that.

1221
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:56,112
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of medical buildings over here in West Medford right next to me, so and that's across from the elementary school, the Brooks

1222
01:53:56,947 --> 01:54:00,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess that's already permitted for us.

1223
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:04,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And the methadone clinics, I suppose, could be here if they chose to locate, but they haven't.

1224
01:54:08,974 --> 01:54:14,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm delighted that the commercial uses that have been non-conforming are being made conforming.

1225
01:54:14,578 --> 01:54:18,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a big supporter of the Greb Cafe and the Bubble Tea Place.

1226
01:54:19,241 --> 01:54:19,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

1227
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:26,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see that the service stations and gas stations are not permitted.

1228
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't certain if that was the case.

1229
01:54:31,023 --> 01:54:34,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to the board and to Innes Associates.

1230
01:54:35,406 --> 01:54:38,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to you for providing your comments and your feedback.

1231
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:43,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Next is Patricia Ciappelli.

1232
01:54:44,312 --> 01:54:48,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Patricia, please state your name and address for the record.

1233
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:53,632
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Patricia Chappelle, 53 Garfield Avenue.

1234
01:54:53,652 --> 01:54:58,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So it seems like we've missed a lot of the process.

1235
01:54:58,733 --> 01:55:02,235
[SPEAKER_10]: One community meeting does not a community outreach make.

1236
01:55:02,575 --> 01:55:13,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the fact that you've walked back so much of the units because this is already according to the GIS map and environmental justice neighborhood.

1237
01:55:13,839 --> 01:55:16,360
[SPEAKER_10]: The map already has us in a very hot,

1238
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,661
[SPEAKER_10]: dense zone.

1239
01:55:17,821 --> 01:55:19,483
[SPEAKER_10]: It's mostly yellow and red.

1240
01:55:19,623 --> 01:55:31,594
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at that GIS map, we have 980 residents that are against and have signed a petition not to move forward with the Salem zoning the way that it was.

1241
01:55:32,254 --> 01:55:36,378
[SPEAKER_10]: There still is a lot of work that needs to be done, but I appreciate what you've done.

1242
01:55:37,018 --> 01:55:45,523
[SPEAKER_10]: However, until there's, I agree that some of the other density needs to be taking place, but let's try it in other areas of Medford.

1243
01:55:46,003 --> 01:55:48,624
[SPEAKER_10]: This is already a death trap for walking.

1244
01:55:48,644 --> 01:55:51,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I have lived here since 2013 and there have been three deaths.

1245
01:55:54,207 --> 01:55:58,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Salem Street is one of the hottest corridors for walking.

1246
01:55:58,070 --> 01:56:03,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So if people think they're going to go out there and walk and not take their life in their hands, guess again.

1247
01:56:03,535 --> 01:56:11,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have been with one of those people that died on a Saturday night because I heard the accident and I came off my porch to go help the lady.

1248
01:56:11,702 --> 01:56:14,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It was horrible, and we just had another one the other night.

1249
01:56:14,864 --> 01:56:17,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So you need to do some research.

1250
01:56:17,305 --> 01:56:26,090
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to understand what the traffic is that goes up and down this, and you need to follow the comprehensive plan that you've set for the city already in place.

1251
01:56:27,051 --> 01:56:34,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you're going to have 980 very upset homeowners, taxpayers, and voters.

1252
01:56:35,236 --> 01:56:35,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1253
01:56:37,177 --> 01:56:37,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Patricia.

1254
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:39,498
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the input.

1255
01:56:42,572 --> 01:56:43,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Next is Rebecca.

1256
01:56:44,659 --> 01:56:46,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Rebecca, please state your name and address for the record.

1257
01:56:47,536 --> 01:56:50,397
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Rebecca Davidson, 26 Farragut Ave.

1258
01:56:51,217 --> 01:56:58,039
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a resident of this neighborhood, the Salem Street neighborhood, and have been raising my family here for the last few years.

1259
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:01,999
[SPEAKER_23]: I also grew up in Medford, and I love this neighborhood.

1260
01:57:02,099 --> 01:57:09,141
[SPEAKER_23]: And what I love most about it is my ability to walk to so many great businesses, hair salons, restaurants, and others.

1261
01:57:09,261 --> 01:57:12,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Walkability is good for health, safety, and the environment.

1262
01:57:12,842 --> 01:57:16,583
[SPEAKER_23]: And as previous speakers have said, we need to shift our habits like yesterday.

1263
01:57:16,943 --> 01:57:18,264
[SPEAKER_23]: to tackle the climate crisis.

1264
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:24,889
[SPEAKER_23]: Zoning changes like this are so important in this neighborhood, especially since this is an environmental justice community.

1265
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:29,993
[SPEAKER_23]: For example, having walkable, close access to healthy food is really important.

1266
01:57:30,053 --> 01:57:36,679
[SPEAKER_23]: And a small grocery store or other healthy food outlet would be a great addition, which wouldn't be allowable without these changes.

1267
01:57:37,499 --> 01:57:41,342
[SPEAKER_23]: When we moved here, I did some research to learn about the history of this incredible neighborhood.

1268
01:57:42,263 --> 01:57:48,586
[SPEAKER_23]: In many ways, it was built with public transit in mind, as well as a tram station that used to exist on Washington Street.

1269
01:57:49,067 --> 01:57:54,429
[SPEAKER_23]: At that time, there was a diversity of businesses that allowed people to not have to travel far to meet many of their needs.

1270
01:57:54,850 --> 01:58:10,718
[SPEAKER_23]: We've moved towards a more car-dominated environment, and since then, and while I feel this proposal helps us move closer to the framework that created this great neighborhood than the previous version, it doesn't go anywhere near where we need to be to address our serious housing shortage.

1271
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:16,323
[SPEAKER_23]: It's too expensive to buy a home or rent a home, and the only way to address that is to build more homes.

1272
01:58:16,863 --> 01:58:21,027
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really disappointing that our parking minimums get in the way of our housing goals.

1273
01:58:21,568 --> 01:58:24,991
[SPEAKER_23]: I realize and share the traffic and safety concerns that have been raised.

1274
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:28,054
[SPEAKER_23]: These are not mutually exclusive with zoning changes.

1275
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:34,259
[SPEAKER_23]: We can have a thriving neighborhood and safe streets, and I'm advocating for that and hope my neighbors join me.

1276
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:37,941
[SPEAKER_23]: in advocating for better crosswalks and safer streets.

1277
01:58:38,441 --> 01:58:41,462
[SPEAKER_23]: That's important now, but it's separate from this zoning proposal.

1278
01:58:41,863 --> 01:58:47,465
[SPEAKER_23]: Hopefully, that's something good that comes from this process, is more community advocacy in this area.

1279
01:58:47,745 --> 01:58:51,806
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a group, Walk Medford, that specifically is working on this that we can all support.

1280
01:58:52,346 --> 01:59:04,611
[SPEAKER_23]: After being at the Roberts School session, I feel that a lot of the concerns that were raised have been addressed, but feel this proposal has shifted too far away from our goals of allowing more housing to be built to meet the needs of people in our community.

1281
01:59:06,627 --> 01:59:06,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1282
01:59:08,428 --> 01:59:09,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Rebecca.

1283
01:59:16,411 --> 01:59:18,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I lost my participant list.

1284
01:59:20,773 --> 01:59:24,574
[SPEAKER_15]: The next person is Yuko Okabe.

1285
01:59:25,975 --> 01:59:27,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Yuko, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1286
01:59:28,556 --> 01:59:30,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1287
01:59:31,997 --> 01:59:33,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Yuko Okabe.

1288
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:38,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a resident of 55 Winchester Street, apartment two.

1289
01:59:38,845 --> 01:59:49,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to say that I am in support of updating the zoning, and I'm speaking from affordability for Medford as a whole as far as also economic

1290
01:59:49,496 --> 01:59:50,297
[SPEAKER_01]: growth as well.

1291
01:59:51,318 --> 01:59:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: New zoning allows new housing and it's an important step to solve the housing crisis and increase the supply of affordable housing.

1292
01:59:57,886 --> 02:00:08,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I live with my partner in South Medford, our rent has been steadily going up for the past five years and we're looking forward to having those zoning conversations in South Medford as well.

1293
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:17,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Like others, I'm disappointed to hear the parking minimums and public comments have limited the amount of units in the neighborhood.

1294
02:00:17,687 --> 02:00:22,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I regret that I wasn't part of earlier discussions and the last public hearing to advocate for more density.

1295
02:00:23,612 --> 02:00:36,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that solving the housing crisis and building more affordable housing on a large scale starts from influencing our own neighborhood structure and building a community that supports our most basic rights of housing and security and supports our most vulnerable populations.

1296
02:00:37,723 --> 02:00:45,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I support how the zoning supports the current local businesses and allows them to thrive and also supports new businesses to come in.

1297
02:00:46,888 --> 02:00:55,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will then increase economic development in the city, I echo that I am also disappointed that banks have been prioritized over medical offices.

1298
02:00:56,853 --> 02:01:06,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the 15-minute city where medical offices, parks, schools, my home, groceries, et cetera, are within that 15-minute commute.

1299
02:01:06,375 --> 02:01:09,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see this as a public transit user and avid walker.

1300
02:01:09,515 --> 02:01:10,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the 101 bus.

1301
02:01:10,816 --> 02:01:11,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

1302
02:01:11,316 --> 02:01:12,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me to all the places I like.

1303
02:01:14,156 --> 02:01:22,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And to conclude, just want to thank the city and associates and the community members on this call for advocating on behalf of their communities.

1304
02:01:22,578 --> 02:01:22,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1305
02:01:24,567 --> 02:01:25,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Yuko.

1306
02:01:25,227 --> 02:01:26,328
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you coming out.

1307
02:01:30,631 --> 02:01:36,254
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you may have aligned, Danielle, if you want to take it back.

1308
02:01:36,815 --> 02:01:37,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1309
02:01:37,355 --> 02:01:40,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Marshall, please state your name and address for the record.

1310
02:01:40,977 --> 02:01:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hi.

1311
02:01:41,898 --> 02:01:42,919
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Marshall Brown.

1312
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:45,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out of 589 Riverside.

1313
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:49,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really lived in Medford long, probably been renting a little bit over a year.

1314
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,234
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that I did notice, I don't own a car, I can't drive.

1315
02:01:56,556 --> 02:02:00,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, you know, like Medford's a good place to live for that.

1316
02:02:02,377 --> 02:02:14,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find that just places that have a lot of businesses and density and things to do are much more friendly for people who walk everywhere.

1317
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:21,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And so places like Salem Street that have like a lot of vibrant local businesses, there's honestly too many to name.

1318
02:02:24,203 --> 02:02:25,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the businesses by like Medford

1319
02:02:26,984 --> 02:02:28,247
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of alongside that corridor.

1320
02:02:28,828 --> 02:02:32,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find it really awful that it's kind of...

1321
02:02:34,175 --> 02:02:37,338
[SPEAKER_09]: flooded with traffic, really dangerous to walk.

1322
02:02:38,459 --> 02:02:50,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's strange not to consider the zoning in tandem with parking requirements, because that's super important to the urban landscape.

1323
02:02:50,888 --> 02:02:54,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the restriction on medical offices.

1324
02:02:55,992 --> 02:03:02,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand the concern with that, but I find that a lot of community members keep bringing up

1325
02:03:04,095 --> 02:03:05,417
[SPEAKER_09]: like methadone clinics.

1326
02:03:06,799 --> 02:03:14,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like that is a much bigger concern for people than having equitable access to health care.

1327
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:23,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I found that it is hard to find a medical practitioner already, especially if you are mobility restricted.

1328
02:03:23,176 --> 02:03:32,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it'd be really nice to offer medical options for people who live in the area who would like easy access to that care.

1329
02:03:33,585 --> 02:03:39,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So I personally really don't like the emphasis on blocking that.

1330
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:41,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, thank you so much.

1331
02:03:41,771 --> 02:03:43,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I do appreciate a lot of the zoning changes.

1332
02:03:45,793 --> 02:04:02,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Marshall appreciate you coming out and just to quickly check in on the medical office thing and Emily and pal if you can help me confirm it, I believe there are some medical uses that are permitted via community development board special permit is that correct.

1333
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:12,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Madam Chair, so the neighborhood medical office is permitted for a special permit in the commercial and the MX2 district.

1334
02:04:12,395 --> 02:04:13,636
[SPEAKER_14]: It was removed from MX1.

1335
02:04:13,656 --> 02:04:28,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so similar to other special permit applications that we would consider, we would look at the benefits, we'd look at the downsides, and then we'd make a decision based on our kind of mandate as a development board.

1336
02:04:29,728 --> 02:04:32,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, the special permit criteria that you have for those.

1337
02:04:32,689 --> 02:04:33,729
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1338
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:35,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1339
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:35,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1340
02:04:40,231 --> 02:04:43,952
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have is JMN.

1341
02:04:44,413 --> 02:04:46,113
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1342
02:04:46,473 --> 02:04:48,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1343
02:05:03,757 --> 02:05:08,865
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not getting a response from JMN, so I'm going to move on to the next speaker and come back.

1344
02:05:09,626 --> 02:05:10,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael Dewberry.

1345
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:14,453
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1346
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:16,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1347
02:05:16,095 --> 02:05:17,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everybody.

1348
02:05:17,897 --> 02:05:19,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael Dewberry, 50 Park Street.

1349
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:21,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1350
02:05:21,656 --> 02:05:22,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a lot of great comments already.

1351
02:05:22,757 --> 02:05:24,858
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to focus on new things.

1352
02:05:26,459 --> 02:05:37,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, overall, positive about the overall citywide zoning revamp, positive about the initial stab at the corridor.

1353
02:05:37,047 --> 02:05:42,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do appreciate the changes, like you're taking on community feedback.

1354
02:05:42,290 --> 02:05:44,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you did a good job of

1355
02:05:45,452 --> 02:05:45,912
[SPEAKER_12]: adjusting.

1356
02:05:47,073 --> 02:05:51,034
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not, this is my first public meeting I've attended in person.

1357
02:05:51,174 --> 02:05:52,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I have been following the discussion online.

1358
02:05:55,035 --> 02:06:00,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I live about a block, a long block and a half from Salem Street, so I'm a user of the corridor.

1359
02:06:00,576 --> 02:06:05,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I am sensitive to the fact that I'm not impacted in the same way that people who live directly in Salem Street are.

1360
02:06:06,398 --> 02:06:16,761
[SPEAKER_12]: But overall, yeah, my sort of interest is, you know, I walk to the dentist, I walk to get a sandwich, walk to get coffee at the bike store, which is kind of weird.

1361
02:06:18,802 --> 02:06:20,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm also an all-mode user.

1362
02:06:21,563 --> 02:06:22,143
[SPEAKER_12]: We do exist.

1363
02:06:22,223 --> 02:06:24,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I do take the bus and bike and drive as well.

1364
02:06:24,304 --> 02:06:28,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to do more of the biking and busing and less of the driving.

1365
02:06:29,405 --> 02:06:30,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited about changes to the 101.

1366
02:06:32,666 --> 02:06:33,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, so comments on

1367
02:06:36,707 --> 02:06:44,129
[SPEAKER_12]: From that perspective, I do feel like there's been an overcorrection in the density, especially around the Park and Salem Street intersection.

1368
02:06:44,149 --> 02:06:57,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I think by removing things from MX-1 and dropping from MX-2 to MX-1, it's been a pretty rapid drop in possibilities for that intersection, which does have a couple of empty lots.

1369
02:06:58,052 --> 02:06:59,732
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably going to develop pretty quickly.

1370
02:07:00,937 --> 02:07:06,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see more restaurants, entertainment options, food, groceries.

1371
02:07:08,305 --> 02:07:11,087
[SPEAKER_12]: On medical – oh, gosh, I'm going to run out of time.

1372
02:07:12,279 --> 02:07:13,880
[SPEAKER_12]: My issue with medical, like I am pro-medical.

1373
02:07:14,321 --> 02:07:18,684
[SPEAKER_12]: My issue is that like we see in Medford Square, there's too much medical with no street engagement.

1374
02:07:19,205 --> 02:07:34,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to see maybe some ideas around, can we push out of the second floor, push it to the back of the building and not off the streets to have more concrete and enforceable rules about street engagement to keep the area vibrant.

1375
02:07:36,598 --> 02:07:37,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will save the rest of my comments for next time.

1376
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:38,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1377
02:07:39,357 --> 02:07:39,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Michael.

1378
02:07:39,977 --> 02:07:43,520
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can also email your comments into the board, because we'll see those.

1379
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:53,806
[SPEAKER_21]: But I like your comment about kind of active streets, and we want those to be active throughout various periods of the day, not just banking hours.

1380
02:07:55,928 --> 02:07:58,309
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I have is Alyssa Nugent.

1381
02:07:58,790 --> 02:08:03,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Alyssa, you're going to get a request to unmute, and please state your name and address for the record.

1382
02:08:06,755 --> 02:08:09,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Alyssa Nugent, 98 Sheridan Avenue.

1383
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:21,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to thank the board and Innis for this presentation and for really taking into account the comments that have been made so far.

1384
02:08:23,991 --> 02:08:27,895
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems as though there's now been a look at feasibility for some of these lots.

1385
02:08:28,575 --> 02:08:31,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we do have such small lots running along Salem.

1386
02:08:32,598 --> 02:08:43,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And as I believe Emily in this indicated some of those lots, it would not even be possible to get to four feet or four stories, just because of the size.

1387
02:08:45,066 --> 02:08:48,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think that the feasibility of a 12 foot sidewalk needs to be looked at.

1388
02:08:48,811 --> 02:08:57,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned about a sidewalk being that wide contributing to something like a concrete jungle and increasing heat.

1389
02:08:57,623 --> 02:09:00,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I know that grass running along the side of sidewalks isn't

1390
02:09:01,568 --> 02:09:04,171
[SPEAKER_13]: necessarily that great ecologically either.

1391
02:09:04,671 --> 02:09:15,603
[SPEAKER_13]: But in terms of making the neighborhood more walkable and feel friendlier, 12 feet wide sidewalks just seem to be too much for the area.

1392
02:09:16,143 --> 02:09:22,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I do worry that it would limit what is actually able to be built because it's going to eat up so much footage.

1393
02:09:24,293 --> 02:09:31,290
[SPEAKER_13]: of the private property and so developers won't want to build on these lots at all because

1394
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:44,899
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, they have to make the building so much smaller in order to provide the city with six plus feet of sidewalk that isn't currently available on the public land.

1395
02:09:45,759 --> 02:09:47,920
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's my main comment.

1396
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:48,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you again.

1397
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:51,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess I do have a question.

1398
02:09:51,561 --> 02:09:53,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, is it possible to waive the,

1399
02:09:54,482 --> 02:10:05,946
[SPEAKER_13]: are individual developers going to be able to go in front of CBD or somebody else to ask for a waiver on that requirement, or is that like a hard requirement as it's currently written?

1400
02:10:08,707 --> 02:10:09,068
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

1401
02:10:09,108 --> 02:10:09,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1402
02:10:11,729 --> 02:10:14,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Perfect timing, Alyssa.

1403
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:23,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Daniella or Alicia or Emily, do you have a response to Alyssa's question about if developers are able to waive on a case-by-case basis?

1404
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:29,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Madam Chair, there is currently not a waiver.

1405
02:10:29,564 --> 02:10:30,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just double checking.

1406
02:10:32,006 --> 02:10:36,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see a waiver at the moment for the 12 foot sidewalk.

1407
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:39,311
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have waivers for a couple of other things.

1408
02:10:39,892 --> 02:10:43,735
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to note, I think the previous speaker did allude to this, right?

1409
02:10:43,775 --> 02:10:50,100
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the property owner, the developer is not creating the full 12 foot sidewalk.

1410
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:52,282
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an additional bit of width.

1411
02:10:52,942 --> 02:10:59,471
[SPEAKER_14]: To the city sidewalk and there's a couple of reasons around that that distance.

1412
02:11:00,092 --> 02:11:06,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It does make it easier to plant trees along the street right trees need a certain amount of room to survive.

1413
02:11:08,063 --> 02:11:15,989
[SPEAKER_14]: and also to be able to have people going back and forth, you know, along the sidewalk without having to have too many people step aside, right?

1414
02:11:16,009 --> 02:11:21,012
[SPEAKER_14]: When we think of sidewalks, we want to be able to have friends talking together.

1415
02:11:21,032 --> 02:11:32,460
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to be able to have people who might be mobility impaired, and so they're using a wheelchair or a walker or something like that, and still have the sidewalk be comfortable for all users.

1416
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:42,346
[SPEAKER_14]: still allow for things like benches, which are incredibly important for people who have mobility limitations and maybe need to rest on their way to the store.

1417
02:11:42,946 --> 02:11:45,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And that could be people of all ages and all capabilities.

1418
02:11:45,988 --> 02:11:48,109
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't have to be somebody who is permanently impaired.

1419
02:11:48,129 --> 02:11:52,292
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be somebody who's got a broken leg from ski season and wants a place to sit.

1420
02:11:52,692 --> 02:12:02,198
[SPEAKER_14]: So 12 foot sidewalk gives that ability to accommodate a number of users, accommodate the trees, accommodate the other street furniture, and that's why we're recommending it.

1421
02:12:03,418 --> 02:12:09,801
[SPEAKER_14]: If a waiver, so we do have some height waivers and we have a step back waiver.

1422
02:12:10,802 --> 02:12:19,205
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if something like a sidewalk waiver is of interest, we could discuss it and try and figure out how that would work while still keeping a consistent environment.

1423
02:12:22,527 --> 02:12:24,367
[SPEAKER_21]: That's helpful context.

1424
02:12:25,288 --> 02:12:29,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, we obviously, you know, anybody can become disabled at any point in their life.

1425
02:12:31,490 --> 02:12:33,091
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something we definitely want to be aware of.

1426
02:12:33,212 --> 02:12:47,704
[SPEAKER_21]: But we also want to make sure that we're prioritizing people, and density, and housing, and vibrant streets, and a dynamic street section over some of those other topics.

1427
02:12:47,724 --> 02:12:49,585
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, it's an interesting balance for sure.

1428
02:12:49,605 --> 02:12:49,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1429
02:12:50,646 --> 02:12:53,629
[SPEAKER_21]: You can noodle on that.

1430
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:56,892
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I see is Gary M.

1431
02:12:58,497 --> 02:13:00,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Gary, you're gonna get a request to unmute.

1432
02:13:00,898 --> 02:13:02,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1433
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Gary Marinelli.

1434
02:13:06,121 --> 02:13:11,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 77 Parish Street, and I am a resident of this neighborhood.

1435
02:13:12,183 --> 02:13:17,486
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I wanna say I'm very happy that the city is looking at and proposing new zoning.

1436
02:13:17,646 --> 02:13:21,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is long overdue, so I wanna thank everyone that is helping with the zoning.

1437
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:26,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am happy that you're taking public feedback into account.

1438
02:13:27,331 --> 02:13:42,315
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like many others have stated, I was very pleased with the initial proposal and I'm a bit disappointed, honestly, in the lack of increase in density in the latest proposal and that the unit counts are decreasing.

1439
02:13:43,575 --> 02:13:48,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the density be increased back to three to six units or maybe somewhere in between.

1440
02:13:48,817 --> 02:13:52,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one to three units is not moving forward as a city.

1441
02:13:53,976 --> 02:13:57,262
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to plan for the future and build a better Medford.

1442
02:13:57,663 --> 02:13:59,547
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not stay stuck in the past.

1443
02:14:00,969 --> 02:14:05,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I see us moving backwards with the latest iteration.

1444
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:12,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And as everyone has said, Medford has a lack of housing, and we really need to increase development.

1445
02:14:12,375 --> 02:14:25,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for supporting a neighborhood with more housing, more commercial, more restaurants, more entertainment options, and more things to do within a walking distance.

1446
02:14:26,723 --> 02:14:28,284
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want an active community.

1447
02:14:29,766 --> 02:14:41,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, without allowing us the potential to grow to more stories, we're not moving forward, it's kind of a significant overcorrection in the wrong direction.

1448
02:14:42,497 --> 02:14:48,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to enable this additional housing to increase availability, increase revenue for the city.

1449
02:14:49,702 --> 02:14:51,763
[SPEAKER_00]: and draw more businesses to the area.

1450
02:14:51,943 --> 02:14:56,385
[SPEAKER_00]: More businesses are not going to move into the area if we don't allow density.

1451
02:14:58,727 --> 02:15:02,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we need to transition to a more modern community and continue to grow.

1452
02:15:04,149 --> 02:15:08,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just ask that that be revisited.

1453
02:15:08,452 --> 02:15:12,013
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I really want to thank everyone for the work that they're doing here.

1454
02:15:12,033 --> 02:15:14,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Gary, for coming out.

1455
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:17,101
[SPEAKER_21]: appreciate your comments.

1456
02:15:18,141 --> 02:15:20,062
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have is Ren Bean.

1457
02:15:21,663 --> 02:15:23,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1458
02:15:23,444 --> 02:15:27,406
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi there, Ren Bean, 37 Woodrow Avenue.

1459
02:15:29,587 --> 02:15:43,314
[SPEAKER_37]: I've been following this Salem Street development here for a minute, and I just want to lend my support to a lot of the commenters here today that have some concerns about the backstabbing from some of the density.

1460
02:15:44,414 --> 02:15:52,638
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, I do have concerns about overall this being done deliberately and thoughtfully, which I think is generally the case.

1461
02:15:52,738 --> 02:16:00,903
[SPEAKER_37]: I think INNIS and City Council and now the CDB has been really thoughtful and careful about not just charging ahead, but

1462
02:16:01,923 --> 02:16:05,606
[SPEAKER_37]: being responsive to public feedback, and I hope that's the case for a lot of what you've heard tonight as well.

1463
02:16:06,807 --> 02:16:21,098
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think that limiting the number of units, especially with considering the small lot sizes and some of the other setbacks and so forth, it's really kind of saying that only a certain type of housing will be allowable, you know, kind of

1464
02:16:21,518 --> 02:16:29,323
[SPEAKER_37]: larger multi-bedroom units, which are great for certain types of renters and buyers, maybe families that need several bedrooms.

1465
02:16:29,383 --> 02:16:40,830
[SPEAKER_37]: But I just think Medford does have a really bad lack of smaller housing, single-bedroom studios for people that need more affordable housing, single individuals.

1466
02:16:42,391 --> 02:16:57,841
[SPEAKER_37]: Another thing I'd like to point out to a lot of the detractors of these proposals is that single individuals, six units on a lot, those folks are contributing a lot to the tax base, and I heard a lot of folks expressing that they're concerned about over-enrollment in the Roberts.

1467
02:16:58,802 --> 02:17:14,045
[SPEAKER_37]: having having six single folks without kids contributing to the tax base and not enrolling kids in that neighborhood sounds like it's exactly what they would want um but uh you know let's let let's let the private market decide what's what's feasible in terms of uh

1468
02:17:14,545 --> 02:17:20,627
[SPEAKER_37]: you know, development and not limit it to three when six would sell well and there are residents that want and need that.

1469
02:17:20,747 --> 02:17:25,389
[SPEAKER_37]: And some of the other folks here said they would love to rent a place and not have to drive a car.

1470
02:17:25,749 --> 02:17:30,271
[SPEAKER_37]: And I agree with the other person who said, you know, studio doesn't need two parking spots.

1471
02:17:31,051 --> 02:17:31,932
[SPEAKER_37]: We can fit them in there.

1472
02:17:32,072 --> 02:17:34,673
[SPEAKER_37]: So anyway, just hope that's considered.

1473
02:17:35,313 --> 02:17:35,573
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1474
02:17:36,734 --> 02:17:37,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ren.

1475
02:17:38,214 --> 02:17:39,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate the comments.

1476
02:17:42,729 --> 02:17:47,773
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have, JMN, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1477
02:17:47,793 --> 02:17:49,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name.

1478
02:17:49,194 --> 02:17:49,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me now?

1479
02:17:50,254 --> 02:17:51,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you.

1480
02:17:51,155 --> 02:17:51,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1481
02:17:51,996 --> 02:17:53,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

1482
02:17:53,497 --> 02:17:54,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1483
02:17:54,597 --> 02:17:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

1484
02:17:57,159 --> 02:17:58,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a direct abutter.

1485
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in the heart of the Glenwood neighborhood.

1486
02:18:00,722 --> 02:18:04,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we are a neighborhood and we have been for decades, proudly so.

1487
02:18:04,424 --> 02:18:09,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the work that's been undertaken to incorporate our modifications based on feedback presented.

1488
02:18:10,183 --> 02:18:14,724
[SPEAKER_06]: and the updates to the presentation, including selected language for consideration.

1489
02:18:15,485 --> 02:18:25,748
[SPEAKER_06]: In reviewing the most recent documents for Salem Street Tonight and the upcoming neighborhood zoning maps, I want to point out that there are discrepancies that persist across those documents, including parcels near mine.

1490
02:18:26,148 --> 02:18:34,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, I would highly recommend a widely available unified map that's thoughtfully colorized to assure accessibility and ease of interpretation for folks.

1491
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:36,251
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of yellows and oranges.

1492
02:18:36,911 --> 02:18:49,443
[SPEAKER_06]: In the absence of this map and observation of the above discrepancies, I find the need to again iterate that parcels alongside streets should not be included in the corridor zoning as they don't qualify elsewhere and shouldn't do so here either.

1493
02:18:50,548 --> 02:19:15,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I must say as an industry professional, the fact that we are on the precipice of voting this through to further densify and exacerbate the inequities and density in this area relative to the remainder of the city without even the most baseline of industry standard documents, such as existing condition analysis on infrastructure impact, constructability within proposed minimums, and not even the most rudimentary of an urban master plan is mind boggling.

1494
02:19:16,266 --> 02:19:29,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly, I think we must take a step back to move forward properly and ensure that we're following industry best practices that are guide rails to success and ensure that implementation doesn't gentrify out long-term residents that are currently affordably housed.

1495
02:19:30,374 --> 02:19:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You simply can't make accurate assessments or shape a clear image of the impact of these zoning changes without a comprehensive analysis.

1496
02:19:37,078 --> 02:19:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And the incremental studies, development by development, doesn't work relative to sweeping rezoning, such as we're doing now, full stop.

1497
02:19:44,862 --> 02:19:50,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unbelievable to contemplate all this being moved along without these typical work products and in such short order.

1498
02:19:50,767 --> 02:19:52,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Neighboring cities take years to do this.

1499
02:19:53,069 --> 02:20:02,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of neighboring cities, Cambridge, who just passed landmark zoning for four-story multifamily buy right, their lot size is 5,000 square feet.

1500
02:20:02,337 --> 02:20:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: But here in Medford, we're looking at three.

1501
02:20:04,379 --> 02:20:08,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is their deeply educated baseline, 5,000 square feet.

1502
02:20:08,543 --> 02:20:09,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's amazing to me.

1503
02:20:10,064 --> 02:20:11,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the time.

1504
02:20:12,205 --> 02:20:22,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that you will think about this because we have the neighborhood zoning coming next that will also deeply densify and has been iterated by other folks.

1505
02:20:23,230 --> 02:20:25,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford isn't going to solve the housing crisis.

1506
02:20:25,811 --> 02:20:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: The goalposts keep moving.

1507
02:20:29,373 --> 02:20:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: The goalposts keep moving.

1508
02:20:31,354 --> 02:20:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very complicated process.

1509
02:20:32,914 --> 02:20:40,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And please consider the quality of life for our neighborhood as well, because we are already more dense than other areas of the city.

1510
02:20:40,178 --> 02:20:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1511
02:20:41,918 --> 02:20:42,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1512
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:49,062
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Jennifer Sullivan.

1513
02:20:49,722 --> 02:20:52,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Jennifer, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1514
02:20:52,323 --> 02:20:54,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1515
02:20:55,613 --> 02:20:55,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1516
02:20:56,073 --> 02:20:56,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

1517
02:20:57,234 --> 02:20:57,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1518
02:20:58,854 --> 02:21:01,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Jen Sullivan, 35 Washington Street.

1519
02:21:01,795 --> 02:21:02,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in Medford.

1520
02:21:02,776 --> 02:21:03,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a recent homeowner.

1521
02:21:04,456 --> 02:21:05,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I purchased off of Salem Street.

1522
02:21:07,257 --> 02:21:13,559
[SPEAKER_03]: While I'm disappointed on the watering down of this proposal, I do appreciate the effort and collaboration to at least get us to here today.

1523
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Updating zoning helps our existing businesses grow and new ones join us also as a non-driver.

1524
02:21:21,422 --> 02:21:26,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a single resident, shout out Wren for pointing us out that we exist.

1525
02:21:27,908 --> 02:21:33,033
[SPEAKER_03]: As a non-driver, I share the prior mentioned safety concerns, but also agree that they're not exclusive to zoning.

1526
02:21:33,053 --> 02:21:40,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a two-year member of a gym on Salem Street, and that and the walkability definitely guided my recent condo purchase.

1527
02:21:40,821 --> 02:21:44,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm investing in my hometown, and I really hope that

1528
02:21:45,005 --> 02:21:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone on this call who clearly care about our neighborhood.

1529
02:21:48,307 --> 02:21:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we can move forward and work together and advocate for what we do want to see in our neighborhood instead of focusing on what we don't want.

1530
02:21:56,272 --> 02:21:56,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1531
02:21:58,594 --> 02:21:59,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1532
02:21:59,714 --> 02:22:01,696
[SPEAKER_21]: And congratulations on your home purchase.

1533
02:22:01,736 --> 02:22:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1534
02:22:07,219 --> 02:22:12,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia or Danielle, have we received any comments about technical difficulties through the chat?

1535
02:22:14,234 --> 02:22:16,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Any emails through the email address?

1536
02:22:17,516 --> 02:22:24,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Chair, Amanda is actually managing the emails for us tonight and the extra viewing room.

1537
02:22:25,521 --> 02:22:25,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes.

1538
02:22:27,282 --> 02:22:31,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was going to raise her hand if any members of the viewing room wanted to speak.

1539
02:22:32,565 --> 02:22:32,845
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1540
02:22:33,185 --> 02:22:36,007
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think she's actually, it looks like she's offering them right now.

1541
02:22:38,008 --> 02:22:40,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, are you able to unmute yourself or do I need to give that?

1542
02:22:40,729 --> 02:22:42,270
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we would need to unmute her.

1543
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:43,031
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to.

1544
02:22:44,755 --> 02:22:44,975
[SPEAKER_16]: There.

1545
02:22:45,315 --> 02:22:46,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I just gave you co-host permissions.

1546
02:22:46,956 --> 02:22:47,857
[SPEAKER_16]: You can do it, Amanda.

1547
02:22:49,077 --> 02:22:49,178
[SPEAKER_28]: OK.

1548
02:22:49,478 --> 02:22:50,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

1549
02:22:51,339 --> 02:23:02,045
[SPEAKER_28]: So no comments live from the room, but I'll just quickly take a look at some notes from emails that were received over the past couple of days.

1550
02:23:04,226 --> 02:23:16,255
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we had, and I know it's sort of reductive to label things as supportive or against, but just for sake of kind of organizing things a little bit.

1551
02:23:17,256 --> 02:23:17,776
[SPEAKER_28]: We had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1552
02:23:20,878 --> 02:23:28,380
[SPEAKER_28]: Eight emails, comments that we received over email that were generally supportive of the proposal.

1553
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:37,784
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, does that we echo a lot of the sentiments we heard tonight about walkability, densification, more housing, more business.

1554
02:23:40,063 --> 02:23:47,246
[SPEAKER_28]: let's see, climate resiliency of the proposal and the way that densification can play into that.

1555
02:23:49,146 --> 02:24:07,593
[SPEAKER_28]: We also had one, two, five comments that leaned toward opposition and raised some concerns, nothing that wasn't already kind of spoken to tonight, but including things such as concerns around specific uses like medical offices, marijuana dispensary,

1556
02:24:08,293 --> 02:24:28,962
[SPEAKER_28]: concerned around height along the corridor and the incentive zoning, the potential for creating congestion, traffic, concerns around hotel, dormitory, bed and breakfast uses, and concern around sufficient parking.

1557
02:24:30,242 --> 02:24:44,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, so I think that, uh, wraps sort of the, the email comments that we'd received over the past, uh, within the past, um, like I'd say maybe two weeks, but, um, we got a slew that came in today and yesterday that were included in that.

1558
02:24:46,291 --> 02:24:46,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1559
02:24:46,451 --> 02:24:50,253
[SPEAKER_21]: And those emails are also put in, um, the board meeting folders.

1560
02:24:51,574 --> 02:24:52,634
[SPEAKER_28]: That is correct there.

1561
02:24:52,814 --> 02:24:58,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, they've been put into the meeting packets as well as the public, um, publicly viewable folders.

1562
02:24:59,637 --> 02:24:59,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1563
02:25:00,658 --> 02:25:00,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1564
02:25:00,998 --> 02:25:01,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for that, Amanda.

1565
02:25:02,099 --> 02:25:02,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice to see you again.

1566
02:25:05,501 --> 02:25:09,384
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, I don't see any new comments.

1567
02:25:10,004 --> 02:25:16,068
[SPEAKER_21]: As a reminder, we have a two-minute limit for each commenter to provide one comment.

1568
02:25:16,769 --> 02:25:25,715
[SPEAKER_21]: I encourage everybody who would like to provide more input to email the email address, and I'll just reiterate that quickly.

1569
02:25:29,596 --> 02:25:30,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Where is it?

1570
02:25:32,297 --> 02:25:32,977
[SPEAKER_21]: I just had it.

1571
02:25:36,498 --> 02:25:41,599
[SPEAKER_21]: OCD at Medford dash ma dot gov.

1572
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:48,260
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, and then I just saw a new hand, Lori.

1573
02:25:49,641 --> 02:25:51,541
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1574
02:25:53,061 --> 02:25:55,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1575
02:26:03,582 --> 02:26:05,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Lori, if you're speaking, I cannot hear you.

1576
02:26:05,783 --> 02:26:07,404
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to send another request to unmute.

1577
02:26:11,527 --> 02:26:13,808
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw you come off mute briefly and then go back on.

1578
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:19,051
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm unfortunately not hearing anything.

1579
02:26:23,013 --> 02:26:23,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

1580
02:26:27,316 --> 02:26:32,419
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd encourage you to reach out to Danielle or Alicia if you're having technical issues.

1581
02:26:36,021 --> 02:26:45,413
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you are having technical issues, you know, coordinate with Alicia and Danielle, and they may be able to share your comment on behalf of you.

1582
02:26:45,433 --> 02:26:48,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's give another minute.

1583
02:27:13,202 --> 02:27:16,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle or Alicia, are you seeing a note come through from Lori?

1584
02:27:16,363 --> 02:27:19,464
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to make sure we hear their comment.

1585
02:27:20,604 --> 02:27:22,225
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I messaged her.

1586
02:27:22,905 --> 02:27:23,525
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1587
02:27:24,105 --> 02:27:35,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll just say it out loud that often if there's an arrow next to the mute button, and you can select a different microphone input, and that's often the problem.

1588
02:27:36,349 --> 02:27:38,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Other people just have to log out and back in.

1589
02:27:38,330 --> 02:27:38,370
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1590
02:27:41,687 --> 02:27:44,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Lori, I encourage you to reach out to Danielle or Alicia.

1591
02:27:45,909 --> 02:27:49,110
[SPEAKER_21]: But as of right now, we're not seeing any new public commenters.

1592
02:27:50,111 --> 02:27:58,615
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this meeting and open it up to the board to discuss further revisions or recommendations.

1593
02:28:00,852 --> 02:28:02,073
[SPEAKER_21]: to the draft zoning.

1594
02:28:02,513 --> 02:28:11,457
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know Ari, you have to leave shortly, so I want to pass it off to you so you can get your thoughts in first.

1595
02:28:13,458 --> 02:28:21,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to all the members of the public and to the consultants from Innes Associates.

1596
02:28:22,042 --> 02:28:24,483
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate all the feedback.

1597
02:28:25,384 --> 02:28:26,864
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been reading all the emails.

1598
02:28:28,545 --> 02:28:39,851
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it is clear that the feedback today is that we are not done, that this is an iteration that probably needs some more work.

1599
02:28:39,871 --> 02:28:51,697
[SPEAKER_19]: I had initially also been interested in moving maybe to the 1 to 4 units if we're not comfortable with going to 3 to 6 even in the same dimensions.

1600
02:28:51,917 --> 02:28:55,279
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have no objections to 3 to 6 in the same dimensions,

1601
02:28:57,693 --> 02:28:59,376
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's worth considering.

1602
02:28:59,396 --> 02:29:08,169
[SPEAKER_19]: I had mentioned earlier looking at kind of weighing the city's priorities among the incentive zoning.

1603
02:29:09,398 --> 02:29:21,021
[SPEAKER_19]: And my priorities and I think the priorities among the community feedback consistently is around affordable housing and kind of affordable businesses.

1604
02:29:21,101 --> 02:29:27,723
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like those to be really prioritized and the incentives to prioritize that.

1605
02:29:29,023 --> 02:29:35,084
[SPEAKER_19]: This was only one or two comments, but I do share the frustration about the excess of banks.

1606
02:29:35,345 --> 02:29:35,885
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know,

1607
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:46,086
[SPEAKER_19]: What argument, I mean, are we allowed to say we have a lot of banks approval needed?

1608
02:29:47,487 --> 02:29:53,812
[SPEAKER_19]: With most of the things that we're discussing, I like see the community harm or kind of community risk that make that obvious.

1609
02:29:53,912 --> 02:29:59,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Banks are, I understand, good tenants, but a bit overrepresented in our neighborhood.

1610
02:30:02,423 --> 02:30:05,224
[SPEAKER_19]: had also been struck by the 12 foot sidewalks.

1611
02:30:05,604 --> 02:30:08,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got a thorough answer from Innes Associates on that.

1612
02:30:09,705 --> 02:30:13,206
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm curious about hearing more about existing condition analysis.

1613
02:30:13,766 --> 02:30:24,408
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of, I understand the argument about shadow and traffic studies needing to be done piece by piece, but I'd be curious in hearing from Innes Associates, their perspective on that.

1614
02:30:24,688 --> 02:30:26,949
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's, that's my notes.

1615
02:30:28,624 --> 02:30:32,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paula, are you able to respond to board member Fishman?

1616
02:30:34,538 --> 02:30:47,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, certainly happy to on, and I think board member fishman some of the comments about that you made about density will allow me to address some of the other comments that were made about just to do so.

1617
02:30:47,503 --> 02:30:48,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that opportunity.

1618
02:30:50,444 --> 02:30:59,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke at the beginning that we are looking at the residential only areas throughout the city, we have been for the past two months.

1619
02:31:00,148 --> 02:31:12,258
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that might clarify some of our thinking about why we took the MR and made it closer to the NR3 rather than to the other possibility could have been, for example, the UR1.

1620
02:31:12,798 --> 02:31:16,542
[SPEAKER_14]: And for that, with your permission, I'm just going to quickly share my screen.

1621
02:31:16,562 --> 02:31:22,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think visuals have been very helpful throughout this, so please feel free to pull stuff up.

1622
02:31:23,735 --> 02:31:24,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1623
02:31:24,355 --> 02:31:30,398
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the map that we just discussed with the Planning and Permitting Committee last week.

1624
02:31:30,498 --> 02:31:32,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, last week, the 26th.

1625
02:31:32,839 --> 02:31:44,745
[SPEAKER_14]: We did change the colors because although yellow is a traditional land use color for residential, when you're talking about different gradations of residential, your eyes tend to start to cross, especially at this scale.

1626
02:31:45,345 --> 02:31:48,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to zoom into Salem Street here.

1627
02:31:48,767 --> 02:31:50,369
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Salem Street.

1628
02:31:51,509 --> 02:31:55,452
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're going to see two colors right up against that.

1629
02:31:55,472 --> 02:32:02,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So the white area is the area that we've been talking about because now we're talking about the residential only in this map where before

1630
02:32:03,538 --> 02:32:07,501
[SPEAKER_14]: our conversations have been about the mixed use to residential.

1631
02:32:07,561 --> 02:32:15,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So the two colors here, this orange color is neighborhood residential three, and the red color is urban residential one.

1632
02:32:16,148 --> 02:32:26,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And so if I zoom back out, you can see where they are throughout the city, but I want to come over here and sorry, urban residential two is the red color, neighborhood residential three is the orange.

1633
02:32:27,118 --> 02:32:27,298
[SPEAKER_14]: So

1634
02:32:28,058 --> 02:32:51,040
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a couple of options as we were thinking about the MR. Our original proposal was to change the MR to one of the new residential zoning districts, but we can't do that because MR is already in front of you and the neighborhood and urban residential districts haven't yet made it to your way, so we're a little bit caught in the process.

1635
02:32:51,680 --> 02:33:03,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So the idea was to make the dimensions the same and then at the end when we do the full wrap up of looking at the final holistic, where do we need to make tweaks and we could combine them.

1636
02:33:04,231 --> 02:33:11,097
[SPEAKER_14]: We chose the neighborhood residential three which allows single unit dwellings, two unit dwellings, three unit dwellings.

1637
02:33:11,617 --> 02:33:21,521
[SPEAKER_14]: townhouses and historic conversions of 2 to 4 units because so much of the abutting area was residential 3.

1638
02:33:21,561 --> 02:33:30,685
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we could also talk about the UR1 as a possibility if that is of interest to the board and then obviously also of interest to the City Council.

1639
02:33:31,185 --> 02:33:43,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So Urban Residential 1 would allow the 2-unit dwelling, historic conversion of 2-5 units, townhouse 3-unit dwelling, and a multiplex of 4-6 units.

1640
02:33:43,941 --> 02:33:48,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that was kind of the transition we originally had with the MR.

1641
02:33:49,308 --> 02:33:56,654
[SPEAKER_14]: then and the proposal that you just saw tonight, the idea was just to let the neighborhood residential come up and sort of attached to where it already exists.

1642
02:33:57,375 --> 02:34:09,666
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think, you know, hearing at least some of the voices on the call and I think Madam Chair mentioned balance earlier, a lot of zoning is that balance of needs and wants and desires.

1643
02:34:10,707 --> 02:34:11,507
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think that

1644
02:34:12,268 --> 02:34:24,555
[SPEAKER_14]: The urban residential 1 could also be a possibility, but as I said, we chose to go with the neighborhood residential 3 as the new base for the MR, just simply because that that was what was abutting.

1645
02:34:24,695 --> 02:34:31,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I wanted to call that out in terms of, you know, I heard the numbers like 2 to 4.

1646
02:34:31,779 --> 02:34:35,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that would be that's kind of like outside.

1647
02:34:35,121 --> 02:34:38,063
[SPEAKER_21]: The buckets that we've identified here.

1648
02:34:39,230 --> 02:34:41,312
[SPEAKER_14]: So two to four is a historic conversion.

1649
02:34:41,792 --> 02:35:01,988
[SPEAKER_14]: In the neighborhood residential, we're not for today's conversation on Salem Street, but the future conversation on the residential, we have a historic conversion definition that would allow a historic, because we would like to preserve existing historic homes, they contribute a great deal.

1650
02:35:02,448 --> 02:35:05,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So the idea is to give it a little bit of an incentive.

1651
02:35:05,371 --> 02:35:06,412
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're,

1652
02:35:07,132 --> 02:35:14,375
[SPEAKER_14]: top number of units per dwelling is three, then you allow the historic conversion for four.

1653
02:35:14,475 --> 02:35:16,475
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're giving an incentive to preserve it.

1654
02:35:17,056 --> 02:35:21,017
[SPEAKER_14]: If your top is four units, you're allowing five.

1655
02:35:21,137 --> 02:35:32,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why urban residential one allows a historic conversion of two to five units, whereas neighborhood residential three allows a historic conversion of two to four units.

1656
02:35:32,821 --> 02:35:39,325
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of balancing the conversion of the building with the characteristics of the neighborhood.

1657
02:35:41,767 --> 02:35:43,688
[SPEAKER_21]: But new construction could not be four units.

1658
02:35:44,209 --> 02:35:47,371
[SPEAKER_14]: New construction in the neighborhood residential could not be four units.

1659
02:35:47,391 --> 02:35:48,111
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct.

1660
02:35:48,171 --> 02:35:49,172
[SPEAKER_14]: It's limited to three.

1661
02:35:49,192 --> 02:35:50,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1662
02:35:53,766 --> 02:35:59,369
[SPEAKER_14]: But I did want to give the board sort of a peek into the thinking back and forth on that.

1663
02:35:59,429 --> 02:36:14,977
[SPEAKER_14]: We did go back and forth ourselves on Neighborhood Residential 3 versus Urban Residential 1 for those existing residential parcels that butt up against Salem Street itself that were not part of the MX1, that were part of the original MR4.

1664
02:36:15,437 --> 02:36:19,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I do also want to just give a preview again.

1665
02:36:19,059 --> 02:36:19,980
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard some

1666
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:27,186
[SPEAKER_14]: comments and concerns from people that we weren't, overall in the city, we weren't adding enough density.

1667
02:36:27,286 --> 02:36:31,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to call out the two squares, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

1668
02:36:31,830 --> 02:36:40,698
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the additional corridors in South Medford, we have the additional corridors on Boston, and then looking over at Wellington.

1669
02:36:40,738 --> 02:36:44,181
[SPEAKER_14]: So we haven't touched everywhere in the city yet.

1670
02:36:44,321 --> 02:36:44,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And so

1671
02:36:45,443 --> 02:36:55,175
[SPEAKER_14]: For the people on the call who've been really engaged and thinking about what else could go where I would encourage them to stay part of the process.

1672
02:36:55,256 --> 02:37:01,444
[SPEAKER_14]: We are having the public meeting on the, you know, all of the planning and permitting meetings, of course, have been public, but we're having a

1673
02:37:01,924 --> 02:37:10,507
[SPEAKER_14]: public listening session in March on the residential and again on the corridors and squares would love to hear from all of the voices that we've heard today on those as well.

1674
02:37:11,047 --> 02:37:17,730
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and then I think the other thing was the idea of additional incentives.

1675
02:37:17,890 --> 02:37:24,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we are trying to tailor the incentives neighborhood by neighborhood for what makes sense.

1676
02:37:24,332 --> 02:37:25,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are totally open.

1677
02:37:26,413 --> 02:37:40,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, to hearing from from yourselves from the community, if there's a preference that a certain incentive not apply in a particular district, then we'd love to have that as part of the discussion and understand what that is.

1678
02:37:40,698 --> 02:37:44,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, it's guided by yourselves as to what makes sense where.

1679
02:37:44,979 --> 02:37:53,122
[SPEAKER_21]: How do you feel, Ari?

1680
02:37:54,763 --> 02:37:55,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1681
02:37:59,138 --> 02:38:01,580
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that, I think I do have to duck out.

1682
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:04,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you everyone for the great discussion.

1683
02:38:04,783 --> 02:38:10,308
[SPEAKER_19]: And I look forward to seeing how the board votes and I'm sure to the continued discussion over time.

1684
02:38:11,469 --> 02:38:11,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1685
02:38:12,690 --> 02:38:12,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1686
02:38:12,910 --> 02:38:13,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

1687
02:38:13,131 --> 02:38:13,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a nice evening.

1688
02:38:14,712 --> 02:38:14,992
[SPEAKER_19]: You too.

1689
02:38:17,535 --> 02:38:19,476
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Peter, Annie, Adam.

1690
02:38:21,678 --> 02:38:22,959
[SPEAKER_21]: What's kicking around in your brains?

1691
02:38:24,091 --> 02:38:26,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, maybe I'll chime in.

1692
02:38:29,735 --> 02:38:35,719
[SPEAKER_24]: I think what's kicking around in my brain is I feel a little bit conflicted.

1693
02:38:35,739 --> 02:38:43,685
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe I'll just talk out loud, and maybe that resonates with some of the residents, and maybe it doesn't.

1694
02:38:45,326 --> 02:38:52,591
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I've had the privilege to live in many different cities across the country.

1695
02:38:54,797 --> 02:39:07,164
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think where I feel conflicted, and I found it quite admirable, I think, the approach that Cambridge ended up taking recently with single family zoning.

1696
02:39:08,865 --> 02:39:16,629
[SPEAKER_24]: And I find it admirable not in the sense of that Medford should be Cambridge, but in the sense that

1697
02:39:18,813 --> 02:39:41,058
[SPEAKER_24]: I think what I struggle with, I'm a homeowner in Medford, I struggle with just how complicated and intractable these kinds of discussions are and how difficult it is to really understand what exactly is being decided that will then have a long-term repercussion for the fabric of the city.

1698
02:39:42,650 --> 02:40:10,271
[SPEAKER_24]: And so what I found admirable was the clarity of that type of approach to zoning, which was really, I found, in the spirit of true progressivism, around kind of looking at the history of zoning and the approaches to zoning, and sort of saying, actually, we're kind of going to go back to square one and rethink this approach that we've taken for the last 30, 40, 50 years.

1699
02:40:13,769 --> 02:40:20,772
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I also, the conflict that I have is I also recognize the jurisdiction of this board or the purview of this board.

1700
02:40:21,212 --> 02:40:24,893
[SPEAKER_24]: I recognize the incredible work that the city has done on the master planning.

1701
02:40:25,954 --> 02:40:39,539
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I don't think it's my role as a member of the board to kind of go against really the input that has been contributed so much

1702
02:40:41,265 --> 02:40:54,144
[SPEAKER_24]: to sort of set up this philosophy to zoning and the approach to zoning, and then all the work into what I do think is like a thoughtful consideration to try to meet a lot of the different parties to make this work for the community overall.

1703
02:40:56,169 --> 02:41:01,016
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's where I feel quite conflicted.

1704
02:41:01,036 --> 02:41:11,189
[SPEAKER_24]: I strongly resonate with the folks talking about just how difficult it is to find affordable places to live in Medford.

1705
02:41:13,772 --> 02:41:32,207
[SPEAKER_24]: And then maybe my other lived experience is that every time that well-intentioned planning has put forward how cities should be designed and looks, 10 or 15 years later, we all look at it and we're like, man, what were we thinking?

1706
02:41:33,048 --> 02:41:36,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Setback laws, the chunking of buildings.

1707
02:41:37,311 --> 02:41:39,633
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I am quite sympathetic that,

1708
02:41:43,255 --> 02:41:57,505
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm trying to try to reconcile that with, is there a way for, as everything's about moving forward, to avoid some of the pitfalls that have happened in the past with zoning?

1709
02:41:58,242 --> 02:41:59,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's kind of like parents.

1710
02:41:59,163 --> 02:42:03,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe that's an unsatisfactory answer, but that's what's in my head right now.

1711
02:42:03,505 --> 02:42:04,606
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I hear what you're saying.

1712
02:42:04,626 --> 02:42:10,110
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, the thing, you know, I feel like the it's with zoning and then it's also with parenting.

1713
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:15,973
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, you know, you always kind of fault your parents for all the mistakes they made, but we're just going to make new, fun and different mistakes.

1714
02:42:16,914 --> 02:42:22,758
[SPEAKER_21]: So with the awareness of, you know, what we've been subject to in a zoning context, of course,

1715
02:42:23,478 --> 02:42:30,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Parenting is a separate meeting, you know, how do we do the best we can, given all the facts we know today, and I think.

1716
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:40,524
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, to your point about our jurisdiction as as a board, the greatest power that we have is these recommendations that we can pass on to the city council.

1717
02:42:41,144 --> 02:42:42,885
[SPEAKER_21]: So, as much as we can.

1718
02:42:45,664 --> 02:42:49,605
[SPEAKER_21]: in recognition of the work that has been done, but also the feedback that we're hearing.

1719
02:42:49,625 --> 02:42:55,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what I'm looking for from the board is, are there specific recommendations?

1720
02:42:56,047 --> 02:42:59,528
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a list in front of me of things that I've been jotting down.

1721
02:43:01,829 --> 02:43:14,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Like are there recommendations, say we were to move this forward this evening, and I'm not saying we will, but if we were, what recommendations could we provide to the city council to provide

1722
02:43:15,583 --> 02:43:31,618
[SPEAKER_21]: the public, which is so enthusiastically and admirably shown up to these public hearings and participated in meetings and written emails, what recommendations can we include to not make the same mistakes as our parents?

1723
02:43:32,379 --> 02:43:33,480
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, city planners.

1724
02:43:36,073 --> 02:43:45,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Like a couple of ones that I've written down, and I'm curious for Emily, Danielle, Alicia, other members of the board to provide input, even if these could be recommendations.

1725
02:43:47,977 --> 02:43:55,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I think one person made this comment, and I have the name in my notes, but the simple idea of kind of coordinating with Malden for a line zoning across borders.

1726
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:58,401
[SPEAKER_21]: We obviously can't tell them what to do.

1727
02:43:58,481 --> 02:44:03,402
[SPEAKER_21]: They can't tell us what to do, the joy of town government in Massachusetts.

1728
02:44:05,503 --> 02:44:12,596
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think it would just be helpful to make sure that those communication avenues are established and maintained.

1729
02:44:12,616 --> 02:44:17,104
[SPEAKER_21]: And Alicia and Danielle, this might be something that you already do, but just to really call it out.

1730
02:44:18,728 --> 02:44:30,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I recognize the importance of a wide sidewalk in terms of accessibility, usability, but is a 12-foot sidewalk right for Salem Street?

1731
02:44:30,454 --> 02:44:32,495
[SPEAKER_21]: It's already a pretty tight street section.

1732
02:44:32,515 --> 02:44:42,080
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if we've, I don't think we've seen street sections just to help contextualize the sidewalk.

1733
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:45,521
[SPEAKER_21]: So that may be a helpful study to do, even if it's just the visuals.

1734
02:44:47,876 --> 02:45:00,988
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I would assume, sorry, and correct me if I'm wrong, that part of the whole thing would be this, these would not be necessarily wide sidewalks extending into the street.

1735
02:45:01,028 --> 02:45:03,150
[SPEAKER_25]: These would be extending in the building direction.

1736
02:45:03,170 --> 02:45:10,017
[SPEAKER_25]: As part of what we've been talking about is that this plan does not have jurisdiction over the street.

1737
02:45:12,311 --> 02:45:18,455
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, but every square foot we take up of building is less buildable area.

1738
02:45:18,495 --> 02:45:19,096
[SPEAKER_25]: Is less building.

1739
02:45:19,196 --> 02:45:19,596
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

1740
02:45:19,856 --> 02:45:20,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

1741
02:45:20,557 --> 02:45:30,223
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we're trying to promote density, housing, diverse uses, that's kind of the balance and trade-off that I was speaking more.

1742
02:45:30,243 --> 02:45:31,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we're not there.

1743
02:45:31,244 --> 02:45:31,764
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, that's fair.

1744
02:45:31,825 --> 02:45:32,325
[SPEAKER_25]: That's nice.

1745
02:45:32,345 --> 02:45:33,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1746
02:45:33,326 --> 02:45:34,626
[SPEAKER_21]: But I appreciate the clarification.

1747
02:45:36,928 --> 02:45:38,869
[SPEAKER_21]: This existing conditions analysis, I think,

1748
02:45:41,896 --> 02:45:46,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be interested in kind of the work involved in that.

1749
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:50,642
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not saying that if it's hard work, if it's tough work, we're not going to do it.

1750
02:45:52,303 --> 02:45:54,664
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think there is a lot of validity to that.

1751
02:45:55,064 --> 02:45:59,047
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't know, you can't have a good idea of where you're going unless you know where you've been.

1752
02:45:59,267 --> 02:46:03,590
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the existing conditions analysis may be able to capture that.

1753
02:46:05,015 --> 02:46:11,601
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I do think that there needs to be some focus on the incentive zoning menu.

1754
02:46:13,042 --> 02:46:14,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Board member already mentioned affordability.

1755
02:46:14,823 --> 02:46:24,671
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also going to add climate and low impact living as other focuses that could be revisited as part of that incentive menu.

1756
02:46:25,752 --> 02:46:30,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I think a deeper dive into the UR1 versus NR

1757
02:46:33,335 --> 02:46:34,455
[SPEAKER_21]: kind of implications.

1758
02:46:39,116 --> 02:46:42,797
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate that it's like one or the other, and I'm almost wondering, like, does it have to be?

1759
02:46:44,837 --> 02:46:48,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie, I see your hand up, so curious to get some other feedback from the board.

1760
02:46:48,218 --> 02:46:59,800
[SPEAKER_27]: I really feel that part of the charm of any city, and I've lived in a lot of places around the world, is

1761
02:47:02,198 --> 02:47:14,383
[SPEAKER_27]: how people gather on a street corner, how they walk down the street, how green space, benches, having a cafe with tables outside.

1762
02:47:15,784 --> 02:47:21,826
[SPEAKER_27]: Boston jokingly, we talk about the cow paths, and that's how Boston was built.

1763
02:47:22,927 --> 02:47:25,328
[SPEAKER_27]: All villages connected by cow paths.

1764
02:47:26,228 --> 02:47:31,070
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think having a 12-foot sidewalk is critical to a charm of a city.

1765
02:47:32,211 --> 02:47:41,156
[SPEAKER_27]: People live in a community to be in that community, not just to be in their home or condo apartment.

1766
02:47:41,996 --> 02:47:45,438
[SPEAKER_27]: They want to be in and out of shops.

1767
02:47:45,558 --> 02:47:48,220
[SPEAKER_27]: They want to be able to stroll down the street.

1768
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:51,922
[SPEAKER_27]: They want to be able to move a stroller.

1769
02:47:54,243 --> 02:47:55,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody who has

1770
02:47:57,323 --> 02:48:00,444
[SPEAKER_21]: So I hear that you're in support of the 12 foot sidewalk.

1771
02:48:00,564 --> 02:48:02,504
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the tree thing, too.

1772
02:48:03,124 --> 02:48:04,345
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the tree thing.

1773
02:48:05,065 --> 02:48:08,066
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to have trees.

1774
02:48:08,806 --> 02:48:13,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Human beings need to reflect on trees.

1775
02:48:13,887 --> 02:48:17,228
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you have a skinny sidewalk, the tree dies.

1776
02:48:17,888 --> 02:48:26,470
[SPEAKER_27]: Because what happens is that cars run into it, bicycles jab it, snow plows jab it,

1777
02:48:27,243 --> 02:48:36,227
[SPEAKER_27]: If you have a wide enough sidewalk, it gives a tremendous aura to the community.

1778
02:48:36,767 --> 02:48:37,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

1779
02:48:38,788 --> 02:48:49,132
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess my recommendation was more that maybe we should just look into it, not completely disregard the 12 foot.

1780
02:48:50,452 --> 02:48:55,194
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you're not comfortable looking into it, then maybe that's something we should have.

1781
02:48:58,033 --> 02:49:18,367
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think to the point of having a slightly larger footprint, if the property will allow it, like what we're doing in West Medford Square, and they're putting up quite a few nine apartments in a building,

1782
02:49:20,035 --> 02:49:37,639
[SPEAKER_27]: It fits right in to the look of the street, but it also gives me hope that we will have the train station right there, would be better used if we had more density.

1783
02:49:37,799 --> 02:49:45,001
[SPEAKER_21]: How would you verbalize that into a recommendation around the Salem?

1784
02:49:45,181 --> 02:49:49,682
[SPEAKER_27]: On Salem Street, if the property would allow,

1785
02:49:50,673 --> 02:50:00,880
[SPEAKER_27]: I think having between four and six apartments in a building is not a 15-story building.

1786
02:50:00,940 --> 02:50:07,404
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not becoming something that the community would not appreciate.

1787
02:50:07,464 --> 02:50:11,987
[SPEAKER_27]: But at the same time, a lot of people would like to live in the community.

1788
02:50:12,027 --> 02:50:13,668
[SPEAKER_27]: There's nowhere for them to go.

1789
02:50:15,189 --> 02:50:18,831
[SPEAKER_27]: So I just would like us to think about it.

1790
02:50:24,336 --> 02:50:31,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and then maybe to sort of maybe continue the thread that Annie was on.

1791
02:50:31,881 --> 02:50:46,772
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the limitation there on the density is really around parking, is there any mechanism that we can recommend?

1792
02:50:47,212 --> 02:50:48,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Parking lots?

1793
02:50:49,045 --> 02:50:53,708
[SPEAKER_24]: There are just that, or that should the parking requirements of the city change?

1794
02:50:55,890 --> 02:50:58,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, 100%.

1795
02:50:58,351 --> 02:51:00,593
[SPEAKER_24]: But I don't know how to formulate it.

1796
02:51:00,613 --> 02:51:02,914
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, I agree with you, Adam.

1797
02:51:03,035 --> 02:51:13,622
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of living in a city is always, when I learned to drive in Manhattan, nobody cared when I took my test if I could drive forward.

1798
02:51:14,383 --> 02:51:21,045
[SPEAKER_27]: on a stopwatch, I had to be able to parallel park, because that was key in Manhattan to be able to park.

1799
02:51:22,005 --> 02:51:30,727
[SPEAKER_27]: The whole idea of big cities, small cities is we can just make recommendations and suggestions.

1800
02:51:31,347 --> 02:51:34,048
[SPEAKER_27]: But if you're in a

1801
02:51:35,423 --> 02:51:49,046
[SPEAKER_27]: a certain size apartment, as a gentleman who had spoke from the community before, if it's a studio apartment or one bedroom, you know, the parking is slightly different.

1802
02:51:49,447 --> 02:52:03,110
[SPEAKER_27]: But if we're going to make a better use of having two different train stations in a small city like Medford, one on each side, we have to consider the concept of parking lots.

1803
02:52:04,711 --> 02:52:19,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Just to refocus us as a board and our discussion, I just want to reiterate that, unfortunately, and I truly agree, unfortunately, we are not discussing parking minimums as part of this Salem Street corridor rezoning.

1804
02:52:20,162 --> 02:52:25,566
[SPEAKER_21]: We did discuss parking minimums as part of the transit-oriented design around Wellington.

1805
02:52:25,586 --> 02:52:26,687
[SPEAKER_21]: We got those down to a point.

1806
02:52:26,707 --> 02:52:30,049
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the MBTA community zoning, that was part of our discussion, but that is not.

1807
02:52:32,224 --> 02:52:34,126
[SPEAKER_21]: which was a very fun discussion.

1808
02:52:35,406 --> 02:52:39,889
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is something that may come before us again, but that's not what we're talking about today.

1809
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:52,878
[SPEAKER_27]: But it reflects on- It is, but I'm just recognizing that- It's about the buildings themselves, and that's what we're talking about, and then we got off on that.

1810
02:52:53,018 --> 02:53:00,603
[SPEAKER_27]: But just simply, we have to consider that maybe in order to make the community

1811
02:53:01,388 --> 02:53:09,311
[SPEAKER_27]: more robust and have more space, maybe we need to consider having more than four in a building.

1812
02:53:11,752 --> 02:53:12,572
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of units?

1813
02:53:13,553 --> 02:53:13,833
Mm-hmm.

1814
02:53:14,273 --> 02:53:15,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, no, I agree.

1815
02:53:15,494 --> 02:53:15,894
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

1816
02:53:19,095 --> 02:53:22,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So that can be one of our recommendations, right?

1817
02:53:22,376 --> 02:53:24,557
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that would be right.

1818
02:53:24,577 --> 02:53:24,777
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1819
02:53:25,338 --> 02:53:28,579
[SPEAKER_25]: Would that be under consider upping the

1820
02:53:30,601 --> 02:53:36,382
[SPEAKER_25]: limit the units on the mixed-use one from three to four, if I'm following correctly?

1821
02:53:36,722 --> 02:53:48,344
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would be aligning the MR more closely with the urban residential one.

1822
02:53:50,544 --> 02:53:51,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that what this is?

1823
02:53:51,145 --> 02:53:51,885
[SPEAKER_25]: The other one.

1824
02:53:51,905 --> 02:53:54,005
[SPEAKER_25]: No, correct me if I'm wrong, Emily.

1825
02:54:00,574 --> 02:54:03,875
[SPEAKER_25]: MR on this corridor is currently based on the neighborhood residential 3.

1826
02:54:04,715 --> 02:54:08,435
[SPEAKER_25]: And what we were talking about potentially changing it to is the urban residential 1.

1827
02:54:09,215 --> 02:54:09,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1828
02:54:09,876 --> 02:54:11,416
[SPEAKER_21]: MR equals NR.

1829
02:54:12,276 --> 02:54:12,656
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1830
02:54:12,676 --> 02:54:13,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now.

1831
02:54:13,936 --> 02:54:24,618
[SPEAKER_25]: And potentially, one of the recommendations, if we wanted to change it, would be to change it to base more closely on the urban residential 1, which was the other option that Emily was presenting earlier.

1832
02:54:25,118 --> 02:54:25,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1833
02:54:26,498 --> 02:54:27,359
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the 2 to 6.

1834
02:54:29,499 --> 02:54:29,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1835
02:54:31,285 --> 02:54:33,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is, I think, what we previously had.

1836
02:54:34,447 --> 02:54:35,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, exactly.

1837
02:54:35,567 --> 02:54:36,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Or something closer to it, yeah.

1838
02:54:36,728 --> 02:54:42,191
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's somewhere between what we had had the first time and what we have now, so.

1839
02:54:45,413 --> 02:54:47,754
[SPEAKER_27]: Depending on the property, right?

1840
02:54:48,414 --> 02:54:53,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So, she makes use of an MR.

1841
02:54:57,583 --> 02:55:15,352
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is where I think an existing conditions analysis would be super dope to have, because the question that I want to ask, and maybe you have the answer to it, is how many single family houses are currently within this MR district?

1842
02:55:17,593 --> 02:55:17,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily?

1843
02:55:19,423 --> 02:55:21,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, so thank you, Madam Chair.

1844
02:55:21,904 --> 02:55:32,570
[SPEAKER_14]: So just as a reminder, and I actually have the maps up and I can show you, I think there's two rounds of existing conditions that we did back in July, actually the end of June of last year.

1845
02:55:33,010 --> 02:55:42,335
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a workshop with city council, the public was invited to it and we had, and I'm going to share that very, very quickly.

1846
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:48,398
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a significant number, you should see a map called recreation up.

1847
02:55:49,138 --> 02:55:53,781
[SPEAKER_14]: So we mapped recreation, we mapped hydrography.

1848
02:55:54,161 --> 02:55:55,742
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is for the whole city?

1849
02:55:55,762 --> 02:55:58,563
[SPEAKER_14]: This is for the whole city, yes.

1850
02:55:58,703 --> 02:56:05,247
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to call it out, we mapped also the surrounding communities.

1851
02:56:06,428 --> 02:56:10,330
[SPEAKER_14]: We got the zoning from the surrounding communities and mapped those as well.

1852
02:56:11,250 --> 02:56:12,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, your audio is really low right now.

1853
02:56:13,293 --> 02:56:13,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1854
02:56:14,054 --> 02:56:16,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've mapped the surrounding communities.

1855
02:56:16,798 --> 02:56:22,225
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually reached out to the other communities and got their zoning so we could look at it.

1856
02:56:22,285 --> 02:56:24,027
[SPEAKER_14]: This is obviously Medford only.

1857
02:56:24,047 --> 02:56:28,533
[SPEAKER_14]: We mapped demographics, so median income, median age.

1858
02:56:29,013 --> 02:56:32,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It's race, it's the environmental justice populations.

1859
02:56:33,434 --> 02:56:35,515
[SPEAKER_14]: We mapped the residential housing stock.

1860
02:56:35,555 --> 02:56:37,155
[SPEAKER_14]: This is in terms of years.

1861
02:56:37,175 --> 02:56:42,997
[SPEAKER_21]: And this fits the kind of the recommendation of an existing conditions analysis.

1862
02:56:43,017 --> 02:56:44,317
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, yeah.

1863
02:56:44,377 --> 02:56:45,398
[SPEAKER_14]: This is everything.

1864
02:56:45,418 --> 02:56:45,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I love this.

1865
02:56:45,958 --> 02:56:46,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1866
02:56:46,258 --> 02:56:49,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Building value, it should all be on the city's website.

1867
02:56:50,280 --> 02:57:01,224
[SPEAKER_14]: We mapped the dimensions, so setbacks, frontage, lot size, building height, building coverage, impervious coverage.

1868
02:57:01,364 --> 02:57:09,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we also, and this is a separate map that we've been working on recently.

1869
02:57:09,227 --> 02:57:11,948
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it answers the question that you just brought up.

1870
02:57:12,608 --> 02:57:18,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is this one was done for the residential districts, but we have it for the others.

1871
02:57:18,958 --> 02:57:26,169
[SPEAKER_14]: So the colors on this map are the existing housing types in each of these districts.

1872
02:57:26,189 --> 02:57:27,912
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's on the ground now?

1873
02:57:28,372 --> 02:57:37,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and the borders are our proposed residential district so this map Salem Street we do have another one that shows the whole city.

1874
02:57:38,281 --> 02:57:45,487
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you can start to see by the different colors that the, the variety of housing types that you already have.

1875
02:57:46,147 --> 02:57:56,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, in this area, the legend, which isn't on on this version, this is a background map, but the legend tells you which 1, these are this map is also available on the city's website.

1876
02:57:56,692 --> 02:58:00,954
[SPEAKER_14]: We just showed it to the planning and permitting council last week while this is up.

1877
02:58:00,994 --> 02:58:03,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you clue us in on the legend?

1878
02:58:04,156 --> 02:58:06,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, yeah, feel orange purple.

1879
02:58:07,223 --> 02:58:11,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so of course I grabbed the one that doesn't have the legend.

1880
02:58:12,006 --> 02:58:14,067
[SPEAKER_14]: That always works.

1881
02:58:14,107 --> 02:58:15,588
[SPEAKER_14]: The purple is single family.

1882
02:58:15,608 --> 02:58:18,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's easy enough to tell you.

1883
02:58:19,130 --> 02:58:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And Paola, if you do have it in front of you, feel free to jump in and correct me.

1884
02:58:22,753 --> 02:58:23,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So purple is single family.

1885
02:58:23,993 --> 02:58:25,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Purple is single family.

1886
02:58:25,734 --> 02:58:27,435
[SPEAKER_14]: The teal is garbage paint.

1887
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:28,896
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the light purple is single family.

1888
02:58:28,916 --> 02:58:29,677
[SPEAKER_14]: The light purple, OK.

1889
02:58:29,757 --> 02:58:32,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the lavender maybe.

1890
02:58:32,238 --> 02:58:32,278
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1891
02:58:32,619 --> 02:58:34,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other.

1892
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:36,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want me to?

1893
02:58:36,928 --> 02:58:37,208
[SPEAKER_14]: go.

1894
02:58:38,550 --> 02:58:38,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1895
02:58:40,311 --> 02:58:42,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so the purple is single family.

1896
02:58:43,054 --> 02:58:45,136
[SPEAKER_18]: The greenish is duplex.

1897
02:58:46,057 --> 02:58:49,841
[SPEAKER_18]: The purple, the dark one is three units.

1898
02:58:50,401 --> 02:58:56,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the orange, it was like multi family, I think, or

1899
02:59:02,297 --> 02:59:02,817
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is.

1900
02:59:04,257 --> 02:59:07,958
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be, no, because it's not about the property.

1901
02:59:10,119 --> 02:59:13,240
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be, I don't know if it's some kind of conversion.

1902
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:14,580
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's conversion, yes.

1903
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:17,601
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be kind of conversion, actually, yes.

1904
02:59:18,101 --> 02:59:23,862
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the very purple, deeper red that it's almost nowhere there.

1905
02:59:27,370 --> 02:59:29,972
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you mean by multiple family?

1906
02:59:31,072 --> 02:59:32,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Four to six, six or more?

1907
02:59:33,434 --> 02:59:34,434
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't have the cap.

1908
02:59:34,594 --> 02:59:37,216
[SPEAKER_18]: It's three stories or six stories.

1909
02:59:37,296 --> 02:59:41,658
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just more than, let's say, the six units.

1910
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:49,803
[SPEAKER_18]: There is the blue that is also something between four and six, just to give that idea.

1911
02:59:50,043 --> 02:59:54,806
[SPEAKER_18]: We have it as well that we can see on Salem.

1912
02:59:57,050 --> 03:00:02,592
[SPEAKER_18]: try to look at it and it's not shared yet, but we do have them.

1913
03:00:03,272 --> 03:00:07,053
[SPEAKER_18]: We should have them in the complete.

1914
03:00:07,193 --> 03:00:11,914
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if that was to the existing conditions or to the map.

1915
03:00:11,934 --> 03:00:12,374
[SPEAKER_18]: We have it.

1916
03:00:12,835 --> 03:00:15,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, in the existing conditions, it should be there as well.

1917
03:00:15,435 --> 03:00:18,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1918
03:00:18,656 --> 03:00:20,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Through the chair, it doesn't have that.

1919
03:00:22,555 --> 03:00:31,455
[SPEAKER_15]: existing land use map that they are but I don't believe I'm looking to see if I can find it should be in the package from last week's meeting.

1920
03:00:31,475 --> 03:00:31,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So

1921
03:00:33,503 --> 03:00:38,068
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just looking to see if we, we have it right where I can get my hands on it.

1922
03:00:38,109 --> 03:00:41,072
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the point is, we have that analysis.

1923
03:00:41,112 --> 03:00:47,460
[SPEAKER_14]: We are happy to share it directly with the board, but we've been doing a lot of existing conditions analysis.

1924
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:53,026
[SPEAKER_14]: We go back a lot of our discussion last week for the residential was neighbors coming in and saying,

1925
03:00:53,947 --> 03:00:59,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be able to see what's on the ground, because I think it's this and show them that.

1926
03:00:59,196 --> 03:01:03,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I didn't realize there were so many two and three in my neighborhoods or.

1927
03:01:03,990 --> 03:01:06,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So that has been part of the discussion.

1928
03:01:06,171 --> 03:01:11,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You may also have noticed under the maps, we actually have a topographical analysis.

1929
03:01:11,474 --> 03:01:29,562
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some comments about sort of the northeastern corner and the smaller lots, but also the steeper hills that make it difficult to add additional housing there because of the actual, the physical access to that.

1930
03:01:29,622 --> 03:01:31,103
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are taking into account

1931
03:01:31,583 --> 03:01:33,725
[SPEAKER_14]: topography as well as the other conditions.

1932
03:01:33,785 --> 03:01:38,608
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do want to stress that that has been part of this process all the way along.

1933
03:01:38,628 --> 03:01:39,809
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1934
03:01:40,069 --> 03:01:41,671
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate you sharing that with us.

1935
03:01:42,531 --> 03:01:44,713
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's great to be able to share it in this form as well.

1936
03:01:44,733 --> 03:01:48,476
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1937
03:01:48,716 --> 03:01:49,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1938
03:01:50,597 --> 03:01:50,737
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1939
03:01:50,777 --> 03:01:56,402
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess the reason why I asked about existing single family is

1940
03:01:58,290 --> 03:02:03,011
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm in favor of as much housing as possible everywhere.

1941
03:02:03,812 --> 03:02:14,375
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do recognize that my opinion is not fact, which hopefully everybody here can agree that their own opinion is not fact.

1942
03:02:14,995 --> 03:02:20,557
[SPEAKER_21]: But if there is a demand for single family housing within this zone,

1943
03:02:22,738 --> 03:02:33,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that something we need to preserve and what I'm seeing based on the existing provision of single family housing is no, there's already so many, and housing is already so rare in Medford.

1944
03:02:34,684 --> 03:02:37,946
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

1945
03:02:37,986 --> 03:02:43,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry Madam Chair to interrupt, but I did find the map that has Salem Street on it with the residential types.

1946
03:02:44,149 --> 03:02:45,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I also had it but you can go.

1947
03:02:46,873 --> 03:02:47,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I got there first.

1948
03:02:48,654 --> 03:02:50,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I added something to the chat, too.

1949
03:02:51,215 --> 03:02:52,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

1950
03:02:52,735 --> 03:02:55,576
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all searching frantically, the joys of being on the computer.

1951
03:02:55,656 --> 03:02:56,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, let me zoom.

1952
03:02:56,676 --> 03:03:00,758
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the rapid response to questions and comments.

1953
03:03:01,218 --> 03:03:01,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Here you go.

1954
03:03:01,798 --> 03:03:04,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's full Salem Street.

1955
03:03:04,119 --> 03:03:05,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see the purple.

1956
03:03:05,800 --> 03:03:08,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this one also has a legend.

1957
03:03:08,721 --> 03:03:11,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So you were not far off, Paula, just for memory.

1958
03:03:11,482 --> 03:03:12,162
[SPEAKER_14]: So well done.

1959
03:03:12,802 --> 03:03:15,524
[SPEAKER_14]: So the orange is, in fact, the condo conversion.

1960
03:03:15,544 --> 03:03:17,385
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a two to three family.

1961
03:03:17,765 --> 03:03:19,286
[SPEAKER_14]: The purple is a three family.

1962
03:03:19,666 --> 03:03:21,447
[SPEAKER_14]: The blue is four to eight units.

1963
03:03:22,167 --> 03:03:25,569
[SPEAKER_14]: The really deep purple is the nine plus units.

1964
03:03:26,029 --> 03:03:27,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We have congregate housing.

1965
03:03:27,590 --> 03:03:30,652
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the pink is multiple houses on one parcel.

1966
03:03:31,593 --> 03:03:34,415
[SPEAKER_14]: And I should stress this all came from your assessor's data.

1967
03:03:34,955 --> 03:03:39,319
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're obviously relying on the accuracy of their collection.

1968
03:03:39,379 --> 03:03:42,821
[SPEAKER_14]: But now knowing what those are, let's zoom back into Salem.

1969
03:03:43,402 --> 03:03:49,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can still see this is a lower density because it was on a PowerPoint presentation.

1970
03:03:49,707 --> 03:03:52,529
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can see the mix of colors in there.

1971
03:03:52,569 --> 03:03:56,813
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's why we were going back and forth between do we do NR3?

1972
03:03:57,353 --> 03:04:00,995
[SPEAKER_14]: three, or do we do UR1 in this area?

1973
03:04:01,976 --> 03:04:04,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you could make a solid case for both.

1974
03:04:04,297 --> 03:04:10,781
[SPEAKER_14]: But UR1, NR3 would be more consistent with what's on the ground now.

1975
03:04:11,481 --> 03:04:19,145
[SPEAKER_14]: UR1 would, I think, be more consistent with the desire to, over time, add additional density.

1976
03:04:19,245 --> 03:04:22,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And you could go either way in that discussion.

1977
03:04:22,487 --> 03:04:23,848
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1978
03:04:25,475 --> 03:04:30,018
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the things I've been struggling with as chair is expressing my own opinion.

1979
03:04:30,038 --> 03:04:36,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I recognize that there's people who've lived here longer than me.

1980
03:04:36,342 --> 03:04:38,384
[SPEAKER_21]: There's people who will live here longer than me.

1981
03:04:38,404 --> 03:04:39,545
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a renter.

1982
03:04:40,866 --> 03:04:45,849
[SPEAKER_21]: The only plots of land I can afford to buy are basically 45 degree angles.

1983
03:04:48,951 --> 03:04:51,032
[SPEAKER_21]: But on this one, you are one.

1984
03:04:52,349 --> 03:04:56,050
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it doesn't make sense to keep things as they are.

1985
03:04:56,370 --> 03:04:57,810
[SPEAKER_21]: As things are, they're unaffordable.

1986
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:59,431
[SPEAKER_21]: They're inaccessible.

1987
03:04:59,451 --> 03:05:11,033
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely support moving the MR in the case of our purview and what we can do.

1988
03:05:11,073 --> 03:05:11,634
[SPEAKER_21]: A recommendation.

1989
03:05:11,674 --> 03:05:18,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Recommending to city council to move the MR back more towards the UR1.

1990
03:05:18,435 --> 03:05:20,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I agree.

1991
03:05:20,276 --> 03:05:21,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Aligned towards the UR1.

1992
03:05:22,432 --> 03:05:35,195
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would also, I mean, I also agree with the comments that say things about the streets, but I know that's a separate issue that will be taken up by a different facet of city government at a later time.

1993
03:05:36,435 --> 03:05:36,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1994
03:05:38,355 --> 03:05:41,116
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do think that is a key issue to making this all work.

1995
03:05:41,216 --> 03:05:47,657
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do think that's something, I mean, I have great faith in Todd and Tim and Ellen that they'll

1996
03:05:48,950 --> 03:05:50,452
[SPEAKER_25]: get over in that direction.

1997
03:05:50,472 --> 03:05:52,453
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's part of the zoning.

1998
03:05:53,875 --> 03:05:58,178
[SPEAKER_25]: The whole process is you have to allow for the city you want to see.

1999
03:05:58,199 --> 03:06:04,584
[SPEAKER_25]: So just doing my requisite writing up of things that I'm hearing.

2000
03:06:06,306 --> 03:06:10,830
[SPEAKER_25]: What I've got so far in terms of recommendations is recommendation to align

2001
03:06:11,668 --> 03:06:18,990
[SPEAKER_25]: the multifamily residential more closely with the urban residential one rather than the neighborhood residential three as is currently present.

2002
03:06:20,130 --> 03:06:36,195
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've got kind of a leftover of Ari's comment but also something I think you brought up Emily of to consider giving greater weight in the incentive zoning toward affordability

2003
03:06:37,882 --> 03:06:56,473
[SPEAKER_21]: uh green space green infrastructure and like low impact low environmental impact yeah all right climate resiliency yeah sustainability renewables all that good stuff so we don't crisp up uh

2004
03:06:58,232 --> 03:07:08,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to disrupt the board's discussion, but I thought if it's helpful, I can put the incentive table up on the, so you all can see it.

2005
03:07:10,002 --> 03:07:10,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that'd be great.

2006
03:07:10,883 --> 03:07:18,769
[SPEAKER_21]: And Alicia, Danielle, when we pass, or if we pass, I'm assuming we will at some point in our lives.

2007
03:07:20,811 --> 03:07:24,735
[SPEAKER_21]: When we pass this on to the city council with our recommendations, are they looking for

2008
03:07:26,952 --> 03:07:35,781
[SPEAKER_21]: like hyper-specific tweaks to these incentive bonuses or kind of just these overall like general recommendations or is it both?

2009
03:07:36,662 --> 03:07:44,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Madam Chair, somebody is going to have to translate it into something very specific for them to vote on.

2010
03:07:45,411 --> 03:07:47,853
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're specific, that's great.

2011
03:07:48,494 --> 03:07:50,616
[SPEAKER_16]: One that I was just ruminating on

2012
03:07:51,255 --> 03:07:58,600
[SPEAKER_16]: is that if you all tonight say this is like, we would like it to align with this, or this is how we'd like it to be.

2013
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:09,867
[SPEAKER_16]: We will then look to Emily and Paula to help establish a recommendation that is a net from what the city council originally sent to you to what you're asking for.

2014
03:08:09,887 --> 03:08:12,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Showing like a bridge, yeah, okay.

2015
03:08:12,328 --> 03:08:15,671
[SPEAKER_16]: So that they like change their original document

2016
03:08:16,557 --> 03:08:21,980
[SPEAKER_16]: based on what your recommendations, if they take your recommendations.

2017
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:24,001
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just always have to caveat that.

2018
03:08:25,001 --> 03:08:33,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they can do changes as well from the floor at that time as well, if that makes sense as well.

2019
03:08:35,067 --> 03:08:43,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so with that, would we have to come back to another meeting to review the content from Emily and Paola?

2020
03:08:45,160 --> 03:09:02,621
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what I'm suggesting is that if you said, we want that area to align with you are three, then Emily will say the table should say that she will take that and translate that into the Community Development Board said they want these numbers in the table.

2021
03:09:03,181 --> 03:09:03,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2022
03:09:03,581 --> 03:09:09,184
[SPEAKER_21]: And would we, is that something we would have to come back as a board and say, yes, we agree with these recommendations.

2023
03:09:09,224 --> 03:09:12,405
[SPEAKER_21]: We're passing them on to, like, is that we wait till the 19th for that?

2024
03:09:12,425 --> 03:09:19,649
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's necessary as long as what they're doing is literally exactly what we're saying, the description and making it.

2025
03:09:19,729 --> 03:09:29,253
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we're aligned on and Annie or Adam, please speak up if you have input about kind of the.

2026
03:09:31,775 --> 03:09:40,717
[SPEAKER_21]: URI, I'm sorry, UR1, NR, MR, I'm losing letters at this point in the evening.

2027
03:09:42,197 --> 03:09:46,038
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think where we could be more specific is in these incentive bonuses.

2028
03:09:46,058 --> 03:09:53,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if we just say, we want you to focus on affordable housing and sustainability, they're going to be like, that's cool, but what does that mean?

2029
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:59,721
[SPEAKER_21]: So that flips back to us in terms of, do we want to,

2030
03:10:01,182 --> 03:10:07,229
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're saying right now it's between one and three floors.

2031
03:10:08,010 --> 03:10:13,976
[SPEAKER_27]: And if we want to add two for two additional floors, you add 5%.

2032
03:10:17,902 --> 03:10:19,082
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, can you walk us through it?

2033
03:10:19,103 --> 03:10:21,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm going to Yes, exactly.

2034
03:10:21,884 --> 03:10:27,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So sorry, I was just making sure I was unmuted because I was let you know if you are.

2035
03:10:28,686 --> 03:10:29,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2036
03:10:29,607 --> 03:10:31,608
[SPEAKER_14]: You say your lips are moving, but we can't hear you.

2037
03:10:31,928 --> 03:10:34,189
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, so exactly.

2038
03:10:34,329 --> 03:10:45,133
[SPEAKER_14]: So if this is the percent of because this is applying townwide, so we set it up as lots of units and proposed project, because it

2039
03:10:45,513 --> 03:10:48,015
[SPEAKER_14]: could potentially be a subdivision.

2040
03:10:49,176 --> 03:10:58,843
[SPEAKER_14]: So for one additional floor based on the number of units or lots, but in this case more likely units, you would have to meet these percentages.

2041
03:10:59,063 --> 03:11:01,505
[SPEAKER_14]: So here is your requirement.

2042
03:11:02,025 --> 03:11:04,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is your basic requirement for 80% AMI.

2043
03:11:04,207 --> 03:11:04,367
[SPEAKER_14]: That's

2044
03:11:06,308 --> 03:11:09,070
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of your affordable housing zoning.

2045
03:11:09,490 --> 03:11:16,774
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we're saying is for deeper affordability, we want affordable units at 65% of AMI.

2046
03:11:17,414 --> 03:11:19,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's your minimum percentage.

2047
03:11:20,016 --> 03:11:21,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's your additional at 65%.

2048
03:11:21,276 --> 03:11:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would have to do 8% for a 10 to 24 unit building, you would have to do 8% at 88 AMI.

2049
03:11:24,838 --> 03:11:26,079
[SPEAKER_14]: We're asking you to do it with

2050
03:11:33,283 --> 03:11:35,804
[SPEAKER_14]: to at 65% AMI.

2051
03:11:35,824 --> 03:11:41,467
[SPEAKER_14]: For two additional floors, you'd have to do five at 80% and five at 65.

2052
03:11:41,587 --> 03:11:47,049
[SPEAKER_14]: In both cases, these add up to the 10%, which is your current affordable requirement.

2053
03:11:47,069 --> 03:11:47,949
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 10% at 80%.

2054
03:11:50,430 --> 03:11:57,833
[SPEAKER_14]: If you were going to do more affordable units as opposed to deeper affordability, this is the percentage of affordable units at 80% AMI

2055
03:11:59,712 --> 03:12:07,558
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is your total percentage of affordable units, additional affordable units to get to that next floor.

2056
03:12:07,618 --> 03:12:09,780
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, we're breaking it up.

2057
03:12:09,820 --> 03:12:13,944
[SPEAKER_14]: We're saying you've got your original 10%, 13% or 15%.

2058
03:12:15,085 --> 03:12:18,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's break it up to require that deeper level of affordability.

2059
03:12:20,789 --> 03:12:22,711
[SPEAKER_21]: And thinking specifically around Salem Street.

2060
03:12:22,731 --> 03:12:23,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2061
03:12:24,676 --> 03:12:32,358
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you said that these incentives are citywide, so... The intent is that they're supposed to be citywide.

2062
03:12:33,018 --> 03:12:39,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, they started with the Wellington District with the MBTA Communities Act.

2063
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:43,081
[SPEAKER_14]: They were morphed a little bit more for Mystic.

2064
03:12:43,842 --> 03:12:47,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we thought a lot once we had done Mystic about how they should be.

2065
03:12:47,743 --> 03:12:51,504
[SPEAKER_14]: So, this is one of those cleanup items I've mentioned from time to time.

2066
03:12:52,064 --> 03:13:06,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, as we go through eventually we would like to be have the incentives be as standardized as possible, but with the caveat that there may be if it's something like affordable, you probably want that to be the same city wide.

2067
03:13:06,414 --> 03:13:06,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2068
03:13:07,555 --> 03:13:17,101
[SPEAKER_14]: But for some of the others, especially those that have something to do with infrastructure, I think those might might that could be varied by district.

2069
03:13:17,861 --> 03:13:21,983
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be the community amenities that come through here.

2070
03:13:22,003 --> 03:13:26,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I think for the vibrant neighborhoods and the environmental resilience.

2071
03:13:27,106 --> 03:13:31,509
[SPEAKER_14]: I think for the environmental resilience, that should probably end up being citywide.

2072
03:13:31,589 --> 03:13:55,944
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have the development project meets the ideal green score, if you remember from a few, more than a few weeks back, you have the green score, but then there's that there's a minimum and there's an ideal and if the project meets the ideal, the reason that's in there is that gets them an additional story and by having that greater environmental resilience, if the building certified as net zero emissions,

2073
03:13:56,424 --> 03:14:03,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Or certifiable as lead platinum or equivalent standard just because the paperwork is so tough on those.

2074
03:14:03,633 --> 03:14:06,697
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very expensive to get fully certified.

2075
03:14:06,717 --> 03:14:07,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2076
03:14:07,558 --> 03:14:10,982
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to confirm, you can't stack these to build a 600-story building?

2077
03:14:13,305 --> 03:14:14,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely not.

2078
03:14:14,225 --> 03:14:16,646
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of the reasons for clarifying the language.

2079
03:14:16,726 --> 03:14:25,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So for Salem Street, where you can only get two additional stories, you're only going to get two of these, right?

2080
03:14:25,508 --> 03:14:30,569
[SPEAKER_14]: So you might get an environmental resilience and an affordability.

2081
03:14:30,669 --> 03:14:37,531
[SPEAKER_14]: You might get two affordabilities, maybe if they've got low income tax credits and that helps with the financing stack.

2082
03:14:38,411 --> 03:14:44,913
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have the parking concealed below grade or within a building structure that might be more appropriate to MX2.

2083
03:14:44,933 --> 03:14:57,338
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a provision that would help for smaller or local businesses or non-profits rather for reduced rent.

2084
03:14:57,398 --> 03:15:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's also in there to contribute to the street and this terminology of vibrant neighborhoods came straight out of the comprehensive plan.

2085
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:12,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Environmental resilience obviously has been a key of both the comprehensive plan and the climate action adaptation plan.

2086
03:15:12,327 --> 03:15:23,657
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's the streetscape improvements through to the community amenities that are probably most likely to vary by neighborhood.

2087
03:15:23,737 --> 03:15:26,340
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think those are also the ones that have had the most

2088
03:15:26,740 --> 03:15:52,062
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah discussion from here is the sort of the how much this this 300 square feet is a 30 foot frontage by a 10 foot setback that's why it's 300 square feet pulled out but you know those are certainly the ones that have had the most conversation around them yeah so if we did want to make recommendations on these there's kind of two directions we can go in one is like de-emphasize

2089
03:15:54,440 --> 03:15:58,443
[SPEAKER_21]: like things that we care less about, like fountain keeps being tossed around.

2090
03:15:58,463 --> 03:16:07,970
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, just as an example, like we could make the fountain water element as like a quarter additional half story, or we can.

2091
03:16:10,686 --> 03:16:14,507
[SPEAKER_21]: overemphasizes things that we do care about, like the affordable housing.

2092
03:16:14,527 --> 03:16:20,689
[SPEAKER_21]: But keeping in mind that there's only so high we can go, specifically within this country corridor.

2093
03:16:20,789 --> 03:16:21,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2094
03:16:21,289 --> 03:16:23,750
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the thing with the affordability.

2095
03:16:23,790 --> 03:16:32,913
[SPEAKER_25]: There's only so much we can do in this neighborhood if we want to keep things within the dimensional incentives, within the dimensional limits.

2096
03:16:33,393 --> 03:16:38,034
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we pass this, or if we provide a recommendation, let's say this is fine as is.

2097
03:16:42,825 --> 03:16:47,451
[SPEAKER_21]: And it goes to city council and they say, yeah, great, we're going to pass it.

2098
03:16:48,832 --> 03:16:56,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any opportunity to reopen this incentive, these incentive bonuses for future

2099
03:16:57,667 --> 03:17:02,748
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that's the whole idea is we're looking 30 years in the future, just as an example.

2100
03:17:03,488 --> 03:17:05,449
[SPEAKER_27]: And it might not happen today.

2101
03:17:05,509 --> 03:17:07,589
[SPEAKER_27]: It might not happen 10 years from now.

2102
03:17:08,129 --> 03:17:12,270
[SPEAKER_27]: But if it's zoned appropriately, it could happen down the road.

2103
03:17:13,211 --> 03:17:17,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I guess my question is like if, because in Salem Street, like we're talking about a certain scale.

2104
03:17:18,612 --> 03:17:18,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

2105
03:17:19,352 --> 03:17:22,613
[SPEAKER_21]: So hold on, Annie, if we're going to

2106
03:17:24,505 --> 03:17:27,066
[SPEAKER_21]: apply, like theoretically have standards across the whole city.

2107
03:17:27,866 --> 03:17:38,389
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe we want to say like, you know, two additional stories for, you know, 30% AMI, or however we decide to say it.

2108
03:17:40,070 --> 03:17:41,811
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be opportunities down the road.

2109
03:17:41,871 --> 03:17:42,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, Annie.

2110
03:17:42,771 --> 03:17:43,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm asking Emily.

2111
03:17:44,151 --> 03:17:48,853
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be opportunities down the road to say, yes, we can change these things.

2112
03:17:49,233 --> 03:17:49,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2113
03:17:50,767 --> 03:18:04,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, at the end of this process, when we bring all of the districts back together and we look and see, so let's just say for the sake of the argument, because it's the easiest one, say you said, look, Salem Street doesn't need a fountain or a water element.

2114
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:06,491
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't make sense for Salem Street.

2115
03:18:07,011 --> 03:18:10,872
[SPEAKER_14]: So you would modify, you would take it out using this example.

2116
03:18:11,292 --> 03:18:16,993
[SPEAKER_14]: you would recommend to the city council that they take it out, and then that would happen for Salem Street.

2117
03:18:17,073 --> 03:18:25,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when we come back, we would say, hey, does a fountain still apply for the other places that have already passed that we put it in?

2118
03:18:25,695 --> 03:18:25,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2119
03:18:27,095 --> 03:18:36,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So then you have a new incentive zoning section that says, here are all the incentives, asterisks, the fountain does not apply in Salem Street.

2120
03:18:38,337 --> 03:18:40,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make that opportunity to come back.

2121
03:18:40,858 --> 03:18:42,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're talking about Salem Street.

2122
03:18:42,399 --> 03:18:45,861
[SPEAKER_21]: We're hearing from Salem Street neighbors and concerned residents.

2123
03:18:46,321 --> 03:18:51,984
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to make decisions on Salem Street based on the whole city.

2124
03:18:52,004 --> 03:18:53,925
[SPEAKER_21]: That scope doesn't feel right.

2125
03:18:54,205 --> 03:18:56,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm glad that there's an opportunity to revisit.

2126
03:18:57,227 --> 03:19:00,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Paula, I see your hand and it's been up for a little bit, so I just want to pass it for a second.

2127
03:19:01,789 --> 03:19:02,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2128
03:19:02,330 --> 03:19:06,952
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing that we also heard from the neighbors and maybe we can bring that is that

2129
03:19:08,067 --> 03:19:19,979
[SPEAKER_18]: In order to not have every building to have a fountain that we can limit by, so if there is one every half a mile, you cannot have another one.

2130
03:19:19,999 --> 03:19:24,764
[SPEAKER_18]: So you cannot have that incentive if there is already one on the street.

2131
03:19:26,123 --> 03:19:30,829
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't have 10 of fountains in the same street.

2132
03:19:31,169 --> 03:19:33,553
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something that we could add if people are interested.

2133
03:19:33,633 --> 03:19:34,254
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that.

2134
03:19:34,634 --> 03:19:41,464
[SPEAKER_21]: And honestly, I don't think a fountain should give anybody any... It's the water that watered the trees.

2135
03:19:46,954 --> 03:19:51,695
[SPEAKER_18]: So for some senior people, the water is very important when they walk.

2136
03:19:52,295 --> 03:19:55,516
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that having fountains, it is important.

2137
03:19:56,116 --> 03:19:58,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we can reduce.

2138
03:19:58,617 --> 03:20:00,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of having a half story, they can have less.

2139
03:20:01,738 --> 03:20:05,699
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do recommend to maintain it, especially if you want to have a walkable neighborhood.

2140
03:20:05,719 --> 03:20:06,539
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

2141
03:20:07,499 --> 03:20:15,601
[SPEAKER_27]: Same as all the other features that you have laid out, Paula, in the drawings.

2142
03:20:16,438 --> 03:20:25,161
[SPEAKER_27]: the plans with having the wide sidewalks and all the other features.

2143
03:20:26,521 --> 03:20:44,107
[SPEAKER_27]: For recommendation, to your point, Emily, that when we look at the housing, is it even on Salem Street, depending on the building, is it possible to add two more apartments?

2144
03:20:46,118 --> 03:20:47,439
[SPEAKER_27]: four to six apartments.

2145
03:20:47,479 --> 03:20:49,921
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all I was trying to get at.

2146
03:20:50,642 --> 03:20:50,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2147
03:20:51,523 --> 03:21:03,493
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that'll be accomplished by the recommendation of aligning the, uh, the multifamily residential zone more closely with the urban residential one zoning.

2148
03:21:03,533 --> 03:21:09,858
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's one that's one that really works as a, as a recommendation to city council, because both of those are specific things.

2149
03:21:10,819 --> 03:21:11,520
[SPEAKER_25]: So we can say,

2150
03:21:12,007 --> 03:21:16,890
[SPEAKER_25]: we want this to go from being modeled on this specific thing to being modeled on this specific thing.

2151
03:21:16,950 --> 03:21:26,755
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's something that I think for Emily and Paula to go back to and edit something for city council, that's going to be, I think, the easiest one.

2152
03:21:28,637 --> 03:21:32,739
[SPEAKER_27]: That makes total sense, since we were heading that way anyway.

2153
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:36,961
[SPEAKER_21]: So making sure that we're wrapping up this incentive zoning thing.

2154
03:21:39,762 --> 03:21:50,807
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with the focus on affordability and climate, but within the context of Salem Street, we might not have specific modifications within the menu right now, is what I'm hearing.

2155
03:21:51,107 --> 03:21:54,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless it's decreased fountain to a quarter of a story.

2156
03:21:54,909 --> 03:21:57,050
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the one we keep picking on, I feel bad.

2157
03:21:58,931 --> 03:22:04,173
[SPEAKER_21]: But Emily, would you mind throwing up the menu again just so we can give it another look through?

2158
03:22:04,725 --> 03:22:05,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, of course.

2159
03:22:05,646 --> 03:22:11,735
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't want to interfere with the talking as well, so people's abilities to see their faces.

2160
03:22:12,456 --> 03:22:14,439
[SPEAKER_14]: So hang on, I navigated away from it.

2161
03:22:14,479 --> 03:22:15,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just jump back.

2162
03:22:15,981 --> 03:22:19,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a lot of screens open for you right now.

2163
03:22:19,025 --> 03:22:19,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2164
03:22:25,869 --> 03:22:26,450
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

2165
03:22:26,610 --> 03:22:27,791
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me just start at the top.

2166
03:22:27,831 --> 03:22:39,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say that the affordability incentives were very closely tied to other parts of the zoning, which is why I recommend maybe not, it's not that you can't change them.

2167
03:22:39,821 --> 03:22:47,328
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't necessarily change them without a lot more discussion and work, but here are the community and amenities.

2168
03:22:49,250 --> 03:22:50,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Indoor pedestrian, scenic, outdoor.

2169
03:22:56,672 --> 03:23:00,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Number item one, indoor pedestrian seating or outdoor pedestrian plaza.

2170
03:23:00,595 --> 03:23:05,098
[SPEAKER_21]: That speaks to me of like privately owned public spaces, which never go well.

2171
03:23:05,958 --> 03:23:06,859
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe that's.

2172
03:23:08,320 --> 03:23:10,722
[SPEAKER_25]: And maybe reduce that.

2173
03:23:12,003 --> 03:23:12,203
[SPEAKER_25]: Well.

2174
03:23:13,283 --> 03:23:14,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

2175
03:23:14,184 --> 03:23:15,865
[SPEAKER_25]: Reduce that in Fountain to a quarter.

2176
03:23:17,326 --> 03:23:18,827
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's the next step down from a half.

2177
03:23:18,847 --> 03:23:25,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because I don't equate indoor seating with a pocket park, garden, playground, skate park bank.

2178
03:23:27,969 --> 03:23:33,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Neighborhood open spaces should be more than pedestrian and fountains.

2179
03:23:34,736 --> 03:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_21]: As somebody who works in renewables, love, love, love a good community solar.

2180
03:23:40,803 --> 03:23:43,565
[SPEAKER_21]: But I see those incentives are to be confirmed so I'll accept those.

2181
03:23:44,366 --> 03:23:49,932
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still doing the research on those to make sure we get it right so the same thing for the public parking we have to.

2182
03:23:50,213 --> 03:23:53,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's part of the parking conversation in the spring, so it's not.

2183
03:23:54,337 --> 03:23:56,760
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want to do it it's just we haven't gotten to that point.

2184
03:23:57,220 --> 03:23:57,961
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that.

2185
03:23:57,981 --> 03:23:59,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay streetscape improvements.

2186
03:24:02,005 --> 03:24:04,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we be more specific about streetscape improvements?

2187
03:24:05,186 --> 03:24:06,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, is it is it is it?

2188
03:24:06,786 --> 03:24:08,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know.

2189
03:24:09,347 --> 03:24:10,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

2190
03:24:10,708 --> 03:24:18,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been having a conversation with director hunt about that because certain things are already required and especially in the special permit process.

2191
03:24:18,690 --> 03:24:24,532
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do need to confirm that level of detail, but I think that's where it gets into the, the.

2192
03:24:25,452 --> 03:24:36,903
[SPEAKER_14]: the how the street trees are added right there, there are certain levels that you can put them in and in terms of using structural soil, how big is the tree pit, etc, etc.

2193
03:24:37,363 --> 03:24:44,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And also whether or not we have those, the, you know, request benches along the street for people to rest on or other street furniture.

2194
03:24:47,152 --> 03:24:48,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm okay with some ambiguity there.

2195
03:24:52,060 --> 03:24:53,780
[SPEAKER_21]: And then vibrant neighborhoods.

2196
03:24:54,821 --> 03:24:56,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just pull it to the top of the page.

2197
03:24:56,421 --> 03:24:57,541
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that'd be great.

2198
03:25:03,443 --> 03:25:08,024
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the rest of these are fine within the scale of Salem Street.

2199
03:25:08,864 --> 03:25:17,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Now that I think about it, that commercial space all the way to the east.

2200
03:25:23,584 --> 03:25:24,185
[SPEAKER_21]: No, nevermind.

2201
03:25:24,825 --> 03:25:25,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Nevermind.

2202
03:25:26,466 --> 03:25:26,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2203
03:25:32,389 --> 03:25:38,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any other of these incentive menu items that members of the board want to revisit?

2204
03:25:38,652 --> 03:25:45,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Any that we should jack up or slice down?

2205
03:25:47,617 --> 03:25:50,379
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I'm good with these as they stand for now, I think.

2206
03:25:51,039 --> 03:25:51,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2207
03:25:51,319 --> 03:25:52,620
[SPEAKER_25]: In the context of Salem Street,

2208
03:25:53,381 --> 03:25:55,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2209
03:25:55,143 --> 03:26:00,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Given these recommendations, we've just thought through.

2210
03:26:00,667 --> 03:26:08,374
[SPEAKER_25]: And just to confirm, with that, we're reducing indoor seating slash outdoor plaza and fountain to a quarter story each from a half.

2211
03:26:08,534 --> 03:26:09,235
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what we're doing?

2212
03:26:09,255 --> 03:26:09,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2213
03:26:10,496 --> 03:26:11,116
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, gotcha.

2214
03:26:11,397 --> 03:26:17,682
[SPEAKER_25]: So I've got so far for recommendations to council, I've got that and the multifamily residential adjustment.

2215
03:26:18,403 --> 03:26:18,543
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2216
03:26:22,504 --> 03:26:26,146
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's late, but I think in the spirit of trying to get it right.

2217
03:26:27,026 --> 03:26:38,731
[SPEAKER_24]: The one on the parking incentive, it's a half story if the building buries the parking or conceals the parking.

2218
03:26:39,852 --> 03:26:41,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Below grade, yes.

2219
03:26:41,173 --> 03:26:41,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Below grade.

2220
03:26:41,953 --> 03:26:46,595
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I might make the recommendation to do a full story.

2221
03:26:46,615 --> 03:26:49,777
[SPEAKER_24]: If the thing that we're trying to encourage is

2222
03:26:50,796 --> 03:27:01,758
[SPEAKER_24]: a vibrant, active street front that, yeah, has density and ground floor, I don't know.

2223
03:27:02,758 --> 03:27:03,578
[SPEAKER_21]: What is it currently?

2224
03:27:03,758 --> 03:27:04,839
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it was a full story.

2225
03:27:05,399 --> 03:27:06,519
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a half story.

2226
03:27:06,539 --> 03:27:07,419
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a half story?

2227
03:27:08,079 --> 03:27:08,359
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2228
03:27:09,859 --> 03:27:17,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, thinking of the cost of putting parking underground, it's a big cash prize, especially in areas like Medford with

2229
03:27:18,670 --> 03:27:21,512
[SPEAKER_21]: all the exciting stuff we have going on underground already.

2230
03:27:21,532 --> 03:27:24,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I would agree.

2231
03:27:24,074 --> 03:27:25,014
[SPEAKER_21]: I would agree, Adam.

2232
03:27:25,635 --> 03:27:27,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, I know you're a transportation guru.

2233
03:27:28,116 --> 03:27:32,059
[SPEAKER_21]: And Annie, I don't know if you have any other insight here, too.

2234
03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:34,100
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, we were talking about concealing the parking.

2235
03:27:35,261 --> 03:27:35,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2236
03:27:35,981 --> 03:27:41,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I mean, it just seems to me like a pretty big expense that I don't know if I have story.

2237
03:27:41,605 --> 03:27:43,126
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, I agree.

2238
03:27:43,666 --> 03:27:46,648
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I was trying to understand from the discussion.

2239
03:27:46,668 --> 03:27:48,149
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like, it is a big expense.

2240
03:27:49,090 --> 03:27:54,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Parking as it is is a big expense, and concealed parking even more so.

2241
03:27:54,874 --> 03:28:04,099
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do think if what we're saying is, this is a big expense, let's reward it appropriately, then I do think I support going after people.

2242
03:28:04,119 --> 03:28:06,741
[SPEAKER_21]: A big expense that would support our goals for.

2243
03:28:06,861 --> 03:28:07,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2244
03:28:07,641 --> 03:28:07,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2245
03:28:08,382 --> 03:28:08,562
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

2246
03:28:08,622 --> 03:28:09,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2247
03:28:09,222 --> 03:28:09,703
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yeah.

2248
03:28:09,723 --> 03:28:13,245
[SPEAKER_25]: The concealed parking is something that supports our goals for a more vibrant community.

2249
03:28:13,345 --> 03:28:16,167
[SPEAKER_25]: And it is something that if you're doing it, it's expensive to do.

2250
03:28:16,187 --> 03:28:17,988
[SPEAKER_25]: So let's reward that.

2251
03:28:18,792 --> 03:28:20,392
[SPEAKER_25]: it's commensurate with its expense.

2252
03:28:23,313 --> 03:28:24,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2253
03:28:24,033 --> 03:28:30,434
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the other things I'm looking through my notes from this evening and previous meetings, there's a lot of discussion around medical office.

2254
03:28:31,874 --> 03:28:37,415
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if that's something we want to jump into.

2255
03:28:37,435 --> 03:28:46,237
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the provisions that have been made overall support

2256
03:28:47,814 --> 03:28:50,636
[SPEAKER_21]: the preferences of the community while maintaining flexibility.

2257
03:28:51,457 --> 03:28:52,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, there is some.

2258
03:28:52,457 --> 03:28:56,060
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, there are still medical uses allowed.

2259
03:28:56,500 --> 03:28:56,920
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2260
03:28:57,080 --> 03:29:00,943
[SPEAKER_25]: To define cases, clinic is still allowed as defined in state law.

2261
03:29:02,864 --> 03:29:07,647
[SPEAKER_21]: And in some areas per our board's special permit.

2262
03:29:10,069 --> 03:29:10,649
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, neighborhood.

2263
03:29:10,909 --> 03:29:12,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Emily, was I mistaken?

2264
03:29:12,390 --> 03:29:16,273
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought I saw that there's or that's just a definition that was added and it wasn't

2265
03:29:17,173 --> 03:29:20,855
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, sorry, the computer screen was not letting me hit my audio.

2266
03:29:20,955 --> 03:29:30,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the definition was added because it may be appropriate in other parts of the city, but clinic is not allowed.

2267
03:29:30,281 --> 03:29:32,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Medical office is not allowed.

2268
03:29:32,102 --> 03:29:34,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Neighborhood medical office is not allowed.

2269
03:29:34,803 --> 03:29:35,444
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was thinking.

2270
03:29:35,624 --> 03:29:37,445
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I was thinking, the neighborhood medical office.

2271
03:29:37,485 --> 03:29:41,247
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's the one that I think was, I think that seems,

2272
03:29:42,304 --> 03:29:46,765
[SPEAKER_25]: That seems to make sense, given the neighborhood context, at least, at this present time.

2273
03:29:46,825 --> 03:29:52,967
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think I'm fine with that for medical uses for now.

2274
03:29:53,887 --> 03:29:54,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2275
03:29:54,287 --> 03:29:54,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2276
03:29:54,487 --> 03:30:01,809
[SPEAKER_21]: We had members of the public speak about being able to walk to a dentist or find an accessible provider within the area.

2277
03:30:01,869 --> 03:30:05,890
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think those sort of uses would work.

2278
03:30:06,470 --> 03:30:06,770
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2279
03:30:10,151 --> 03:30:10,271
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

2280
03:30:12,834 --> 03:30:33,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Just to summarize for the members of the board and city staff, what we have right now is recommendations to city council recommend aligning the multifamily residential zones more closely with the urban residential one rather than the current neighborhood residential three.

2281
03:30:34,680 --> 03:30:39,421
[SPEAKER_25]: We have reduce the zoning incentive,

2282
03:30:40,883 --> 03:30:54,387
[SPEAKER_25]: incentive for indoor seating, outdoor plaza, and fountain to a quarter story from the current half, and increase the incentive for concealed parking up to a full story from a half.

2283
03:30:58,028 --> 03:31:01,889
[SPEAKER_25]: And that is the recommendations as I have them summarized from our discussion.

2284
03:31:01,909 --> 03:31:05,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2285
03:31:06,870 --> 03:31:07,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Paula?

2286
03:31:10,837 --> 03:31:18,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I just wanted to say that in the beginning, there was the conversation about the section and the sidewalks.

2287
03:31:19,242 --> 03:31:20,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2288
03:31:20,263 --> 03:31:22,865
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a study in sections.

2289
03:31:23,185 --> 03:31:25,847
[SPEAKER_18]: We did it for Mystic and for Salem.

2290
03:31:27,728 --> 03:31:30,490
[SPEAKER_18]: We used the recommendations from the NACTO.

2291
03:31:30,530 --> 03:31:34,252
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the National Association of City Transportation Officials.

2292
03:31:35,513 --> 03:31:37,234
[SPEAKER_18]: And we tried to really make it

2293
03:31:39,708 --> 03:31:47,871
[SPEAKER_18]: The minimum, because we know that it's very tight, so the minimum to have a walkable street.

2294
03:31:48,431 --> 03:31:55,454
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm just going to share, it's going to be a very small image, but just to have a little bit of that idea in section, what does it mean?

2295
03:31:55,474 --> 03:31:56,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.

2296
03:32:15,104 --> 03:32:18,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you see my screen?

2297
03:32:18,929 --> 03:32:22,693
[SPEAKER_18]: So these are the different types of sidewalks.

2298
03:32:22,753 --> 03:32:23,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that it's in meters.

2299
03:32:25,457 --> 03:32:26,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry for that.

2300
03:32:26,478 --> 03:32:28,841
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you look into the one that says four,

2301
03:32:29,818 --> 03:32:35,302
[SPEAKER_18]: this is more or less what we are planning for Salem Street.

2302
03:32:35,822 --> 03:32:36,963
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's nothing crazy.

2303
03:32:37,003 --> 03:32:50,872
[SPEAKER_18]: We would have some green to really have the buffer to make it more walkable and safe, to be able to plant trees that are decent, and then to be able to walk people side by side, not one after the other.

2304
03:32:52,337 --> 03:32:58,000
[SPEAKER_18]: This will take like three feet in some areas and some other areas in Salem won't take any.

2305
03:32:59,441 --> 03:33:11,707
[SPEAKER_18]: So we just want to make it continue as much as possible and then whenever we don't have green we can have some benches or we can have some furniture like lighting or any other.

2306
03:33:13,328 --> 03:33:25,436
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we really think that this is more or less that for having a minimum of eight for a sidewalk and that is the minimum recommendation from NACTO to have as continuous walking and then on the side.

2307
03:33:25,456 --> 03:33:26,477
[SPEAKER_21]: This is super helpful.

2308
03:33:27,277 --> 03:33:28,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, okay, perfect.

2309
03:33:29,159 --> 03:33:32,841
[SPEAKER_18]: So, this is why we really strongly recommend to leave the 12.

2310
03:33:33,822 --> 03:33:41,707
[SPEAKER_18]: It is taking a little bit of the lots, we really understand, but we are making an effort to make this really

2311
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:49,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And in those conversations, they really agreed that this is what that street needed.

2312
03:33:49,861 --> 03:33:50,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to share that.

2313
03:33:51,482 --> 03:33:53,742
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, these are great street sections.

2314
03:33:54,663 --> 03:33:55,663
[SPEAKER_21]: I love a good diagram.

2315
03:33:55,683 --> 03:33:58,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you mind leaving it up for a second?

2316
03:33:58,484 --> 03:33:59,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, sure.

2317
03:33:59,124 --> 03:33:59,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

2318
03:33:59,704 --> 03:34:01,104
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're talking about it.

2319
03:34:02,645 --> 03:34:02,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

2320
03:34:03,025 --> 03:34:03,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2321
03:34:04,649 --> 03:34:10,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and one of the concerns that we heard again and again from members of the public is around safety.

2322
03:34:11,972 --> 03:34:28,600
[SPEAKER_21]: And if Salem Street, as it is now, continues to be a highly trafficked road, we want to make sure that the pedestrians and residents and users have enough space to occupy the sidewalk and not have to be pushed out into the road.

2323
03:34:30,275 --> 03:34:34,216
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, seeing this like this, I like the 12 feet.

2324
03:34:34,356 --> 03:34:46,278
[SPEAKER_21]: And hearing that in some areas, it would take 3 feet of space, but most of the time, it'd be fine, brings me more comfort with it.

2325
03:34:46,478 --> 03:34:47,198
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

2326
03:34:48,478 --> 03:34:51,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, just a clarification, not in most areas, but in some will be fine.

2327
03:34:52,039 --> 03:34:54,959
[SPEAKER_18]: In some, they have to give that more or less 3 feet.

2328
03:34:55,339 --> 03:34:55,439
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

2329
03:34:55,699 --> 03:34:55,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2330
03:34:57,260 --> 03:34:57,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Understood.

2331
03:34:59,800 --> 03:34:59,880
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

2332
03:35:05,103 --> 03:35:08,166
[SPEAKER_21]: All right board, what are we thinking?

2333
03:35:09,308 --> 03:35:15,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there more recommendations we want to put down?

2334
03:35:15,154 --> 03:35:18,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there more thinking we need to do?

2335
03:35:18,177 --> 03:35:19,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there more we need to hear?

2336
03:35:19,659 --> 03:35:25,165
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I kind of,

2337
03:35:26,003 --> 03:35:28,185
[SPEAKER_25]: like the direction of the discussions we have.

2338
03:35:28,245 --> 03:35:38,334
[SPEAKER_25]: And I personally would be good going forward with our recommendations and passing it down the line to city council for their further thoughts.

2339
03:35:41,517 --> 03:35:46,581
[SPEAKER_21]: When we pass it to city council, they can make changes on the floor.

2340
03:35:47,021 --> 03:35:47,262
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2341
03:35:47,402 --> 03:35:47,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2342
03:35:48,363 --> 03:35:53,207
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would encourage members of the public to continue to advocate for

2343
03:35:56,112 --> 03:36:01,714
[SPEAKER_21]: the topics that they're passionate about, whether it's more housing or safety or uses.

2344
03:36:01,734 --> 03:36:19,720
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel confident that the board, with the support of the city and its associates, has done our due diligence around public comments, around our scope of the board.

2345
03:36:19,740 --> 03:36:24,082
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, I'd also be comfortable passing a recommendation

2346
03:36:25,537 --> 03:36:29,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie, Adam, how are you all feeling?

2347
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:32,580
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, Adam, I didn't catch that.

2348
03:36:33,580 --> 03:36:34,441
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd be comfortable too.

2349
03:36:35,141 --> 03:36:35,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2350
03:36:37,282 --> 03:36:38,162
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, me too.

2351
03:36:39,143 --> 03:36:39,483
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2352
03:36:39,823 --> 03:36:51,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so with that, I'm going to move to, what's the formal term to what we're doing?

2353
03:36:51,128 --> 03:36:52,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we approving with recommendations?

2354
03:36:54,493 --> 03:37:05,478
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a motion to recommend approval of the draft zoning as revised with recommendations from the Community Development Board.

2355
03:37:05,518 --> 03:37:09,920
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, so moved.

2356
03:37:11,621 --> 03:37:12,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for a second.

2357
03:37:13,822 --> 03:37:15,123
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll second that motion.

2358
03:37:15,143 --> 03:37:17,063
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't second yourself, Peter.

2359
03:37:18,004 --> 03:37:18,784
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't.

2360
03:37:18,804 --> 03:37:19,885
[SPEAKER_25]: That was Adam.

2361
03:37:21,642 --> 03:37:22,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for clarification.

2362
03:37:24,024 --> 03:37:25,225
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam, feel free to second anybody.

2363
03:37:26,226 --> 03:37:28,889
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, we're going to do a roll call vote.

2364
03:37:31,431 --> 03:37:32,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Calves?

2365
03:37:33,373 --> 03:37:33,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2366
03:37:34,854 --> 03:37:35,455
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

2367
03:37:36,196 --> 03:37:36,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2368
03:37:37,297 --> 03:37:37,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens?

2369
03:37:38,918 --> 03:37:39,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

2370
03:37:40,219 --> 03:37:42,762
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

2371
03:37:44,159 --> 03:37:52,701
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, we recommend approval of the draft zoning as revised for the recommendations from the Community Development Board.

2372
03:37:53,882 --> 03:37:58,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I encourage members of the public to continue dialogue around this, reach out to your city councilors.

2373
03:38:02,344 --> 03:38:10,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, thank you all so much for your just commitment to making Medford just such a great place to live.

2374
03:38:13,738 --> 03:38:15,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Really appreciate everybody's time this evening.

2375
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:24,067
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia or Danielle, is there anything else we need to do around this to make sure we're kind of putting a bow on it?

2376
03:38:25,702 --> 03:38:29,003
[SPEAKER_16]: messaged Emily to make sure that she felt confident.

2377
03:38:29,103 --> 03:38:34,485
[SPEAKER_16]: We may need to review the video to capture all of the recommendations and write it all up.

2378
03:38:35,405 --> 03:38:49,229
[SPEAKER_16]: I expect, I think this is usually Danielle's process, but we're gonna ask Emily's team to package it all up so that what we're sending are the changes from the original that was referred out by the city council.

2379
03:38:50,788 --> 03:38:55,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I think that we usually run all the, like a decision by you.

2380
03:38:55,970 --> 03:39:08,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We will definitely send you the document so that you can read through it and make sure that you, we heard you like, cause we're going to take the words said verbally and put them on paper.

2381
03:39:08,155 --> 03:39:10,856
[SPEAKER_21]: And it sounds like Peter also took some notes.

2382
03:39:10,976 --> 03:39:14,017
[SPEAKER_21]: So Peter, if you can share those with Alicia and Danielle.

2383
03:39:14,752 --> 03:39:15,233
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be great.

2384
03:39:15,253 --> 03:39:15,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, yeah.

2385
03:39:15,635 --> 03:39:20,909
[SPEAKER_25]: I took my regular, well, for what a lot of developments would be, my condition notes.

2386
03:39:22,162 --> 03:39:22,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

2387
03:39:22,762 --> 03:39:26,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you only tough thing is it just so you're aware we are trying to move it.

2388
03:39:27,084 --> 03:39:33,147
[SPEAKER_16]: We're only trying to move it quickly because the city council continued till next Tuesday, which is the 11th.

2389
03:39:33,728 --> 03:39:39,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if we don't get it to them for their ability to vote next Tuesday, it goes out another two weeks.

2390
03:39:40,411 --> 03:39:43,252
[SPEAKER_16]: And they, you know, we just don't want to drag it out forever.

2391
03:39:43,272 --> 03:39:44,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2392
03:39:45,153 --> 03:39:45,313
[SPEAKER_16]: But

2393
03:39:47,242 --> 03:39:47,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2394
03:39:48,603 --> 03:39:54,889
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also want to extend a thank you to Emily and Pella for your very thorough process.

2395
03:39:55,790 --> 03:39:57,191
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you've made this much stronger.

2396
03:39:57,211 --> 03:40:04,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your responsiveness to the board, to the city, to the public.

2397
03:40:05,498 --> 03:40:09,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I look forward to seeing how this all works out.

2398
03:40:10,403 --> 03:40:11,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2399
03:40:11,644 --> 03:40:12,985
[SPEAKER_14]: And we appreciate your time.

2400
03:40:13,607 --> 03:40:16,371
[SPEAKER_14]: effort and energy and also the people who spoke today.

2401
03:40:16,391 --> 03:40:19,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I think all the voices are making it a much stronger process.

2402
03:40:19,675 --> 03:40:30,068
[SPEAKER_14]: So we appreciate people taking time out to to share their thoughts, their concerns and you know where they think we've gone right and where they think you know the zoning needs more work.

2403
03:40:30,188 --> 03:40:31,570
[SPEAKER_14]: So really appreciate them.

2404
03:40:32,228 --> 03:40:42,093
[SPEAKER_21]: And the last thing I'll say to members of the public is that a couple of us on the board have our terms coming to an end or expiring the middle of this summer.

2405
03:40:42,653 --> 03:40:52,138
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd encourage anybody that's super passionate about this work, super passionate about Medford to apply for community development board positions.

2406
03:40:53,679 --> 03:40:56,240
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been doing it, I think for three, four years.

2407
03:40:56,260 --> 03:40:58,402
[SPEAKER_21]: It's super rewarding.

2408
03:40:58,422 --> 03:41:00,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know if Peter can speak to it too.

2409
03:41:01,323 --> 03:41:03,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we're coming up on two years.

2410
03:41:03,784 --> 03:41:05,684
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm one of the people whose terms are up in June.

2411
03:41:06,384 --> 03:41:07,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2412
03:41:07,825 --> 03:41:08,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2413
03:41:08,565 --> 03:41:11,646
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not going to make your money back.

2414
03:41:12,406 --> 03:41:16,847
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all owe the city of Medford a great debt for being a great place to live.

2415
03:41:16,927 --> 03:41:20,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And hopefully, we can all do what we can do to make it better.

2416
03:41:20,848 --> 03:41:22,949
[SPEAKER_21]: So fill out those applications.

2417
03:41:24,869 --> 03:41:26,990
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd love to have some of you on the board.

2418
03:41:29,049 --> 03:41:32,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool, all right, so our next agenda item is minutes.

2419
03:41:35,230 --> 03:41:37,771
[SPEAKER_21]: We have minutes from the 15th and the 5th.

2420
03:41:39,692 --> 03:41:49,074
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna look for, well, first of all, are there any comments from members of the board on those meeting minutes?

2421
03:41:51,794 --> 03:41:52,615
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have any.

2422
03:41:52,895 --> 03:41:53,355
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2423
03:41:53,835 --> 03:41:54,475
[SPEAKER_27]: They look great.

2424
03:41:57,281 --> 03:41:59,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, city staff has been doing a great job with those.

2425
03:42:00,942 --> 03:42:01,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

2426
03:42:03,103 --> 03:42:11,166
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I'm going to look for is a motion to accept and approve the two sets of meeting minutes for January 15th and February 5th.

2427
03:42:14,567 --> 03:42:22,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll make a motion to approve both sets of meeting minutes for the 15th and February 5th.

2428
03:42:23,810 --> 03:42:24,431
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Annie.

2429
03:42:24,551 --> 03:42:25,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for a second.

2430
03:42:27,305 --> 03:42:28,066
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll second that.

2431
03:42:28,767 --> 03:42:29,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Adam.

2432
03:42:29,949 --> 03:42:30,589
[SPEAKER_21]: I recognize it.

2433
03:42:30,649 --> 03:42:33,754
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we're gonna do a roll call vote.

2434
03:42:34,555 --> 03:42:35,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Calves?

2435
03:42:36,577 --> 03:42:36,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

2436
03:42:37,619 --> 03:42:38,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

2437
03:42:39,121 --> 03:42:39,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2438
03:42:40,242 --> 03:42:40,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens?

2439
03:42:41,944 --> 03:42:42,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2440
03:42:42,885 --> 03:42:44,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Myself, Emily Hedeman, am an aye.

2441
03:42:48,431 --> 03:42:52,612
[SPEAKER_21]: So the next agenda item we have is zoning updates.

2442
03:42:53,513 --> 03:43:00,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing as we're rapidly approaching 11 o'clock, I'm just going to ask city staff if they have any quick high-level updates.

2443
03:43:03,715 --> 03:43:10,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chair, the residential zoning was voted out of committee last week.

2444
03:43:11,277 --> 03:43:11,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that right, Alicia?

2445
03:43:15,311 --> 03:43:18,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we'll be going to city council to be referred.

2446
03:43:18,714 --> 03:43:22,777
[SPEAKER_15]: So that will be the next coming before you.

2447
03:43:24,678 --> 03:43:26,540
[SPEAKER_16]: You got a little bit of a taste tonight.

2448
03:43:27,262 --> 03:43:30,364
[SPEAKER_16]: That and the change in the MBTA zoning.

2449
03:43:30,644 --> 03:43:30,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2450
03:43:31,525 --> 03:43:32,065
[SPEAKER_15]: That's next.

2451
03:43:32,165 --> 03:43:33,566
[SPEAKER_15]: That's next meeting, actually.

2452
03:43:33,586 --> 03:43:34,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2453
03:43:34,866 --> 03:43:36,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, we have public comments.

2454
03:43:36,948 --> 03:43:45,833
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very, it's a very minor change to the MBTA zoning that is being proposed by one of the property owners and we are in supportive of it.

2455
03:43:46,693 --> 03:43:46,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

2456
03:43:47,874 --> 03:43:48,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

2457
03:43:52,637 --> 03:43:56,659
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, I am looking for a motion to adjourn.

2458
03:43:56,979 --> 03:43:58,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless, is there any other business?

2459
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:00,641
[SPEAKER_21]: No, seeing none.

2460
03:44:00,981 --> 03:44:01,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2461
03:44:01,641 --> 03:44:03,062
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a motion to adjourn.

2462
03:44:03,082 --> 03:44:08,844
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll move to adjourn.

2463
03:44:09,965 --> 03:44:10,885
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a second.

2464
03:44:11,765 --> 03:44:13,366
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll second that motion.

2465
03:44:14,006 --> 03:44:14,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2466
03:44:14,447 --> 03:44:15,807
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do a roll call vote.

2467
03:44:16,387 --> 03:44:16,988

2468
03:44:18,188 --> 03:44:18,288

[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

2473
03:44:24,268 --> 03:44:28,130
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Henneman, am also an aye for the adjournment.

2474
03:44:29,411 --> 03:44:37,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to city staff for your tireless effort and support in these issues.

2475
03:44:37,195 --> 03:44:38,335
[SPEAKER_21]: We could not do this without you.

2476
03:44:40,116 --> 03:44:41,997
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you to members of the public for coming out.

2477
03:44:45,319 --> 03:44:46,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, anything else?

2478
03:44:46,700 --> 03:44:47,620
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

2479
03:44:48,221 --> 03:44:49,001
[SPEAKER_21]: No, drop the mic.

2480
03:44:50,513 --> 03:44:51,775
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, have a nice evening, everyone.

2481
