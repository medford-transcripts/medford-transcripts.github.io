Councilor Knight. Present. Councilor Marks. Present. Councilor Morrell. Present. Councilor Scarpelli. Present. President Falco.

00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:54,757
President, all seven members are present. At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise and salute the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you.

3
00:00:56,022 --> 00:01:15,513

6
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:36,547
At this point, I want to recognize Vice President Caviello, who would like to make a statement. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a statement, a partial statement for myself and some of my other counselors. And if you indulge me, I'd like to read it to you. Please. Good evening. We are angry and we should be. It is the natural response to a senseless and tragic and preventable act. This time, that senseless, tragic act

7
00:02:36,884 --> 00:03:04,289
tragic and preventable act was the death of George Floyd this time. In times of tragedy, it's so common there is offer of thoughts and prayers, and when the dust settles, the perpetual systematic failures continue without address. The conversation about race can no longer be a side issue.

8
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:36,098
We need to face the uncomfortable fact that Medford is not perfect. For those of you who feel you have no voice, we hear you. We are listening. We want you to feel and to be free, to express your opinion and to do so without fear of punishment or reprisal. We recognize the need to be better and we will work with you. Topic is not something we cannot run from. It's something we need to address and embrace. And you have our commitment to do so. Respectfully signed by counselors,

9
00:03:36,453 --> 00:04:02,525
Caviello, Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Kelly, and Councilor Mox. Thank you. Thank you Councilor for your comments. Thank you very much. I apologize Councilor Knight. Motion to revert back to regular order of business. Thank you very much Mr. President. Thank you very much for your comments. On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business. Please call the roll. Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

10
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:25,913
That's a bears. Yes. Vice President care of yellow. Yes. Council night. Yes. Council marks. Yes. That's a morale. Yes. That's a scrub Kelly. Yes. President Falco. Yes. The motion passes hearings.

11
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:57,318

I'm also going to suspend the remainder of the reading and have the petitioner give a brief synopsis, Mr. President.

15
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:32,999
Yes, on the motion of Councilor Marks to get approved, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Do we have a representative on the line? Mr. President, I still need to take a roll call on this, I'm sorry. Mr. President, I still need to take a roll call on this, on the motion to waive the reading. On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Behrs, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs.

00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:55,898
Vice President Caravello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative. Do we have a representative from National Grid? I believe I saw Socrates here earlier. Oh, he is, I see him right here, okay.

17
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:24,164
I'm sorry. I was trying to unmute myself. I was trying to unmute myself. I'm sorry. So yes, for this one is basically a simple pole that we need to install near Woodrow Ave in Medford. It's just for feeder monitor. It's just for our circuit to be more reliable. That's what we need it for. Okay. So

18
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:48,633
If I may go on further, this has been approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions. The engineering division recommends that this grant of location be approved with the following conditions. Number one, the grant of location is limited to this one JO poll described in the GOL document as follows. National Grid will install one JO poll

19
00:07:48,987 --> 00:08:12,680
on Woodruff Ave beginning at a point approximately 200 feet east of the center line of the intersection of Bradbury Avenue and Woodruff Avenue. Two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division. The project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141A.

20
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:37,064
of the city ordinances prior to commencing work. Number three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted. National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation. Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind. Asphalt must be replaced with asphalt.

21
00:08:37,739 --> 00:09:06,275
Number four, the new pole location is located adjacent to granite curbing. Any disturbance of the curb or curb concrete backing must be repaired to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Number five, the new pole location is in a landscaped area with trees. The city of Medford tree warden should inspect the trees before and after construction. Tree protection should be required and coordinated with the Medford tree warden.

22
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:34,625
That's approved by the superintendent of wire. So at this point, I'll declare the public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition. Socrates, you're in favor, I assume? Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Okay. Is there anyone else here in favor of the petition that would like to speak in favor of this petition? Okay.

23
00:09:37,325 --> 00:10:04,477
Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. Anyone here in opposition of the petition? Anyone in opposition? Anyone in opposition? Clerk Cardavis, you see anybody in opposition? I don't see any. Okay.

24
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:23,832
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any questions for Socrates on this matter? Consul and I. Mr. President, thank you very much. Socrates, good to see you again this evening, Phil. Good to see you too.

25
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:49,178
A couple questions for you. Now this looks like it's a 200 foot trench. What's it going to be the typical trench that we used to see in a grounded in grounded inlay trench 18 inches right around the gutter the curb right along the curb? Yep. Okay, and is this you said it was for system upgrades for reliability circuit circuit or something?

26
00:10:50,866 --> 00:11:13,090
It's just to monitor the feeders that we have, existing feeders. It's just for a way for us to make it more reliable. Okay. And 200 feet grounded inlay, 18 inches from the curb. And then it says also that some of this work is going to be done in a wooded or treed area. Is that on city property?

27
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:40,580
I'm not too familiar with the area at the moment. I don't believe it's going to be any near that place, but I can double check. I can double check. No, it looks like the tree warden's involved, so it looks like it is. Okay, I appreciate you clarifying some of those questions that I have for you. Thank you very much. No problem. Any other questions from the council?

28
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:57,303
Thank you, Mr. President. This is more of a general statement and no reflection on National Grid, although they sometimes are part of the problem in the community, Mr. President. But of recent, I've been receiving a number of complaints regarding

29
00:11:57,303 --> 00:12:12,575
utility work on our streets. Just recently, Park Street had some utility work and a giant trench was dug the length of Park Street, and the work to put back the tar was less than shoddy, Mr. President.

30
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:39,457
and poses a safety concern for area residents. I would ask, Mr. President, at some point, I know we have a lot on our plate, but at some point that we set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss utility work in the community so we can address and make sure that when utility companies come in, that they restore our streets better than they were, Mr. President, and that no safety concerns exist while work takes place.

31
00:12:41,633 --> 00:13:06,136
Thank you, Councilor Marks. We can organize that at some point in time. I think that actually would be a good meeting to make sure that we resolve any issues and make sure that any utility companies that are coming in are basically repairing our roads to the original condition. So I thank you for bringing that forward. Any other questions from the council? Clerk Hernandez.

32
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:35,279
Is Councilor Marks' request an amendment, or is it just a request for the Council to take up? I don't want to do it on their petition, so I would just put in a request to the Council President to kindly set up a meeting regarding utility work in this community. Thank you for clarifying, Councilor. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Any other questions from the Council? Any other questions from the public?

33
00:13:35,988 --> 00:14:05,857
No emails on this topic. Mr. President, I am hoping we can add a condition onto the granting of this location that when the work is complete, the street will be swept. We've seen Park Street, as Councilor Mark mentioned, Stearns Avenue, Golden Avenue, where a lot of public utility work has been performed, trenching the length of the street to replace pipes and the like. And what happens is,

34
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:25,364
You know, they dig a 200-foot-long trench, and they have a great system of doing it. I mean, they're very efficient. They take all the stone out of the ground, all the dirt out of the ground. They put it on the street. They do the work that they have to get done while the street's closed. They put all the sand and dirt back in the hole. They seal it up. But there is debris left over, Mr. President. There are rocks and stuff like that that kick up.

35
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:53,680
especially on streets that are highly frequented. You know, if you think about Golden Avenue, you think about Park Street, the amount of cars that drive down the street, kicking up those little rocks do tend to damage vehicles. So that's something that I'd like to ask to be placed on it as a condition that the street be swept the length of the 200 feet for which the trench is being dug. Okay. Clerk Bernanke, do you have that word? I've got it, yep. Okay. So, Shaka Teasy, is that something we can do?

36
00:14:54,794 --> 00:15:24,140
Yeah, I can send that information over. But I believe this one is an overhead service. I mean, it's an overhead run. It's not going to be on the ground, if I'm not mistaken. Because I was just looking at the sketch right now, and it seems like it's an overhead portion. It's not going to be on the ground. So it's wires, it's not digging into the concrete or the asphalt? Yeah, no.

37
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:54,447
I'm just looking at it real quick. Okay. So, Mr. President. Counselor. I just want to concur with my colleague, Counselor Knight, that that is a great suggestion and much of the work involves trenching and digging in our community and sweeping up after, I think should be a standard part of the job. So I support that in future requests, Mr. President, as well.

38
00:15:55,291 --> 00:16:03,155
Yeah, thank you console box I would agree as well. That is actually nice to add that in console and I for the purposes of.

39
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:32,956
This petition, Mr. President, I have reviewed it. It does look like it is a J-pole only. And the 200 feet is east of the center line as to where it's located. It's gonna be a 200 foot run overhead from what Socrates said. What I have in front of me looks like it's in line. So in terms of making that a condition on this petition, I'm not so crazy about it, but in the future, I think that that's something that we need to talk about. So I would ask that it be added to the agenda of items that we've discussed in the past relative to French work when we conduct this meeting with the engineer.

40
00:16:33,732 --> 00:17:03,415
but at this point I would withdraw the I would withdraw the restriction. Thank you. Is there a motion on the floor? Motion for approval. Mr. President. I'm emotional to approve seconded by console and I caught her to be please call the roll bears. Yes.

41
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:30,415
Vice President Caraviello. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. Socrates, thank you. Thank you, good night. Notice of a public hearing.

45
00:18:52,715 --> 00:19:21,284
I declare this public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition. Do we have Michael James Coleman with us tonight? We do. Okay. Mr. Coleman, welcome. If you could please tell us a little bit about your business and if you just, and then questions, I'm sure the councilors will have questions, but if you could just give us a brief overview of why you were in favor of the petition.

46
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:40,184
Sure. So, I've been a professional tattoo artist for six plus years. I have family in Medford. This has been my business for, you know, doing it professionally, and I'm in favor of just opening up my own studio.

47
00:19:41,045 --> 00:20:04,349
won't be like a huge place, it'll be more of like a private studio, couple rooms in there. And I can answer any questions that you might have about it. So you are in favor of the petition? Yes. Okay, perfect. So at this point in time, is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition? Anyone else?

48
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:42,672
Anyone else? Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. Anyone in opposition of the petition? Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak? It should make sure I'm not missing anyone. I don't see anybody, Mr. President. Okay.

49
00:20:44,073 --> 00:21:02,534
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. And I'll call upon the Chairperson of Zoning, Vice President Caviello. Councilor Caviello, I have to unmute you, one minute. All right, I got it. Thank you, Mr. President.

50
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:28,437
Thank you. Thank you. I see your paper here that says everything seems to be in order for this. As you know, we've received many calls from residents in the neighborhood in regards to your tattoo file. Again, you're a legal business. You're entitled to open.

51
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:51,860
I see no problem here. My only question is, and maybe this might make it a little more amiable to some of the people in the neighborhood, is the name. You're a stone's throw from our three churches, and maybe if you could soften the name up a little bit, might make it a little more...

52
00:21:52,113 --> 00:22:05,377
amiable to the people in the West River Square and the three churches that are really right within, let's say, they're within a stone's throw of it. So that's my opinion. So I don't know what you feel about that.

53
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:28,934
No, I understand. I'm brought up in an Irish Italian family, you know, religious, went to Malden Catholic, in no disrespect to, you know, the name being it somewhat of like a religious name. You know, the reason that I really chose the name for it was

54
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:58,972
Sacrament and the sacraments that you receive is kind of like a ritual ceremony. So I kind of link that to like a tattoo between like an artist and a person and sharing a bond. Like I said, I don't mean any disrespect. I can talk to anyone that, you know, kind of isn't really feeling the name so much. But like I said, I can,

55
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm a person that can, you know, can be reached easily and very personable person I can. I'm sure you are. Yeah. Is it just a suggestion, you know, we have two other, we have two other similar type businesses. We have one in the residential neighborhood in South Bend that's similar to yours and they've been a good neighbor too.

56
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:47,960
The people, I don't think there's been any complaints that I know of. And we also have another one on the Fells Way, which, you know, I don't think there's been any problems there either. But again, that was just my two cents into that. But other than that, you know, your license seems to be in order here. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Carviello. Godfless Carpelli. Thank you. And thank you, James, for applying. And hopefully this works.

57
00:23:48,398 --> 00:24:05,982
Some, some of the comments I received is some of the, the artwork that could be posted on the windows and some might tasteful some might be a little questionable and being in that area. That was some of the questions I got from some residents.

58
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:35,665
Do you plan on putting, you know, some, I know artwork is important and people can see your artwork. I think that's important. I think you should be able to do that in a sense. But I think what the fear of some of those neighbors are that some of that artwork might be a little too provocative or risque to put in an area where kids are walking by to go to CB Scoops or to a sub shop. So can you speak to that a bit?

59
00:24:36,121 --> 00:25:02,294
Absolutely. Um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't put anything disrespectful or risque like in, in the windows or even from like street view. Um, I understand that tattoo work and religious art work and can get, you know, a little questionable sometimes, but, um, I'm a father of an eight year old myself. So, you know, nothing that I would do would.

60
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:30,644
jeopardize my business. And I want everyone in that community, I know it's very tight knit in that in that row of, of businesses and whatnot, that I want to be able to be a good role model for for kids, you know, that are interested in artwork or interested in tattooing or, you know, anything else, you know. Right. Great. Thank you. Yeah, no problem.

61
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:56,834
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. The question I had was regarding how would you treat medical waste? So I know that's definitely something that is covered early on in like learning the tattoo process. Everything in the studio will be fully disposable.

62
00:25:57,661 --> 00:26:25,589
you know, we would be abiding by the big, you know, the COVID-19 pandemic that we're in right now with face shields, masks, you know, allowing certain amount of people in the studio when we open. But as far as like needles, cartridges, we have a service that's done weekly and monthly, and they come pick up

63
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:47,611
everything there in sharp containers and everything is handled on hospital clean levels. So at no time would you be using the local trash for needles or blood or any other type of medical waste? No, absolutely not.

64
00:26:48,337 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you. Mr. President, my good luck of being on the council for a number of years gives me some wisdom. And back so many years ago, we had a tattoo pile that tried to come onto Forest Street across from the Boys and Girls Club. It was called Lucky Tattoos.

65
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:21,935
And at the time, Mr. President, the petitioners had, in my opinion, a lengthy record about border health issues and so forth and raised some concern. And I

66
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:46,387
Voted against the petition based on concerns. I had with lucky tattoo. This has nothing to do with this petitioner and We mr. President ended up getting sued by lucky tattoo and they ended up winning a suit of I believe it was 25 to $30,000 against the city of method because we denied their special permit and

67
00:27:46,387 --> 00:28:14,652
and apparently we were being arbitrary and capricious, even though I felt we had valid concerns of this opening. On this particular petitioner, Mr. President, I don't have those concerns. It is signed off by the Board of Health. The Method Police has issued a statement saying that they have no public safety concerns. The petitioner seems to be a good business person, and I wish him well, Mr. President.

68
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:42,867
Thanks so much for the kind words. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Any other comments from the council? Second. Motion to approve. Second. On the motion to approve by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Does anyone want to speak on this in the public? Anyone in the public want to speak?

69
00:28:48,217 --> 00:29:15,250
Okay. Mr. President. Council Marks. I would also ask similar to many other special permit requests that we put a six month review on this special permit, Mr. President. Okay. Also, Mr. President, that the special permit goes with the business and not with the address. Do you have those amendments, Corker? Hang on a second.

70
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:47,245
I do see a raised hand, Mr. President. I've got the two amendments. I've got the two conditions. Councilor Marks has requested a six month review and Councilor Knight has requested that the permit goes with the business and not with the address. Okay, we have, let's see.

71
00:29:48,950 --> 00:30:17,249
John Nicholas First, if you could please give us your name and address for the record. Sure. I'm John Nicholas First. I live at 32 Warren Street in Medford. So that's just a block or two away from where this is on High Street. I just wanted to voice my public positive support for this prospective institution. I think that they are doing a good thing for the community, and I look forward to them being approved by this council.

72
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:47,995
Thank you so much, John. Thank you very much for your comment. Would anybody else like to speak on this issue? Clerk Kurtabese, have you received any emails on this? I have not, Mr. President. So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers, as amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight. Clerk Kurtabese, would you please call the roll? Councilor Beers? Yes. Vice President Caravaglio? Yes.

73
00:30:48,248 --> 00:31:10,608
Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero on the negative. The motion passes. Thank you and good luck. Thank you so much, everybody. Thank you. Have a good night. Mr. President, motion for suspension of the rules to take paper 2040.

74
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:41,962
2-0-0-4-0? 2-0-4-2-0. Mr. President, it's 2-0-4-2-0. It came in under suspension. I did not assign it a number until this afternoon. I don't think I have the paper in front of me. OK, so on the- I can read my email and read it back if you need me to. Mr. President, we can do this next one and you can come back to it when the clerk sends you

75
00:31:42,046 --> 00:32:01,891
uh, the paper. Okay. So we can move on. We'll do that next. So are we sitting by motion? Okay. So we're going to continue on with the regular order of business. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night. You too. Congratulations. Best of luck. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you.

76
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:29,245
Thank you. Notice of a public hearing 20-042, an ordinance amending the revised ordinances of the city of Medford zoning relative to adult use marijuana. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Medford. Motion to suspend the reading in favor of a synopsis. Would you like to give that a synopsis, Councilor Bears?

77
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:50,525
I can try. I think it's easier than reading this whole thing. I understand it's a 17-page document. It is the first time it's being read, so that's why I was probably going to read it in its full context, because it's the first time I think it's been out.

78
00:32:50,525 --> 00:33:15,955
So I think the public should actually be able to listen to this. I know it's long, but if the council sees that we should move forward with a brief synopsis, if someone wants to give it, that's fine. But I think there's a lot of detail in here that probably should, that should be read through. Mr. President, just a point of information. Is it possible to table this till the end of the meeting?

79
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:45,132
We can do that. The meeting will never end if we table. Is there a motion to table? Motion to table to the end of the meeting. Okay, motion by Councilor Behrs to table this, seconded by? Second. Seconded by Councilor Marks. Clerk Urbis, please call the roll. Is this to be tabled until the end of the meeting tonight? You are correct. Okay, Councilor Behrs.

80
00:33:45,740 --> 00:34:14,005
Yes. Vice President Caravello. Yes. Councilor Knight. No. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. No. President Falco. No. Is that a four, three in favor? I have four, three.

81
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:38,086
Okay, four in favor, three against. This will be tabled to the end of the meeting. Mr. President, do you have the paper now? I'm doing it right now. I'm setting it right now. Mr. President, motion for suspension of the rules to take paper 20420.

82
00:34:39,807 --> 00:35:06,082
Vice President Carviello, does he suspend the rule, seconded by? Second. Councilor Marks, please call the roll. Councilor Peters? Yes. Vice President Carviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? No. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? No.

83
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:23,682
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? No. Four in favor, three against, motion passes. The rules are suspended. Clerk Hernandez, can you read the motion please?

84
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:40,456
Yes, this is offered under suspension by Vice President Carabiello. Whereas the city of Medford is in a fiscal budget emergency, be it resolved that the mayor be requested to appropriate, with the city council approval, the necessary amount out of free cash

85
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:57,955
to address the municipal and school budget deficits, and further, that the mayor be requested to replenish this account with any budget aid Medford receives from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Be it further resolved that the mayor respond to this request by next Tuesday's city council meeting.

86
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:11,303
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President. If I may, Vice President Carvajal, this has been on under suspension and this year I don't think falls under the.

87
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:39,907
the guidance that we've been given by the city solicitor. I mean, I tend to think of- Mr. President, Mr. President, where this is a number- Vice President Caviello, and if I may, I believe that a paper that is requesting free cash should be coming from the mayor's office. It shouldn't be derived from the city council. So that's- It's only a suggestion to the mayor, Mr. President, and this is an emergency situation.

88
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:43,096
And so what I would do is...

89
00:36:44,193 --> 00:37:10,298
I think that this is something that we should put on the agenda for next week, because I'm sure there's probably plenty of people that would like to chime in on this, and they're probably not on the call tonight, because they probably didn't know it was gonna come up. So as far as, we have some other, I think, budget-related motions afterwards, but I think as far as bringing this up under suspension, I don't think it's proper to bring this up tonight.

90
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:39,256
Whatever you think. I want to make sure we're complying with the open meeting law, that's why. Again, I felt this was an emergency situation. Notices of teacher layoffs have to go out by Monday. And I know the administration is aware of that as well, as well as the school department. If you feel that it should be tabled to next week, then... I would ask you respectfully if you could please reintroduce it next week.

91
00:37:39,880 --> 00:38:05,395
Whatever you say, Mr. President. Thank you, Vice President Caviello. Is there anything on the suspension that- Motion to revert back to the regular order of business. On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by- Mr. President. Councilor Marks. Just a point of information. I think the paper was offered under suspension. I still think we have to do something with it.

92
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:35,956
Right, whether we receive it on file or do something. Motion to table. Motion to table. Rule the paper out of order. I'm basically ruling the paper out of order. That's what I'm doing. So I'm asking, I respectfully ask Vice President Caviello to reintroduce it next week. I will reintroduce it next week, Mr. President. Thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, Councilor, Vice President Caviello. So I have a motion to revert back to regular order businesses by Councilor Knight, seconded by? Second.

93
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:58,012
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

94
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:30,952
Motions, orders, and resolutions. 20-394 offered by Councilor Knight. Be it resolved that the Manhattan City Council publish the scheduled pre-budget and regular budget meetings for the purpose of establishing a fiscal year 2021 city budget. Councilor Knight? Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, yes.

95
00:39:31,357 --> 00:40:00,112
Um, as I've stated in the past, I have a, uh, hostile desire that we get a fiscal year budget completed before the close of the fiscal year. Um, just last week, I believe we met with our paid outside consultant that said that we're, uh, in a difficult financial situation. We have about a $10 million deficit. Um, we have $183 million budget. Um, the consultant says that he feels as though we do have the ability to put out a fiscal year budget.

96
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:29,474
The consultant says that there's no way that we want to get involved in a 1-12 budget. So I'm going to do my best Jerry Maguire here, Mr. President, and ask, where's the budget? Show me the money. Show me the money, Mr. President. Time that we get to the table and start negotiating this budget, debating this budget. It's what, June 9th? The fiscal year closes in 21 days, Mr. President. We've seen nothing, not one financial paper yet. Transparency, where is it?

97
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:56,913
Where is it? Again, come on, Jerry, say it. Show me the money. Show me the money, Jerry. Where is the budget, Mr. President? Where is it? You know, we need to take the bull by the horns, schedule budget debates, invite the administration to come down and participate. And if they don't want to, they don't have to. But we got to do something here. We got to show some leadership that at the end of the day, the residents and the taxpayers in this community know that we're pushing hard to be sure that city services aren't interrupted during these difficult fiscal times.

98
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:26,208
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that you work with the administration to publish a schedule as to when we're going to be able to meet in person to conduct budget debates. I think, you know, as we're seeing the phases of government and coronavirus to be allowed to start working again, I'm pretty sure that the seven of us plus the department head and the budget director can sit down in a room, be safe, and work out these very significant, serious issues in this community. So I'll say it again. Show me the money. It's time, Mr. President.

99
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:48,668
That's time, June 9th, June 9th. I've never, ever, ever in my time working in government and working in this community ever seen a goal this long where we haven't had some sort of budget. We have a consultant. The consultant has given us our figures. The consultant has told us they're worth $10 million in the hole. Last time we talked, the plan was to level fund, to borrow money

100
00:41:48,871 --> 00:42:16,276
out of our free cash, to take money out of our free cash. But we're still going to have a structural deficit if we do that, Mr. President. So I know there are difficult decisions that need to be made, but that's what we get paid the big bucks to do. So quite frankly, we can't sit down at the table and start talking about issues of concern if we don't have a document in front of us to work off of. So it's very important that we get this budget book and we get it immediately. My frustration level at this point, Mr. President, is over the edge. I feel like I've been talking about this now for six, seven, eight weeks.

101
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:34,028
Um, and we're still no closer to having any understanding as to what the administration's financial plan is to move this community forward. Um, so with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution. I asked the council president to publish a series of meetings as to when we're going to be able to sit down and negotiate this budget.

102
00:42:34,282 --> 00:43:02,378
I'd ask that it be done in line with the recommendations that our paid outside consultant gave us, which says that we can complete the budget before the close of the fiscal year. So that's what I asked for, Mr. President. And I hope that the administration is willing to work with us and has been doing what they're supposed to be doing and preparing a budget for us based upon the forecast that our private paid consultants have given us. There's no point in having outside consultants if we're not going to listen to the information they've given us and use it to make informed data-driven decisions.

103
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:28,838
So with that being said, I rest my case. I don't know any more lines from the movie Jerry Maguire. So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this paper and I have all the confidence in the world that you'll be able to make this happen, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Knight. If I may, briefly, I did speak to the mayor earlier today and she did inform me that I guess the state has allowed

104
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:59,365
is allowed the budget deadline to move from June 30th to July 31st. But she knows that we're looking for something sooner than later. I did tell her that I wanna make sure that we have, as last week I stated repeatedly to the chief of staff that we need to have a budget book ASAP. I agree with you a thousand percent. We need to have a budget book in front of us that we have a few days so we can actually go through the data, take a look and formulate,

105
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:11,431
Good question. So when we meet with the mayor, we can have a very constructive conversation. This is a very important budget. I know that they're still working. From what I've been told, they're still working on the numbers.

106
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:31,141
From what I have also been told is we won't get state aid until July. But I am working, or actually I did talk to the mayor. I think she's going to have something for us hopefully next week, but don't know for sure yet.

107
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:58,327
So that's the update that I have from the administration. I know Alicia Nunley, I think is on the line. She may want to talk to this a little bit more. I'm not sure if Jackie Peeks or Dave Rodriguez is on the line as well, but they may want to comment as well. We have a number of councils that want to talk too. So why don't I, let's see, Alicia Nunley, would you like to speak on the matter? Sure. Thank you, Honorable City Councilors.

108
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:26,457
Yes, we are still making cuts. I'm going to be completely transparent. This has been an extremely difficult budget. And like the councilor said, this has never happened before. We've never had COVID before. We've never had a shutdown. This has just really, really been difficult. So we've been trying to figure out the best way to do the cuts with each department head, trying to figure out everything that we can do. It is still a work in process, unfortunately. We have not finalized

109
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:36,329
numbers, but we are really working towards getting there right now. We've had meetings, so we do want to get you a budget.

110
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:57,777
Thank you. We have a number of questions. Let's see, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Villes, and Councilor Marks. Vice President Caviello. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, if I could amend Councilor Nice's paper to put down that we do meet in person.

111
00:45:57,777 --> 00:46:25,638
We had 1,000 people at Hall Mill Stadium last week. It was attended by many councillors. So again, I don't see why seven or eight or 10 of us can't be in a room if we could have 1,000 people in one spot and say there were councillors that were in attendance. So if I could amend that Councillor Knight's motion to make sure that we have a plan to meet in person.

112
00:46:27,224 --> 00:46:53,650
Thank you, Councilor Caviello. So, Clerk Curtis, do you have the amendment? I do, Mr. President. The amendment is that the council meet in person to discuss the budget once everything is scheduled. Okay, thank you. Councilor Beers. I'd be happy to meet outside on a sunny day, six feet away with a mask on, but just my actual point is,

113
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:23,013
that it's incredibly frustrating that we're at this point. I understand the difficulty, I understand this is unprecedented, but people are really concerned about this budget and they have a right to be. And the fact that a lot of us, basically everyone feels in the dark is just gonna, the longer that we go, the bigger a problem this is gonna be with residents feeling in the dark. So I, next week is, it's late. I think we need something by Friday if we're gonna be able to do this right.

114
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:46,047
Thank you, Council of Affairs. Councilor Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. I think if we all recall, this may have gave us a commitment that we were going to get the budget in April. That would have been the earliest budget, Mr. President, I've been on 20 years on the council, that this council has ever received a budget.

115
00:47:46,047 --> 00:48:01,437
And then we had what we all know COVID-19 came into effect, Mr. President, and threw a monkey wrench into that. So the commitment was out there, Mr. President, to get us an early budget. And we're faced now with a $10 million deficit.

116
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:26,294
And although some would like to see a budget immediately, I think it's only prudent that the mayor take the time, Mr. President, to wait to see the local aid, what we're going to receive, to see what local receipts may be coming in. We also waited, Mr. President, which we all know, because they extended the period to pay your taxes. So we wanted to see what revenue we had in order to put together a budget.

117
00:48:26,294 --> 00:48:37,904
So I appreciate the fact that my colleagues have concern, but I can tell you from experience, Mr. President, I remember getting the budget with one night to work on it.

118
00:48:38,427 --> 00:49:05,630
And I remember, Mr. President, in the past, there wasn't much outcry for many years, Mr. President. And now all of a sudden, in the middle of COVID-19, there's an outcry to get the budget, which we never got this early, Mr. President. So it's great people want to see the budget. I'm eager to see the budget. We need to move forward, Mr. President. But by no stretch of the imagination is this city administration holding

119
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:22,353
anything back. They're trying to put together a budget that will provide city services, that will keep people employed, Mr. President. The last thing we want to do is send out a budget to alarm people that they may be losing their job, and then we get a federal stimulus.

120
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:37,388
or we get a bailout. And guess what? When you were worried about your job for the last three weeks, you don't have to worry. The last thing we do is want to worry people, Mr. President. We're all going to have ample time to meet with the department heads. We're going to have ample time to go over the budget, Mr. President.

121
00:49:37,388 --> 00:50:06,835
And we're going to have ample time to make sure we have input. So don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The process has worked this way, Mr. President. And I feel comfortable that we're moving forward with a realistic budget. I don't want to see a budget that's not realistic, because I've dealt with one for the last 20 years. I want to see a realistic budget. And I think that's what this current administration is working on, Mr. President, in a time of emergency, in a time of a pandemic, and a lot more happening, Mr. President. Thank you.

122
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:32,603
Thank you, Councilor Marks. Councilor Layton. I do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that if we were supposed to meet April 1st, that would have been great. And government shutdown happened March 13th. And I do believe the administration had indicated that they had a working budget based upon the forecast at the time for fiscal year 21.

123
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:56,363
And I do believe that we requested that that information be shared with us. And I do believe that the administration has refused to do so. I still haven't received that document that we requested, Mr. President, asking for a copy of the working budget that they had. Mr. President, that was a preliminary budget that every mayor for the last 30 years works on, Mr. President.

124
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:24,545
And if someone wants to create the budget, maybe they should run for mayor. Because it's the mayor's responsibility to create the budget and then pass it on to the council, Mr. President. So I don't know why we're putting the cop before the horse, Mr. President. It's never happened in previous years, and there was never anyone outspoken in previous years. But now, I guess in COVID-19, we have different expectations, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman, I

125
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:50,549
I agree with the gentleman wholeheartedly. It's the mayor's responsibility to put a budget forward, and I certainly would love to see one, one that has, based on realistic expectations, like the ones that we paid for from our private consultant, the numbers that he gave us, that the private consultant provided us with, so that we were able to forecast accurately, so that we could put together a realistic budget. You know, Mr. President, I think that it's important for us to look at the circumstances that are before us.

126
00:51:50,853 --> 00:52:12,976
We're in a financial crisis. We've been in financial crises before, and we've been able to work our way out of them. But we've had to work to do it. So let's get to work on it. That's all I'm saying. Thank you. Any other comments regarding the budget? Does the public have any comments? Great.

127
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:43,790
Okay, hearing and seeing none on the motion. Mr. President, I see that Danielle has her hand raised, I believe. I'm sorry. We're gonna let Councilor Scarpelli go first and then we'll go to Danielle. Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Councilor. I believe I was just letting you be aware that Alicia Nunley had her hand up. Oh, I'm sorry. Alicia. Yeah, I just wanted to address that. Yes, it's true that we did start the budget process back in March.

128
00:52:44,330 --> 00:53:06,503
We had met with the school department gave them an estimate and then unfortunately, the COVID-19 hit and we were trying to kind of figure out how everything was going to work. I just want to be completely fully transparent. And as we were trying to get our numbers and I was trying to do casting like that I was affected personally by COVID-19.

129
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:36,237
I'm a key contributor, to be honest, with your honorable body. I give the revenue figure to the mayor in order to budget, and I was not available, and they had to find a consultant to help them with that while I was away. I've been back, I've been working extremely hard on the front side, looking at each department's budget, looking at where we can cut, what we can do, analyzing the revenues with our consultant to make sure my numbers and his numbers are aligned

130
00:53:36,743 --> 00:54:02,140
So I just wanna let you know that we are working extremely hard to get you a budget. Thank you, Alicia. Councilor Lange. Alicia, was there a working budget for the city of Medford ever prepared? What we did was I came up with a projection based on the numbers that I saw.

131
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:23,858
of what I thought we would have for revenues and where I thought the school could be. I gave that figure. I started looking at the numbers once the COVID hit, and we had to freeze everything. I started going back and did a 10 year analysis to look back to when we had other crashes in the economy and how we fared out and what to kind of expect. And then I got sick.

132
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:47,028
Okay, so when the chief of staff said three meetings ago that they had a working budget for fiscal year 21. That wasn't necessarily the case. I'm talking about back in March. Sorry, me too. Yeah, I believe it was represented that the city had a working budget based upon the projections at the time prior to COVID-19.

133
00:54:47,618 --> 00:55:05,101
for fiscal year 21. And then Coronavirus hit. And then that's why they pulled on it didn't put it out. Numbers I had at that time were incorrect because we had to revise them down because of COVID-19. So that was that was no good. So we do have a pre Coronavirus budget representing each department in this community.

134
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:33,164
I mean, the ones that I worked on, I worked on some projections to come up with numbers for what to budget for the school and what to budget in general, but we didn't have every single budget set up, but yes, they would have had a preliminary of what the number would have been. Okay. So there wasn't a working budget that was ready to be looked at and reviewed and debated in the two weeks coming up to April 1st. All right. Thank you very much for that. I appreciate it.

135
00:55:33,569 --> 00:56:03,505
You're doing an awful lot of work on the budget. And that's great, we appreciate it. I find it to be very, very intelligent and I've always enjoyed that conversation. But a silent voice in this has always been the budget director. And I don't know if the budget director is on the call. I'm not sure. But it's becoming increasingly frustrating.

136
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:33,155
Do we have a budget director that doesn't come to budget meetings? We have people that, you know, the budget can't happen because certain people around certain people aren't, but we have a budget director that we're paying to coordinate this stuff. So with that being said, Mr. President, you know where I stand, I want a budget. And I want it as soon as we can get it, get as soon as possible so we can get down to work on it. I won't belabor the point. And again, I thank Ms. Nunley for all the work that she does here in the community. I rest my case. Thank you, Ms. Nunley. Thank you, council. We have David Rodriguez, chief of staff and the mayor, David Rodriguez.

137
00:56:33,543 --> 00:56:59,075
and just to be very, very clear, the mayor wants to give you a budget. This is not a question of will, this is a math problem we're trying to work through. Exactly right, based upon the revenue numbers that were given to us and that we've been working on, that we were very, and to speak to the point of transparency, we came to the council and to the school committee pretty early to say, this is the trouble that we think we're gonna be seeing in terms of the revenue side. And this is the number that we're working off of in order to craft and propose

138
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:22,632
to provide a balanced budget. The mayor is required by law to provide a balanced budget to the council. Under statutory timelines, which thankfully have been extended, but we will be getting it to you as soon as we possibly can. This will be a responsible, balanced budget based upon these revenue numbers that Alicia and Tony Roselli have been putting together and working around the clock, trying to revise constantly.

139
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:41,195
We had begun the work on the budget previously. Budget is a year-long process, and it needs to be recognized like that. Inside March and inside early April, we had begun work on the budget, and we effectively had to restart all that work based upon the current economic and budgetary crisis that we're facing.

140
00:57:41,195 --> 00:58:06,878
So it's been a challenging scenario from March 12th to now, but we're working through it. And thankfully we have a talented budget team that's working together as a team to pull this document together. If I may Chief of Staff Rodriguez, thank you for dialing in. Do we know when we can expect the first budget meeting to be?

141
00:58:08,262 --> 00:58:18,927
Basically, I was my understanding about a conversation with the mayor earlier today. And I think that that conversation was beginning the 20th. I believe that's the conversation that you and you and her had.

142
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:49,083
Okay, so if we have the 20th, so that would be a Saturday. What can we expect a budget book? The bigger question is the book. We really need the book. Yep. And that's currently under development right now. We will give it to you as soon as possible ahead of time on the 19th or before. So at least that we'll be able to start chewing on it for 24, 48 hours ahead of time. Thank you. Councilor Behrs, you had a question. Thanks. I don't want to belabor it, but you know,

143
00:58:50,112 --> 00:59:19,542
We didn't get much solid information early. I understand the circumstances are difficult, but, you know, I personally feel the communication hasn't been enough. And I understand that people can disagree about that, but I don't think we're going to get any further here. So I move the question. Thank you. The motion of Councilor Peo, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Carviello, Clerk Carnaby, please call the roll. Actually, you know what, I apologize.

144
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:49,057
Did you say there was one person that wanted to speak that I missed before? Yes, Mr. President. Danielle has her hand up. Hi, I think I may be, you're seeing that I was clapping my hands for the opening statement about racism. Okay. Would you like to speak on the budget? No, thank you. Thank you.

145
00:59:50,660 --> 01:00:17,103
We just wanna make sure everybody gets their turn. Okay, on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Caravaglio, Clerk Herves, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caravaglio? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Councilor Marks?

146
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:37,673
I'm gonna skip Councilor Marks and come back to him. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. And then Councilor Marks, we still don't have a vote. Yes. Thank you. Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

147
01:00:38,973 --> 01:01:00,252
2-0-399 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas the Office of Diversity is established to provide oversight of laws and regulations relating to affirmative action, contract compliance, fair housing, disability, human rights, discrimination, hate-related incidents, and or crimes. We focus on outreach, inclusion, and education.

148
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:23,995
We interact with other city departments as well as other cities in local, state, and federal organizations and agencies to ensure fair and equitable opportunity and access for all persons. And whereas the Office of Diversity is established to provide persons with disabilities equal opportunity to access to as well as participation in education, employment,

149
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:49,392
the public and private services in the city of Medford through advocacy, awareness, and enforcement. And whereas the office of personnel is established to help city departments attract, motivate, retain, manage, and develop qualified and productive employees. And whereas the functions of the office of the disability and office of diversity have been consolidated under the director of personnel. And whereas the consolidation

150
01:01:49,392 --> 01:02:15,869
as a result in the elimination of the independent disinterested check and balance on personal matters once provided through the Office of Disability and Diversity. Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request City Solicitor Scanlon provide an opinion on the following question. Does the consolidation of the above departments create any conflict with the law or liability within the City of Medford? Councilor Layton.

151
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:39,258
Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you for indulging me in that very long-winded resolution that I put together. Ultimately, I've been concerned about this for some time, and I scratch my head sometimes and wonder if it's appropriate that we have a personnel director serving as judge, jury, and executioner on all matters related to personnel, disability, and diversity in the community.

152
01:02:39,494 --> 01:03:07,810
And the reason I say that, Mr. President, is because when the person that's responsible for personnel in our community wears so many different hats, that becomes a question and a concern as to whether or not he's serving the appropriate master and is in an appropriate role. So with that being said, Mr. President, if in fact we have the director of personnel that's serving on, let's say a hiring panel, and there's an individual in our community that feels as though they've been aggrieved based upon a disability issue or a diversity issue,

153
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:34,439
course of action would be to go and speak with the disability director or the diversity director. Well, that person would also be the personnel director who sat on the panel, which made a determination that may have made you feel uncomfortable and maybe felt as though your rights have been violated. So that's the independent check and balance you go to to determine whether or not your rights are being violated and whether or not you're going to be advocated for. And it puts the personnel director in the precarious position of determining whether or not he's going to be defending the actions of the board he sits on.

154
01:03:35,148 --> 01:04:02,114
or advocating for the personnel that have come before him and asked for the assistance and the help. So, you know, it's really a structure of government, the consolidation, the government issue, Mr. President, but with a director of personnel has to wear so many hats and we already have made, you know, the recognition, the realization that there is a marginalized and underrepresented population in this community. The question is whether or not it's a best practice to merge these functions in underneath one

155
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:32,354
umbrella in one person, number one, and number two, if by doing that, it creates a situation where individuals are being denied access to a resource and an independent check and balance that they had previously had that they no longer do. So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the measure, to send the question to the city solicitor to see if it poses any conflict. Again, Mr. President, you know, it could be something as simple as an existing employee asking for a reasonable accommodation and the reasonable accommodation not being made.

156
01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:59,624
So you go to the personnel director, you ask for a reasonable accommodation, it's not being made. You go to the director of disability and you say, you know, this is my situation, I need someone to advocate for me. If that's the same person, it creates a situation and a circumstance where people might be less likely to come forward, less likely to seek help in advocating for themselves through these offices. So that's why I raised the issue and I'd ask for your support. Thank you, counsel Knight. Any questions or comments from the council?

157
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:22,287
Okay, any other questions from the public? Anybody have any questions? Second, Mr. President. I see Melanie McGough. Yes. Thank you. There we go. Melanie, could you please have your name and address for the record?

158
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:51,143
Sure. Thank you. Uh, melanie mclaughlin 152 awesome street medford, mass Please forgive me for staying off video at this point, but it's been a long day and I think i'm doing everybody a justice by doing so Um, I just wanted to second, uh, and then speak to uh councillor knight's, um, uh direction I think uh as the former co-chair of the special education parent advisory council and also the parent of a child with a disability

159
01:05:51,599 --> 01:06:20,641
I think it is incredibly important for us to have singular disability and inclusion office in our city hall. We've had that for many, many years and having presented to them and gone to them as a member of the CPAC and having asked them to advocate in the past, I think it's incredibly important. I think if you see what's happening in our city and our nation around racism, ableism is a big part of the discrimination piece as well.

160
01:06:21,097 --> 01:06:48,788
And we need to be thinking about that in our schools. We just recently got a disability and inclusion officer in our school as a stipended position, not even a full position. This is a very important matter and one that I would not want to see separated. So as a community member, I'm weighing in as the mother of a child with a disability, and as a person who's been connected to families with disability in the community, I would ask that this be maintained as an individual position for our city. Thank you very much.

161
01:06:49,750 --> 01:07:19,349
Would anybody else like to weigh in on this? Okay, I don't see anybody else. Let's see, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carabiello. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Carabiello? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

162
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:48,948
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. 20-400 offered by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the City Council receive an update on the Bedford Police Department's use of four standards in other policies relevant to de-escalation. Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. Like my fellow councilors, I've received more than 100 emails in the past week plus with residents seeking information

163
01:07:49,302 --> 01:08:14,362
related to questions as far as what our police and Medford are doing to ensure the safety and support of all members of our community. And more specifically, what the current practices and policies of our police are, and how they might relate to recent policy suggestions that work to stop police violence and stop police killings throughout this country. So my intention with this is to send it to the public safety subcommittee for a future meeting held with all urgency.

164
01:08:14,733 --> 01:08:38,543
where the chief of police can attend and address these questions, as well as allow the subcommittee members and the public to ask more specific policy questions. I did talk to the chief earlier last week. It's my understanding that he's working on a public document to address a lot of these questions. But I do think this is something that needs to be taken up in a subcommittee so that we can have more specific questions and conversation around this. I do understand there's a

165
01:08:39,168 --> 01:09:08,108
Similar type motion, but I think this is something that we need to address as a subcommittee. And I move for approval to send the paper there. Second. Thank you, Councilor Morrell. On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Knight to move this paper to the public safety subcommittee that is chaired by Councilor Knight with members Councilor Behrs, Councilor Scarpelli. Are there any questions from the council? I believe that Councilor Behrs, did you have your hand up?

166
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:38,467
I just wanted to say that people clearly really want to have this conversation, and I think it's important that we as a council take it on. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions from the council? Any comments? Anybody from the public who would like to speak on this issue? Hearing and seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Knight,

167
01:09:39,158 --> 01:10:08,622
To move this to the Public Safety Subcommittee. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Kerrio. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. Vice President Falco. Yes. 70 affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 20-401 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the city administration and the recreation director report back to the city council

168
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:22,595
with programming plans for summer recreation, Tusk Pool and Wright's Pond. Councilor Scott Pelley. Thank you, Mr. President. Now, with phase two,

169
01:10:23,422 --> 01:10:48,802
all in and looking into phase three. And as we approach our official summer vacation, the question I had as I put this resolution through is getting some understanding of what's going on with the recreation department and what programs and the policies and procedures and what we're looking at for the pool rights pond. And since I,

170
01:10:48,802 --> 01:11:16,308
As for this resolution, I've had a great discussion with our director of recreation and he has been, Kevin has been great. I know that working with a group of three and spending a lot of his time distributing the food, he's been very busy in the community and I really appreciate their hard work. But I think that as we move forward,

171
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:36,288
we have to get to a sense of normalcy and making sure that we are informed as we move forward of what the policies are at the pool, what the policies are at the pond, how are we going to handle separate camps and activities in the community are going to be very important for all constituents.

172
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:52,302
I know that as we move forward to some sense of normalcy, we have a lot of questions that are coming back from the state level and what we can do at pools and ponds. The regulations right now, we're saying that it's 25%

173
01:11:52,302 --> 01:12:14,881
of occupancy at one time. So how we arrange that, I know that our recreation director is working very, very hard. He's got some great ideas, some ideas that we're using as well. And moving forward, I just want to make sure that he gets the assistance from the city administration like he's been getting so far.

174
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:42,252
and getting the word out. So I think that really, it's really keeping everybody informed as we're working through the process. So whatever I just said, it's just adding some information. So I hope to get more information soon. So I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly. Any other questions from the council first?

175
01:12:43,687 --> 01:13:11,665
Any questions from the general public? We have, let's see. Chris Murphy. Christopher Murphy. Could you please have your name and address for the record? Chris Murphy, 51 shared now. I'm also a member of the park commission. I know we are going to meet Thursday on this to talk about how we go forward with not only the pond, the pool and all the fields.

176
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:39,526
I think we should have a, um, keep you all in the loop. We're meeting Thursday night and hopefully we'll have a better answer for you guys going forward on the pool, the pond and the fields with pace too. So I just want to let you guys know that we are, um, as a board going to talk about that stuff on Thursday night. Okay, good. Thank you Chris. Thank you very much. Mr. President.

177
01:13:40,032 --> 01:14:08,973
Um, I, what have we done so far? Mr. Murphy, we talked to the administration about the, the, the fields. Cause as we're rolling out now that we can have passive activity, um, I know that, uh, you know, we're, we're going to be talking about another resolution coming down the line that I have. And I'll save that till later, but have, have we now started getting the fields in place? You know, if that's happened, you're meeting. It's something we, we, we, we're going to be talking about Thursday now that we

178
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:38,791
I believe we just got guidelines today. I haven't looked at them in depth yet, but it's something we're all going to be able to talk. We'll have a better understanding Thursday, because as you guys have seen, things could change between now and then, so. Thank you, Chris. No problem. Counselor Scott Pelli, did you have any further comments on this? No. Any questions from the public?

179
01:14:43,043 --> 01:15:07,968
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Caravaglia. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco.

180
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:23,780
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. 20-402 offered by Councilor Scott Kelly. Be it resolved that the city administration provide the city council with any organized strategies dealing with the possibilities of some youth sports. Councilor Scott Kelly.

181
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:39,659
Thank you, Mr. President. Again, to follow up with Kevin Bailey, our Director of Recreation, I know that as we're meeting with Mr. Murphy and the PACS Commission, they've told us that

182
01:15:39,659 --> 01:16:07,570
They've already started to reach out to little leagues and softball and different organizations. I'm just hoping that, I know it's been a tough time and the city administration has been inundated with so many different issues. I think that it's important that we call for a meeting with all of our youth organizations to make sure we review guidelines, policies and procedures, what's the expectations,

183
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:35,212
and what we need to do moving forward as we get to some sort of COVID-19 normalcy. So I ask that move approval. Thank you, Councilor. Second. On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Pierres. Any questions from Councilors? Any comments? Any questions or comments from the general public? Okay, hearing and seeing none.

184
01:16:36,005 --> 01:17:03,612
on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Caravaglia. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco. Yes, and the affirmative is zero and the negative, the motion passes. 20-403 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish

185
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:32,502
Peter Fuccioni, a happy 75th birthday. God's all right. Mr. President, Peter Fuccioni, the man, the myth, the legend, the man responsible for all those wonderful meals that we received down at Raso's Restaurant, day in and day out. One of the hottest working men in show business, Mr. President, just celebrated his 75th birthday, and we wish him 75 more happy and healthy ones. Many of us have gotten to know Peter over the years from his work down at Raso's Restaurant.

186
01:17:32,671 --> 01:18:01,426
And before that, in Clarendon Hill at the Genoa. And before that, in Beacon Hill at Primo's Restaurant. Peter's been in the industry for 70 over 75 years, Mr. President, and he's done an excellent job at it, as evident by the product that they're putting out at Razzles Restaurant. So I just wanted to take an opportunity to wish Peter a happy 75th birthday, and to hope that he has a nice, healthy, and happy summer out there, making sure that we have safe spaces to eat,

187
01:18:01,645 --> 01:18:10,707
and outdoor dining at Razzles restaurants. He's done a great job. Mr. President's a great guy, a good friend, and I just wish him the best. I ask my council colleagues to join me.

188
01:18:11,348 --> 01:18:39,395
Thank you, Councilor Knight. Vice President Carviello. Thank you, Mr. President. I concur with Councilor Knight's kind words. I was able to participate in the motorcade that went by there last week. I think Peter was a little in awe, but I've known Peter for many years now. Great guy. He's the glue that keeps Razzos together. And I wanted to wish him a happy birthday also. Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

189
01:18:40,036 --> 01:19:08,133
We have a hand raised. Oh, once again. I apologize. I think someone, do you have someone else that wants to, oh, Marianne. Marianne. Hi, I apologize. I'm not very good at this. So didn't know how to raise my hand early, but on the parks and rec stuff, just want to let you know, been working really hard and Kevin's been working really hard.

190
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:34,559
Our first thing is we have to post and put guidelines on all the parks and playgrounds before they can open the youth sports teams can certainly, we're working with them we're going to I'm going to be at the parks commission meeting on Thursday evening. But again, there's no games allowed there's no tournaments it's basically drills and practices limited groups of 10s. There's some really strict guidelines in place.

191
01:19:34,964 --> 01:20:03,803
But we're going to be going all over those are Thursday evening, but we are working hard to get everything up and running again, slowly but surely. Thank you for that update. We appreciate it. On the motion of Council night seconded by Vice President yellow to wish you a happy 75th birthday on that motion.

192
01:20:05,153 --> 01:20:22,282
Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caravaglia? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

193
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:53,838
2020-404 offered by Councilor Scarpelli being resolved that the city council congratulate our 2020 Medford High School graduates in the school department for a very successful rolling graduation honoring our seniors, Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Mr. President. In such an awful time, there's so many different negatives that have come out, so many tragic issues with the COVID crisis.

194
01:20:54,918 --> 01:21:22,627
One side note, which is pretty, which was pretty devastating to many young men and women is the, um, the absence of a graduation. Um, and what, what Medford did to honor our seniors the past Wednesday, I think our school department should get a slap on the back and at least giving our seniors something that they can remember. And you know, if it's, um,

195
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:43,231
a group of people that I wanted to mention, Nancy and Joe Donlan, Mr. Blauck, of course, Mr. DeLava, Peter Arcola, former Medford graduate, who owns New Image Entertainment, DJ'd the parade for nothing, came down to Medford, hopped in a trailer, who, by the way,

196
01:21:43,332 --> 01:22:09,185
was donated and driven by our favorite dad, Dave Crowley, who whenever you need something, if you see the marching band trailer coming by, it's Mr. Crowley and his dedication to our kids in Medford. And he drove the DJ around the city, and we saw our graduates waiting on main streets in the caps and gowns.

197
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:35,273
And it was about a 10-minute procession of teachers just to come by just so they can wave and congratulate our seniors. Again, a few other people. I know that Mr. Cushing, Peter Cushing, our assistant superintendent. And I know, of course, Lisa Evangelista played a big part in this. But I think the head of guidance, Mo Lavin, Maureen Lavin, who really

198
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:55,203
did a lot to get this going. She's done a great job as the head of guidance. And one thing she wanted to make sure is that we don't forget our kids. And I know it's a small gesture, but again, Method PD, again, helping leading the way, getting them around safely so we can acknowledge them.

199
01:22:55,203 --> 01:23:21,393
It was a feel-good story. I wish we could do more for them. But just acknowledging them is so important that it was a great, great morning. It was all over Facebook, live. And I know that families were up and down Fulton Street congratulating our seniors. So again, I just wanted to reach out and say congratulations. And thank you for putting something together for our seniors. And again, for our seniors,

200
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:42,959
best of luck for everything you and you encounter for your future and best best of luck and best wishes. So thank you. Thank you, Scott Kelly. And if I may echo the sentiments of my colleague, my son actually is a member of the senior class this year. And thank you to everyone that was involved in the planning of that parade for our

201
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:59,817
senior class. It was a great day, a lot of fun, a lot of involvement from all the teachers and administration at the high school. It was nice. I think the seniors really enjoyed it. They were in their caps and gowns on the side of the road.

202
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:29,028
you know, the administration, the school administration went all out and they did a really, really nice job, especially in these difficult times. So I would also like to thank everyone that was involved in planning the parade and look forward to, I believe they're going to actually have a real graduation. It'll throwback, it'll be at a Hormel Stadium. I believe it's going to be August 15th. So it'll be in the summer, but looking forward to that. But I think it was a great that the,

203
01:24:29,028 --> 01:24:57,648
that everyone in the school system could have a part in putting this together. So we thank everyone that was involved. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I'd like to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this result forward. I think it's also important to point out the resilience of the Memphis High School class of 2020 senior class, the sacrifices that they had to make, the lost memories and lost opportunities that they've had

204
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:21,442
to deal with as a result of the government shutdown. You know, I think it's very unfortunate that, you know, um, my little buddy, Mikey Nesta, didn't get to have a senior year of baseball. I think it's very unfortunate that, uh, you know, our hockey team didn't get to finish this season and, uh, you know, our lacrosse team didn't get to get out there on the field. Um, you know, those are the sacrifices that these, uh, these, these children made, and these are the memories

205
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:50,213
that they're not going to be able to ever make up. So it's very important, Mr. President, to do the best we can to be sure that we do leave some good memories in their head during this trying time and take extra steps to make sure that they are a special part of this community. So I really think the school department did an excellent job. Lisa Evangelista and her team, you know, Moe Levin and the rest of them are a great group of people. And, you know, they always put Mentored first, and that's what's very important to me, Mr. President, is the type of people that put Mentored first in these roles.

206
01:25:50,213 --> 01:26:20,032
And those are two people that, you know, you can't shake a stick at. Mr. DeLave has done an excellent job in his new role. Dr. Vincent's done an excellent job in her new role. So I think at this point, you know, we're adapting to this new set of criteria and circumstances that are gonna be governing our life for the next period of time. But I think it's very important that we recognize the strength and the sacrifices that the senior class has made in order for us to get where we are today. Thank you Councilor Knight, Councilor Pears.

207
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:48,719
Thank you, Mr. President. I second what everyone has said, and I graduated from Medford High in 2011, and those memories are still there, and the friendships are still there. And I think also we've done a lot as a community, and I just wanna acknowledge all the folks who have put up signs, put up those signs all around town, Class of 2020, Medford Strong, and signs on folks' lawns as well, because I think

208
01:26:49,158 --> 01:27:17,137
As everyone has said, we're gonna need to do extra to make sure that the class of 2020 has the memories that they deserve to have, or at least as many as we can give them. So thank you to everyone who's been supporting people. Thank you, Councilor Beers. So congratulations to the class of 2020. We wish them well. And on the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by? Second, Mr. President. Vice President Carviello, Clerk, please call the roll.

209
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:34,045
Also bears. Yes. Vice President carry yellow. Yes. Tonight. Yes. Also marks. Yes. That's a morale. Yes.

210
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:56,438
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes. 20-405 offered by Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell. Whereas systemic racism is a national, state, and local crisis threatening the public health and safety of our communities. And whereas we have a duty and obligation as a city and a community to be actively

211
01:27:56,742 --> 01:28:26,375
anti-racist in our words, actions, and policies. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city of Memphis declares systemic racism to be a public health emergency that demands immediate action from the city and its residents. Be it further resolved by the Memphis City Council that we invite the mayor of Memphis and the Memphis School Committee to submit a joint resolution declaring systemic racism as a public health emergency. Councilor Behrs.

212
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:53,898
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the consideration of my colleagues. I'm gonna read a little bit. A chorus of people from across Medford have reached out to their elected officials in the last week and two to demand anti-racist action from our city. I've only been a city councilor for a few months, but this is by far the most contact I've received from Medford residents. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery,

213
01:28:54,134 --> 01:29:23,024
and thousands of other black Americans at the hands of police are horrific and yet all too common examples of the ongoing violence of white supremacy and structural racism in our country and right here in our community. Medford residents, especially young black residents, are sharing stories online about the racism and hate that they've experienced in our schools and on our streets. While some people were shocked by these horrific accounts, people commit racist acts or make racist remarks every single day in Medford.

214
01:29:23,648 --> 01:29:51,307
The many people who spoke at the powerful Black Lives Matter vigil at Hormel Stadium last week confirmed those stories of racism in our community and shared more of their own. I attended the Medford public schools. I remember the racist and hateful remarks that I would hear on a near daily basis. It doesn't surprise me to know that this racism was even worse than I knew or that I could see as a white student. None of us did enough to stop it. And sometimes we didn't do anything at all. Racism is a Medford problem.

215
01:29:52,538 --> 01:30:18,475
Medford has a deep history, and some of that is a deep history of racism, and we don't talk about it. Medford also has a deep history of anti-racist organizing, of abolitionists, and of black-led movements for racial equity and justice for all, which we almost never talk about as a community. I want to particularly note the story of Shirley Kuntz, who in the late 1960s fought to desegregate the Hervey School, where I attended elementary school.

216
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:45,155
Medford Historical Society hosts on their website a history of the many African American Medford residents who have fought racial injustices and advocated for everyone in our community. Medford residents of color have repeatedly stood up and demanded change and a real commitment to fight racism in Medford, even in the recent past. But as I've heard too often this week from people who fought for that change, they said, quote, still nothing has changed. No more.

217
01:30:46,066 --> 01:31:15,749
First, we have to declare systemic racism as a public health emergency here in Medford. One of the deepest impacts of racism are the racial health disparities that lead to poor medical treatment, illness, and death for people of color. This was the subject of my undergraduate thesis at UMass Amherst, and we know that even after you control for income or wealth or any other factor, Black people and people of color have worse health outcomes just because of their race. The increased illness and early death of our neighbors and friends is an emergency.

218
01:31:17,015 --> 01:31:46,748
This declaration is one of the municipal actions requested as part of the 10-point agenda from the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, and they were joined with many elected officials of color from across the state. Yes, at the beginning, this is symbolic, but it's also a statement of values, a statement that we are taking this seriously and something that the community must use to hold us, your elected officials, accountable to taking action. I'm also hopeful that under a different national administration, we will see increased funding,

219
01:31:47,120 --> 01:32:16,162
coming to communities that declare these emergencies. I wanna close by thanking Mayor Lungo Kern, who I heard today has also committed to issuing an order declaring systemic racism a public health emergency here in Medford. All of the city's elected officials need to make this an urgent priority. And more importantly than anything, this cannot be the end. This must be a continuation of the work unsung and unheard and unfulfilled that people in this community have been doing literally for centuries.

220
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:42,824
We have to take this seriously. We have to fight racism. We have to make Medford anti-racist. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilor Behrs for putting so much of that into a statement and putting it so well. So you alluded to this, but I'm gonna start by reading off a few statistics. So black Americans are nearly three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.

221
01:32:43,381 --> 01:33:10,162
Black women die of pregnancy related causes at a rate about three times higher than those of white women. Black Americans are dying of COVID-19 at a three times rate of white Americans. And black Americans face a higher risk of particle pollution than white Americans, which recent research has shown ties into the severity of COVID-19 cases. All of this does nothing to speak of the immense mental health toll of systemic and structural racism on black Americans.

222
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:40,132
These are just a few highlights of the so-called social determinants of health. So to me, as has been referenced already by Councilor Behrs, it's incredibly apparent that structural and systemic racism is a public health crisis. Saying so follows in line with statements of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association. However, simply naming this emergency does not get the work done. I'm committed, as I hope are my council colleagues,

223
01:33:40,368 --> 01:34:08,532
to work within our power and alongside our colleagues on the school committee and in the administration to work within our system and our structures to break down the systemic and structural racism that exists within this city and within this country. And I think the mayor, I had a line about us not being able to advance this work on our own. So I thank the mayor for coming out and supporting this statement. And that will allow us to dedicate resources and time to eradicate this issue.

224
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:38,468
And I also speak to the fact that I received probably more than 100 emails from community members around this, from residents seeking change and conversations that have needed to happen for decades that we cannot and should not ignore any longer. So again, this resolution is not the work. It's asking for the work to begin and inviting our colleagues throughout city government to work on this intractable challenge. And I ask my fellow counselors to support this resolution. And again, I thank the mayor for coming out with her declaration.

225
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:59,292
Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Rao. Is there any councilors that would like to speak on this at the moment? Okay. Anyone from the general public? Any comments or would anybody like to speak on this? Mr. President? One minute.

226
01:35:00,727 --> 01:35:22,816
Yes, Vice President Carvajal. Mr. President, I think this statement should come from the mayor, not from us. We could join with the mayor at some other time, but the mayor is the chief executive and I think she's the one that should be making the statements. Thank you, Vice President Carvajal.

227
01:35:23,963 --> 01:35:36,940
We have councilors at the moment would like to speak on this. We have members of the public that would like to speak. At this point in time, I'll recognize Curtis.

228
01:35:38,695 --> 01:35:55,233
Curtis, I'm trying to, there you go. Hello, thank you, I'm unmuted now. My name is Curtis Tooden, I live at 38 Early Ave in Medford, and I don't have much to add, I just, because Councilors Behrs and Morrell pretty much said it all, but I just think it's important to have it on the record, said out loud, that Black Lives Matter.

229
01:35:55,570 --> 01:36:22,739
and a vote in support of treating racism as it should be, a public health crisis. It's a vote for change that everybody in this community I think wants wholeheartedly. So thank you for having this on the agenda and I hope it proceeds. Thank you. Thank you, Curtis. Let's see, there's another hand up, I believe. Here we go.

230
01:36:26,266 --> 01:36:55,443
please have your name and address for the record. Yep, this is Marshall Mootnow at 33 Waterville Road, Medford. I think it's absolutely for the mayor to say, it's for the council to say, it's for everyone to say. Y'all can wish people happy birthdays, you can of course talk about anti-racist needs in our city. I think it's really important that this is brought to the fore and I hope that it becomes part of the discussion of the budget as well.

231
01:36:56,084 --> 01:37:01,619
The diversity funding is.

232
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:30,205
miniscule relative to other items. And I think if we're going to tackle this, we need to take a serious look of where we're putting our resources. And so I appreciate the sentiment about this is not the work, this is where the work begins. And I hope you all take a lens when you're looking at the other issues within the city. So thank you. Thank you. At this point in time, let's see,

233
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:53,493
Natalie Hill, can we please have your name and address for the record? Hi, my name is Natalie Hill. I live at 15 Madison Street, Medford, Mass. I'd like to just echo what council persons Morrell and Baird said. I am a mental health counselor, social worker. I feel very strongly that this is a public health crisis.

234
01:37:53,493 --> 01:38:16,544
It's been the main topic of conversation in all of my sessions for the last two weeks It should have been the topic of discussion in my sessions much longer than that. Um, I have done work on Mental health disparities and access to treatment for mental health. Um for for black the black community, um accessing mental health services um, it it has uh

235
01:38:16,544 --> 01:38:43,021
been a long and hard fight to get Resources to really look at how our systems really minimize The impacts of racism on the black community. I don't think You know, this should be put on any sort of backburner for discussion. That's all Thank you very much let's see we have a

236
01:38:43,139 --> 01:39:11,118
Mary, did you want to speak on the resolution offered by Councilors beers and console morale. There you go. I do. Thank you. I just want to thank you for bringing this forward, I do agree it's a public health crisis, but it has been for a long time. It's not a new emergency. It's something that we've been looking at for social determinants as far as

237
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:40,717
you know in inequalities and inequities for all peoples of color, and the disparities that they face, whether it because of their housing education and factors but against them so yes, thank you. This is a public health crisis but it has been for a long time, and we have been working on it we have gotten some grant funding to do some work but we have a lot more work to do, and I appreciate your, your acknowledgement and your support.

238
01:39:42,607 --> 01:40:09,083
Thank you. Let's see, we have, okay, we have Councilor Knight, and then we have a number of other people that would like this. We'll get to everyone. So I just ask everyone to please be patient. Councilor Knight. Yes, first we'll get to you. Mr. President, it's Mary Ann. You're getting me dizzy over there waving. Mr. President, this question's for Mary Ann.

239
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:32,388
I guess my question is this, what does this do in terms of it is, you know, Jack said it was a symbolic gesture. You know, words on paper. Does this give us any access to any money, I guess, these are a couple questions I have if we declare a public health emergency. Does it open up any avenues for us to get resources, number one. Number two, does it.

240
01:40:32,877 --> 01:41:00,687
create any obligations for us legally or establish any mandates that we need to follow that may become unfunded mandates. So, you know, is there gonna be an impact on the bottom line if we make a declaration of a public health emergency? You know, what's the process we have to go through to declare a public health emergency? And then once you do it, is there any unfunded mandates or other obligations that we need to live up to once that's done? And does it allow us to have

241
01:41:00,856 --> 01:41:28,075
access to resources, revenues and the like. Sorry, I was muted. Okay. Um, so as of right now, um, there is no funding available. As far as I know, if you

242
01:41:28,261 --> 01:41:56,257
declare a public health emergency like I said I feel it's more public health crisis this isn't anything new or emerging. There are grants and things that have been available and one we're just playing today for this week for a $200,000 grant but that's again it's not new it's not because of public health emergency. It's just the work we always do. I don't think there'll be any unfunded mandates associated with this at all because

243
01:41:56,813 --> 01:42:25,720
Maybe they should have been a long time ago, but there's nothing now in the works. No, you know this, obviously now that this has become such a an issue in the spotlight. There may be additional funding available, but nothing that we've seen so far, and nothing that I think would require us to, to have additional unfunded mandates, because

244
01:42:26,632 --> 01:42:54,053
So answer your question. I think so. I think so. So ultimately, you know, by making this declaration, it's more of just a statement. But, you know, I think, well, there obviously there should be action behind it. And we need to come up with action steps. That's what I'm saying to it. Yeah. Yeah.

245
01:42:54,222 --> 01:43:23,230
No, and I believe the mayor already has a list of action statements that she wants to implement his first trainings and discussions but like I said we have a grassroots advocacy grant going forward that's going to highlight this and some trainings and on anti racism and just some awareness that, you know, we as a white privilege so don't have a clue on what some of the issues are out there and I think we need to learn.

246
01:43:23,737 --> 01:43:53,538
So that's what we're looking at, but I do believe that the mayor already has some action steps as far as policy changes and, and things that she's looking at. Yeah, there has to be action behind this we, we just can't say this and not doing anything else. In terms of these action plans that the mayor is working on, I'm assuming that some of them are going to require council involvement somewhere along the line, whether it be in terms of passing policy or appropriating funding.

247
01:43:53,960 --> 01:44:21,061
I would assume Yeah, absolutely. So do you think it might warrant the conversation of us sitting down with the mayor and your office to discuss you know what, what we're really let's put some teeth into this thing if we're going to do it, you know what I mean? symbolic gesture tonight, but you know, I'm, I'm not big on symbolic stuff. I'm more of an action type of guy. You know, when it comes down to business, do you think that maybe it would make sense for us to sit down with you and the mayor, the mayor is going to make this declaration already.

248
01:44:21,314 --> 01:44:46,778
Wouldn't it make sense for us all to sit down and kind of craft the declaration and the next steps that would be, you know, suitable and enjoyable for all of us to participate in. Sure, I mean, obviously I think there are action steps that that can like there are some that can be some low hanging fruit, I guess you'd call it that we can be looking at as far as policy and changes go but there's some also some obviously some long term deep.

249
01:44:47,538 --> 01:45:15,398
conversations and things that need to happen and and yeah that that that would be between you and the mayor and my office would certainly be happy to support and and coordinate, but yeah. Do you think that that would be the best course of action. Yep. We need to get the conversations going. Absolutely. Sure. Yeah. Now, June 17 is some sort of meeting I believe that scheduled surround certain parts of this discussion.

250
01:45:17,474 --> 01:45:35,547
I don't know. I'm not sure which was not sure. I think the mayor said a little bit of a coven mind right now so

251
01:45:35,935 --> 01:46:01,788
I can't find it presently in my email. So I guess the question is, is that the suggested course of action? Do we sit down, meet with the Board of Health, meet with the mayor, the mayor is going to make the declaration, we can join her in putting out a joint statement and actually crafting some next steps and action items? Or do we want to make a symbolic statement and move on to the next speech? No, of course. No, of course.

252
01:46:02,092 --> 01:46:22,763
I think that would be the best course of action as far as all to sit down and talk about next steps, and putting some meat and some action behind behind these words, for sure. Sounds good to me. I think that that's a great suggestion myself. Mr President, I rest my case. Thank you very much. Thank you. I believe. Did you want to comment on this.

253
01:46:22,932 --> 01:46:47,013
Just to just to highlight the meeting on the 17th is the Human Rights Commission meeting that's going to focus on these issues designed to be the beginning of the community conversation surrounding some, allow the community to express their opinion, their feelings, their frustrations, and start working towards some community solutions to these issues. Thank you. Let's see, we have Councilor Behrs and Councilor Scott. Kelly, Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President.

254
01:46:47,435 --> 01:47:13,726
Yeah, I mean, the intent here and the intent of the next motion is that the 14 white people who are in elected office might not have the best answers to these questions. And I don't think that we should just go ahead and say, we can solve racism. We don't experience it. So I think the intent of this is to say, this is a crisis, this is an emergency. We need to take action, as Councilor Morrell and I said,

255
01:47:14,367 --> 01:47:42,312
You know, this is a starting point. This is a statement of values and we have to live up to those values through action I could put ten things on the agenda tonight But I think I want to hear from black residents and residents of color about what they want to do moving forward And and residents of the community. I think we have to have an open process and open conversation and I don't think That us coming up with ideas in a room is necessarily the best way to do that. So I

256
01:47:42,565 --> 01:48:10,493
That's the intent of this and the intent of the following motion is to bring the public in because at the end of the day, a lot of this is about how we all live our lives and us saying something and us putting something out, we can get to a lot of problems, but the biggest thing we need to do is do the education and do the conversation and have that community process so that we can, how many people

257
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:36,380
saw things or heard things in the past week that they never thought were happening in this city. Because I know 15 who texted me about it, and I'm sure that there's many more. The intent here is this is a statement of our values. We're taking this seriously. We're going to take action. So that's the intent of this. And I think we have to involve the community as openly and widely as possible to do that. So thank you.

258
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:43,771
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the time.

259
01:48:44,463 --> 01:49:08,982
question a resolution that It could be looked deeper and it could also be looked at by the public as just lip service so I think that I said I had a statement that that I too feel the murder of George Floyd is an incomprehensible horror that has occurred in our country I'm beyond saddened by the current state of the Union as a father husband son brother and more importantly a human being and

260
01:49:09,185 --> 01:49:35,273
It is unfathomable that yet again is discriminatory murders act has occurred. How are we here yet again? We need to have what needs to happen for the census acts of violence to stop. We're being ripped apart by this nation and controversies. These situations remind us that as a privileged white male, I need to first of all acknowledge that

261
01:49:35,695 --> 01:50:04,163
my privilege. Secondly, I need to be responsible for how I lead my life and model beliefs and behaviors that support the values of all people, that we're all created equal. So questions come about. It matters how we treat each other. It matters that we teach our children what we teach our children. It matters the words we use. It matters what actions we take. It matters what choices we make now that will actually create a better future.

262
01:50:04,602 --> 01:50:34,150
And yes, black lives do matter. In Medford, we need to see some change. We've heard that. And as we talk and bring this resolution forward, we realize that as we listen to young men and women that I've coached and taught, and they express their concerns of racism and inequalities, it opens your eyes.

263
01:50:36,361 --> 01:50:43,533
I love the city of Medford and I'm heartbroken that we have our residents continually traumatized and hurt by ignorance.

264
01:50:44,613 --> 01:51:07,630
But I'm also wanna make sure that we as a community learn to work together and make sure that we're in this, in looking some of these emails that we're getting a device of in splitting our community where, you know, the whole defunding of the police department and looking at what the budget looks like in the police department.

265
01:51:09,908 --> 01:51:35,677
I've talked to the chief. I know we have to look at change. We need to address the way that our police officers might need more professional development when it comes to conflict resolution. I understand we have concerns with how our police officers are being hired, but I think that as we move forward, like Councilor Knight said, I think we need more action.

266
01:51:36,436 --> 01:52:04,972
I think that with the mayor's leadership that we need to start a forum with members in our community, a black community that can come out and tell us, as my former students have come and talked to me about and shared those concerns. Now, great, like Councilor Beall says, yep, here's all the white people talking to 14 privileged white people that are in power here at our political level.

267
01:52:06,777 --> 01:52:29,491
but I don't see one person of color here. I've got a form letter from people that have concerns. A statement like this, I appreciate it, and I can understand that Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beals want to go forward with this.

268
01:52:30,166 --> 01:52:58,212
But as I talk to my colleagues in Somerville, there is substance behind what they're going to do. So it's great to send out a statement and talk about this horror and talk about the change. When you sit with a young black man and a young black woman, they tell you that they're afraid sometimes to leave their house if they're gonna come home. And that's an awful way to think.

269
01:52:58,853 --> 01:53:28,537
But what I think we need more than ever right now is the action. I think that we should immediately form a community advisory group with our city administrators, our police department, our superintendent, our black leaders in our community, so they can lead us to what is actually wrong. I have two young children

270
01:53:29,431 --> 01:53:57,882
that opened up a lot of dialogue, but we need to start moving forward with a discussion, not with just a statement. So I thank you for hearing me and hopefully we see some movement. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scott. Let's see, we have a number of people with their hands up. At this point, I'll recognize, we'll get to everyone. So let's see, Christia Vina.

271
01:53:58,675 --> 01:54:16,681
Name and address for the record, please. Thank you, Mr. President. Christie Avino, 24 Carberry Street in Medford, Massachusetts. Thank you so much, Councilor Behrs, for your very thoughtful and your forthright

272
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:33,708
that you've taken by submitting this resolution to the Medford City Council. Thank you, Councilor Morrell, for putting together such clear authority supporting that, yes, systemic racism is a public health emergency.

273
01:54:33,708 --> 01:55:03,340
in our country, not just with respect to police violence, but also with respect to healthcare, access to health treatment and many other quality of life indicators. I think as I look at our city council composed of entirely what appears to me white individuals, it's clear that more work needs to be done within our city to elevate people of color,

274
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:29,210
um to representation, but that is not where we are today, and I think it's incumbent upon this council to look at this groundswell that is happening across this country. People protesting in the middle of a pandemic because they are in fear of their lives. They are in fear for their children's lives. They're in fear for their parents' lives.

275
01:55:30,037 --> 01:55:54,269
And I think if Medford chooses not to come forward with so many other cities, towns, states, medical organizations, for example, nurses organizations across the country are coming forward and supporting resolutions like Councilor Behrs. I think if this council chooses not to do it, we are saying we are afraid

276
01:55:54,691 --> 01:56:19,615
and we are on the wrong side of history. The time is now to step up and say, yes, we are committed to working with our black brothers and sisters. We are committed to working with the African-American community that has sustained the city of Medford for so long, but not seen representation at the state, at the city level or the state level.

277
01:56:19,615 --> 01:56:48,455
we are committed by issuing this statement to saying, yes, we see you, we recognize you. A statement issued at the beginning of a city council meeting doesn't do it, but passing a formal resolution saying, yes, we are willing to get to work, we are willing to put together forms, we're willing to sit down with a mayor, yes, the action items will come. But right now today, when so many people, people of all color, white people,

278
01:56:48,877 --> 01:57:08,941
across this country are in so much pain from the decades and really centuries of violence against people of color in the United States, the time is now to step forward and say, yes, we recognize that systemic racism must be dismantled in many ways, but it is, first of all, a public health emergency.

279
01:57:09,194 --> 01:57:37,612
And I urge all councilors to listen carefully to the statistics that Councilor Morrell has provided and really listen to the voices of people, not only across the country, but here in Medford, asking our elected officials to stand up with us and stand with us. The time is now. Thank you very much. Thank you, Christy. Let's see, we have...

280
01:57:38,607 --> 01:58:01,186
Natalie Hill. Name and address for the record, please. I already spoke. I apologize. I'll be brief. But I forgot to mention one of the action items that I think folks should address is the mural that is in the post office on Forest Street. I know there was a petition in 2018 to address this mural. It is

281
01:58:01,186 --> 01:58:26,077
I can understand why this hasn't been taken down at this point in time, but it really should be addressed and it's a clear action item that can be taken. Again, I'm Natalie Hill, 15 Madison Street, Medford. Thank you very much. Councilor Scarapelli, did you want to speak on that? Yeah, I know for the last week, I appreciate everybody's comments and I'm open-minded, but at the same time,

282
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:50,765
A statement is a statement. What I want to make sure that we do, I'm going to make the motion that we refer for a meeting immediately with the Board of Health, the mayor, the police chief, the diversity director, and our school superintendent to address items immediately.

283
01:58:51,524 --> 01:59:20,465
I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, and we need to go move forward with this. So I call for my president and our school city council to move that motion, to vote on that motion, and get the conversation started. Not what Somerville put out and what other communities are putting out. Let's do what Medford needs to do to make sure that we are protecting our friends of color and that have been hit with this racial injustice. I think we need to move forward with that. Thank you, Mr. President.

284
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:50,097
Councilor Scarpelli, if I may, I just want to make sure. So that is, if I'm correct, that is an amendment to the main resolution offered by Councilor Beza and Councilor Morrell. Could you please just confirm that you have the wording of Councilor Scarpelli? The motion. Yes, I have the wording. If you'd like me to read it back, it's an amendment. It's a motion. I'm sorry, it's a motion. Do you want it as part of the main motion? Do you want it amended to the main paper, or do you want it as a B paper? I want it as a B paper.

285
01:59:50,519 --> 02:00:04,492
Okay, it's a B paper, okay. The motion on the main paper. Right. B paper too. The motion on the main paper. Is it a B paper or is it a motion on the main paper? It's a B paper. Offered by Councilor Scott Kelly.

286
02:00:05,977 --> 02:00:22,919
I mean, I'm still not clear whether Councilor Scarpelli is moving to approve the paper with this condition on it or whether it's a B paper to the main paper. No, it's a B paper. I'm not moving to accept this. What I'm hearing from everybody is that we need action.

287
02:00:23,054 --> 02:00:44,570
So I agree. So my motion isn't to, um, it's to move forward to get the board of health, the, uh, the mayor's office, the police chief, the diversity director, the superintendent of schools to immediately meet with the suit, with the, with the method city council to start a process by bringing people of color to the table.

288
02:00:45,295 --> 02:01:14,692
working with them to make sure that we move to a positive resolution. And this isn't going to take, this isn't going to be a one week issue. This is something that we need to find a way to work both budgetary and socially to move this forward. So thank you, Mr. Clark. Thank you. I hope you got that. I got it. Thank you. Okay.

289
02:01:14,928 --> 02:01:44,510
Let's see, we had a, I'm sorry, Vice President Carviello, did you have your hand up? I did, Mr. President, I wanted to thank you. And I want to thank all my colleagues for the great suggestions, especially Councilor Scott Pelley saying that we're BEDFED and we should do what's good for our community, not what's good for other communities. Mr. President, I've been, I've lived in this community my whole life. I'm a graduate at Meppet High School, similar to what many of these other people are. And I'm a, I'm a probably a 30 year volunteer in this community.

290
02:01:44,830 --> 02:02:11,020
Long before I ran for city council, I was involved with this community doing many, many things. So I work from action. I don't work from statements or pieces of paper. I let my actions and leadership lead the way in what I do and what I have been. You know, when I first ran for office 10 years ago, one of the people who schooled me pretty well was the late Wally Counts.

291
02:02:11,459 --> 02:02:34,477
And Wally Counts took me into his house, two hours, one night, and really explained to me the things that it took to be a counselor in the city of Medford, and how he had supported other people for counsel, and they didn't live up to his expectations over what they should do for the African-American community. And I made a commitment to Wally Counts that night

292
02:02:34,477 --> 02:02:57,089
that I will continue to support everyone in our African-American community and I still continue to do so to this day. So Mr. President, I lead with my actions and I'm a leader in this community and I'll continue to be a leader in the African-American community going forward. Thank you Councilor, Vice President Carvillo. Daniel Faluca.

293
02:03:00,295 --> 02:03:15,652
Hi, thank you. I'm not too familiar with city government, so this is a great learning experience for me. But like Natalie, I'm also a social worker. Danielle, and I apologize to interrupt. The first thing we need to do is if you could just give us your name and address for the record.

294
02:03:15,652 --> 02:03:31,632
The club records that and then you can speak. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Danielle Blanca, 17 Wilson Street in Medford. So I want to echo Natalie. I'm also a social worker in the community and I've been having a lot of conversations with clients about

295
02:03:31,632 --> 02:04:00,421
their safety, especially black people right now. And I think your responsibility as our city council members is to make yourself accessible and to out yourselves as people who honor and respect black lives. Many of you are noticing your privilege right now, and don't forget that our black community members and their ancestors have always known about our privilege. And I think what you're deciding around declaration versus action steps,

296
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:29,783
I think it sounds like you're deciding that people of color don't need to hear about your immediate support. And so Mr. Scarapelli, he described the murder of George Floyd as incomprehensible. And I just wanna put it out there that if that's not incomprehensible for our black community members, it happens all the time. And just to- Point of information. Point of information, Mr. President. One minute, please. So, okay, so- Almost done.

297
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:48,802
the the imprehensible is that someone was was tragically killed. So that's what's imprehensible. And then the idea of, if you can repeat the comment that you made before, because I thought I misheard you speak, that we're not

298
02:04:51,788 --> 02:05:19,919
So yeah, so I was just gonna bring up the point that I think what it sounds like what you guys are saying is you're deciding between a declaration or action steps. And I think it doesn't have to be an either or, but it can be a yes and. I think like putting a declaration out to the community, letting them know that you stand with black people is really important. And that's a way to activate the community, get black community members involved in the work that you're gonna continue to do. One information, Mr. President.

299
02:05:20,645 --> 02:05:50,480
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli. I think my words are clear. I think that my record speaks for itself. I think that making a motion just to make a motion, as other communities did, I want to go further beyond that. So I think it's more important, yes, that we make that motion to meet with all the representatives to get this forward. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. We have Councilor Beers, Councilor Morrell, Councilor Marks, Councilor Beers. Point of information, Mr. President.

300
02:05:50,615 --> 02:06:18,290
Point of information, Councilor Marks. Councilor Marks. I just want to state because, you know, I'm actually here tonight to listen more than I do speak. But I think this is far too important of an issue to not attack it on many fronts. So I'm not opposed to putting out a statement. I'm not opposed to getting together, as Councilor Scott Pelley said, in trying to move issue items forward. I think we have to attack this head on, Mr. President.

301
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:44,935
As we heard, this systemic racism has existed for decades. So don't believe for one second we can take one approach to solve this. We have to take many different approaches, Mr. President. And I, as one member of the council, am willing to do that, Mr. President. So tonight, because I'm not saying a lot, I wanted to listen, Mr. President. I think it's important to listen to the community. I attended the rally, Mr. President.

302
02:06:44,935 --> 02:07:01,642
And as my council colleagues state, I realize there's a lot of anger out there. But you have to remember, I represent this whole city. When someone reaches out to me with a concern, I don't ask them what their ethnicity is. I don't ask them what their religion is. I help everyone, Mr. President.

303
02:07:01,642 --> 02:07:16,238
So I would hope that members of the general public realize that we're here to assist, we're here to help, and I don't think there's anyone behind the reel, the seven of us, that don't want to see change in this community, Mr. President.

304
02:07:16,373 --> 02:07:45,922
And I, for one, agree with my colleagues. I like to see action. And I'm not saying a statement's not bad. I agree with the statement that was made by both Counselor Beers and Morrell. I agree with that. But I also like to see action. I want to see action happen in this community, Mr. President. You know, this is a long point of information, but I'll wait, Mr. President. But I did want to mention, because I'd say 90% of the emails I got were relative to defunding the police department.

305
02:07:46,293 --> 02:08:15,267
And I think at some point, no one wants to talk about it, but at some point that discussion needs to be had, Mr. President, because I've talked to members of the general public. I've talked to members of the police department. And I, you know, in my opinion, I think the general public and the police department share a lot of common concerns and a lot of issues that I hear people raise about maybe the police department has too much on their plate. Maybe the police department shouldn't be domestic violence specialists. Maybe they shouldn't be drug counselors.

306
02:08:15,267 --> 02:08:18,440
Maybe they should be mental health counselors, social workers.

307
02:08:18,727 --> 02:08:47,735
Um, and those are the issues I think, you know, that we can have common ground and say, you know what? Maybe we have to look at funding stuff outside of the police budget to assist with issues, Mr. President, that we're hearing. I think there's a lot of common ground. I really do. But I don't want to get bogged down in the weeds of us against them. And, you know, I, you know, I ran for office to help Mr. President. And if people see otherwise, so be it. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

308
02:08:47,887 --> 02:09:17,468
But I think all of us have the same intent, Mr. President. We want to move this forward. And I think getting back and forth with semantics and so forth, I think it doesn't do the conversation just, Mr. President. So I just want to add that, Mr. President. I'm here for the long run. I'm here to assist and help out. But I'm also here to listen. God gave me two ears and one mouth for a reason. Do twice as much listening, Mr. President. You are correct. Thank you, Councilor Marks.

309
02:09:19,088 --> 02:09:48,367
Councilor Beers, Councilor Morrell, we have a number of members of the public that would like to speak on this. And I know you've been speaking numerous times, but I'll recognize Councilor Beers. Thank you, Mr. President. And I mean, I don't know how I could have made it any clearer that this is a starting point for the action that we're talking about, that this is a beginning. This is not even a beginning, a continuation and a recognition. And just to the point, this is action. This is an action that we are being

310
02:09:48,991 --> 02:10:16,767
Asked to take by the black and latino elected officials of this commonwealth. They said Municipalities, this is one of the actions we want you to take and it's not about somerville. It's not about anything else This is about the fact that black and latino elected officials across the state have said we want communities to do this And i'm listening to them. So that's why this is on the agenda And that's why I put it forward i'm listening to them And I want the next item is about a forum so that we can listen to people in this community

311
02:10:17,088 --> 02:10:42,940
and get to the agreement and make these changes. That's what I'm talking about. That's what the intention is. All else I wanted to say is I'm so grateful for all of the people who showed up tonight, all the people who spoke, and I likely won't speak again on this topic, but who knows. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, and I will just be brief. I just want to echo what Councilor Behrs was saying. This is a starting point.

312
02:10:43,261 --> 02:11:12,944
It feels silly to say naming the problem because this is something that has existed since the beginning of our country. And as Marianne O'Connor said, this is a known issue, but it's naming it and it's starting these conversations. And absolutely, as I said, when I introduced this, this is not the work. The work starts from here. This is naming where we have to go from here. And again, as Councilor Behr said, this is responding to a direct call from the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus

313
02:11:13,265 --> 02:11:39,708
I'm encouraging us to do this, to do this action. This is one of the many actions they're encouraging. So I'm trying to listen to those voices and move off that. And I want to, I'll stop talking as well. I want to give time for people to talk. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Morrell. We have a number of residents that want to speak that have been waiting patiently. So I want to, let's see if we could go to Rebecca Schmielen.

314
02:11:40,096 --> 02:11:44,028
I apologize if I have that incorrect. If you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.

315
02:11:44,838 --> 02:12:13,188
Yeah, that was a pretty good pronunciation. So I'm at 206 Salem Street here in Medford. And I just really, a lot of the things I wanted to say were already said by some really eloquent, least spoken people. I wanna echo what Danielle was saying that I don't think you have to choose between words and actions. And as a white person myself, I think the past few weeks I've been dealing with kind of my own privilege and realizing that

316
02:12:13,188 --> 02:12:34,197
While it's great to say that your actions speak for themselves, sometimes we need to say the words and do the actions. So, just hearing a lot of community members in the past few weeks arguing on social media about, you know, All Lives Matter versus Black Lives Matter, I think it's really important that as a body that represents

317
02:12:34,197 --> 02:12:55,223
this community, we're saying it out loud that this is a problem that we need to address. And I do want to just kind of echo what Councilman Scarpelli was saying about bringing in the community. I think, you know, there's probably a reason why all of the council members and from what I can tell, most of the people speaking tonight are white.

318
02:12:55,223 --> 02:13:24,856
I just want to say thank you to the council for putting forward this resolution. What can we do as a council to bring people to feel more comfortable speaking and listening and participating with the rest of the community. I don't want to say a grand speech either. I want to let other people have their time. Thank you to the council people who have put this

319
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:39,149
Thanks. Thank you, Rebecca. We have Divya Anand. Please have your name and address for the record, please.

320
02:13:40,229 --> 02:14:05,575
Divya Anand, 122 Park Street, Medford, Unit 2. I heard a lot of the city councilors speak and also members of the public speak. And one, a few things that stood out to me was, you know, where as a person of color, we would be invited to the table and we don't wanna be invited to the table. We want you to listen.

321
02:14:06,436 --> 02:14:34,752
And there was someone who said that we would be allowed and I object to that term. I have been in that city council. I have tried to speak up in the past and I've had horrible experiences. So I hope there are a few moments of reflection on how comfortable or how safe city council spaces or city administration spaces are for people of color to even show up and speak up.

322
02:14:39,123 --> 02:15:05,245
And I heard about the community advisory board, and I also want to throw in, like, in that advisory board, who has power? And also, please note that all people of color, all black people are not a monolith. We have differences of opinion. There's diversity among us. So I just wanted to throw in that as well. Thank you. Thank you.

323
02:15:12,805 --> 02:15:25,867
Melanie McLaughlin. Name and address. Melanie, I'm trying to unmute you.

324
02:15:34,608 --> 02:16:02,958
Okay, Melanie, you're on. Hi, Council President Falco. I was just saying it's Melanie McLaughlin, 152 Alston. Hi, Council President Falco. Just saying that it's Melanie McLaughlin, 152 Alston Street. And since I've spoken earlier, I will defer if there are other people with their hands raised until the end. I think you wanted a lot. Are there other people with their hands?

325
02:16:03,633 --> 02:16:16,340
I just wanted to echo a lot of work as a woman, a white woman of privilege as well, and

326
02:16:16,610 --> 02:16:44,335
I want to echo the other folks who are thanking Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell. I thought Councilor Behrs' statement was incredibly articulate and right on the money for everything that I've been hearing and listening to among the community. I agree with many of the folks who are saying we need to listen and not talk. And I especially agree with our previous speaker, Divya Anand, who talked about safe spaces for people of color and white people and white privilege. And I think that

327
02:16:44,335 --> 02:17:10,964
If we're talking about any community forums, we need to be the ones who are invited to the table as white people, and it needs to be people of color-led, and Divya is a great example of that. She talks about ABIPOC, that's African American Indigenous People of Color, and those are the ranges of individuals.

328
02:17:19,958 --> 02:17:49,068
I think we lost Melanie. I think Melanie might have dropped off the call. Hi, I'm here, sorry. It looked like you guys dropped me and then it looked like just put me back on.

329
02:17:49,507 --> 02:18:05,234
please continue. I don't know how much you guys heard. So I feel like I was on the cell phone talking when you know, you don't know if anybody's on the other line. So all I just wanted to add was I thought, uh, counselor bears and counselor morale were incredibly articulate. I echo

330
02:18:05,858 --> 02:18:35,474
the sentiment of other white folks in this space, but it is unfortunate that there are so many white people speaking in this space. I think to Dr. Anand's point, Dr. Divya Anand's point, who has done a lot of this work previously, we need to be the folks invited to the table. I think we need to make a strong statement that Black Lives Matter, that Zach Baer's resolution and the advice of our friends who are ABI POC individuals is taken. And I would strongly encourage

331
02:18:35,474 --> 02:19:04,246
the council and the community to listen and to be invited into spaces where people of color are inviting us. And if they're gracious enough to invite us after the 400 years of oppression and all of the things that we've seen, it's been a really powerful time. And I especially want to thank the students for what they did last week and coming forward. I was so impressed and so horrified at the same time with what I was reading, knowing that it was true, but also the bravery in which they came forward. That's all I have to say. Thank you.

332
02:19:04,786 --> 02:19:34,773
Thank you. I was going to recognize Joyce Paul next. Is Joyce still on the call? I think we may have lost Joyce. OK. OK. Would anybody else like to comment? Philip Kossel, Scott Kelly? Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I think that I

333
02:19:35,380 --> 02:20:01,823
I appreciate school committee member Melanie McLaughlin. I think that as we start these conversations, one thing I realized and what I've heard and who I heard from the most and the loudest are our young people, young people of color that really stood up and said, this is what we need. This is the problem. These are the issues, these are the concerns. So I think as we move on with that group, I know that I need to withdraw that B paper.

334
02:20:02,279 --> 02:20:13,906
And I want to make that as a motion, please. And I think I misspoke. But having those young people at the table, so yes, we can listen to them. We can invite them to come in.

335
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:43,201
This is what I've done in the last couple of weeks, especially as I'm talking to young men and women of color, I've asked them, as a privileged white man, what do you see? What can help us learn, teach us what we need to learn? Because there's a lot that we need to learn as a privileged white community. So maybe, as they said, listen to them. Bring them as part of the forum.

336
02:20:44,990 --> 02:21:12,783
It's the mouths of babes, they're gonna tell you how they feel, and we have to listen. So again, I made a mistake as I spoke early. I motion to move forward with the information that I spoke earlier, Mr. Clerk, and move forward with the resolution, with the motion. Thank you. Thank you, Counselor Scott Kelly. We have, let's see, Diane Sullivan.

337
02:21:16,512 --> 02:21:44,845
Yes, hi. Hi, give an address on the record, please. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. Diane Sullivan, 83 Jerome Street, West Medford. Thank you. I just wanted to acknowledge my appreciation for Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell's work and leadership on this. I appreciate what folks have added to this conversation. And I think most of us here in Medford acknowledge this is

338
02:21:45,183 --> 02:22:13,820
a long overdue conversation. It's not the first time we've approached this very sensitive issue. As an ally, I'm a social justice and racial justice advocate. I've been for many years. It's been my intent to try to educate other white allies. And I think that as we look for our roles in this community, that's where our attention

339
02:22:14,005 --> 02:22:41,343
you know, or where we can really help and support each other. Um, you know, I agree. I apologize. I missed her name as I'm driving. Um, but, um, the woman of color who spoke about, um, how safe people of color feel in, um, in, in, in showing up in city government. And I just want, you know, I've been doing the work of engaging people with lived experience in the anti-poverty space. Myself as somebody with lived experience who,

340
02:22:41,647 --> 02:23:08,630
And just in full disclosure, when I first started to think about what white privilege meant as somebody who was low income, I had a hard time wrapping my head around it. But it soon became clear that even despite my poverty, my privilege was always intact. So I'm dedicated. Diane, you there?

341
02:23:13,962 --> 02:23:42,127
Diane? Encouraged by the bravery that our students have shown. I've had one-on-one conversations with a lot of young adults who've been impacted by racism in this city. I'm encouraged by their bravery. I agree. This is really about building trust in relationships. When we talk about, quote unquote, inviting folks to the table, we really need to create the space that says, you are welcome and you are equal.

342
02:23:42,312 --> 02:24:04,486
Your voice matters and you are an expert in your own experience and and we need to really listen to these voices So I'm encouraged by the discussion tonight. I throw my 100% full support behind it I'm doing my you know work on my own trying to connect with a lot of these youth so that they right now can acknowledge the power that they hold and

343
02:24:04,857 --> 02:24:34,338
people who are in power. And we have to come together with those that they see in power. And really begin on the path towards healing. Because that is really what it is. And we have to acknowledge white privilege. Have this discussion in ways and creative ways that we have not thought about before. Again, councilor bears, councilor Morrell for taking your leadership. And other councilmembers who are clearly ready to get behind this.

344
02:24:35,722 --> 02:24:58,182
Thank you. Are there any other comments or questions or would anybody like to make a statement? Did we get Joyce back? I feel bad we lost Joyce. Okay. So if I may, I want to...

345
02:24:59,465 --> 02:25:28,760
I want to thank Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell for bringing this paper forward. I agree with you a thousand percent. And I think Councilor Beers, you know, you hit it on the head when you said, you know, this can't be the end. This has to be just the beginning. You know, it's a continuation. We need to work on this and we need to work on this now. This has to be something that is addressed immediately. It will take time, but we need to begin now. So I thank you both for bringing this forward. I agree with you a thousand percent. I look forward to working with everyone

346
02:25:29,182 --> 02:25:56,873
throughout our community on this issue. It needs to be addressed, and we need to do it now. So I look forward to working with the administration, all the elected officials, everyone, the public. We need involvement, and I think Councilor Marchione on the head, we need to listen, and that's really big. So I thank you for bringing this forward. So on the motion of Councilor Beers and Councilor Laurel, seconded by, is there a second?

347
02:25:58,645 --> 02:26:25,105
Mr. President, does this include the B paper as well? That's going to be a separate resolution. I eliminated the B paper. Okay. No worries, no worries. So on the motion of Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beers, seconded by? Second. Councilor Marks, Clerk Urbis, please call the roll. Councilor Beers? Yes. Vice President Carabiello?

348
02:26:28,598 --> 02:26:49,135
Vice President Carriello. I don't have Vice President Carriello. I'm gonna skip Vice President Carriello. I'm gonna go to Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I would vote no this evening, and I would like the record to reflect that I feel as though we need to meet with the administration and produce some action items before we move forward.

349
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:25,552
Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? No. President Falco? Yes. And then we need Vice President Caravello, I didn't hear him. Vice President Caravello, are you with us? Hold on, Mr. President. Thank you, I'm sorry. I left the table for a minute. I'm sorry.

350
02:27:26,142 --> 02:27:49,902
No, I'm gonna vote no, I think for the same reasons that my other two colleagues are saying. We need to take action on this and not words, not pieces of paper. Okay, so you're a no vote? Yes. Okay, thank you. Clerk Artebiz, you've called the roll. I have four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

351
02:27:51,117 --> 02:28:10,473
Is that what you have? That's what I have. Okay, correct, okay. Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes. 20406, offered by Councilor Pierce. Oh, I'm sorry. Councilor Scarpelli has a motion. Councilor Scarpelli's motion, do you have the wording to that?

352
02:28:12,886 --> 02:28:35,414
Councilor Scarpella, I wanna make sure I have that wording right. You wanna move for an immediate meeting with the mayor, the police chief, the board of health, the diversity director, the school superintendent, and representative of communities of color.

353
02:28:35,718 --> 02:29:02,245
Yes, and especially the youth. And the youth. We look to our leadership, our senior leadership, and have our high school students involved in these discussions, because that's what I'm hearing. As I've gone out and talked, I've heard a lot from our students, more than anything. So I would love to have them at that table. Thank you. Second, Mr. President.

354
02:29:03,511 --> 02:29:32,772
The motion of Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by Vice President Caviello-Cook. Mr. President, before the roll is called. Councilor Marks. I believe Councilor Scott Peli alluded to it, but I just want to confirm. This meeting is also going to be a meeting open to the general public, correct? Oh, absolutely. Okay. It's a forum. That's what I'm asking for. A forum with a table where, especially as people have spoken, that people of color don't feel comfortable.

355
02:29:33,177 --> 02:29:57,848
in our forum that we need to reach those individuals and bring them to that table so they can share and help us move forward in a positive way, and make Meffitt a better place to live. So I think it's important that we do that. Thank you for clarifying. Mr. President. Mr. President. Okay, on that motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Marks. Councilor Pierce.

356
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:27,262
motion to join this with paper 2406, the request for a forum with the mayor that I put on the agenda for tonight's meeting. Okay. No, I don't think you can. You want this separate? I want this separate, please. Okay. On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Marks, Clerk Urnavis, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Sure.

357
02:30:28,088 --> 02:30:55,595
Vice President Carabiello? Yes. Councilor Nights? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven affirmative, zero negative motion passes. 20-406 offered by council appears to be resolved at the Memphis City Council. Resolved by the Memphis City Council that the council and the city administration urgently host a public community forum for residents.

358
02:30:55,595 --> 02:31:25,328
to discuss the structural and cultural concerns regarding policing in our community as requested by numerous Methodist residents and community organizations. Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. The intent of this was very similar to the discussion that we had. And I just, essentially, I think we need to have a forum. But I think the most important thing is that we're going to have a bunch of councilors, the mayor, chief of police, all these folks in the room. It can't be about us talking. It needs to be about us listening. And that's what I'm most concerned about.

359
02:31:25,666 --> 02:31:55,552
Um, you know, we need to make sure that we are not just taking action because we want to take action. And I understand the urgent desire for action, but as Divya said, if people of color don't even feel comfortable and safe coming to public meetings and spaces and speaking, you know, that forum is going to be very, it's not going to be what we need it to be. So, um, the intent of this motion is very similar to, uh, to that before. And I would just make one amendment.

360
02:31:56,176 --> 02:32:24,847
It's cultural concerns regarding racism and policing. So two separate topics. I think we need to talk about both. Racism in our community goes far beyond anything about policing. It's everywhere. Thank you, Councilor Beers. Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Councilor Beers. Again, with what I've heard, and this is why I'm so animated, is that as I work with

361
02:32:25,184 --> 02:32:52,775
uh, strong men of color. And we sit together and they say, you know, George, that's great. Um, we're going to, we're going to, you know, we're going to march and we're going to do this and we're going to do that. But you know what, as the next day comes on, something else is going to happen. It's going to be forgotten. Okay. Because remember when I was a young man, Rodney King was beaten and remember everybody stood up and marched and burned the city down.

362
02:32:53,669 --> 02:33:22,120
So I think it's important, and again, I'm gonna stress it. It's important that my friends, my neighbors that have talked to me and said, George, if you're an elected official, talk is great, marches are great, do something. So let's do something. That's why these meetings are important that we have right away. The budget's important, we know that, but we can't let another day go by without finishing this. So thank you. Thank you, council members.

363
02:33:23,791 --> 02:33:41,324
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly. Vice President Caviello. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, Mr. President, you know, we talk about having all these meetings, all these meetings, and they're all well and great, but here we are, a bunch of white people knowing, thinking that we know all the

364
02:33:41,813 --> 02:34:09,050
yields of African-Americans, and we don't. We don't. And I'm a little disappointed tonight that I didn't hear from more people in the community about their issues. If all we're going to do is have meetings amongst ourselves, and people of color don't come to these meetings, then we're going nowhere, Mr. President.

365
02:34:09,539 --> 02:34:38,682
So that's the key, is to bring people of color to the table, not a bunch of white people thinking that we know what their ills are, because we don't. We haven't walked in these shoes, and we don't know. We might think we know, but we don't. I mean, we have an idea, but again, we don't know. And again, the real key idea is we need to bring them to the table to have these discussions. So again, so that's the most important part, Mr. President. Thank you, Vice President Capiello.

366
02:34:39,104 --> 02:35:07,775
Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not trying to delve too deep into this topic, but I think we need to watch carefully when we're asking people of color to do the unpaid labor of educating us. Racism is something white people had a very good part in, and I think we could definitely think of some ways we can do better by it, and not asking people of color in Medford to answer all of our questions and do all the work for us. So I just want to

367
02:35:08,146 --> 02:35:36,952
that on the record. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Pierce. I just want to echo. I want to echo Councilor Morrell and I just want to say I just got a text from a Medford resident of color, I'm not going to put them on the spot, who said there's a lot of hate on Facebook right now and it scared people away from this meeting. So I just again, you know, racism has a lot of different impacts and one of them is who shows up here. Thank you. Councilor Pierce.

368
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:54,788
Let's see, any other questions from the council? Any other comments? Okay, let's see. Curtis, we can try to unmute you. Curtis, hi, name and address for the record, please. Thank you, this is Curtis Tootin at 38 Early Ave in Medford.

369
02:35:55,143 --> 02:36:09,470
And I just wanted to speak to the issue you're discussing about how there hasn't been a large number of people of color voicing their opinions tonight. And I wanted to point out that especially due to the pandemic, we are a technologically segregated city right now.

370
02:36:09,892 --> 02:36:39,322
And I happen to be a white guy who happens to have multiple devices and very reliable internet, but that is not the case for a lot of the families and people who would rather be here. And I know when we were all at Hormel at the vigil together, that there are a bunch of people who couldn't make it tonight that want to see progress in the city. So thank you for making sure it gets on the agenda. And I hope that the news of the positive steps tonight reach all corners of Medford. So thank you. Thank you, Curtis.

371
02:36:40,132 --> 02:37:05,343
Any other questions or comments? Okay, seeing and hearing none, on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by? Seconded. Seconded by Councilor Morrell, as amended by Councilor Behrs. Clerk Carnavis, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Caravaglia.

372
02:37:09,865 --> 02:37:28,073
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Council night. Yeah. Council marks. Yes. Council Morrell. Yes. I'll just go Peli. Yes. President Falco. Yes. So the affirmative zero the negative, the motion passes.

373
02:37:28,883 --> 02:37:53,234
20-407 offered by Council of Mayors, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express a request to 2680 and act relative to municipal governance during the COVID-19 emergency. Be it further resolved that the legislature amend the text of 2680 to allow municipalities to issue state qualified deficit financing bonds to provide revenue

374
02:37:53,234 --> 02:38:16,673
to support essential general fund programs endangered by the current economic crisis. Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Method Legislative Delegation, as well as House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker. Councilor Beers. Thank you, Mr. President.

375
02:38:17,686 --> 02:38:46,407
I'm happy to report that the bill actually passed late last weekend, has been signed into law. Spoke with Representative Donato about it as well. One thing that the bill allows the city to do is to look at special revenue funds and using those for general fund expenses if needed. There's also a variety of other municipal budget items in that bill. So I withdraw the paper as it's no longer relevant. The paper has been withdrawn by Councilor Beres.

376
02:38:48,078 --> 02:38:57,646
Clerk Bernabez, you have that? Paper's been withdrawn. Mr. President, I have it as withdrawn, yes. Thank you. Councilor Knight.

377
02:38:58,625 --> 02:39:23,043
The paper has been introduced, Mr. President. It's been read into the record, so I believe by the Council rules, I think we have to maybe move on it. But either way, I just think this is a very slippery slope. Now we're writing state law. I don't think that's out of scope and purview to, you know, direct the state legislature to amend bills and pieces of legislation that are before them that are going to be impactful to the 351 cities and towns.

378
02:39:23,313 --> 02:39:43,765
We can't even get our affairs in our own house straightened up and we're up there telling people in the statehouse what to put in bills. I don't think that that's really appropriate or within the scope of function of by the city council, Mr. President. Um, so as we move forward, you know, I've asked that the council president, uh, remain cognizant of that and, um, take a position as to whether or not that type of action will be out of order or allowed in the future.

379
02:39:45,217 --> 02:40:14,697
Thank you, Councilor Knight. So since the paper has been introduced, what we'll do is we'll receive it and place it on file. So on the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Beers? Yes. Vice President Caravaglia? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco?

380
02:40:14,849 --> 02:40:34,289
Yes, 70 affirmative, 0 negative. The paper is received and placed on file. 20-408 be resolved by the Memphis City Council that our colleagues on the school committee share with us the assembled list of items designed to improve student outcomes as discussed in their budget meetings which began in February.

381
02:40:35,082 --> 02:41:03,061
Be it further resolved that the council express its thanks to the school committee for bringing this transparency to the school budget process, and that we look forward to any information they can share regarding the criticality and prioritization of items on this list as it relates to a traditional school year and or the anticipated 2020-2021 academic year. Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I think as everyone

382
02:41:03,888 --> 02:41:33,385
I think we really need to talk in this community about need and unmet need for the essential services that we provide. I know that the school committee has had an extensive budget process. Much of it was based on being in a school building and having a normal year revenue. But I still think that the information discussed there is valuable so that we can see what the educators, what the parents, what the community is thinking that we are missing and that we need.

383
02:41:33,605 --> 02:41:56,217
I know it's been referred to as a wish list. I don't think reading specialists are a wish list item. I think those are needs, and I would just like us to be able to see the unmet need, knowing we might not be able to address it in this year's budget, but I think it's important for that scope. So that's the intent of this. Thank you, Councilor Paris. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and I'd like to

384
02:41:56,487 --> 02:42:23,369
further amended and ask that the school committee or the superintendent of schools or whoever it may be that's putting this budget together, probably the assistant superintendent of finance, provide us with a draft copy of that department's budget. As we discussed earlier in the meeting, it's budget time, it's time to get rolling. If the school department has a budget that's been put together, then we need to see it, Mr. President. So if the administration's not willing to give us a whole budget book, then maybe we can seek them out as individual departments so that we can better prepare ourselves for these debates.

385
02:42:23,656 --> 02:42:53,440
So I'd offer that in the form of an amendment, and I'd ask the council to call it to second. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Any other questions or comments from the council? Second the motion, Mr. President. Okay, on the motion of Councilor Rios, seconded by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Knight. Let's see, are there any other questions, or does anybody else want to speak on this matter? On that motion, Clerk, please call the roll.

386
02:42:53,727 --> 02:43:10,568
Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Carabiello. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Spakali. Yes. President Falcone. Yes. So the affirmative, zero, the negative, the motion passes.

387
02:43:10,788 --> 02:43:28,085
Communications from the mayor. I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve to partially rescind the appropriation of free cash

388
02:43:28,085 --> 02:43:54,899
per council paper 19-671 in the amount of $87,508.00 to purchase APX-8000XE all band portable radios and assorted accessories for the fire department. The radio project is complete and the total amount expended was $195,250.

389
02:43:55,203 --> 02:44:12,922
$195,249.18 for the radios and accessories. The free cash needed to fund the radios project was $120,249.18 and $75,000 was funded from a fire special revenue fund.

390
02:44:12,922 --> 02:44:40,478
The balance of pre-cash before this vote was $10,431,282. Finance Director Alicia Nunley-Benjamin is present to answer any questions, any of the council's questions regarding this matter. Brianna Lungo-Kern, Mayor. Move approval of the paper, Mr. President. I thought the explanation was excellent. Second. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Peers.

391
02:44:42,233 --> 02:45:10,432
Any questions from the council? Any comments? Any comments? Mr. President, if we could, we have Alicia with us. If she could just give a short presentation on it, Mr. President. Absolutely. Alicia. Hi, honorable councilors. So the fire department had requested some free cash for a radio project. They had a special revenue fund for equipment, which includes radios. That was $75,000.

392
02:45:10,752 --> 02:45:33,803
So they didn't need that $75,000 initially from the free cash. And that's why we're sending that money back. Thank you. Any other questions? Any questions from the council? Councilor Marks? Mr. President, does this include repeaters and other issues that the fire department had concerns about communication citywide?

393
02:45:36,217 --> 02:45:43,034
This includes their radio and accessories that they brought before your honorable body with paper 19-671.

394
02:45:44,418 --> 02:46:07,368
So, do you know, Alicia, and you may not know, but do you know where we stand with the repeaters? Because that was a major issue. You know, we can have all the updates to radios, but without the repeaters that actually forwards the message, communications fail in the community, which is a public safety concern. So I want to make sure that that's addressed as well.

395
02:46:07,688 --> 02:46:32,663
I did ask the fire chief, uh, about his radios and he said all his radios, accessories and equipment was complete and done. He has everything that he needs. So I hope that that covers repeaters because that's what he told me. If, if I'm going to support the paper tonight, but if you could just double check with the chief regarding the repeaters, a longstanding issue for a number of years. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions from the council?

396
02:46:35,785 --> 02:47:01,115
Any other questions from the public? Anybody have questions on this issue? Nate, name and address for the record, please. Nate Barrett? Okay, I think he took his hand out.

397
02:47:04,051 --> 02:47:24,183
On the motion of council and I second advise. Mr. President, I think Mr. President. I apologize. That's all right. I think it just came up again. I see it at the bottom. Here we go. Let's try it again. I'm trying to.

398
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:48,247
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. I just want to second Councilor Marks just to make sure that the fire department has all the communications gear it needs, especially with the recent development of all the large apartment complexes in the area, especially using 700 800 megahertz radios like is described in the paper.

399
02:47:48,247 --> 02:48:16,883
They can have difficulty penetrating even through the building. So we just want to make sure they get the equipment they need, especially with a lot more residents that could be using the fire department services. You know, the repeaters are important. Backup power, if there really is an emergency for those repeaters. Just want to make sure before we take money back before the new fiscal year budget, that they have what they need. Thank you.

514
03:34:11,812 --> 03:34:39,132
I ran out of water on my page two. Can you repeat that? Motion to refer the community development board pursuant to chapter 48, section five. Second, Mr. President. Thank you. On that motion offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by, was it Vice President Caviello? Yes, sir. Mr. President.

515
03:34:39,892 --> 03:35:04,141
Yes. I didn't get that. Can you repeat that, please? What part? The whole thing, Mr. President. Councilor Knight. Councilor Knight beat you to it, Councilor Marks. Oh, he did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, we set up a pizza while you were waiting. Hey, I changed my shirt. Oh, thank you. I set up a pizza, but I ate a whole pizza while I was hearing that.

516
03:35:06,031 --> 03:35:33,503
questions. Before I have the clerk call the roll, are there any questions or comments from the Council or the general public? Nate Merritt, name and address for the record.

517
03:35:33,875 --> 03:35:59,221
Specifically, it's actually towards the end, page 20, section 5B, compliance, where it states that compliance with federal law, since as I'm still aware, unless I'm wrong, that distribution of marijuana is still not compliant with federal law. You just wanna tighten up the language so you don't permit someone to set up an establishment and then have them get in trouble. That's all, thank you. Thank you.

518
03:36:00,284 --> 03:36:28,415
And besides federal, I'm sorry, besides that item, there was a similar throughout page six at the top. There's something that says this isn't supposed to supersede federal law, although the whole content therein kind of does. It's avoided on page 14 in section 12 there. They don't mention federal law, but did you mention state and local law? So you might want to have someone take a look and tighten up the language.

519
03:36:29,107 --> 03:36:55,482
Mr. President, Mr. President, if we can refer to KP before our second reading KP law. Yes. So, so, uh, so we can pass it tonight, send it to the CD board and then KP. Is tonight the third reading? Today's this is the first reading. Yeah. I'm sorry. Council on information council night.

520
03:36:56,258 --> 03:37:15,614
It's a zoning amendment, Mr. President. So the first reading is us introducing this paper tonight, but by law, we have to send it to the CD board. This would enact the public hearing process where once the CD board receives it, the council and the CD board are required to hold a public hearing and the CD board would be required to report back.

521
03:37:15,985 --> 03:37:44,960
their findings to the council and the council would be precluded from voting on the measure until the CD board provides us with that information or I think got three weeks past from the close of their public hearing. So this isn't the typical ordinance with three readings because it's a zoning amendment, it has to go through the CD board. So the council wouldn't have, you know, a first reading and advertisement and then a third reading, it would be sent it to the CD board, have a public hearing, CD board has a public hearing provides us with their

522
03:37:45,280 --> 03:38:13,647
recommendation, we close our public hearing that have a certain defined period to deliberate. So we can make the change after that, then. Yeah, but between it takes 40, it's four votes to take off to go to the CD board, but five votes to pass. And you can change the language after the CD board because the idea is they're going to have a public hearing and make a recommendation on language, right? Yes.

523
03:38:16,583 --> 03:38:39,010
Sounds good. Okay, so there's a motion on the floor and the motion was, I'm sorry, was the motion made by Councilor Knight? Yes, I seconded it, Mr. President. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carabiello, Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Carabiello? Yes. Councilor Knight?

524
03:38:39,652 --> 03:39:01,454
Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes, I'm the affirmative, zero on the negative, the motion passes. Mr. Clerk, we have committee report, your committee reports are just the records.

525
03:39:01,606 --> 03:39:24,860
Mr. President, I actually completed a committee report, but I never made the entry on the agenda. So I did not. So there's, I mean, I have a committee report from last week, or you can just table it. Actually, you don't need to table, it's not on the agenda. Yeah, it's on the agenda. We'll take it up next week. Thank you, Mr. Clark. I think we should stay a little longer. I believe the last item then is the last two items are records and adjournment at this point.

526
03:39:25,062 --> 03:39:51,708
Yes, so the records, let's see here. The records of the meeting of June 2nd, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight. Councilor Knight, how did you find those records? Not a chance. Table them please, Mr. President. You could have read them while Johnny was reading the ordinance. I was taking a nap. Well, thank you very much.

527
03:39:53,024 --> 03:40:22,370
It may sound about me, water and cough drops. Thank you, Jack. I brought you a drink. It's water. Fine. On the motion of Councilor Knight to table the records, I seconded by Vice President Carriello, Clerk Kurtabese. Please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. No. Vice President Carriello. Yes. Councilor Knight.

528
03:40:23,112 --> 03:40:51,935
Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? No. President Falco? Yes. Five in the affirmative, two in the negative. The record's at table. Is there a meeting to adjourn? Is there a motion to adjourn? No. Motion to adjourn, Mr. President. There is a meeting to adjourn.

529
03:40:53,133 --> 03:41:20,369
This one. On the motion of Councilor Beas to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Councilor Morrell. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Beas. Yes. Vice President Caravaglia. No. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco.

530
03:41:20,943 --> 03:41:29,313
Yes, it's in the affirmative. One in the negative. The meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Good night. Be safe. Thank you.
