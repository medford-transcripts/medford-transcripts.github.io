19
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:47,533
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:54,637
Thank you.

21
00:00:56,042 --> 00:01:15,353
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law, Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

At this point, I want to recognize Vice President Caviello, who would like to make a statement.

27
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:15,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

28
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:20,396
I have a statement, a partial statement for myself and some of my other counselors.

29
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,938
And if you indulge me, I'd like to read it to you.

30
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:24,059
Please.

31
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:24,839
Good evening.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,861
We are angry and we should be.

33
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:33,165
It is the natural response to a senseless and tragic and preventable act.

34
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,407
This time, that senseless, tragic act

35
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:43,585
tragic and preventable act was the death of George Floyd this time.

36
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:58,768
In times of tragedy, it's so common there is offer of thoughts and prayers, and when the dust settles, the perpetual systematic failures continue without address.

37
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:04,029
The conversation about race can no longer be a side issue.

38
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,713
We need to face the uncomfortable fact that Medford is not perfect.

39
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:13,013
For those of you who feel you have no voice, we hear you.

40
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,173
We are listening.

41
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:20,895
We want you to feel and to be free, to express your opinion and to do so without fear of punishment or reprisal.

42
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:24,056
We recognize the need to be better and we will work with you.

43
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:27,716
Topic is not something we cannot run from.

44
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:30,637
It's something we need to address and embrace.

45
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:33,617
And you have our commitment to do so.

46
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:35,938
Respectfully signed by counselors,

47
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:40,415

50
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,538

51
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:48,819
I apologize Councilor Knight.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,141
Thank you very much Mr. President.

54
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,762
Thank you very much for your comments.

55
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,483
On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business.

56
00:03:58,723 --> 00:03:59,724
Please call the roll.

57
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:02,285
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

58
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:04,975
That's a bears.

59
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:06,036
Yes.

60
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:07,598

Council marks.

65
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:12,462
Yes.

66
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:13,463
That's a morale.

67
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:14,363
Yes.

68
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:15,504
That's a scrub Kelly.

69
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:16,125
Yes.

70
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,226
President Falco.

71
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:18,567
Yes.

72
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,609
The motion passes hearings.

00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:30,388

00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:15,929
Mr. President, I still need to take a roll call on this, I'm sorry.

86
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:24,754
Mr. President, I still need to take a roll call on this, on the motion to waive the reading.

87
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:30,437
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Behrs, please call the roll.

88
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,558
Councilor Behrs.

89
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:32,279
Yes.

90
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:34,083
Vice President Caravello?

91
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:34,643
Yes.

92
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:35,544
Councilor Knight?

93
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:37,205
Yes.

94
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:38,206
Councilor Marks?

95
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:38,946
Yes.

96
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:39,887
Councilor Morrell?

97
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:40,667
Yes.

98
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,848
Councilor Scarpelli?

99
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:42,388
Yes.

100
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:43,429
President Falco?

101
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,611
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

102
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,253
Do we have a representative from National Grid?

103
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,937
I believe I saw Socrates here earlier.

104
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,718
Oh, he is, I see him right here, okay.

105
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:00,878
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:03,359
I was trying to unmute myself.

107
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:04,819
I was trying to unmute myself.

108
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,299
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:12,901
So yes, for this one is basically a simple pole that we need to install near Woodrow Ave in Medford.

110
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,422
It's just for feeder monitor.

111
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,522
It's just for our circuit to be more reliable.

112
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,563
That's what we need it for.

113
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,363
Okay.

114
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,044
So

115
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:30,899
If I may go on further, this has been approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions.

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,384
The engineering division recommends that this grant of location be approved with the following conditions.

117
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:45,751
Number one, the grant of location is limited to this one JO poll described in the GOL document as follows.

118
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,513
National Grid will install one JO poll

119
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:57,131
on Woodruff Ave beginning at a point approximately 200 feet east of the center line of the intersection of Bradbury Avenue and Woodruff Avenue.

120
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:06,176
Two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division.

121
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:10,019
The project must obtain a street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141A.

122
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,197
of the city ordinances prior to commencing work.

123
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:22,959
Number three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted.

124
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:29,161
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

125
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:33,383
Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind.

126
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:36,764
Asphalt must be replaced with asphalt.

127
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,422
Number four, the new pole location is located adjacent to granite curbing.

128
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:50,826
Any disturbance of the curb or curb concrete backing must be repaired to the satisfaction of the city engineer.

129
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:56,169
Number five, the new pole location is in a landscaped area with trees.

130
00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:00,992
The city of Medford tree warden should inspect the trees before and after construction.

131
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:05,935
Tree protection should be required and coordinated with the Medford tree warden.

132
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,819
That's approved by the superintendent of wire.

133
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:15,840
So at this point, I'll declare the public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition.

134
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,641
Socrates, you're in favor, I assume?

135
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,181
Yes, I am.

136
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:20,121
Yes, I am.

137
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:20,882
Okay.

138
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:26,623
Is there anyone else here in favor of the petition that would like to speak in favor of this petition?

139
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:34,505
Okay.

140
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:41,847
Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

141
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:46,269
Anyone here in opposition of the petition?

142
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:47,950
Anyone in opposition?

143
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:58,875
Anyone in opposition?

144
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,576
Clerk Cardavis, you see anybody in opposition?

145
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,196
I don't see any.

146
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:04,217
Okay.

147
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:09,445
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

148
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:10,926
Thank you.

149
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:12,607
Thank you.

150
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,688
Is there any questions for Socrates on this matter?

151
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,190
Consul and I. Mr. President, thank you very much.

152
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,211
Socrates, good to see you again this evening, Phil.

153
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,752
Good to see you too.

154
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:25,704
A couple questions for you.

155
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,725
Now this looks like it's a 200 foot trench.

156
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:37,631
What's it going to be the typical trench that we used to see in a grounded in grounded inlay trench 18 inches right around the gutter the curb right along the curb?

157
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:39,932
Yep.

158
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:48,137
Okay, and is this you said it was for system upgrades for reliability circuit circuit or something?

159
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:53,849
It's just to monitor the feeders that we have, existing feeders.

160
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,233
It's just for a way for us to make it more reliable.

161
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:03,159
Okay.

162
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,003
And 200 feet grounded inlay, 18 inches from the curb.

163
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:11,388
And then it says also that some of this work is going to be done in a wooded or treed area.

164
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:12,970
Is that on city property?

165
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,333
I'm not too familiar with the area at the moment.

166
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:25,115
I don't believe it's going to be any near that place, but I can double check.

167
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:25,955
I can double check.

168
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:28,356
No, it looks like the tree warden's involved, so it looks like it is.

169
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:32,377
Okay, I appreciate you clarifying some of those questions that I have for you.

170
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,017
Thank you very much.

171
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:35,378
No problem.

172
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,419
Any other questions from the council?

173
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,257
Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:52,861
This is more of a general statement and no reflection on National Grid, although they sometimes are part of the problem in the community, Mr. President.

175
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:57,003
But of recent, I've been receiving a number of complaints regarding

176
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,964
utility work on our streets.

177
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:12,415
Just recently, Park Street had some utility work and a giant trench was dug the length of Park Street, and the work to put back the tar was less than shoddy, Mr. President.

178
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,529
and poses a safety concern for area residents.

179
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:39,217
I would ask, Mr. President, at some point, I know we have a lot on our plate, but at some point that we set up a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss utility work in the community so we can address and make sure that when utility companies come in, that they restore our streets better than they were, Mr. President, and that no safety concerns exist while work takes place.

180
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,715
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

181
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,619
We can organize that at some point in time.

182
00:12:47,679 --> 00:13:01,031
I think that actually would be a good meeting to make sure that we resolve any issues and make sure that any utility companies that are coming in are basically repairing our roads to the original condition.

183
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,993
So I thank you for bringing that forward.

184
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,915
Any other questions from the council?

185
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:05,616
Clerk Hernandez.

186
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:11,390
Is Councilor Marks' request an amendment, or is it just a request for the Council to take up?

187
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:22,774
I don't want to do it on their petition, so I would just put in a request to the Council President to kindly set up a meeting regarding utility work in this community.

188
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,475
Thank you for clarifying, Councilor.

189
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,095
I appreciate it.

190
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:25,575
Thank you.

191
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,196
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

192
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,357
Any other questions from the Council?

193
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:34,839
Any other questions from the public?

194
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,769
No emails on this topic.

195
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:52,873
Mr. President, I am hoping we can add a condition onto the granting of this location that when the work is complete, the street will be swept.

196
00:13:53,053 --> 00:14:04,577
We've seen Park Street, as Councilor Mark mentioned, Stearns Avenue, Golden Avenue, where a lot of public utility work has been performed, trenching the length of the street to replace pipes and the like.

197
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:05,437
And what happens is,

198
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,460
You know, they dig a 200-foot-long trench, and they have a great system of doing it.

199
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,560
I mean, they're very efficient.

200
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,261
They take all the stone out of the ground, all the dirt out of the ground.

201
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,221
They put it on the street.

202
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:18,182
They do the work that they have to get done while the street's closed.

203
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:20,083
They put all the sand and dirt back in the hole.

204
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:20,803
They seal it up.

205
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,123
But there is debris left over, Mr. President.

206
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,264
There are rocks and stuff like that that kick up.

207
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,662
especially on streets that are highly frequented.

208
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:36,228
You know, if you think about Golden Avenue, you think about Park Street, the amount of cars that drive down the street, kicking up those little rocks do tend to damage vehicles.

209
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:45,114
So that's something that I'd like to ask to be placed on it as a condition that the street be swept the length of the 200 feet for which the trench is being dug.

210
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:46,515
Okay.

211
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,676
Clerk Bernanke, do you have that word?

212
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:49,357
I've got it, yep.

213
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:50,938
Okay.

214
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,260
So, Shaka Teasy, is that something we can do?

215
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:59,535
Yeah, I can send that information over.

216
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:05,556
But I believe this one is an overhead service.

217
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,797
I mean, it's an overhead run.

218
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:11,217
It's not going to be on the ground, if I'm not mistaken.

219
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:16,618
Because I was just looking at the sketch right now, and it seems like it's an overhead portion.

220
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,399
It's not going to be on the ground.

221
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,720
So it's wires, it's not digging into the concrete or the asphalt?

222
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,740
Yeah, no.

223
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,819
I'm just looking at it real quick.

224
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:31,739
Okay.

225
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,279
So, Mr. President.

226
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,360
Counselor.

227
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:48,665
I just want to concur with my colleague, Counselor Knight, that that is a great suggestion and much of the work involves trenching and digging in our community and sweeping up after, I think should be a standard part of the job.

228
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:54,327
So I support that in future requests, Mr. President, as well.

229
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,277
Yeah, thank you console box I would agree as well.

230
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:02,854
That is actually nice to add that in console and I for the purposes of.

231
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,629
This petition, Mr. President, I have reviewed it.

232
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,929
It does look like it is a J-pole only.

233
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:11,950
And the 200 feet is east of the center line as to where it's located.

234
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,991
It's gonna be a 200 foot run overhead from what Socrates said.

235
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:17,892
What I have in front of me looks like it's in line.

236
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:25,754
So in terms of making that a condition on this petition, I'm not so crazy about it, but in the future, I think that that's something that we need to talk about.

237
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:32,856
So I would ask that it be added to the agenda of items that we've discussed in the past relative to French work when we conduct this meeting with the engineer.

238
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:40,077
but at this point I would withdraw the I would withdraw the restriction.

239
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:44,981
Thank you.

240
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,083
Is there a motion on the floor?

241
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:49,584
Motion for approval.

242
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:50,105
Mr. President.

243
00:16:50,605 --> 00:17:02,054
I'm emotional to approve seconded by console and I caught her to be please call the roll bears.

244
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,055
Yes.

245
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,466
Vice President Caraviello.

246
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:06,007
Yes.

247
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,107
Councilor Knight.

248
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:09,248
Yes.

249

Councilor Marks.

250
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:11,288
Yes.

251
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:12,349
Councilor Morrell.

252
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:13,229
Yes.

253
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,770
Councilor Scarpelli.

254
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,230
Yes.

255
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,350
President Falco.

256
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,291
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

257
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,712
Socrates, thank you.

258
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:23,293
Thank you, good night.

259
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,235

Do we have Michael James Coleman with us tonight?

00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:02,138
We do.

272
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:03,839
Okay.

273
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,360
Mr. Coleman, welcome.

274
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:21,144
If you could please tell us a little bit about your business and if you just, and then questions, I'm sure the councilors will have questions, but if you could just give us a brief overview of why you were in favor of the petition.

275
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:22,379
Sure.

276
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:27,060
So, I've been a professional tattoo artist for six plus years.

277
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,761
I have family in Medford.

278
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:39,464
This has been my business for, you know, doing it professionally, and I'm in favor of just opening up my own studio.

279
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:46,491
won't be like a huge place, it'll be more of like a private studio, couple rooms in there.

280
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:50,875
And I can answer any questions that you might have about it.

281
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:54,939
So you are in favor of the petition?

282
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,700
Yes.

283
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,582
Okay, perfect.

284
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:02,007
So at this point in time, is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

285
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:02,787
Anyone else?

286
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:16,897

289
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:28,304
Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak?

290
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:36,088
It should make sure I'm not missing anyone.

291
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,491
I don't see anybody, Mr. President.

292
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:42,592
Okay.

293
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:46,456
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

294
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:51,902
And I'll call upon the Chairperson of Zoning, Vice President Caviello.

295
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,791
Councilor Caviello, I have to unmute you, one minute.

296
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:01,793
All right, I got it.

297
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:02,414
Thank you, Mr. President.

298
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:03,515
Thank you.

299
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:04,356
Thank you.

300
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,304
I see your paper here that says everything seems to be in order for this.

301
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:22,752
As you know, we've received many calls from residents in the neighborhood in regards to your tattoo file.

302
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:26,115
Again, you're a legal business.

303
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:27,056
You're entitled to open.

304
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,151
I see no problem here.

305
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:40,255
My only question is, and maybe this might make it a little more amiable to some of the people in the neighborhood, is the name.

306
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:51,220
You're a stone's throw from our three churches, and maybe if you could soften the name up a little bit, might make it a little more...

307
00:21:52,293 --> 00:22:00,969
amiable to the people in the West River Square and the three churches that are really right within, let's say, they're within a stone's throw of it.

308
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,672
So that's my opinion.

309
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:05,157
So I don't know what you feel about that.

310
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:06,796
No, I understand.

311
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:22,929
I'm brought up in an Irish Italian family, you know, religious, went to Malden Catholic, in no disrespect to, you know, the name being it somewhat of like a religious name.

312
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,313
You know, the reason that I really chose the name for it was

313
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,962
Sacrament and the sacraments that you receive is kind of like a ritual ceremony.

314
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:43,886
So I kind of link that to like a tattoo between like an artist and a person and sharing a bond.

315
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,707
Like I said, I don't mean any disrespect.

316
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:55,811
I can talk to anyone that, you know, kind of isn't really feeling the name so much.

317
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:58,412
But like I said, I can,

318
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:06,109
I'm a person that can, you know, can be reached easily and very personable person I can.

319
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,350
I'm sure you are.

320
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:08,231
Yeah.

321
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:12,895
Is it just a suggestion, you know, we have two other, we have two other similar type businesses.

322
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:19,680
We have one in the residential neighborhood in South Bend that's similar to yours and they've been a good neighbor too.

323
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,340
The people, I don't think there's been any complaints that I know of.

324
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,484
And we also have another one on the Fells Way, which, you know, I don't think there's been any problems there either.

325
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,007
But again, that was just my two cents into that.

326
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:35,890
But other than that, you know, your license seems to be in order here.

327
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:36,911
Thanks so much.

328
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:37,391
Thank you.

329
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:40,354
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

330
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,937
Godfless Carpelli.

331
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:44,337
Thank you.

332
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,499
And thank you, James, for applying.

333
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,580
And hopefully this works.

334
00:23:48,478 --> 00:24:03,158
Some, some of the comments I received is some of the, the artwork that could be posted on the windows and some might tasteful some might be a little questionable and being in that area.

335
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,401
That was some of the questions I got from some residents.

336
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:13,812
Do you plan on putting, you know, some, I know artwork is important and people can see your artwork.

337
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,652
I think that's important.

338
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:16,753
I think you should be able to do that in a sense.

339
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:33,023
But I think what the fear of some of those neighbors are that some of that artwork might be a little too provocative or risque to put in an area where kids are walking by to go to CB Scoops or to a sub shop.

340
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:35,305
So can you speak to that a bit?

341
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:36,641
Absolutely.

342
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:46,206
Um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't put anything disrespectful or risque like in, in the windows or even from like street view.

343
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:58,332
Um, I understand that tattoo work and religious art work and can get, you know, a little questionable sometimes, but, um, I'm a father of an eight year old myself.

344
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:01,694
So, you know, nothing that I would do would.

345
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,815
jeopardize my business.

346
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:27,403
And I want everyone in that community, I know it's very tight knit in that in that row of, of businesses and whatnot, that I want to be able to be a good role model for for kids, you know, that are interested in artwork or interested in tattooing or, you know, anything else, you know.

347
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:28,163
Right.

348
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:28,483
Great.

349
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:29,043
Thank you.

350
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:30,324
Yeah, no problem.

351
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,261
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

352
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:32,941
Councilor Marks.

353
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:34,942
Thank you, Mr. President.

354
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:39,805
The question I had was regarding how would you treat medical waste?

355
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:51,651
So I know that's definitely something that is covered early on in like learning the tattoo process.

356
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:55,873
Everything in the studio will be fully disposable.

357
00:25:57,661 --> 00:26:13,526
you know, we would be abiding by the big, you know, the COVID-19 pandemic that we're in right now with face shields, masks, you know, allowing certain amount of people in the studio when we open.

358
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:25,489
But as far as like needles, cartridges, we have a service that's done weekly and monthly, and they come pick up

359
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:35,024
everything there in sharp containers and everything is handled on hospital clean levels.

360
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:45,690
So at no time would you be using the local trash for needles or blood or any other type of medical waste?

361
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,391
No, absolutely not.

362
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:48,978
Thank you.

363
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:55,086
Mr. President, my good luck of being on the council for a number of years gives me some wisdom.

364
00:26:55,867 --> 00:27:03,437
And back so many years ago, we had a tattoo pile that tried to come onto Forest Street across from the Boys and Girls Club.

365
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,359
It was called Lucky Tattoos.

366
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:19,273
And at the time, Mr. President, the petitioners had, in my opinion, a lengthy record about border health issues and so forth and raised some concern.

367
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:20,293
And I

368
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:25,097
Voted against the petition based on concerns.

369
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,417
I had with lucky tattoo.

370
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:46,247
This has nothing to do with this petitioner and We mr. President ended up getting sued by lucky tattoo and they ended up winning a suit of I believe it was 25 to $30,000 against the city of method because we denied their special permit and

371
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:55,629
and apparently we were being arbitrary and capricious, even though I felt we had valid concerns of this opening.

372
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,989
On this particular petitioner, Mr. President, I don't have those concerns.

373
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,010
It is signed off by the Board of Health.

374
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,731
The Method Police has issued a statement saying that they have no public safety concerns.

375
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:14,252
The petitioner seems to be a good business person, and I wish him well, Mr. President.

376
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,120
Thanks so much for the kind words.

377
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,061
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

378
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,261
Any other comments from the council?

379
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:24,382
Second.

380
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:29,224
Motion to approve.

381
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,004
Second.

382
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:35,485
On the motion to approve by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

383
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:41,367
Does anyone want to speak on this in the public?

384
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:42,667
Anyone in the public want to speak?

385
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:48,477
Okay.

386
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:50,378
Mr. President.

387
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,279
Council Marks.

388
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:01,223
I would also ask similar to many other special permit requests that we put a six month review on this special permit, Mr. President.

389
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:02,744
Okay.

390
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:07,386
Also, Mr. President, that the special permit goes with the business and not with the address.

391
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:13,109
Do you have those amendments, Corker?

392
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,050
Hang on a second.

393
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:24,061
I do see a raised hand, Mr. President.

394
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:28,322
I've got the two amendments.

395
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,882
I've got the two conditions.

396
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:37,063
Councilor Marks has requested a six month review and Councilor Knight has requested that the permit goes with the business and not with the address.

397
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:42,284
Okay, we have, let's see.

398
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,592
John Nicholas First, if you could please give us your name and address for the record.

399
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:53,553
Sure.

400
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:54,934
I'm John Nicholas First.

401
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:57,516
I live at 32 Warren Street in Medford.

402
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:02,099
So that's just a block or two away from where this is on High Street.

403
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:08,563
I just wanted to voice my public positive support for this prospective institution.

404
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:17,049
I think that they are doing a good thing for the community, and I look forward to them being approved by this council.

405
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,327
Thank you so much, John.

406
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,848
Thank you very much for your comment.

407
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:23,828
Would anybody else like to speak on this issue?

408
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:28,090
Clerk Kurtabese, have you received any emails on this?

409
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,550
I have not, Mr. President.

410
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:41,173
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers, as amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight.

411
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:43,094
Clerk Kurtabese, would you please call the roll?

412
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:44,474
Councilor Beers?

413
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:45,474
Yes.

414
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:47,055
Vice President Caravaglio?

415
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:47,495
Yes.

416
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:48,788
Councilor Knight.

417
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,930
Yes.

418
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:50,970
Councilor Marks.

419
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:51,871
Yes.

420
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:52,852
Councilor Morrell.

421
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:53,733
Yes.

422
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:54,874
Councilor Scarpelli.

423
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:55,655
Yes.

424
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:56,776
President Falco.

425
00:30:57,476 --> 00:30:59,438
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero on the negative.

426
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,379
The motion passes.

427
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:01,480
Thank you and good luck.

428
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,121
Thank you so much, everybody.

429
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:04,402
Thank you.

430
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:05,944
Have a good night.

431
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:09,227
Mr. President, motion for suspension of the rules to take paper 2040.

432
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:12,715
2-0-0-4-0?

433
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:13,175
2-0-4-2-0.

434
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:17,636
Mr. President, it's 2-0-4-2-0.

435
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,057
It came in under suspension.

436
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,817
I did not assign it a number until this afternoon.

437
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,458
I don't think I have the paper in front of me.

438
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:36,521
OK, so on the- I can read my email and read it back if you need me to.

439
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:41,042
Mr. President, we can do this next one and you can come back to it when the clerk sends you

440
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:42,846
uh, the paper.

441
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:44,227
Okay.

442
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,327
So we can move on.

443
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:46,967
We'll do that next.

444
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,248
So are we sitting by motion?

445
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:49,948
Okay.

446
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:52,549
So we're going to continue on with the regular order of business.

447
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:54,669
Thank you so much.

448
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:55,990
Thank you.

449
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,550
Have a good night.

450
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:57,770
You too.

451
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,030
Congratulations.

452
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,530
Best of luck.

453
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,051
Thank you so much, everyone.

454
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:01,591
Thank you.

455
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:02,757
Thank you.

456
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:13,740
Notice of a public hearing 20-042, an ordinance amending the revised ordinances of the city of Medford zoning relative to adult use marijuana.

457
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:20,903
Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Medford.

458
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,543
Motion to suspend the reading in favor of a synopsis.

459
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,745
Would you like to give that a synopsis, Councilor Bears?

460
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:31,536
I can try.

461
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:34,057
I think it's easier than reading this whole thing.

462
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:36,778
I understand it's a 17-page document.

463
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:47,884
It is the first time it's being read, so that's why I was probably going to read it in its full context, because it's the first time I think it's been out.

464
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:55,087
So I think the public should actually be able to listen to this.

465
00:32:55,147 --> 00:33:02,590
I know it's long, but if the council sees that we should move forward with a brief synopsis, if someone wants to give it, that's fine.

466
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,011
But I think there's a lot of detail in here that probably should, that should be read through.

467
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:12,794
Mr. President, just a point of information.

468
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:15,675
Is it possible to table this till the end of the meeting?

469
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,820
We can do that.

470
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,621
The meeting will never end if we table.

471
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,003
Is there a motion to table?

472
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,324
Motion to table to the end of the meeting.

473
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:32,947
Okay, motion by Councilor Behrs to table this, seconded by?

474
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:35,328
Second.

475
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,048
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

476
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,489
Clerk Urbis, please call the roll.

477
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,811
Is this to be tabled until the end of the meeting tonight?

478
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:42,991
You are correct.

479
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:44,752
Okay, Councilor Behrs.

480
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:45,980
Yes.

481
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,560
Vice President Caravello.

482
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,080
Yes.

483
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,061
Councilor Knight.

484
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,121
No.

485
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:55,022
Councilor Marks.

486
00:33:55,562 --> 00:33:55,842
Yes.

487
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:57,662
Councilor Morrell.

488
00:33:58,502 --> 00:33:58,742
Yes.

489
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:00,703
Councilor Scarpelli.

490
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:01,283
No.

491
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,224
President Falco.

492
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:07,744
No.

493
00:34:08,824 --> 00:34:10,324
Is that a four, three in favor?

494
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,565
I have four, three.

495
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,581
Okay, four in favor, three against.

496
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:21,062
This will be tabled to the end of the meeting.

497
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,142
Mr. President, do you have the paper now?

498
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:24,262
I'm doing it right now.

499
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:27,163
I'm setting it right now.

500
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:35,945
Mr. President, motion for suspension of the rules to take paper 20420.

501
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:45,090
Vice President Carviello, does he suspend the rule, seconded by?

502
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:47,011
Second.

503
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,113
Councilor Marks, please call the roll.

504
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:52,274
Councilor Peters?

505
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:53,275
Yes.

506
00:34:54,015 --> 00:34:54,916
Vice President Carviello?

507
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:55,416
Yes.

508
00:34:56,457 --> 00:34:56,977
Councilor Knight?

509
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:58,177
No.

510
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,740
Councilor Marks?

511
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,501
Yes.

512
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,181
Councilor Morrell?

513
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:05,802
No.

514
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:10,413
Councilor Scarpelli?

515
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:11,113
Yes.

516
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:12,874
President Falco?

517
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:14,255
No.

518
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:18,799
Four in favor, three against, motion passes.

519
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:19,679
The rules are suspended.

520
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:23,422
Clerk Hernandez, can you read the motion please?

521
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:27,991
Yes, this is offered under suspension by Vice President Carabiello.

522
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:38,415
Whereas the city of Medford is in a fiscal budget emergency, be it resolved that the mayor be requested to appropriate, with the city council approval, the necessary amount out of free cash

523
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:53,010
to address the municipal and school budget deficits, and further, that the mayor be requested to replenish this account with any budget aid Medford receives from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

524
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,835
Be it further resolved that the mayor respond to this request by next Tuesday's city council meeting.

525
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,578
Thank you, Mr. President.

526
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:01,819
Mr. President.

527
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:10,423
If I may, Vice President Carvajal, this has been on under suspension and this year I don't think falls under the.

528
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:17,350
the guidance that we've been given by the city solicitor.

529
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:31,200
I mean, I tend to think of- Mr. President, Mr. President, where this is a number- Vice President Caviello, and if I may, I believe that a paper that is requesting free cash should be coming from the mayor's office.

530
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,862
It shouldn't be derived from the city council.

531
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:39,527
So that's- It's only a suggestion to the mayor, Mr. President, and this is an emergency situation.

532
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:41,745
And so what I would do is...

533
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:57,276
I think that this is something that we should put on the agenda for next week, because I'm sure there's probably plenty of people that would like to chime in on this, and they're probably not on the call tonight, because they probably didn't know it was gonna come up.

534
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:10,098
So as far as, we have some other, I think, budget-related motions afterwards, but I think as far as bringing this up under suspension, I don't think it's proper to bring this up tonight.

535
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:11,593
Whatever you think.

536
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:15,276
I want to make sure we're complying with the open meeting law, that's why.

537
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:18,498
Again, I felt this was an emergency situation.

538
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,861
Notices of teacher layoffs have to go out by Monday.

539
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:29,868
And I know the administration is aware of that as well, as well as the school department.

540
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:39,056
If you feel that it should be tabled to next week, then... I would ask you respectfully if you could please reintroduce it next week.

541
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,041
Whatever you say, Mr. President.

542
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,242
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

543
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:50,406
Is there anything on the suspension that- Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

544
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:55,949
On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by- Mr. President.

545
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:57,230
Councilor Marks.

546
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,511
Just a point of information.

547
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,093
I think the paper was offered under suspension.

548
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,195
I still think we have to do something with it.

549
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:10,516
Right, whether we receive it on file or do something.

550
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:11,357
Motion to table.

551
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:12,678
Motion to table.

552
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:15,180
Rule the paper out of order.

553
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,101
I'm basically ruling the paper out of order.

554
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,162
That's what I'm doing.

555
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:23,506
So I'm asking, I respectfully ask Vice President Caviello to reintroduce it next week.

556
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,288
I will reintroduce it next week, Mr. President.

557
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:26,669
Thank you, I appreciate it.

558
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,650
Thank you, Councilor, Vice President Caviello.

559
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:34,795
So I have a motion to revert back to regular order businesses by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

560
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:35,876
Second.

561
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:36,914
Yes.

562
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:37,074
Yes.

563
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:37,295
Yes.

564
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:37,435
Yes.

565
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:37,695
Yes.

566
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:38,215
Yes.

567
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:38,436
Yes.

568
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:38,656
Yes.

569
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:38,836
Yes.

570
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,160
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

571
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,401
20-394 offered by Councilor Knight.

572
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:23,187
Be it resolved that the Manhattan City Council publish the scheduled pre-budget and regular budget meetings for the purpose of establishing a fiscal year 2021 city budget.

573
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,810
Councilor Knight?

574
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,151
Yes, Mr. President.

575
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:30,772
Mr. President, yes.

576
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:40,382
Um, as I've stated in the past, I have a, uh, hostile desire that we get a fiscal year budget completed before the close of the fiscal year.

577
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:49,386
Um, just last week, I believe we met with our paid outside consultant that said that we're, uh, in a difficult financial situation.

578
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:51,147
We have about a $10 million deficit.

579
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:53,969
Um, we have $183 million budget.

580
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:59,952
Um, the consultant says that he feels as though we do have the ability to put out a fiscal year budget.

581
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:04,600
The consultant says that there's no way that we want to get involved in a 1-12 budget.

582
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:10,724
So I'm going to do my best Jerry Maguire here, Mr. President, and ask, where's the budget?

583
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,344
Show me the money.

584
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,245
Show me the money, Mr. President.

585
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:18,288
Time that we get to the table and start negotiating this budget, debating this budget.

586
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,329
It's what, June 9th?

587
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,971
The fiscal year closes in 21 days, Mr. President.

588
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:27,113
We've seen nothing, not one financial paper yet.

589
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,354
Transparency, where is it?

590
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:30,357
Where is it?

591
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:32,939
Again, come on, Jerry, say it.

592
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:33,799
Show me the money.

593
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,200
Show me the money, Jerry.

594
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,402
Where is the budget, Mr. President?

595
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:38,122
Where is it?

596
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:44,766
You know, we need to take the bull by the horns, schedule budget debates, invite the administration to come down and participate.

597
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:46,507
And if they don't want to, they don't have to.

598
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:47,848
But we got to do something here.

599
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:56,853
We got to show some leadership that at the end of the day, the residents and the taxpayers in this community know that we're pushing hard to be sure that city services aren't interrupted during these difficult fiscal times.

600
00:40:57,493 --> 00:41:06,258
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that you work with the administration to publish a schedule as to when we're going to be able to meet in person to conduct budget debates.

601
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:23,046
I think, you know, as we're seeing the phases of government and coronavirus to be allowed to start working again, I'm pretty sure that the seven of us plus the department head and the budget director can sit down in a room, be safe, and work out these very significant, serious issues in this community.

602
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,207
So I'll say it again.

603
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:24,947
Show me the money.

604
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,148
It's time, Mr. President.

605
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:29,103
That's time, June 9th, June 9th.

606
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:36,585
I've never, ever, ever in my time working in government and working in this community ever seen a goal this long where we haven't had some sort of budget.

607
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:38,705
We have a consultant.

608
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:40,646
The consultant has given us our figures.

609
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,207
The consultant has told us they're worth $10 million in the hole.

610
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:48,448
Last time we talked, the plan was to level fund, to borrow money

611
00:41:48,991 --> 00:41:51,191
out of our free cash, to take money out of our free cash.

612
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:54,232
But we're still going to have a structural deficit if we do that, Mr. President.

613
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:59,073
So I know there are difficult decisions that need to be made, but that's what we get paid the big bucks to do.

614
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:06,014
So quite frankly, we can't sit down at the table and start talking about issues of concern if we don't have a document in front of us to work off of.

615
00:42:06,354 --> 00:42:09,515
So it's very important that we get this budget book and we get it immediately.

616
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:13,035
My frustration level at this point, Mr. President, is over the edge.

617
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:16,156
I feel like I've been talking about this now for six, seven, eight weeks.

618
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:24,205
Um, and we're still no closer to having any understanding as to what the administration's financial plan is to move this community forward.

619
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,846
Um, so with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.

620
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:33,928
I asked the council president to publish a series of meetings as to when we're going to be able to sit down and negotiate this budget.

621
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:42,327
I'd ask that it be done in line with the recommendations that our paid outside consultant gave us, which says that we can complete the budget before the close of the fiscal year.

622
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,408
So that's what I asked for, Mr. President.

623
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:54,834
And I hope that the administration is willing to work with us and has been doing what they're supposed to be doing and preparing a budget for us based upon the forecast that our private paid consultants have given us.

624
00:42:55,294 --> 00:43:02,298
There's no point in having outside consultants if we're not going to listen to the information they've given us and use it to make informed data-driven decisions.

625
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:04,746
So with that being said, I rest my case.

626
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:07,647
I don't know any more lines from the movie Jerry Maguire.

627
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:16,012
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this paper and I have all the confidence in the world that you'll be able to make this happen, Mr. President.

628
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:17,392
Thank you.

629
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:18,713
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

630
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:28,218
If I may, briefly, I did speak to the mayor earlier today and she did inform me that I guess the state has allowed

631
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:33,649
is allowed the budget deadline to move from June 30th to July 31st.

632
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,971
But she knows that we're looking for something sooner than later.

633
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:47,858
I did tell her that I wanna make sure that we have, as last week I stated repeatedly to the chief of staff that we need to have a budget book ASAP.

634
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,979
I agree with you a thousand percent.

635
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:58,264
We need to have a budget book in front of us that we have a few days so we can actually go through the data, take a look and formulate,

636
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:00,773
Good question.

637
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:04,439
So when we meet with the mayor, we can have a very constructive conversation.

638
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,262
This is a very important budget.

639
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,486
I know that they're still working.

640
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,251
From what I've been told, they're still working on the numbers.

641
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:17,235
From what I have also been told is we won't get state aid until July.

642
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:22,537
But I am working, or actually I did talk to the mayor.

643
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:29,060
I think she's going to have something for us hopefully next week, but don't know for sure yet.

644
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,882
So that's the update that I have from the administration.

645
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,662
I know Alicia Nunley, I think is on the line.

646
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,883
She may want to talk to this a little bit more.

647
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:45,364
I'm not sure if Jackie Peeks or Dave Rodriguez is on the line as well, but they may want to comment as well.

648
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:48,205
We have a number of councils that want to talk too.

649
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:53,646
So why don't I, let's see, Alicia Nunley, would you like to speak on the matter?

650
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:54,926
Sure.

651
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:58,127
Thank you, Honorable City Councilors.

652
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:01,398
Yes, we are still making cuts.

653
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:03,319
I'm going to be completely transparent.

654
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,541
This has been an extremely difficult budget.

655
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:08,363
And like the councilor said, this has never happened before.

656
00:45:08,403 --> 00:45:09,764
We've never had COVID before.

657
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,165
We've never had a shutdown.

658
00:45:12,006 --> 00:45:14,428
This has just really, really been difficult.

659
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:22,254
So we've been trying to figure out the best way to do the cuts with each department head, trying to figure out everything that we can do.

660
00:45:22,314 --> 00:45:24,636
It is still a work in process, unfortunately.

661
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:25,857
We have not finalized

662
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:30,022
numbers, but we are really working towards getting there right now.

663
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:35,268
We've had meetings, so we do want to get you a budget.

664
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:41,567
Thank you.

665
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,389
We have a number of questions.

666
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:48,031
Let's see, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Villes, and Councilor Marks.

667
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:48,992
Vice President Caviello.

668
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,092
Thank you, Mr. President.

669
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:55,816
Mr. President, if I could amend Councilor Nice's paper to put down that we do meet in person.

670
00:45:57,997 --> 00:46:01,240
We had 1,000 people at Hall Mill Stadium last week.

671
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,342
It was attended by many councillors.

672
00:46:05,383 --> 00:46:17,092
So again, I don't see why seven or eight or 10 of us can't be in a room if we could have 1,000 people in one spot and say there were councillors that were in attendance.

673
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:25,158
So if I could amend that Councillor Knight's motion to make sure that we have a plan to meet in person.

674
00:46:27,224 --> 00:46:29,304
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

675
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:32,125
So, Clerk Curtis, do you have the amendment?

676
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:36,246
I do, Mr. President.

677
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:41,987
The amendment is that the council meet in person to discuss the budget once everything is scheduled.

678
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,408
Okay, thank you.

679
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:45,128
Councilor Beers.

680
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:53,190
I'd be happy to meet outside on a sunny day, six feet away with a mask on, but just my actual point is,

681
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,632
that it's incredibly frustrating that we're at this point.

682
00:46:56,692 --> 00:47:06,760
I understand the difficulty, I understand this is unprecedented, but people are really concerned about this budget and they have a right to be.

683
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:14,886
And the fact that a lot of us, basically everyone feels in the dark is just gonna, the longer that we go, the bigger a problem this is gonna be with residents feeling in the dark.

684
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:19,230
So I, next week is, it's late.

685
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,693
I think we need something by Friday if we're gonna be able to do this right.

686
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:27,415
Thank you, Council of Affairs.

687
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:28,255
Councilor Marks.

688
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:30,357
Thank you, Mr. President.

689
00:47:31,257 --> 00:47:38,102
I think if we all recall, this may have gave us a commitment that we were going to get the budget in April.

690
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:45,487
That would have been the earliest budget, Mr. President, I've been on 20 years on the council, that this council has ever received a budget.

691
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:52,711
And then we had what we all know COVID-19 came into effect, Mr. President, and threw a monkey wrench into that.

692
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:56,554
So the commitment was out there, Mr. President, to get us an early budget.

693
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,837
And we're faced now with a $10 million deficit.

694
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:15,006
And although some would like to see a budget immediately, I think it's only prudent that the mayor take the time, Mr. President, to wait to see the local aid, what we're going to receive, to see what local receipts may be coming in.

695
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:20,950
We also waited, Mr. President, which we all know, because they extended the period to pay your taxes.

696
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:25,934
So we wanted to see what revenue we had in order to put together a budget.

697
00:48:26,494 --> 00:48:37,484
So I appreciate the fact that my colleagues have concern, but I can tell you from experience, Mr. President, I remember getting the budget with one night to work on it.

698
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:46,294
And I remember, Mr. President, in the past, there wasn't much outcry for many years, Mr. President.

699
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:54,380
And now all of a sudden, in the middle of COVID-19, there's an outcry to get the budget, which we never got this early, Mr. President.

700
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:56,823
So it's great people want to see the budget.

701
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:58,404
I'm eager to see the budget.

702
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:00,546
We need to move forward, Mr. President.

703
00:49:00,986 --> 00:49:05,510
But by no stretch of the imagination is this city administration holding

704
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,611
anything back.

705
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:13,681
They're trying to put together a budget that will provide city services, that will keep people employed, Mr. President.

706
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:22,113
The last thing we want to do is send out a budget to alarm people that they may be losing their job, and then we get a federal stimulus.

707
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:23,374
or we get a bailout.

708
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:24,315
And guess what?

709
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:28,059
When you were worried about your job for the last three weeks, you don't have to worry.

710
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:31,082
The last thing we do is want to worry people, Mr. President.

711
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:34,105
We're all going to have ample time to meet with the department heads.

712
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,008
We're going to have ample time to go over the budget, Mr. President.

713
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:40,389
And we're going to have ample time to make sure we have input.

714
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:42,509
So don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

715
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:45,430
The process has worked this way, Mr. President.

716
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,651
And I feel comfortable that we're moving forward with a realistic budget.

717
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:54,192
I don't want to see a budget that's not realistic, because I've dealt with one for the last 20 years.

718
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:56,152
I want to see a realistic budget.

719
00:49:56,433 --> 00:50:06,155
And I think that's what this current administration is working on, Mr. President, in a time of emergency, in a time of a pandemic, and a lot more happening, Mr. President.

720
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:06,515
Thank you.

721
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:08,998
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

722
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,679
Councilor Layton.

723
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:19,900
I do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that if we were supposed to meet April 1st, that would have been great.

724
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:22,741
And government shutdown happened March 13th.

725
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:31,943
And I do believe the administration had indicated that they had a working budget based upon the forecast at the time for fiscal year 21.

726
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:36,350
And I do believe that we requested that that information be shared with us.

727
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,112
And I do believe that the administration has refused to do so.

728
00:50:39,752 --> 00:50:45,176
I still haven't received that document that we requested, Mr. President, asking for a copy of the working budget that they had.

729
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:50,559
Mr. President, that was a preliminary budget that every mayor for the last 30 years works on, Mr. President.

730
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:59,806
And if someone wants to create the budget, maybe they should run for mayor.

731
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:06,471
Because it's the mayor's responsibility to create the budget and then pass it on to the council, Mr. President.

732
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:11,255
So I don't know why we're putting the cop before the horse, Mr. President.

733
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:16,058
It's never happened in previous years, and there was never anyone outspoken in previous years.

734
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:21,423
But now, I guess in COVID-19, we have different expectations, Mr. President.

735
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,664
Thank you, Councilman.

736
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:24,165
Councilman, I

737
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:27,314
I agree with the gentleman wholeheartedly.

738
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:45,005
It's the mayor's responsibility to put a budget forward, and I certainly would love to see one, one that has, based on realistic expectations, like the ones that we paid for from our private consultant, the numbers that he gave us, that the private consultant provided us with, so that we were able to forecast accurately, so that we could put together a realistic budget.

739
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:50,429
You know, Mr. President, I think that it's important for us to look at the circumstances that are before us.

740
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:51,954
We're in a financial crisis.

741
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:54,977
We've been in financial crises before, and we've been able to work our way out of them.

742
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:56,439
But we've had to work to do it.

743
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:57,680
So let's get to work on it.

744
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,521
That's all I'm saying.

745
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:00,083
Thank you.

746
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,826
Any other comments regarding the budget?

747
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:07,090
Does the public have any comments?

748
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:12,616
Great.

749
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:19,550
Okay, hearing and seeing none on the motion.

750
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:24,194
Mr. President, I see that Danielle has her hand raised, I believe.

751
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:24,915
I'm sorry.

752
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:28,638
We're gonna let Councilor Scarpelli go first and then we'll go to Danielle.

753
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,538
Councilor Scarpelli.

754
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:30,659
Thank you, Councilor.

755
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:34,683
I believe I was just letting you be aware that Alicia Nunley had her hand up.

756
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:36,044
Oh, I'm sorry.

757
00:52:36,584 --> 00:52:37,004
Alicia.

758
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:39,727
Yeah, I just wanted to address that.

759
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:43,470
Yes, it's true that we did start the budget process back in March.

760
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:53,515
We had met with the school department gave them an estimate and then unfortunately, the COVID-19 hit and we were trying to kind of figure out how everything was going to work.

761
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:55,497
I just want to be completely fully transparent.

762
00:52:56,377 --> 00:53:03,421
And as we were trying to get our numbers and I was trying to do casting like that I was affected personally by COVID-19.

763
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,202
I'm a key contributor, to be honest, with your honorable body.

764
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:22,169
I give the revenue figure to the mayor in order to budget, and I was not available, and they had to find a consultant to help them with that while I was away.

765
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:35,977
I've been back, I've been working extremely hard on the front side, looking at each department's budget, looking at where we can cut, what we can do, analyzing the revenues with our consultant to make sure my numbers and his numbers are aligned

766
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:41,126
So I just wanna let you know that we are working extremely hard to get you a budget.

767
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:43,768
Thank you, Alicia.

768
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:47,010
Councilor Lange.

769
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:55,836
Alicia, was there a working budget for the city of Medford ever prepared?

770
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:01,259
What we did was I came up with a projection based on the numbers that I saw.

771
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:05,534
of what I thought we would have for revenues and where I thought the school could be.

772
00:54:05,554 --> 00:54:07,294
I gave that figure.

773
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:13,896
I started looking at the numbers once the COVID hit, and we had to freeze everything.

774
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:22,118
I started going back and did a 10 year analysis to look back to when we had other crashes in the economy and how we fared out and what to kind of expect.

775
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:23,618
And then I got sick.

776
00:54:25,106 --> 00:54:31,773
Okay, so when the chief of staff said three meetings ago that they had a working budget for fiscal year 21.

777
00:54:32,013 --> 00:54:34,856
That wasn't necessarily the case.

778
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:38,319
I'm talking about back in March.

779
00:54:38,499 --> 00:54:39,581
Sorry, me too.

780
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:45,426
Yeah, I believe it was represented that the city had a working budget based upon the projections at the time prior to COVID-19.

781
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:48,679
for fiscal year 21.

782
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,961
And then Coronavirus hit.

783
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:53,245
And then that's why they pulled on it didn't put it out.

784
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:58,232
Numbers I had at that time were incorrect because we had to revise them down because of COVID-19.

785
00:54:58,272 --> 00:54:59,794
So that was that was no good.

786
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:04,841
So we do have a pre Coronavirus budget representing each department in this community.

787
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:17,330
I mean, the ones that I worked on, I worked on some projections to come up with numbers for what to budget for the school and what to budget in general, but we didn't have every single budget set up, but yes, they would have had a preliminary of what the number would have been.

788
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:18,411
Okay.

789
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:25,057
So there wasn't a working budget that was ready to be looked at and reviewed and debated in the two weeks coming up to April 1st.

790
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:26,398
All right.

791
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:27,639
Thank you very much for that.

792
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,400
I appreciate it.

793
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,690
You're doing an awful lot of work on the budget.

794
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:40,333
And that's great, we appreciate it.

795
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:43,754
I find it to be very, very intelligent and I've always enjoyed that conversation.

796
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:48,457
But a silent voice in this has always been the budget director.

797
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:51,539
And I don't know if the budget director is on the call.

798
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:59,503
I'm not sure.

799
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,845
But it's becoming increasingly frustrating.

800
00:56:03,964 --> 00:56:06,025
Do we have a budget director that doesn't come to budget meetings?

801
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:12,227
We have people that, you know, the budget can't happen because certain people around certain people aren't, but we have a budget director that we're paying to coordinate this stuff.

802
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:16,309
So with that being said, Mr. President, you know where I stand, I want a budget.

803
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:20,070
And I want it as soon as we can get it, get as soon as possible so we can get down to work on it.

804
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:21,611
I won't belabor the point.

805
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:22,491
And again, I thank Ms.

806
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:24,492
Nunley for all the work that she does here in the community.

807
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:25,532
I rest my case.

808
00:56:27,153 --> 00:56:27,853
Thank you, Ms.

809
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:28,213
Nunley.

810
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:29,334
Thank you, council.

811
00:56:29,374 --> 00:56:32,795
We have David Rodriguez, chief of staff and the mayor, David Rodriguez.

812
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:36,624
and just to be very, very clear, the mayor wants to give you a budget.

813
00:56:37,385 --> 00:56:40,366
This is not a question of will, this is a math problem we're trying to work through.

814
00:56:40,866 --> 00:56:55,553
Exactly right, based upon the revenue numbers that were given to us and that we've been working on, that we were very, and to speak to the point of transparency, we came to the council and to the school committee pretty early to say, this is the trouble that we think we're gonna be seeing in terms of the revenue side.

815
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:58,775
And this is the number that we're working off of in order to craft and propose

816
00:56:59,075 --> 00:56:59,996
to provide a balanced budget.

817
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:03,638
The mayor is required by law to provide a balanced budget to the council.

818
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,964
Under statutory timelines, which thankfully have been extended, but we will be getting it to you as soon as we possibly can.

819
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:22,372
This will be a responsible, balanced budget based upon these revenue numbers that Alicia and Tony Roselli have been putting together and working around the clock, trying to revise constantly.

820
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:25,796
We had begun the work on the budget previously.

821
00:57:27,338 --> 00:57:30,241
Budget is a year-long process, and it needs to be recognized like that.

822
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:40,754
Inside March and inside early April, we had begun work on the budget, and we effectively had to restart all that work based upon the current economic and budgetary crisis that we're facing.

823
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:48,421
So it's been a challenging scenario from March 12th to now, but we're working through it.

824
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:53,446
And thankfully we have a talented budget team that's working together as a team to pull this document together.

825
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:59,932
If I may Chief of Staff Rodriguez, thank you for dialing in.

826
00:58:00,452 --> 00:58:06,698
Do we know when we can expect the first budget meeting to be?

827
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:11,724
Basically, I was my understanding about a conversation with the mayor earlier today.

828
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:15,866
And I think that that conversation was beginning the 20th.

829
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:18,707
I believe that's the conversation that you and you and her had.

830
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,711
Okay, so if we have the 20th, so that would be a Saturday.

831
00:58:23,892 --> 00:58:26,153
What can we expect a budget book?

832
00:58:26,773 --> 00:58:29,114
The bigger question is the book.

833
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:30,275
We really need the book.

834
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:31,655
Yep.

835
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,276
And that's currently under development right now.

836
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:37,198
We will give it to you as soon as possible ahead of time on the 19th or before.

837
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:41,460
So at least that we'll be able to start chewing on it for 24, 48 hours ahead of time.

838
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:44,521
Thank you.

839
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,382
Councilor Behrs, you had a question.

840
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:47,362
Thanks.

841
00:58:47,382 --> 00:58:48,903
I don't want to belabor it, but you know,

842
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:52,033
We didn't get much solid information early.

843
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:58,875
I understand the circumstances are difficult, but, you know, I personally feel the communication hasn't been enough.

844
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:03,437
And I understand that people can disagree about that, but I don't think we're going to get any further here.

845
00:59:04,317 --> 00:59:05,157
So I move the question.

846
00:59:07,998 --> 00:59:09,098
Thank you.

847
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:17,121
The motion of Councilor Peo, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Carviello, Clerk Carnaby, please call the roll.

848
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:19,322
Actually, you know what, I apologize.

849
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:23,304
Did you say there was one person that wanted to speak that I missed before?

850
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:25,826
Yes, Mr. President.

851
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,146
Danielle has her hand up.

852
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:41,954
Hi, I think I may be, you're seeing that I was clapping my hands for the opening statement about racism.

853
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:43,054
Okay.

854
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,295
Would you like to speak on the budget?

855
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:46,396
No, thank you.

856
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:48,457
Thank you.

857
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,081
We just wanna make sure everybody gets their turn.

858
00:59:53,002 --> 01:00:01,730
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Caravaglio, Clerk Herves, please call the roll.

859
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:02,470
Councilor Behrs?

860
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:03,631
Yes.

861
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:05,033
Vice President Caravaglio?

862
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:05,673
Yes.

863
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:06,654
Councilor Knight?

864
01:00:07,515 --> 01:00:07,735
Yes.

865
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:08,916
Councilor Marks?

866
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,100
Councilor Marks?

867
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:22,213
I'm gonna skip Councilor Marks and come back to him.

868
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:23,294
Councilor Morrell?

869
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:24,135
Yes.

870
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:25,697
Councilor Scarpelli?

871
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:26,218
Yes.

872
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:27,540
President Falco?

873
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:29,703
Yes.

874
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:32,747
And then Councilor Marks, we still don't have a vote.

875
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:33,087
Yes.

876
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:33,988
Thank you.

877
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,453
Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

878
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:56,509
2-0-399 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas the Office of Diversity is established to provide oversight of laws and regulations relating to affirmative action, contract compliance, fair housing, disability, human rights, discrimination, hate-related incidents, and or crimes.

879
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:59,651
We focus on outreach, inclusion, and education.

880
01:01:00,512 --> 01:01:12,464
We interact with other city departments as well as other cities in local, state, and federal organizations and agencies to ensure fair and equitable opportunity and access for all persons.

881
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:23,875
And whereas the Office of Diversity is established to provide persons with disabilities equal opportunity to access to as well as participation in education, employment,

882
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:28,458
the public and private services in the city of Medford through advocacy, awareness, and enforcement.

883
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:38,965
And whereas the office of personnel is established to help city departments attract, motivate, retain, manage, and develop qualified and productive employees.

884
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:47,211
And whereas the functions of the office of the disability and office of diversity have been consolidated under the director of personnel.

885
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:49,112
And whereas the consolidation

886
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:59,498
as a result in the elimination of the independent disinterested check and balance on personal matters once provided through the Office of Disability and Diversity.

887
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:06,383
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request City Solicitor Scanlon provide an opinion on the following question.

888
01:02:06,943 --> 01:02:14,428
Does the consolidation of the above departments create any conflict with the law or liability within the City of Medford?

889
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:15,729
Councilor Layton.

890
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:22,540
Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you for indulging me in that very long-winded resolution that I put together.

891
01:02:23,661 --> 01:02:39,158
Ultimately, I've been concerned about this for some time, and I scratch my head sometimes and wonder if it's appropriate that we have a personnel director serving as judge, jury, and executioner on all matters related to personnel, disability, and diversity in the community.

892
01:02:39,914 --> 01:02:53,162
And the reason I say that, Mr. President, is because when the person that's responsible for personnel in our community wears so many different hats, that becomes a question and a concern as to whether or not he's serving the appropriate master and is in an appropriate role.

893
01:02:53,682 --> 01:03:06,749
So with that being said, Mr. President, if in fact we have the director of personnel that's serving on, let's say a hiring panel, and there's an individual in our community that feels as though they've been aggrieved based upon a disability issue or a diversity issue,

894
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,843
course of action would be to go and speak with the disability director or the diversity director.

895
01:03:12,183 --> 01:03:20,609
Well, that person would also be the personnel director who sat on the panel, which made a determination that may have made you feel uncomfortable and maybe felt as though your rights have been violated.

896
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:27,434
So that's the independent check and balance you go to to determine whether or not your rights are being violated and whether or not you're going to be advocated for.

897
01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:34,239
And it puts the personnel director in the precarious position of determining whether or not he's going to be defending the actions of the board he sits on.

898
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:39,689
or advocating for the personnel that have come before him and asked for the assistance and the help.

899
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:56,533
So, you know, it's really a structure of government, the consolidation, the government issue, Mr. President, but with a director of personnel has to wear so many hats and we already have made, you know, the recognition, the realization that there is a marginalized and underrepresented population in this community.

900
01:03:57,093 --> 01:04:01,914
The question is whether or not it's a best practice to merge these functions in underneath one

901
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:14,970
umbrella in one person, number one, and number two, if by doing that, it creates a situation where individuals are being denied access to a resource and an independent check and balance that they had previously had that they no longer do.

902
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:22,512
So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the measure, to send the question to the city solicitor to see if it poses any conflict.

903
01:04:23,352 --> 01:04:32,134
Again, Mr. President, you know, it could be something as simple as an existing employee asking for a reasonable accommodation and the reasonable accommodation not being made.

904
01:04:32,554 --> 01:04:36,135
So you go to the personnel director, you ask for a reasonable accommodation, it's not being made.

905
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:42,318
You go to the director of disability and you say, you know, this is my situation, I need someone to advocate for me.

906
01:04:42,438 --> 01:04:52,401
If that's the same person, it creates a situation and a circumstance where people might be less likely to come forward, less likely to seek help in advocating for themselves through these offices.

907
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:54,562
So that's why I raised the issue and I'd ask for your support.

908
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:57,963
Thank you, counsel Knight.

909
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,504
Any questions or comments from the council?

910
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,701
Okay, any other questions from the public?

911
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:05,681
Anybody have any questions?

912
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:08,502
Second, Mr. President.

913
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:10,823
I see Melanie McGough.

914
01:05:11,103 --> 01:05:12,744
Yes.

915
01:05:12,884 --> 01:05:13,284
Thank you.

916
01:05:13,304 --> 01:05:16,265
There we go.

917
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:22,027
Melanie, could you please have your name and address for the record?

918
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:23,956
Sure.

919
01:05:24,036 --> 01:05:24,556
Thank you.

920
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:51,043
Uh, melanie mclaughlin 152 awesome street medford, mass Please forgive me for staying off video at this point, but it's been a long day and I think i'm doing everybody a justice by doing so Um, I just wanted to second, uh, and then speak to uh councillor knight's, um, uh direction I think uh as the former co-chair of the special education parent advisory council and also the parent of a child with a disability

921
01:05:51,679 --> 01:06:03,288
I think it is incredibly important for us to have singular disability and inclusion office in our city hall.

922
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:11,674
We've had that for many, many years and having presented to them and gone to them as a member of the CPAC and having asked them to advocate in the past, I think it's incredibly important.

923
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:20,361
I think if you see what's happening in our city and our nation around racism, ableism is a big part of the discrimination piece as well.

924
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:23,098
And we need to be thinking about that in our schools.

925
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:29,320
We just recently got a disability and inclusion officer in our school as a stipended position, not even a full position.

926
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,862
This is a very important matter and one that I would not want to see separated.

927
01:06:33,942 --> 01:06:45,947
So as a community member, I'm weighing in as the mother of a child with a disability, and as a person who's been connected to families with disability in the community, I would ask that this be maintained as an individual position for our city.

928
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:48,508
Thank you very much.

929
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,171
Would anybody else like to weigh in on this?

930
01:06:54,613 --> 01:06:56,795
Okay, I don't see anybody else.

931
01:06:57,035 --> 01:07:04,239
Let's see, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carabiello.

932
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,981
Clerk, please call the roll.

933
01:07:07,882 --> 01:07:08,502
Councilor Behrs?

934
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:09,623
Yes.

935
01:07:10,203 --> 01:07:11,124
Vice President Carabiello?

936
01:07:11,424 --> 01:07:11,664
Yes.

937
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:12,725
Councilor Knight?

938
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:13,825
Yes.

939
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:15,487
Councilor Marks?

940
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:16,387
Yes.

941
01:07:17,508 --> 01:07:18,188
Councilor Morrell?

942
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:19,049
Yes.

943
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,571
Councilor Scarpelli?

944
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:21,172
Yes.

945
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:22,353
President Falco?

946
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:28,036
Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

947
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:39,042
20-400 offered by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the City Council receive an update on the Bedford Police Department's use of four standards in other policies relevant to de-escalation.

948
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:40,003
Councilor Morrell.

949
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,104
Thank you, Mr. President.

950
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:48,748
Like my fellow councilors, I've received more than 100 emails in the past week plus with residents seeking information

951
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:56,308
related to questions as far as what our police and Medford are doing to ensure the safety and support of all members of our community.

952
01:07:57,088 --> 01:08:07,877
And more specifically, what the current practices and policies of our police are, and how they might relate to recent policy suggestions that work to stop police violence and stop police killings throughout this country.

953
01:08:08,557 --> 01:08:14,182
So my intention with this is to send it to the public safety subcommittee for a future meeting held with all urgency.

954
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:22,656
where the chief of police can attend and address these questions, as well as allow the subcommittee members and the public to ask more specific policy questions.

955
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,417
I did talk to the chief earlier last week.

956
01:08:26,318 --> 01:08:30,199
It's my understanding that he's working on a public document to address a lot of these questions.

957
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:37,483
But I do think this is something that needs to be taken up in a subcommittee so that we can have more specific questions and conversation around this.

958
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:38,443
I do understand there's a

959
01:08:39,268 --> 01:08:42,951
Similar type motion, but I think this is something that we need to address as a subcommittee.

960
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:45,552
And I move for approval to send the paper there.

961
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:46,873
Second.

962
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:48,775
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

964
01:09:04,345 --> 01:09:05,947
Are there any questions from the council?

965
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,948
I believe that Councilor Behrs, did you have your hand up?

966
01:09:09,462 --> 01:09:15,067
I just wanted to say that people clearly really want to have this conversation, and I think it's important that we as a council take it on.

967
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:16,048
Thank you.

968
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:17,369

Any comments?

971
01:09:23,194 --> 01:09:26,256
Anybody from the public who would like to speak on this issue?

979
01:09:47,645 --> 01:09:48,185

Yes.

983
01:09:51,668 --> 01:09:52,309
Councilor Morrell.

984
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:53,089
Yes.

985
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,330
Councilor Scarpelli.

986
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:54,911
Yes.

987
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,092
Vice President Falco.

988
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:57,493
Yes.

989
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:58,914
70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

990
01:09:59,014 --> 01:09:59,755
The motion passes.

991
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:08,502
20-401 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the city administration and the recreation director report back to the city council

992
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:13,665
with programming plans for summer recreation, Tusk Pool and Wright's Pond.

993
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:16,048
Councilor Scott Pelley.

994
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:17,149
Thank you, Mr. President.

995
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:20,433
Now, with phase two,

996
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,884
all in and looking into phase three.

997
01:10:26,044 --> 01:10:46,080
And as we approach our official summer vacation, the question I had as I put this resolution through is getting some understanding of what's going on with the recreation department and what programs and the policies and procedures and what we're looking at for the pool rights pond.

998
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,222
And since I,

999
01:10:49,122 --> 01:10:58,284
As for this resolution, I've had a great discussion with our director of recreation and he has been, Kevin has been great.

1000
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:12,227
I know that working with a group of three and spending a lot of his time distributing the food, he's been very busy in the community and I really appreciate their hard work.

1001
01:11:12,827 --> 01:11:16,148
But I think that as we move forward,

1002
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:36,048
we have to get to a sense of normalcy and making sure that we are informed as we move forward of what the policies are at the pool, what the policies are at the pond, how are we going to handle separate camps and activities in the community are going to be very important for all constituents.

1003
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:47,037
I know that as we move forward to some sense of normalcy, we have a lot of questions that are coming back from the state level and what we can do at pools and ponds.

1004
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:50,901
The regulations right now, we're saying that it's 25%

1005
01:11:52,582 --> 01:11:55,264
of occupancy at one time.

1006
01:11:55,365 --> 01:12:02,611
So how we arrange that, I know that our recreation director is working very, very hard.

1007
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:06,474
He's got some great ideas, some ideas that we're using as well.

1008
01:12:06,754 --> 01:12:14,421
And moving forward, I just want to make sure that he gets the assistance from the city administration like he's been getting so far.

1009
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:16,542
and getting the word out.

1010
01:12:16,602 --> 01:12:21,824
So I think that really, it's really keeping everybody informed as we're working through the process.

1011
01:12:21,844 --> 01:12:28,987
So whatever I just said, it's just adding some information.

1012
01:12:30,107 --> 01:12:32,508
So I hope to get more information soon.

1013
01:12:33,108 --> 01:12:34,549
So I just wanted to share that with you.

1014
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:37,070
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

1015
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:41,972
Any other questions from the council first?

1016
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:45,868
Any questions from the general public?

1017
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,069
We have, let's see.

01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,610

01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:50,091

01:12:53,814 --> 01:12:55,555
Chris Murphy, 51 shared now.

1022
01:12:56,055 --> 01:12:58,557
I'm also a member of the park commission.

1023
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:11,225
I know we are going to meet Thursday on this to talk about how we go forward with not only the pond, the pool and all the fields.

1024
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,715
I think we should have a, um, keep you all in the loop.

1025
01:13:15,735 --> 01:13:27,580
We're meeting Thursday night and hopefully we'll have a better answer for you guys going forward on the pool, the pond and the fields with pace too.

1026
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:34,123
So I just want to let you guys know that we are, um, as a board going to talk about that stuff on Thursday night.

1027
01:13:35,164 --> 01:13:35,804
Okay, good.

1028
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:36,284
Thank you Chris.

1029
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:37,745
Thank you very much.

1030
01:13:37,785 --> 01:13:38,145
Mr. President.

1031
01:13:40,272 --> 01:13:42,874
Um, I, what have we done so far?

1032
01:13:42,894 --> 01:13:47,237
Mr. Murphy, we talked to the administration about the, the, the fields.

1033
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:57,505
Cause as we're rolling out now that we can have passive activity, um, I know that, uh, you know, we're, we're going to be talking about another resolution coming down the line that I have.

1034
01:13:57,785 --> 01:14:02,208
And I'll save that till later, but have, have we now started getting the fields in place?

1035
01:14:02,248 --> 01:14:04,590
You know, if that's happened, you're meeting.

1036
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:08,693
It's something we, we, we, we're going to be talking about Thursday now that we

1037
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:11,802
I believe we just got guidelines today.

1038
01:14:13,142 --> 01:14:16,383
I haven't looked at them in depth yet, but it's something we're all going to be able to talk.

1039
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:22,785
We'll have a better understanding Thursday, because as you guys have seen, things could change between now and then, so.

1040
01:14:26,327 --> 01:14:27,027
Thank you, Chris.

1041
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:28,427
No problem.

1042
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:31,869
Counselor Scott Pelli, did you have any further comments on this?

1043
01:14:32,429 --> 01:14:32,649
No.

1044
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:35,730

Yes.

Yes.

1057
01:15:05,227 --> 01:15:06,048
Councilor Scarpelli.

01:15:06,328 --> 01:15:06,568
Yes.

1059
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:07,628
President Falco.

1060
01:15:08,278 --> 01:15:10,942
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1061
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:14,527
20-402 offered by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1062
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:22,138

Councilor Scott Kelly.

1064
01:15:24,381 --> 01:15:25,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

1065
01:15:25,342 --> 01:15:39,198
Again, to follow up with Kevin Bailey, our Director of Recreation, I know that as we're meeting with Mr. Murphy and the PACS Commission, they've told us that

1066
01:15:40,179 --> 01:15:46,042
They've already started to reach out to little leagues and softball and different organizations.

1067
01:15:46,062 --> 01:15:56,105
I'm just hoping that, I know it's been a tough time and the city administration has been inundated with so many different issues.

1068
01:15:56,606 --> 01:16:07,330
I think that it's important that we call for a meeting with all of our youth organizations to make sure we review guidelines, policies and procedures, what's the expectations,

1069
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:13,174
and what we need to do moving forward as we get to some sort of COVID-19 normalcy.

1070
01:16:13,214 --> 01:16:17,018
So I ask that move approval.

1071
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:19,880

Peter Fuccioni, a happy 75th birthday.

1096
01:17:08,663 --> 01:17:09,184
God's all right.

1097
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:19,832
Mr. President, Peter Fuccioni, the man, the myth, the legend, the man responsible for all those wonderful meals that we received down at Raso's Restaurant, day in and day out.

1098
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:27,898
One of the hottest working men in show business, Mr. President, just celebrated his 75th birthday, and we wish him 75 more happy and healthy ones.

1099
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:32,342
Many of us have gotten to know Peter over the years from his work down at Raso's Restaurant.

1100
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:35,012
And before that, in Clarendon Hill at the Genoa.

1101
01:17:35,372 --> 01:17:37,954
And before that, in Beacon Hill at Primo's Restaurant.

1102
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:47,759
Peter's been in the industry for 70 over 75 years, Mr. President, and he's done an excellent job at it, as evident by the product that they're putting out at Razzles Restaurant.

1103
01:17:48,419 --> 01:18:01,266
So I just wanted to take an opportunity to wish Peter a happy 75th birthday, and to hope that he has a nice, healthy, and happy summer out there, making sure that we have safe spaces to eat,

1104
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:04,011
and outdoor dining at Razzles restaurants.

1105
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:04,953
He's done a great job.

1106
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,960
Mr. President's a great guy, a good friend, and I just wish him the best.

1107
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,567
I ask my council colleagues to join me.

1108
01:18:11,348 --> 01:18:12,168
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1109
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,629

1110
01:18:13,649 --> 01:18:14,729
Thank you, Mr. President.

1111
01:18:15,269 --> 01:18:20,050
I concur with Councilor Knight's kind words.

1112
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,951
I was able to participate in the motorcade that went by there last week.

1113
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:28,892
I think Peter was a little in awe, but I've known Peter for many years now.

1114
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:30,053
Great guy.

1115
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,553
He's the glue that keeps Razzos together.

1116
01:18:33,093 --> 01:18:34,914
And I wanted to wish him a happy birthday also.

1117
01:18:36,414 --> 01:18:37,915
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

1118
01:18:40,096 --> 01:18:41,397
We have a hand raised.

1119
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:44,539
Oh, once again.

1120
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:49,121
I apologize.

1121
01:18:49,162 --> 01:18:53,424
I think someone, do you have someone else that wants to, oh, Marianne.

1122
01:18:56,326 --> 01:18:56,746
Marianne.

1123
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:58,867
Hi, I apologize.

1124
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,688
I'm not very good at this.

1125
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:08,073
So didn't know how to raise my hand early, but on the parks and rec stuff, just want to let you know, been working really hard and Kevin's been working really hard.

1126
01:19:09,002 --> 01:19:23,532
Our first thing is we have to post and put guidelines on all the parks and playgrounds before they can open the youth sports teams can certainly, we're working with them we're going to I'm going to be at the parks commission meeting on Thursday evening.

1127
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:31,537
But again, there's no games allowed there's no tournaments it's basically drills and practices limited groups of 10s.

1128
01:19:32,157 --> 01:19:34,379
There's some really strict guidelines in place.

1129
01:19:35,264 --> 01:19:48,533
But we're going to be going all over those are Thursday evening, but we are working hard to get everything up and running again, slowly but surely.

1130
01:19:49,173 --> 01:19:50,294
Thank you for that update.

1131
01:19:50,975 --> 01:19:52,476
We appreciate it.

1132
01:19:52,756 --> 01:20:02,202
On the motion of Council night seconded by Vice President yellow to wish you a happy 75th birthday on that motion.

1133
01:20:05,153 --> 01:20:05,753
Councilor Behrs?

1134
01:20:06,674 --> 01:20:06,914
Yes.

1135
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:08,275
Vice President Caravaglia?

1136
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:08,815
Yes.

1137
01:20:09,395 --> 01:20:09,875
Councilor Knight?

1138
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:11,096
Yes.

1139
01:20:11,456 --> 01:20:12,017
Councilor Marks?

1140
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:12,977
Yes.

1141
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:13,938
Councilor Morrell?

1142
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:14,718
Yes.

1143
01:20:15,098 --> 01:20:15,899
Councilor Scarpelli?

1144
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:17,720
Yes.

1145
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,060
President Falco?

1146
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:21,982
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1147
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:41,570
2020-404 offered by Councilor Scarpelli being resolved that the city council congratulate our 2020 Medford High School graduates in the school department for a very successful rolling graduation honoring our seniors, Councilor Scarpelli.

1148
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:42,670
Thank you, Mr. President.

1149
01:20:43,351 --> 01:20:52,657
In such an awful time, there's so many different negatives that have come out, so many tragic issues with the COVID crisis.

1150
01:20:55,138 --> 01:21:04,521
One side note, which is pretty, which was pretty devastating to many young men and women is the, um, the absence of a graduation.

1151
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:20,386
Um, and what, what Medford did to honor our seniors the past Wednesday, I think our school department should get a slap on the back and at least giving our seniors something that they can remember.

1152
01:21:20,566 --> 01:21:22,487
And you know, if it's, um,

1153
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:42,510
a group of people that I wanted to mention, Nancy and Joe Donlan, Mr. Blauck, of course, Mr. DeLava, Peter Arcola, former Medford graduate, who owns New Image Entertainment, DJ'd the parade for nothing, came down to Medford, hopped in a trailer, who, by the way,

1154
01:21:43,392 --> 01:22:00,961
was donated and driven by our favorite dad, Dave Crowley, who whenever you need something, if you see the marching band trailer coming by, it's Mr. Crowley and his dedication to our kids in Medford.

1155
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:08,925
And he drove the DJ around the city, and we saw our graduates waiting on main streets in the caps and gowns.

1156
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:17,448
And it was about a 10-minute procession of teachers just to come by just so they can wave and congratulate our seniors.

1157
01:22:17,468 --> 01:22:18,848
Again, a few other people.

1158
01:22:18,908 --> 01:22:23,589
I know that Mr. Cushing, Peter Cushing, our assistant superintendent.

1159
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:29,311
And I know, of course, Lisa Evangelista played a big part in this.

1160
01:22:29,351 --> 01:22:33,713
But I think the head of guidance, Mo Lavin, Maureen Lavin, who really

1161
01:22:35,353 --> 01:22:36,634
did a lot to get this going.

1162
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:38,735
She's done a great job as the head of guidance.

1163
01:22:39,415 --> 01:22:44,017
And one thing she wanted to make sure is that we don't forget our kids.

1164
01:22:44,077 --> 01:22:53,862
And I know it's a small gesture, but again, Method PD, again, helping leading the way, getting them around safely so we can acknowledge them.

1165
01:22:55,343 --> 01:22:56,664
It was a feel-good story.

1166
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:57,924
I wish we could do more for them.

1167
01:22:58,424 --> 01:23:03,926
But just acknowledging them is so important that it was a great, great morning.

1168
01:23:04,547 --> 01:23:06,407
It was all over Facebook, live.

1169
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:13,570
And I know that families were up and down Fulton Street congratulating our seniors.

1170
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:16,191
So again, I just wanted to reach out and say congratulations.

1171
01:23:16,611 --> 01:23:19,312
And thank you for putting something together for our seniors.

1172
01:23:19,672 --> 01:23:20,673
And again, for our seniors,

1173
01:23:21,673 --> 01:23:27,895
best of luck for everything you and you encounter for your future and best best of luck and best wishes.

1174
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:28,455
So thank you.

1175
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:30,916
Thank you, Scott Kelly.

1176
01:23:30,936 --> 01:23:37,497
And if I may echo the sentiments of my colleague, my son actually is a member of the senior class this year.

1177
01:23:37,658 --> 01:23:42,859
And thank you to everyone that was involved in the planning of that parade for our

1178
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:44,090
senior class.

1179
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:51,393
It was a great day, a lot of fun, a lot of involvement from all the teachers and administration at the high school.

1180
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:53,794
It was nice.

1181
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:55,475
I think the seniors really enjoyed it.

1182
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:58,496
They were in their caps and gowns on the side of the road.

1183
01:24:00,137 --> 01:24:09,441
you know, the administration, the school administration went all out and they did a really, really nice job, especially in these difficult times.

1184
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:19,024
So I would also like to thank everyone that was involved in planning the parade and look forward to, I believe they're going to actually have a real graduation.

1185
01:24:19,664 --> 01:24:21,765
It'll throwback, it'll be at a Hormel Stadium.

1186
01:24:22,105 --> 01:24:23,826
I believe it's going to be August 15th.

1187
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:26,767
So it'll be in the summer, but looking forward to that.

1188
01:24:26,847 --> 01:24:28,528
But I think it was a great that the,

1189
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:33,191
that everyone in the school system could have a part in putting this together.

1190
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:34,732
So we thank everyone that was involved.

1191
01:24:35,533 --> 01:24:36,493
Councilor Knight.

1192
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:42,537
Mr. President, I'd like to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this result forward.

1193
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:57,248
I think it's also important to point out the resilience of the Memphis High School class of 2020 senior class, the sacrifices that they had to make, the lost memories and lost opportunities that they've had

1194
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,251
to deal with as a result of the government shutdown.

1195
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:07,355
You know, I think it's very unfortunate that, you know, um, my little buddy, Mikey Nesta, didn't get to have a senior year of baseball.

1196
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:14,478
I think it's very unfortunate that, uh, you know, our hockey team didn't get to finish this season and, uh, you know, our lacrosse team didn't get to get out there on the field.

1197
01:25:15,019 --> 01:25:21,342
Um, you know, those are the sacrifices that these, uh, these, these children made, and these are the memories

1198
01:25:22,192 --> 01:25:24,414
that they're not going to be able to ever make up.

1199
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:35,642
So it's very important, Mr. President, to do the best we can to be sure that we do leave some good memories in their head during this trying time and take extra steps to make sure that they are a special part of this community.

1200
01:25:35,702 --> 01:25:38,004
So I really think the school department did an excellent job.

1201
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:42,928
Lisa Evangelista and her team, you know, Moe Levin and the rest of them are a great group of people.

1202
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:50,213
And, you know, they always put Mentored first, and that's what's very important to me, Mr. President, is the type of people that put Mentored first in these roles.

1203
01:25:50,653 --> 01:25:53,175
And those are two people that, you know, you can't shake a stick at.

1204
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:55,476
Mr. DeLave has done an excellent job in his new role.

1205
01:25:56,377 --> 01:25:58,478
Dr. Vincent's done an excellent job in her new role.

1206
01:25:58,538 --> 01:26:08,985
So I think at this point, you know, we're adapting to this new set of criteria and circumstances that are gonna be governing our life for the next period of time.

1207
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:16,330
But I think it's very important that we recognize the strength and the sacrifices that the senior class has made in order for us to get where we are today.

1208
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,772
Thank you Councilor Knight, Councilor Pears.

1209
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:22,099
Thank you, Mr. President.

1210
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:31,426
I second what everyone has said, and I graduated from Medford High in 2011, and those memories are still there, and the friendships are still there.

1211
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:48,079
And I think also we've done a lot as a community, and I just wanna acknowledge all the folks who have put up signs, put up those signs all around town, Class of 2020, Medford Strong, and signs on folks' lawns as well, because I think

1212
01:26:49,298 --> 01:26:59,325
As everyone has said, we're gonna need to do extra to make sure that the class of 2020 has the memories that they deserve to have, or at least as many as we can give them.

1213
01:26:59,565 --> 01:27:01,907
So thank you to everyone who's been supporting people.

1214
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:04,168
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

1215
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:08,831
So congratulations to the class of 2020.

1216
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:09,732
We wish them well.

1217
01:27:10,212 --> 01:27:12,694
And on the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by?

1218
01:27:12,714 --> 01:27:14,195
Second, Mr. President.

1219
01:27:14,915 --> 01:27:16,997
Vice President Carviello, Clerk, please call the roll.

1220
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,091
Also bears.

1221
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:20,612
Yes.

1222
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:22,394
Vice President carry yellow.

1223
01:27:22,834 --> 01:27:23,054
Yes.

1224
01:27:23,755 --> 01:27:24,175
Tonight.

1225
01:27:25,817 --> 01:27:26,137
Yes.

1226
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,178
Also marks.

1227
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:27,959
Yes.

1228
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,220
That's a morale.

1229
01:27:30,502 --> 01:27:30,682
Yes.

1230
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:37,151
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1231
01:27:37,171 --> 01:27:41,473
20-405 offered by Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell.

1232
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:48,875
Whereas systemic racism is a national, state, and local crisis threatening the public health and safety of our communities.

1233
01:27:49,576 --> 01:27:56,238
And whereas we have a duty and obligation as a city and a community to be actively

1234
01:27:56,862 --> 01:28:00,384
anti-racist in our words, actions, and policies.

1235
01:28:00,904 --> 01:28:13,509
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city of Memphis declares systemic racism to be a public health emergency that demands immediate action from the city and its residents.

1236
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:24,614
Be it further resolved by the Memphis City Council that we invite the mayor of Memphis and the Memphis School Committee to submit a joint resolution declaring systemic racism as a public health emergency.

1237
01:28:25,435 --> 01:28:26,095
Councilor Behrs.

1238
01:28:28,116 --> 01:28:31,059
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the consideration of my colleagues.

1239
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,540
I'm gonna read a little bit.

1240
01:28:34,361 --> 01:28:42,708
A chorus of people from across Medford have reached out to their elected officials in the last week and two to demand anti-racist action from our city.

1241
01:28:43,549 --> 01:28:49,074
I've only been a city councilor for a few months, but this is by far the most contact I've received from Medford residents.

1242
01:28:49,995 --> 01:28:53,778
The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery,

1243
01:28:54,194 --> 01:29:05,718
and thousands of other black Americans at the hands of police are horrific and yet all too common examples of the ongoing violence of white supremacy and structural racism in our country and right here in our community.

1244
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:14,781
Medford residents, especially young black residents, are sharing stories online about the racism and hate that they've experienced in our schools and on our streets.

1245
01:29:15,761 --> 01:29:22,944
While some people were shocked by these horrific accounts, people commit racist acts or make racist remarks every single day in Medford.

1246
01:29:23,668 --> 01:29:31,393
The many people who spoke at the powerful Black Lives Matter vigil at Hormel Stadium last week confirmed those stories of racism in our community and shared more of their own.

1247
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,255
I attended the Medford public schools.

1248
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:38,438
I remember the racist and hateful remarks that I would hear on a near daily basis.

1249
01:29:39,339 --> 01:29:44,002
It doesn't surprise me to know that this racism was even worse than I knew or that I could see as a white student.

1250
01:29:44,923 --> 01:29:46,284
None of us did enough to stop it.

1251
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:48,865
And sometimes we didn't do anything at all.

1252
01:29:49,966 --> 01:29:51,247
Racism is a Medford problem.

1253
01:29:52,578 --> 01:29:57,661
Medford has a deep history, and some of that is a deep history of racism, and we don't talk about it.

1254
01:29:58,262 --> 01:30:09,709
Medford also has a deep history of anti-racist organizing, of abolitionists, and of black-led movements for racial equity and justice for all, which we almost never talk about as a community.

1255
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:18,435
I want to particularly note the story of Shirley Kuntz, who in the late 1960s fought to desegregate the Hervey School, where I attended elementary school.

1256
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:28,832
Medford Historical Society hosts on their website a history of the many African American Medford residents who have fought racial injustices and advocated for everyone in our community.

1257
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:36,873
Medford residents of color have repeatedly stood up and demanded change and a real commitment to fight racism in Medford, even in the recent past.

1258
01:30:37,674 --> 01:30:43,555
But as I've heard too often this week from people who fought for that change, they said, quote, still nothing has changed.

1259
01:30:44,695 --> 01:30:45,055
No more.

1260
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:50,309
First, we have to declare systemic racism as a public health emergency here in Medford.

1261
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:57,795
One of the deepest impacts of racism are the racial health disparities that lead to poor medical treatment, illness, and death for people of color.

1262
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:10,885
This was the subject of my undergraduate thesis at UMass Amherst, and we know that even after you control for income or wealth or any other factor, Black people and people of color have worse health outcomes just because of their race.

1263
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:15,669
The increased illness and early death of our neighbors and friends is an emergency.

1264
01:31:17,035 --> 01:31:27,420
This declaration is one of the municipal actions requested as part of the 10-point agenda from the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, and they were joined with many elected officials of color from across the state.

1265
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:41,126
Yes, at the beginning, this is symbolic, but it's also a statement of values, a statement that we are taking this seriously and something that the community must use to hold us, your elected officials, accountable to taking action.

1266
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:46,668
I'm also hopeful that under a different national administration, we will see increased funding,

1267
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,262
coming to communities that declare these emergencies.

1268
01:31:50,483 --> 01:31:59,269
I wanna close by thanking Mayor Lungo Kern, who I heard today has also committed to issuing an order declaring systemic racism a public health emergency here in Medford.

1269
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,752
All of the city's elected officials need to make this an urgent priority.

1270
01:32:03,252 --> 01:32:06,194
And more importantly than anything, this cannot be the end.

1271
01:32:06,435 --> 01:32:15,922
This must be a continuation of the work unsung and unheard and unfulfilled that people in this community have been doing literally for centuries.

1272
01:32:16,607 --> 01:32:18,568
We have to take this seriously.

1273
01:32:18,768 --> 01:32:20,049
We have to fight racism.

1274
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:22,291
We have to make Medford anti-racist.

1275
01:32:22,911 --> 01:32:23,231
Thank you.

1276
01:32:25,213 --> 01:32:26,153
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1277
01:32:26,273 --> 01:32:26,914
Councilor Morrell.

1278
01:32:27,734 --> 01:32:28,755
Thank you, Mr. President.

1279
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:33,558
And thank you, Councilor Behrs for putting so much of that into a statement and putting it so well.

1280
01:32:33,658 --> 01:32:37,240
So you alluded to this, but I'm gonna start by reading off a few statistics.

1281
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:42,624
So black Americans are nearly three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.

1282
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:48,145
Black women die of pregnancy related causes at a rate about three times higher than those of white women.

1283
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:53,769
Black Americans are dying of COVID-19 at a three times rate of white Americans.

1284
01:32:54,470 --> 01:33:02,956
And black Americans face a higher risk of particle pollution than white Americans, which recent research has shown ties into the severity of COVID-19 cases.

1285
01:33:03,857 --> 01:33:10,002
All of this does nothing to speak of the immense mental health toll of systemic and structural racism on black Americans.

1286
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:14,373
These are just a few highlights of the so-called social determinants of health.

1287
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:22,179
So to me, as has been referenced already by Councilor Behrs, it's incredibly apparent that structural and systemic racism is a public health crisis.

1288
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:32,746
Saying so follows in line with statements of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association.

1289
01:33:33,387 --> 01:33:37,050
However, simply naming this emergency does not get the work done.

1290
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:39,992
I'm committed, as I hope are my council colleagues,

1291
01:33:40,388 --> 01:33:52,899
to work within our power and alongside our colleagues on the school committee and in the administration to work within our system and our structures to break down the systemic and structural racism that exists within this city and within this country.

1292
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:59,104
And I think the mayor, I had a line about us not being able to advance this work on our own.

1293
01:33:59,124 --> 01:34:02,787
So I thank the mayor for coming out and supporting this statement.

1294
01:34:03,468 --> 01:34:08,472
And that will allow us to dedicate resources and time to eradicate this issue.

1295
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:22,978
And I also speak to the fact that I received probably more than 100 emails from community members around this, from residents seeking change and conversations that have needed to happen for decades that we cannot and should not ignore any longer.

1296
01:34:23,779 --> 01:34:25,560
So again, this resolution is not the work.

1297
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:32,484
It's asking for the work to begin and inviting our colleagues throughout city government to work on this intractable challenge.

1298
01:34:32,785 --> 01:34:35,466
And I ask my fellow counselors to support this resolution.

1299
01:34:35,906 --> 01:34:38,388
And again, I thank the mayor for coming out with her declaration.

1300
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:39,321
Thank you.

1301
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:42,843
Thank you, Council Member Rao.

1302
01:34:42,863 --> 01:34:45,184
Is there any councilors that would like to speak on this at the moment?

1303
01:34:48,386 --> 01:34:49,607
Okay.

1304
01:34:50,807 --> 01:34:52,468
Anyone from the general public?

1305
01:34:52,528 --> 01:34:54,609
Any comments or would anybody like to speak on this?

1306
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:57,011
Mr. President?

1307
01:34:57,031 --> 01:34:58,912
One minute.

1308
01:35:00,747 --> 01:35:02,028
Yes, Vice President Carvajal.

1309
01:35:02,468 --> 01:35:07,010
Mr. President, I think this statement should come from the mayor, not from us.

1310
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:17,814
We could join with the mayor at some other time, but the mayor is the chief executive and I think she's the one that should be making the statements.

1311
01:35:20,355 --> 01:35:21,455
Thank you, Vice President Carvajal.

1312
01:35:24,063 --> 01:35:26,046
We have councilors at the moment would like to speak on this.

1313
01:35:26,106 --> 01:35:27,928
We have members of the public that would like to speak.

1314
01:35:28,449 --> 01:35:31,973
At this point in time, I'll recognize Curtis.

1315
01:35:38,715 --> 01:35:40,397
Curtis, I'm trying to, there you go.

1316
01:35:40,577 --> 01:35:42,219
Hello, thank you, I'm unmuted now.

1317
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:55,133
My name is Curtis Tooden, I live at 38 Early Ave in Medford, and I don't have much to add, I just, because Councilors Behrs and Morrell pretty much said it all, but I just think it's important to have it on the record, said out loud, that Black Lives Matter.

1318
01:35:55,810 --> 01:36:01,912
and a vote in support of treating racism as it should be, a public health crisis.

1319
01:36:03,092 --> 01:36:07,554
It's a vote for change that everybody in this community I think wants wholeheartedly.

1320
01:36:07,634 --> 01:36:12,176
So thank you for having this on the agenda and I hope it proceeds.

1321
01:36:13,036 --> 01:36:13,336
Thank you.

1322
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:15,697
Thank you, Curtis.

1323
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:19,578
Let's see, there's another hand up, I believe.

1324
01:36:22,179 --> 01:36:22,499
Here we go.

1325
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,887
please have your name and address for the record.

1326
01:36:29,428 --> 01:36:33,110
Yep, this is Marshall Mootnow at 33 Waterville Road, Medford.

1327
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:39,874
I think it's absolutely for the mayor to say, it's for the council to say, it's for everyone to say.

1328
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:47,478
Y'all can wish people happy birthdays, you can of course talk about anti-racist needs in our city.

1329
01:36:47,498 --> 01:36:55,183
I think it's really important that this is brought to the fore and I hope that it becomes part of the discussion of the budget as well.

1330
01:36:57,006 --> 01:37:00,957
The diversity funding is.

1331
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:05,572
miniscule relative to other items.

1332
01:37:06,732 --> 01:37:11,475
And I think if we're going to tackle this, we need to take a serious look of where we're putting our resources.

1333
01:37:12,656 --> 01:37:16,498
And so I appreciate the sentiment about this is not the work, this is where the work begins.

1334
01:37:17,038 --> 01:37:24,262
And I hope you all take a lens when you're looking at the other issues within the city.

1335
01:37:24,682 --> 01:37:25,282
So thank you.

1336
01:37:26,303 --> 01:37:26,663
Thank you.

1337
01:37:26,683 --> 01:37:29,305
At this point in time, let's see,

1338
01:37:30,657 --> 01:37:33,039
Natalie Hill, can we please have your name and address for the record?

1339
01:37:34,019 --> 01:37:35,601
Hi, my name is Natalie Hill.

1340
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:39,163
I live at 15 Madison Street, Medford, Mass.

1341
01:37:39,223 --> 01:37:44,547
I'd like to just echo what council persons Morrell and Baird said.

1342
01:37:45,247 --> 01:37:48,009
I am a mental health counselor, social worker.

1343
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,372
I feel very strongly that this is a public health crisis.

1344
01:37:53,693 --> 01:38:02,337
It's been the main topic of conversation in all of my sessions for the last two weeks It should have been the topic of discussion in my sessions much longer than that.

1345
01:38:02,857 --> 01:38:07,840
Um, I have done work on Mental health disparities and access to treatment for mental health.

1346
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:15,784
Um for for black the black community, um accessing mental health services um, it it has uh

1347
01:38:16,944 --> 01:38:29,052
been a long and hard fight to get Resources to really look at how our systems really minimize The impacts of racism on the black community.

1348
01:38:29,772 --> 01:38:36,657
I don't think You know, this should be put on any sort of backburner for discussion.

1349
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:42,601
That's all Thank you very much let's see we have a

1350
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:47,942
Mary, did you want to speak on the resolution offered by Councilors beers and console morale.

1351
01:38:54,427 --> 01:38:54,827
There you go.

1352
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:55,487
I do.

1353
01:38:55,607 --> 01:38:56,388
Thank you.

1354
01:38:56,448 --> 01:39:03,773
I just want to thank you for bringing this forward, I do agree it's a public health crisis, but it has been for a long time.

1355
01:39:04,233 --> 01:39:05,634
It's not a new emergency.

1356
01:39:06,135 --> 01:39:10,978
It's something that we've been looking at for social determinants as far as

1357
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:25,413
you know in inequalities and inequities for all peoples of color, and the disparities that they face, whether it because of their housing education and factors but against them so yes, thank you.

1358
01:39:26,274 --> 01:39:39,977
This is a public health crisis but it has been for a long time, and we have been working on it we have gotten some grant funding to do some work but we have a lot more work to do, and I appreciate your, your acknowledgement and your support.

1359
01:39:42,607 --> 01:39:43,007
Thank you.

1360
01:39:43,027 --> 01:39:52,313
Let's see, we have, okay, we have Councilor Knight, and then we have a number of other people that would like this.

1361
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,093
We'll get to everyone.

1362
01:39:53,113 --> 01:39:55,075
So I just ask everyone to please be patient.

1363
01:39:55,735 --> 01:39:56,215
Councilor Knight.

1364
01:39:57,496 --> 01:40:00,478
Yes, first we'll get to you.

1365
01:40:00,518 --> 01:40:01,598
Mr. President, it's Mary Ann.

1366
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,001
You're getting me dizzy over there waving.

1367
01:40:05,901 --> 01:40:07,622
Mr. President, this question's for Mary Ann.

1368
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:16,155
I guess my question is this, what does this do in terms of it is, you know, Jack said it was a symbolic gesture.

1369
01:40:16,175 --> 01:40:18,417
You know, words on paper.

1370
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:26,143
Does this give us any access to any money, I guess, these are a couple questions I have if we declare a public health emergency.

1371
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:30,366
Does it open up any avenues for us to get resources, number one.

1372
01:40:31,247 --> 01:40:32,268
Number two, does it.

1373
01:40:32,917 --> 01:40:40,580
create any obligations for us legally or establish any mandates that we need to follow that may become unfunded mandates.

1374
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:46,802
So, you know, is there gonna be an impact on the bottom line if we make a declaration of a public health emergency?

1375
01:40:47,102 --> 01:40:50,463
You know, what's the process we have to go through to declare a public health emergency?

1376
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:58,326
And then once you do it, is there any unfunded mandates or other obligations that we need to live up to once that's done?

1377
01:40:58,746 --> 01:41:00,027
And does it allow us to have

1378
01:41:01,016 --> 01:41:03,198
access to resources, revenues and the like.

1379
01:41:03,218 --> 01:41:19,969
Sorry, I was muted.

1380
01:41:20,089 --> 01:41:20,330
Okay.

1381
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:26,034
Um, so as of right now, um, there is no funding available.

1382
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:27,435
As far as I know, if you

1383
01:41:28,281 --> 01:41:33,664
declare a public health emergency like I said I feel it's more public health crisis this isn't anything new or emerging.

1384
01:41:35,685 --> 01:41:47,372
There are grants and things that have been available and one we're just playing today for this week for a $200,000 grant but that's again it's not new it's not because of public health emergency.

1385
01:41:48,032 --> 01:41:49,333
It's just the work we always do.

1386
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:55,777
I don't think there'll be any unfunded mandates associated with this at all because

1387
01:41:56,833 --> 01:42:00,994
Maybe they should have been a long time ago, but there's nothing now in the works.

1388
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:10,976
No, you know this, obviously now that this has become such a an issue in the spotlight.

1389
01:42:11,517 --> 01:42:25,420
There may be additional funding available, but nothing that we've seen so far, and nothing that I think would require us to, to have additional unfunded mandates, because

1390
01:42:26,692 --> 01:42:28,834
So answer your question.

1391
01:42:31,376 --> 01:42:31,916
I think so.

1392
01:42:32,637 --> 01:42:33,117
I think so.

1393
01:42:34,718 --> 01:42:39,142
So ultimately, you know, by making this declaration, it's more of just a statement.

1394
01:42:40,042 --> 01:42:44,025
But, you know, I think, well, there obviously there should be action behind it.

1395
01:42:44,145 --> 01:42:45,967
And we need to come up with action steps.

1396
01:42:46,587 --> 01:42:47,928
That's what I'm saying to it.

1397
01:42:47,948 --> 01:42:48,269
Yeah.

1398
01:42:48,309 --> 01:42:48,449
Yeah.

1399
01:42:54,282 --> 01:43:23,130
No, and I believe the mayor already has a list of action statements that she wants to implement his first trainings and discussions but like I said we have a grassroots advocacy grant going forward that's going to highlight this and some trainings and on anti racism and just some awareness that, you know, we as a white privilege so don't have a clue on what some of the issues are out there and I think we need to learn.

1400
01:43:23,837 --> 01:43:33,884
So that's what we're looking at, but I do believe that the mayor already has some action steps as far as policy changes and, and things that she's looking at.

1401
01:43:33,904 --> 01:43:39,428
Yeah, there has to be action behind this we, we just can't say this and not doing anything else.

1402
01:43:41,389 --> 01:43:53,398
In terms of these action plans that the mayor is working on, I'm assuming that some of them are going to require council involvement somewhere along the line, whether it be in terms of passing policy or appropriating funding.

1403
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,781
I would assume Yeah, absolutely.

1404
01:43:56,842 --> 01:44:07,871
So do you think it might warrant the conversation of us sitting down with the mayor and your office to discuss you know what, what we're really let's put some teeth into this thing if we're going to do it, you know what I mean?

1405
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:11,694
symbolic gesture tonight, but you know, I'm, I'm not big on symbolic stuff.

1406
01:44:11,734 --> 01:44:13,075
I'm more of an action type of guy.

1407
01:44:13,835 --> 01:44:20,921
You know, when it comes down to business, do you think that maybe it would make sense for us to sit down with you and the mayor, the mayor is going to make this declaration already.

1408
01:44:21,915 --> 01:44:31,524
Wouldn't it make sense for us all to sit down and kind of craft the declaration and the next steps that would be, you know, suitable and enjoyable for all of us to participate in.

1409
01:44:32,304 --> 01:44:46,157
Sure, I mean, obviously I think there are action steps that that can like there are some that can be some low hanging fruit, I guess you'd call it that we can be looking at as far as policy and changes go but there's some also some obviously some long term deep.

1410
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:58,566
conversations and things that need to happen and and yeah that that that would be between you and the mayor and my office would certainly be happy to support and and coordinate, but yeah.

1411
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,628
Do you think that that would be the best course of action.

1412
01:45:02,349 --> 01:45:03,109
Yep.

1413
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:06,191
We need to get the conversations going.

1414
01:45:06,432 --> 01:45:06,872
Absolutely.

1415
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:07,272
Sure.

1416
01:45:07,773 --> 01:45:08,033
Yeah.

1417
01:45:08,313 --> 01:45:15,238
Now, June 17 is some sort of meeting I believe that scheduled surround certain parts of this discussion.

1418
01:45:18,175 --> 01:45:19,075
I don't know.

1419
01:45:19,475 --> 01:45:25,119
I'm not sure which was not sure.

1420
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:32,605
I think the mayor said a little bit of a coven mind right now so

1421
01:45:36,135 --> 01:45:37,756
I can't find it presently in my email.

1422
01:45:38,616 --> 01:45:41,858
So I guess the question is, is that the suggested course of action?

1423
01:45:41,898 --> 01:45:52,463
Do we sit down, meet with the Board of Health, meet with the mayor, the mayor is going to make the declaration, we can join her in putting out a joint statement and actually crafting some next steps and action items?

1424
01:45:52,964 --> 01:45:57,686
Or do we want to make a symbolic statement and move on to the next speech?

1425
01:45:58,486 --> 01:45:59,287
No, of course.

1426
01:45:59,407 --> 01:46:00,447
No, of course.

1427
01:46:02,192 --> 01:46:11,797
I think that would be the best course of action as far as all to sit down and talk about next steps, and putting some meat and some action behind behind these words, for sure.

1428
01:46:12,998 --> 01:46:13,638
Sounds good to me.

1429
01:46:13,838 --> 01:46:15,519
I think that that's a great suggestion myself.

1430
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,440
Mr President, I rest my case.

1431
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:19,161
Thank you very much.

1432
01:46:19,181 --> 01:46:19,441
Thank you.

1433
01:46:19,501 --> 01:46:20,262
I believe.

1434
01:46:21,162 --> 01:46:22,443
Did you want to comment on this.

1435
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:39,246
Just to just to highlight the meeting on the 17th is the Human Rights Commission meeting that's going to focus on these issues designed to be the beginning of the community conversation surrounding some, allow the community to express their opinion, their feelings, their frustrations, and start working towards some community solutions to these issues.

1436
01:46:40,367 --> 01:46:40,687
Thank you.

1437
01:46:41,668 --> 01:46:43,890
Let's see, we have Councilor Behrs and Councilor Scott.

1438
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:44,851
Kelly, Councilor Behrs.

1439
01:46:45,652 --> 01:46:46,553
Thank you, Mr. President.

1440
01:46:47,455 --> 01:46:54,758
Yeah, I mean, the intent here and the intent of the next motion is that the 14 white people who are in elected office might not have the best answers to these questions.

1441
01:46:56,179 --> 01:47:01,401
And I don't think that we should just go ahead and say, we can solve racism.

1442
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:04,402
We don't experience it.

1443
01:47:05,483 --> 01:47:10,485
So I think the intent of this is to say, this is a crisis, this is an emergency.

1444
01:47:10,785 --> 01:47:13,066
We need to take action, as Councilor Morrell and I said,

1445
01:47:14,767 --> 01:47:16,407
You know, this is a starting point.

1446
01:47:16,447 --> 01:47:30,910
This is a statement of values and we have to live up to those values through action I could put ten things on the agenda tonight But I think I want to hear from black residents and residents of color about what they want to do moving forward And and residents of the community.

1447
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:41,472
I think we have to have an open process and open conversation and I don't think That us coming up with ideas in a room is necessarily the best way to do that.

1448
01:47:41,492 --> 01:47:41,852
So I

1449
01:47:42,605 --> 01:48:10,293
That's the intent of this and the intent of the following motion is to bring the public in because at the end of the day, a lot of this is about how we all live our lives and us saying something and us putting something out, we can get to a lot of problems, but the biggest thing we need to do is do the education and do the conversation and have that community process so that we can, how many people

1450
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:15,121
saw things or heard things in the past week that they never thought were happening in this city.

1451
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:20,626
Because I know 15 who texted me about it, and I'm sure that there's many more.

1452
01:48:21,467 --> 01:48:24,009
The intent here is this is a statement of our values.

1453
01:48:24,249 --> 01:48:25,511
We're taking this seriously.

1454
01:48:25,811 --> 01:48:26,932
We're going to take action.

1455
01:48:26,952 --> 01:48:28,813
So that's the intent of this.

1456
01:48:28,994 --> 01:48:32,717
And I think we have to involve the community as openly and widely as possible to do that.

1457
01:48:32,937 --> 01:48:33,618
So thank you.

1458
01:48:37,571 --> 01:48:40,300
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the time.

1459
01:48:44,783 --> 01:49:08,482
question a resolution that It could be looked deeper and it could also be looked at by the public as just lip service so I think that I said I had a statement that that I too feel the murder of George Floyd is an incomprehensible horror that has occurred in our country I'm beyond saddened by the current state of the Union as a father husband son brother and more importantly a human being and

1460
01:49:09,265 --> 01:49:14,427
It is unfathomable that yet again is discriminatory murders act has occurred.

1461
01:49:15,727 --> 01:49:17,027
How are we here yet again?

1462
01:49:17,748 --> 01:49:21,749
We need to have what needs to happen for the census acts of violence to stop.

1463
01:49:22,469 --> 01:49:26,890
We're being ripped apart by this nation and controversies.

1464
01:49:28,991 --> 01:49:34,753
These situations remind us that as a privileged white male, I need to first of all acknowledge that

1465
01:49:35,795 --> 01:49:36,395
my privilege.

1466
01:49:36,675 --> 01:49:45,598
Secondly, I need to be responsible for how I lead my life and model beliefs and behaviors that support the values of all people, that we're all created equal.

1467
01:49:46,878 --> 01:49:48,819
So questions come about.

1468
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:50,759
It matters how we treat each other.

1469
01:49:51,339 --> 01:49:55,120
It matters that we teach our children what we teach our children.

1470
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,641
It matters the words we use.

1471
01:49:57,181 --> 01:49:58,681
It matters what actions we take.

1472
01:49:59,362 --> 01:50:03,663
It matters what choices we make now that will actually create a better future.

1473
01:50:04,642 --> 01:50:06,122
And yes, black lives do matter.

1474
01:50:07,143 --> 01:50:10,464
In Medford, we need to see some change.

1475
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:12,164
We've heard that.

1476
01:50:13,084 --> 01:50:33,890
And as we talk and bring this resolution forward, we realize that as we listen to young men and women that I've coached and taught, and they express their concerns of racism and inequalities, it opens your eyes.

1477
01:50:36,481 --> 01:50:43,273
I love the city of Medford and I'm heartbroken that we have our residents continually traumatized and hurt by ignorance.

1478
01:50:44,613 --> 01:51:07,370
But I'm also wanna make sure that we as a community learn to work together and make sure that we're in this, in looking some of these emails that we're getting a device of in splitting our community where, you know, the whole defunding of the police department and looking at what the budget looks like in the police department.

1479
01:51:09,968 --> 01:51:10,908
I've talked to the chief.

1480
01:51:11,228 --> 01:51:13,509
I know we have to look at change.

1481
01:51:14,049 --> 01:51:22,272
We need to address the way that our police officers might need more professional development when it comes to conflict resolution.

1482
01:51:22,873 --> 01:51:35,317
I understand we have concerns with how our police officers are being hired, but I think that as we move forward, like Councilor Knight said, I think we need more action.

1483
01:51:36,516 --> 01:51:52,545
I think that with the mayor's leadership that we need to start a forum with members in our community, a black community that can come out and tell us, as my former students have come and talked to me about and shared those concerns.

1484
01:51:54,226 --> 01:52:04,832
Now, great, like Councilor Beall says, yep, here's all the white people talking to 14 privileged white people that are in power here at our political level.

1485
01:52:06,777 --> 01:52:08,658
but I don't see one person of color here.

1486
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:18,464
I've got a form letter from people that have concerns.

1487
01:52:19,945 --> 01:52:29,131
A statement like this, I appreciate it, and I can understand that Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beals want to go forward with this.

1488
01:52:30,186 --> 01:52:36,407
But as I talk to my colleagues in Somerville, there is substance behind what they're going to do.

1489
01:52:37,328 --> 01:52:43,469
So it's great to send out a statement and talk about this horror and talk about the change.

1490
01:52:45,129 --> 01:52:54,411
When you sit with a young black man and a young black woman, they tell you that they're afraid sometimes to leave their house if they're gonna come home.

1491
01:52:56,492 --> 01:52:57,872
And that's an awful way to think.

1492
01:52:58,853 --> 01:53:02,156
But what I think we need more than ever right now is the action.

1493
01:53:03,377 --> 01:53:25,615
I think that we should immediately form a community advisory group with our city administrators, our police department, our superintendent, our black leaders in our community, so they can lead us to what is actually wrong.

1494
01:53:27,016 --> 01:53:28,257
I have two young children

1495
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:37,094
that opened up a lot of dialogue, but we need to start moving forward with a discussion, not with just a statement.

1496
01:53:38,294 --> 01:53:43,556
So I thank you for hearing me and hopefully we see some movement.

1497
01:53:43,897 --> 01:53:44,257
Thank you.

1498
01:53:46,017 --> 01:53:46,958
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

1499
01:53:47,138 --> 01:53:50,459
Let's see, we have a number of people with their hands up.

1500
01:53:51,079 --> 01:53:54,681
At this point, I'll recognize, we'll get to everyone.

1501
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:57,502
So let's see, Christia Vina.

1502
01:53:58,775 --> 01:54:00,296
Name and address for the record, please.

1503
01:54:03,016 --> 01:54:04,457
Thank you, Mr. President.

1504
01:54:05,177 --> 01:54:08,838
Christie Avino, 24 Carberry Street in Medford, Massachusetts.

1505
01:54:09,319 --> 01:54:16,481
Thank you so much, Councilor Behrs, for your very thoughtful and your forthright

1506
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:21,735
that you've taken by submitting this resolution to the Medford City Council.

1507
01:54:22,076 --> 01:54:33,488
Thank you, Councilor Morrell, for putting together such clear authority supporting that, yes, systemic racism is a public health emergency.

1508
01:54:33,928 --> 01:54:47,674
in our country, not just with respect to police violence, but also with respect to healthcare, access to health treatment and many other quality of life indicators.

1509
01:54:48,154 --> 01:55:03,060
I think as I look at our city council composed of entirely what appears to me white individuals, it's clear that more work needs to be done within our city to elevate people of color,

1510
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:17,405
um to representation, but that is not where we are today, and I think it's incumbent upon this council to look at this groundswell that is happening across this country.

1511
01:55:18,266 --> 01:55:24,268
People protesting in the middle of a pandemic because they are in fear of their lives.

1512
01:55:24,488 --> 01:55:26,709
They are in fear for their children's lives.

1513
01:55:27,069 --> 01:55:29,050
They're in fear for their parents' lives.

1514
01:55:30,157 --> 01:55:49,487
And I think if Medford chooses not to come forward with so many other cities, towns, states, medical organizations, for example, nurses organizations across the country are coming forward and supporting resolutions like Councilor Behrs.

1515
01:55:49,847 --> 01:55:54,109
I think if this council chooses not to do it, we are saying we are afraid

1516
01:55:54,851 --> 01:55:57,854
and we are on the wrong side of history.

1517
01:55:58,194 --> 01:56:04,881
The time is now to step up and say, yes, we are committed to working with our black brothers and sisters.

1518
01:56:05,261 --> 01:56:19,375
We are committed to working with the African-American community that has sustained the city of Medford for so long, but not seen representation at the state, at the city level or the state level.

1519
01:56:19,935 --> 01:56:26,420
we are committed by issuing this statement to saying, yes, we see you, we recognize you.

1520
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:42,431
A statement issued at the beginning of a city council meeting doesn't do it, but passing a formal resolution saying, yes, we are willing to get to work, we are willing to put together forms, we're willing to sit down with a mayor, yes, the action items will come.

1521
01:56:42,591 --> 01:56:48,215
But right now today, when so many people, people of all color, white people,

1522
01:56:48,957 --> 01:57:08,841
across this country are in so much pain from the decades and really centuries of violence against people of color in the United States, the time is now to step forward and say, yes, we recognize that systemic racism must be dismantled in many ways, but it is, first of all, a public health emergency.

1523
01:57:09,294 --> 01:57:29,387
And I urge all councilors to listen carefully to the statistics that Councilor Morrell has provided and really listen to the voices of people, not only across the country, but here in Medford, asking our elected officials to stand up with us and stand with us.

1524
01:57:29,967 --> 01:57:30,648
The time is now.

1525
01:57:30,868 --> 01:57:31,568
Thank you very much.

1526
01:57:33,349 --> 01:57:34,130
Thank you, Christy.

1527
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:36,091
Let's see, we have...

1528
01:57:38,667 --> 01:57:39,308
Natalie Hill.

1529
01:57:40,008 --> 01:57:41,349
Name and address for the record, please.

1530
01:57:43,491 --> 01:57:44,432
I already spoke.

1531
01:57:44,492 --> 01:57:45,092
I apologize.

1532
01:57:45,132 --> 01:57:45,733
I'll be brief.

1533
01:57:46,173 --> 01:57:53,740
But I forgot to mention one of the action items that I think folks should address is the mural that is in the post office on Forest Street.

1534
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,022
I know there was a petition in 2018 to address this mural.

1535
01:57:56,362 --> 01:57:56,522
It is

1536
01:58:01,726 --> 01:58:09,750
I can understand why this hasn't been taken down at this point in time, but it really should be addressed and it's a clear action item that can be taken.

1537
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:14,552
Again, I'm Natalie Hill, 15 Madison Street, Medford.

1538
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,693
Thank you very much.

1539
01:58:17,713 --> 01:58:19,314
Councilor Scarapelli, did you want to speak on that?

1540
01:58:19,654 --> 01:58:25,017
Yeah, I know for the last week, I appreciate everybody's comments and I'm open-minded, but at the same time,

1541
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:28,579
A statement is a statement.

1542
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:49,205
What I want to make sure that we do, I'm going to make the motion that we refer for a meeting immediately with the Board of Health, the mayor, the police chief, the diversity director, and our school superintendent to address items immediately.

1543
01:58:51,584 --> 01:58:54,746
I'm going to put my money where my mouth is, and we need to go move forward with this.

1544
01:58:54,766 --> 01:59:02,672
So I call for my president and our school city council to move that motion, to vote on that motion, and get the conversation started.

1545
01:59:03,172 --> 01:59:06,455
Not what Somerville put out and what other communities are putting out.

1546
01:59:06,715 --> 01:59:15,521
Let's do what Medford needs to do to make sure that we are protecting our friends of color and that have been hit with this racial injustice.

1547
01:59:15,561 --> 01:59:17,002
I think we need to move forward with that.

1548
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:18,143
Thank you, Mr. President.

1549
01:59:20,727 --> 01:59:23,228
Councilor Scarpelli, if I may, I just want to make sure.

1550
01:59:23,288 --> 01:59:30,350
So that is, if I'm correct, that is an amendment to the main resolution offered by Councilor Beza and Councilor Morrell.

1551
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:35,112
Could you please just confirm that you have the wording of Councilor Scarpelli?

1552
01:59:36,312 --> 01:59:36,893
The motion.

1553
01:59:36,953 --> 01:59:38,533
Yes, I have the wording.

1554
01:59:38,573 --> 01:59:40,874
If you'd like me to read it back, it's an amendment.

1555
01:59:40,894 --> 01:59:41,834
It's a motion.

1556
01:59:42,174 --> 01:59:43,255
I'm sorry, it's a motion.

1557
01:59:45,615 --> 01:59:46,736
Do you want it as part of the main motion?

1558
01:59:46,756 --> 01:59:48,616
Do you want it amended to the main paper, or do you want it as a B paper?

1559
01:59:48,657 --> 01:59:49,897
I want it as a B paper.

1560
01:59:50,519 --> 01:59:51,440
Okay, it's a B paper, okay.

1561
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,781
The motion on the main paper.

1562
01:59:53,282 --> 01:59:56,024
Right.

1563
01:59:56,044 --> 01:59:56,565
B paper too.

1564
01:59:56,585 --> 01:59:57,626
The motion on the main paper.

1565
01:59:57,806 --> 02:00:00,008
Is it a B paper or is it a motion on the main paper?

1566
02:00:00,428 --> 02:00:01,509
It's a B paper.

1567
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:04,312
Offered by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1568
02:00:06,538 --> 02:00:16,350
I mean, I'm still not clear whether Councilor Scarpelli is moving to approve the paper with this condition on it or whether it's a B paper to the main paper.

1569
02:00:16,411 --> 02:00:17,232
No, it's a B paper.

1570
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:18,593
I'm not moving to accept this.

1571
02:00:19,014 --> 02:00:22,298
What I'm hearing from everybody is that we need action.

1572
02:00:23,114 --> 02:00:23,955
So I agree.

1573
02:00:24,315 --> 02:00:44,290
So my motion isn't to, um, it's to move forward to get the board of health, the, uh, the mayor's office, the police chief, the diversity director, the superintendent of schools to immediately meet with the suit, with the, with the method city council to start a process by bringing people of color to the table.

1574
02:00:45,415 --> 02:00:50,738
working with them to make sure that we move to a positive resolution.

1575
02:00:50,998 --> 02:00:55,761
And this isn't going to take, this isn't going to be a one week issue.

1576
02:00:56,081 --> 02:01:03,746
This is something that we need to find a way to work both budgetary and socially to move this forward.

1577
02:01:03,806 --> 02:01:05,747
So thank you, Mr. Clark.

1578
02:01:06,867 --> 02:01:07,168
Thank you.

1579
02:01:07,188 --> 02:01:08,028
I hope you got that.

1580
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:10,530
I got it.

1581
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:11,230
Thank you.

1582
02:01:14,492 --> 02:01:14,632
Okay.

1583
02:01:15,228 --> 02:01:20,832
Let's see, we had a, I'm sorry, Vice President Carviello, did you have your hand up?

1584
02:01:21,113 --> 02:01:22,494
I did, Mr. President, I wanted to thank you.

1585
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:32,981
And I want to thank all my colleagues for the great suggestions, especially Councilor Scott Pelley saying that we're BEDFED and we should do what's good for our community, not what's good for other communities.

1586
02:01:33,262 --> 02:01:35,904
Mr. President, I've been, I've lived in this community my whole life.

1587
02:01:35,964 --> 02:01:40,067
I'm a graduate at Meppet High School, similar to what many of these other people are.

1588
02:01:40,587 --> 02:01:44,450
And I'm a, I'm a probably a 30 year volunteer in this community.

1589
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:51,172
Long before I ran for city council, I was involved with this community doing many, many things.

1590
02:01:51,192 --> 02:01:52,853
So I work from action.

1591
02:01:52,913 --> 02:01:56,695
I don't work from statements or pieces of paper.

1592
02:01:57,535 --> 02:02:01,776
I let my actions and leadership lead the way in what I do and what I have been.

1593
02:02:02,077 --> 02:02:10,580
You know, when I first ran for office 10 years ago, one of the people who schooled me pretty well was the late Wally Counts.

1594
02:02:11,659 --> 02:02:32,035
And Wally Counts took me into his house, two hours, one night, and really explained to me the things that it took to be a counselor in the city of Medford, and how he had supported other people for counsel, and they didn't live up to his expectations over what they should do for the African-American community.

1595
02:02:32,295 --> 02:02:34,217
And I made a commitment to Wally Counts that night

1596
02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:40,740
that I will continue to support everyone in our African-American community and I still continue to do so to this day.

1597
02:02:41,181 --> 02:02:50,846
So Mr. President, I lead with my actions and I'm a leader in this community and I'll continue to be a leader in the African-American community going forward.

1598
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,668
Thank you Councilor, Vice President Carvillo.

1599
02:02:55,448 --> 02:02:56,989
Daniel Faluca.

1600
02:03:00,335 --> 02:03:01,096
Hi, thank you.

1601
02:03:01,116 --> 02:03:06,762
I'm not too familiar with city government, so this is a great learning experience for me.

1602
02:03:06,802 --> 02:03:10,026
But like Natalie, I'm also a social worker.

1603
02:03:10,266 --> 02:03:11,988
Danielle, and I apologize to interrupt.

1604
02:03:12,228 --> 02:03:15,332
The first thing we need to do is if you could just give us your name and address for the record.

1605
02:03:15,812 --> 02:03:18,856
The club records that and then you can speak.

1606
02:03:18,996 --> 02:03:19,437
I'm sorry.

1607
02:03:19,617 --> 02:03:20,098
Sorry about that.

1608
02:03:20,498 --> 02:03:24,043
Danielle Blanca, 17 Wilson Street in Medford.

1609
02:03:24,703 --> 02:03:27,006
So I want to echo Natalie.

1610
02:03:27,026 --> 02:03:31,292
I'm also a social worker in the community and I've been having a lot of conversations with clients about

1611
02:03:31,872 --> 02:03:34,653
their safety, especially black people right now.

1612
02:03:35,253 --> 02:03:45,096
And I think your responsibility as our city council members is to make yourself accessible and to out yourselves as people who honor and respect black lives.

1613
02:03:46,577 --> 02:03:53,719
Many of you are noticing your privilege right now, and don't forget that our black community members and their ancestors have always known about our privilege.

1614
02:03:54,539 --> 02:03:59,281
And I think what you're deciding around declaration versus action steps,

1615
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:05,264
I think it sounds like you're deciding that people of color don't need to hear about your immediate support.

1616
02:04:05,864 --> 02:04:12,789
And so Mr. Scarapelli, he described the murder of George Floyd as incomprehensible.

1617
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:18,994
And I just wanna put it out there that if that's not incomprehensible for our black community members, it happens all the time.

1618
02:04:20,616 --> 02:04:22,557
And just to- Point of information.

1619
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:25,319
Point of information, Mr. President.

1620
02:04:25,359 --> 02:04:26,981
One minute, please.

1621
02:04:27,361 --> 02:04:28,442
So, okay, so- Almost done.

1622
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:34,773
the the imprehensible is that someone was was tragically killed.

1623
02:04:35,854 --> 02:04:37,535
So that's what's imprehensible.

1624
02:04:37,555 --> 02:04:48,662
And then the idea of, if you can repeat the comment that you made before, because I thought I misheard you speak, that we're not

1625
02:04:51,828 --> 02:05:00,731
So yeah, so I was just gonna bring up the point that I think what it sounds like what you guys are saying is you're deciding between a declaration or action steps.

1626
02:05:00,752 --> 02:05:03,333
And I think it doesn't have to be an either or, but it can be a yes and.

1627
02:05:03,733 --> 02:05:11,076
I think like putting a declaration out to the community, letting them know that you stand with black people is really important.

1628
02:05:11,436 --> 02:05:18,538
And that's a way to activate the community, get black community members involved in the work that you're gonna continue to do.

1629
02:05:18,638 --> 02:05:19,739
One information, Mr. President.

1630
02:05:21,045 --> 02:05:22,566
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1631
02:05:23,026 --> 02:05:24,227
I think my words are clear.

1632
02:05:24,607 --> 02:05:26,848
I think that my record speaks for itself.

1633
02:05:27,488 --> 02:05:33,011
I think that making a motion just to make a motion, as other communities did, I want to go further beyond that.

1634
02:05:33,311 --> 02:05:40,135
So I think it's more important, yes, that we make that motion to meet with all the representatives to get this forward.

1635
02:05:41,215 --> 02:05:42,556
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1636
02:05:43,336 --> 02:05:48,299
We have Councilor Beers, Councilor Morrell, Councilor Marks, Councilor Beers.

1637
02:05:48,859 --> 02:05:50,220
Point of information, Mr. President.

1638
02:05:50,855 --> 02:05:52,196
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1639
02:05:52,236 --> 02:05:52,816
Councilor Marks.

1640
02:05:53,617 --> 02:05:58,819
I just want to state because, you know, I'm actually here tonight to listen more than I do speak.

1641
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:05,823
But I think this is far too important of an issue to not attack it on many fronts.

1642
02:06:06,524 --> 02:06:08,785
So I'm not opposed to putting out a statement.

1643
02:06:09,285 --> 02:06:15,308
I'm not opposed to getting together, as Councilor Scott Pelley said, in trying to move issue items forward.

1644
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:18,050
I think we have to attack this head on, Mr. President.

1645
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:25,271
As we heard, this systemic racism has existed for decades.

1646
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:28,972
So don't believe for one second we can take one approach to solve this.

1647
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,833
We have to take many different approaches, Mr. President.

1648
02:06:32,213 --> 02:06:35,613
And I, as one member of the council, am willing to do that, Mr. President.

1649
02:06:35,653 --> 02:06:39,854
So tonight, because I'm not saying a lot, I wanted to listen, Mr. President.

1650
02:06:39,914 --> 02:06:42,254
I think it's important to listen to the community.

1651
02:06:42,695 --> 02:06:44,635
I attended the rally, Mr. President.

1652
02:06:45,035 --> 02:06:49,577
And as my council colleagues state, I realize there's a lot of anger out there.

1653
02:06:50,037 --> 02:06:53,038
But you have to remember, I represent this whole city.

1654
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:57,480
When someone reaches out to me with a concern, I don't ask them what their ethnicity is.

1655
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,221
I don't ask them what their religion is.

1656
02:06:59,641 --> 02:07:01,362
I help everyone, Mr. President.

1657
02:07:01,722 --> 02:07:15,958
So I would hope that members of the general public realize that we're here to assist, we're here to help, and I don't think there's anyone behind the reel, the seven of us, that don't want to see change in this community, Mr. President.

1658
02:07:16,553 --> 02:07:19,434
And I, for one, agree with my colleagues.

1659
02:07:20,134 --> 02:07:21,254
I like to see action.

1660
02:07:21,815 --> 02:07:23,355
And I'm not saying a statement's not bad.

1661
02:07:23,475 --> 02:07:26,996
I agree with the statement that was made by both Counselor Beers and Morrell.

1662
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:27,836
I agree with that.

1663
02:07:28,357 --> 02:07:29,997
But I also like to see action.

1664
02:07:30,397 --> 02:07:33,298
I want to see action happen in this community, Mr. President.

1665
02:07:33,798 --> 02:07:38,560
You know, this is a long point of information, but I'll wait, Mr. President.

1666
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:45,742
But I did want to mention, because I'd say 90% of the emails I got were relative to defunding the police department.

1667
02:07:46,453 --> 02:07:54,917
And I think at some point, no one wants to talk about it, but at some point that discussion needs to be had, Mr. President, because I've talked to members of the general public.

1668
02:07:55,237 --> 02:07:56,958
I've talked to members of the police department.

1669
02:07:57,438 --> 02:08:09,924
And I, you know, in my opinion, I think the general public and the police department share a lot of common concerns and a lot of issues that I hear people raise about maybe the police department has too much on their plate.

1670
02:08:10,345 --> 02:08:13,266
Maybe the police department shouldn't be domestic violence specialists.

1671
02:08:13,586 --> 02:08:15,087
Maybe they shouldn't be drug counselors.

1672
02:08:15,387 --> 02:08:18,239
Maybe they should be mental health counselors, social workers.

1673
02:08:18,927 --> 02:08:24,229
Um, and those are the issues I think, you know, that we can have common ground and say, you know what?

1674
02:08:24,669 --> 02:08:32,551
Maybe we have to look at funding stuff outside of the police budget to assist with issues, Mr. President, that we're hearing.

1675
02:08:32,851 --> 02:08:34,491
I think there's a lot of common ground.

1676
02:08:34,651 --> 02:08:35,272
I really do.

1677
02:08:35,812 --> 02:08:39,273
But I don't want to get bogged down in the weeds of us against them.

1678
02:08:39,353 --> 02:08:43,134
And, you know, I, you know, I ran for office to help Mr. President.

1679
02:08:43,774 --> 02:08:45,834
And if people see otherwise, so be it.

1680
02:08:45,874 --> 02:08:47,175
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

1681
02:08:47,947 --> 02:08:50,549
But I think all of us have the same intent, Mr. President.

1682
02:08:50,809 --> 02:08:52,110
We want to move this forward.

1683
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:59,555
And I think getting back and forth with semantics and so forth, I think it doesn't do the conversation just, Mr. President.

1684
02:08:59,595 --> 02:09:02,197
So I just want to add that, Mr. President.

1685
02:09:02,758 --> 02:09:03,918
I'm here for the long run.

1686
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:06,340
I'm here to assist and help out.

1687
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,501
But I'm also here to listen.

1688
02:09:08,221 --> 02:09:10,343
God gave me two ears and one mouth for a reason.

1689
02:09:10,623 --> 02:09:12,665
Do twice as much listening, Mr. President.

1690
02:09:13,725 --> 02:09:14,366
You are correct.

1691
02:09:14,466 --> 02:09:15,527
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1692
02:09:19,128 --> 02:09:23,931
Councilor Beers, Councilor Morrell, we have a number of members of the public that would like to speak on this.

1693
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:28,234
And I know you've been speaking numerous times, but I'll recognize Councilor Beers.

1694
02:09:30,075 --> 02:09:30,936
Thank you, Mr. President.

1695
02:09:30,996 --> 02:09:39,061
And I mean, I don't know how I could have made it any clearer that this is a starting point for the action that we're talking about, that this is a beginning.

1696
02:09:39,121 --> 02:09:41,923
This is not even a beginning, a continuation and a recognition.

1697
02:09:41,943 --> 02:09:46,086
And just to the point, this is action.

1698
02:09:46,446 --> 02:09:48,247
This is an action that we are being

1699
02:09:49,171 --> 02:09:52,993
Asked to take by the black and latino elected officials of this commonwealth.

1700
02:09:53,313 --> 02:09:59,357
They said Municipalities, this is one of the actions we want you to take and it's not about somerville.

1701
02:09:59,397 --> 02:10:07,882
It's not about anything else This is about the fact that black and latino elected officials across the state have said we want communities to do this And i'm listening to them.

1702
02:10:08,162 --> 02:10:16,627
So that's why this is on the agenda And that's why I put it forward i'm listening to them And I want the next item is about a forum so that we can listen to people in this community

1703
02:10:17,168 --> 02:10:19,489
and get to the agreement and make these changes.

1704
02:10:19,829 --> 02:10:20,930
That's what I'm talking about.

1705
02:10:21,410 --> 02:10:22,811
That's what the intention is.

1706
02:10:24,171 --> 02:10:33,095
All else I wanted to say is I'm so grateful for all of the people who showed up tonight, all the people who spoke, and I likely won't speak again on this topic, but who knows.

1707
02:10:33,115 --> 02:10:35,557
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1708
02:10:35,577 --> 02:10:36,177
Councilor Morrell.

1709
02:10:37,017 --> 02:10:37,758
Thank you, Mr. President.

1710
02:10:37,778 --> 02:10:39,018
Yeah, and I will just be brief.

1711
02:10:39,538 --> 02:10:41,299
I just want to echo what Councilor Behrs was saying.

1712
02:10:41,339 --> 02:10:42,440
This is a starting point.

1713
02:10:43,982 --> 02:10:49,806
It feels silly to say naming the problem because this is something that has existed since the beginning of our country.

1714
02:10:50,306 --> 02:10:56,992
And as Marianne O'Connor said, this is a known issue, but it's naming it and it's starting these conversations.

1715
02:10:57,032 --> 02:11:02,216
And absolutely, as I said, when I introduced this, this is not the work.

1716
02:11:02,656 --> 02:11:03,917
The work starts from here.

1717
02:11:04,237 --> 02:11:06,599
This is naming where we have to go from here.

1718
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:12,804
And again, as Councilor Behr said, this is responding to a direct call from the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus

1719
02:11:13,365 --> 02:11:16,928
I'm encouraging us to do this, to do this action.

1720
02:11:17,008 --> 02:11:18,870
This is one of the many actions they're encouraging.

1721
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:21,472
So I'm trying to listen to those voices and move off that.

1722
02:11:21,973 --> 02:11:23,974
And I want to, I'll stop talking as well.

1723
02:11:24,014 --> 02:11:25,536
I want to give time for people to talk.

1724
02:11:25,596 --> 02:11:25,956
Thank you.

1725
02:11:27,017 --> 02:11:28,118
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1726
02:11:28,378 --> 02:11:31,681
We have a number of residents that want to speak that have been waiting patiently.

1727
02:11:31,701 --> 02:11:39,107
So I want to, let's see if we could go to Rebecca Schmielen.

1728
02:11:40,116 --> 02:11:41,641
I apologize if I have that incorrect.

1729
02:11:41,681 --> 02:11:43,787
If you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.

1730
02:11:44,858 --> 02:11:46,859
Yeah, that was a pretty good pronunciation.

1731
02:11:46,879 --> 02:11:51,440
So I'm at 206 Salem Street here in Medford.

1732
02:11:51,961 --> 02:11:58,983
And I just really, a lot of the things I wanted to say were already said by some really eloquent, least spoken people.

1733
02:11:59,343 --> 02:12:04,985
I wanna echo what Danielle was saying that I don't think you have to choose between words and actions.

1734
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:12,768
And as a white person myself, I think the past few weeks I've been dealing with kind of my own privilege and realizing that

1735
02:12:13,288 --> 02:12:19,791
While it's great to say that your actions speak for themselves, sometimes we need to say the words and do the actions.

1736
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:33,437
So, just hearing a lot of community members in the past few weeks arguing on social media about, you know, All Lives Matter versus Black Lives Matter, I think it's really important that as a body that represents

1737
02:12:34,397 --> 02:12:39,799
this community, we're saying it out loud that this is a problem that we need to address.

1738
02:12:40,019 --> 02:12:46,501
And I do want to just kind of echo what Councilman Scarpelli was saying about bringing in the community.

1739
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:55,123
I think, you know, there's probably a reason why all of the council members and from what I can tell, most of the people speaking tonight are white.

1740
02:12:55,723 --> 02:12:59,785
I just want to say thank you to the council for putting forward this resolution.

1741
02:13:00,165 --> 02:13:07,708
What can we do as a council to bring people to feel more comfortable speaking and listening and participating with the rest of the community.

1742
02:13:07,929 --> 02:13:11,590
I don't want to say a grand speech either.

1743
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:13,531
I want to let other people have their time.

1744
02:13:14,251 --> 02:13:18,493
Thank you to the council people who have put this

1745
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:25,410
Thanks.

1746
02:13:26,352 --> 02:13:27,032
Thank you, Rebecca.

1747
02:13:30,677 --> 02:13:36,245
We have Divya Anand.

1748
02:13:37,166 --> 02:13:38,869
Please have your name and address for the record, please.

1749
02:13:40,569 --> 02:13:44,390
Divya Anand, 122 Park Street, Medford, Unit 2.

1750
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:51,072
I heard a lot of the city councilors speak and also members of the public speak.

1751
02:13:51,232 --> 02:14:04,015
And one, a few things that stood out to me was, you know, where as a person of color, we would be invited to the table and we don't wanna be invited to the table.

1752
02:14:04,095 --> 02:14:05,195
We want you to listen.

1753
02:14:06,476 --> 02:14:10,778
And there was someone who said that we would be allowed and I object to that term.

1754
02:14:10,798 --> 02:14:14,461
I have been in that city council.

1755
02:14:14,541 --> 02:14:17,983
I have tried to speak up in the past and I've had horrible experiences.

1756
02:14:18,523 --> 02:14:34,512
So I hope there are a few moments of reflection on how comfortable or how safe city council spaces or city administration spaces are for people of color to even show up and speak up.

1757
02:14:39,924 --> 02:14:45,989
And I heard about the community advisory board, and I also want to throw in, like, in that advisory board, who has power?

1758
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:52,374
And also, please note that all people of color, all black people are not a monolith.

1759
02:14:55,076 --> 02:14:56,758
We have differences of opinion.

1760
02:14:57,018 --> 02:14:58,479
There's diversity among us.

1761
02:15:00,861 --> 02:15:03,423
So I just wanted to throw in that as well.

1762
02:15:03,504 --> 02:15:03,924
Thank you.

1763
02:15:04,604 --> 02:15:05,065
Thank you.

1764
02:15:15,049 --> 02:15:16,070
Melanie McLaughlin.

1765
02:15:17,473 --> 02:15:18,354
Name and address.

1766
02:15:24,565 --> 02:15:25,747
Melanie, I'm trying to unmute you.

1767
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:37,009
Okay, Melanie, you're on.

1768
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:40,130
Hi, Council President Falco.

1769
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:43,151
I was just saying it's Melanie McLaughlin, 152 Alston.

1770
02:15:45,112 --> 02:15:49,373
Hi, Council President Falco.

1771
02:15:50,053 --> 02:15:52,934
Just saying that it's Melanie McLaughlin, 152 Alston Street.

1772
02:15:53,034 --> 02:15:58,757
And since I've spoken earlier, I will defer if there are other people with their hands raised until the end.

1773
02:15:58,777 --> 02:16:01,417
I think you wanted a lot.

1774
02:16:01,437 --> 02:16:02,618
Are there other people with their hands?

1775
02:16:03,753 --> 02:16:07,775
I just wanted to echo a lot of work as a woman, a white woman of privilege as well, and

1776
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:21,254
I want to echo the other folks who are thanking Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell.

1777
02:16:21,274 --> 02:16:29,902
I thought Councilor Behrs' statement was incredibly articulate and right on the money for everything that I've been hearing and listening to among the community.

1778
02:16:30,022 --> 02:16:33,725
I agree with many of the folks who are saying we need to listen and not talk.

1779
02:16:33,785 --> 02:16:43,434
And I especially agree with our previous speaker, Divya Anand, who talked about safe spaces for people of color and white people and white privilege.

1780
02:16:43,474 --> 02:16:44,035
And I think that

1781
02:16:44,655 --> 02:16:54,959
If we're talking about any community forums, we need to be the ones who are invited to the table as white people, and it needs to be people of color-led, and Divya is a great example of that.

1782
02:16:54,999 --> 02:17:04,322
She talks about ABIPOC, that's African American Indigenous People of Color, and those are the ranges of individuals.

1783
02:17:19,978 --> 02:17:21,178
I think we lost Melanie.

1784
02:17:31,122 --> 02:17:33,603
I think Melanie might have dropped off the call.

1785
02:17:42,786 --> 02:17:44,086
Hi, I'm here, sorry.

1786
02:17:45,067 --> 02:17:48,708
It looked like you guys dropped me and then it looked like just put me back on.

1787
02:17:49,507 --> 02:17:50,027
please continue.

1788
02:17:52,368 --> 02:17:53,889
I don't know how much you guys heard.

1789
02:17:54,209 --> 02:17:58,131
So I feel like I was on the cell phone talking when you know, you don't know if anybody's on the other line.

1790
02:17:58,231 --> 02:18:04,434
So all I just wanted to add was I thought, uh, counselor bears and counselor morale were incredibly articulate.

1791
02:18:04,594 --> 02:18:04,974
I echo

1792
02:18:06,358 --> 02:18:13,662
the sentiment of other white folks in this space, but it is unfortunate that there are so many white people speaking in this space.

1793
02:18:13,702 --> 02:18:20,626
I think to Dr. Anand's point, Dr. Divya Anand's point, who has done a lot of this work previously, we need to be the folks invited to the table.

1794
02:18:20,706 --> 02:18:32,893
I think we need to make a strong statement that Black Lives Matter, that Zach Baer's resolution and the advice of our friends who are ABI POC individuals is taken.

1795
02:18:33,473 --> 02:18:34,954
And I would strongly encourage

1796
02:18:35,594 --> 02:18:41,436
the council and the community to listen and to be invited into spaces where people of color are inviting us.

1797
02:18:41,957 --> 02:18:51,040
And if they're gracious enough to invite us after the 400 years of oppression and all of the things that we've seen, it's been a really powerful time.

1798
02:18:51,081 --> 02:18:55,362
And I especially want to thank the students for what they did last week and coming forward.

1799
02:18:55,402 --> 02:19:02,485
I was so impressed and so horrified at the same time with what I was reading, knowing that it was true, but also the bravery in which they came forward.

1800
02:19:03,045 --> 02:19:03,766
That's all I have to say.

1801
02:19:03,826 --> 02:19:04,126
Thank you.

1802
02:19:04,806 --> 02:19:05,346
Thank you.

1803
02:19:05,906 --> 02:19:08,507
I was going to recognize Joyce Paul next.

1804
02:19:08,627 --> 02:19:09,847
Is Joyce still on the call?

1805
02:19:10,687 --> 02:19:22,650
I think we may have lost Joyce.

1806
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:22,890
OK.

1807
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:23,150
OK.

1808
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:28,812
Would anybody else like to comment?

1809
02:19:29,092 --> 02:19:31,472
Philip Kossel, Scott Kelly?

1810
02:19:31,532 --> 02:19:32,552
Thank you, Mr. President.

1811
02:19:32,612 --> 02:19:34,313
Again, I think that I

1812
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:38,543
I appreciate school committee member Melanie McLaughlin.

1813
02:19:38,563 --> 02:19:52,515
I think that as we start these conversations, one thing I realized and what I've heard and who I heard from the most and the loudest are our young people, young people of color that really stood up and said, this is what we need.

1814
02:19:52,595 --> 02:19:53,456
This is the problem.

1815
02:19:53,876 --> 02:19:55,457
These are the issues, these are the concerns.

1816
02:19:55,518 --> 02:20:01,703
So I think as we move on with that group, I know that I need to withdraw that B paper.

1817
02:20:02,339 --> 02:20:04,080
And I want to make that as a motion, please.

1818
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:05,641
And I think I misspoke.

1819
02:20:06,241 --> 02:20:10,804
But having those young people at the table, so yes, we can listen to them.

1820
02:20:11,204 --> 02:20:12,845
We can invite them to come in.

1821
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:25,594
This is what I've done in the last couple of weeks, especially as I'm talking to young men and women of color, I've asked them, as a privileged white man, what do you see?

1822
02:20:25,714 --> 02:20:31,436
What can help us learn, teach us what we need to learn?

1823
02:20:31,496 --> 02:20:35,818
Because there's a lot that we need to learn as a privileged white community.

1824
02:20:36,238 --> 02:20:40,400
So maybe, as they said, listen to them.

1825
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,001
Bring them as part of the forum.

1826
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:48,492
It's the mouths of babes, they're gonna tell you how they feel, and we have to listen.

1827
02:20:48,552 --> 02:20:52,213
So again, I made a mistake as I spoke early.

1828
02:20:52,634 --> 02:21:06,160
I motion to move forward with the information that I spoke earlier, Mr. Clerk, and move forward with the resolution, with the motion.

1829
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:07,380
Thank you.

1830
02:21:08,261 --> 02:21:09,802
Thank you, Counselor Scott Kelly.

1831
02:21:10,382 --> 02:21:12,703
We have, let's see, Diane Sullivan.

1832
02:21:16,532 --> 02:21:17,092
Yes, hi.

1833
02:21:17,853 --> 02:21:19,553
Hi, give an address on the record, please.

1834
02:21:20,594 --> 02:21:22,495
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1835
02:21:22,555 --> 02:21:26,457
Diane Sullivan, 83 Jerome Street, West Medford.

1836
02:21:27,597 --> 02:21:27,937
Thank you.

1837
02:21:27,977 --> 02:21:36,481
I just wanted to acknowledge my appreciation for Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell's work and leadership on this.

1838
02:21:37,622 --> 02:21:41,343
I appreciate what folks have added to this conversation.

1839
02:21:41,383 --> 02:21:44,665
And I think most of us here in Medford acknowledge this is

1840
02:21:45,283 --> 02:21:47,104
a long overdue conversation.

1841
02:21:47,564 --> 02:21:52,027
It's not the first time we've approached this very sensitive issue.

1842
02:21:52,047 --> 02:21:59,091
As an ally, I'm a social justice and racial justice advocate.

1843
02:21:59,111 --> 02:22:00,272
I've been for many years.

1844
02:22:01,413 --> 02:22:05,915
It's been my intent to try to educate other white allies.

1845
02:22:05,975 --> 02:22:13,100
And I think that as we look for our roles in this community, that's where our attention

1846
02:22:14,045 --> 02:22:16,967
you know, or where we can really help and support each other.

1847
02:22:17,868 --> 02:22:19,088
Um, you know, I agree.

1848
02:22:19,208 --> 02:22:19,989
I apologize.

1849
02:22:20,089 --> 02:22:21,770
I missed her name as I'm driving.

1850
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:31,296
Um, but, um, the woman of color who spoke about, um, how safe people of color feel in, um, in, in, in showing up in city government.

1851
02:22:31,797 --> 02:22:37,721
And I just want, you know, I've been doing the work of engaging people with lived experience in the anti-poverty space.

1852
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:40,823
Myself as somebody with lived experience who,

1853
02:22:41,707 --> 02:22:50,495
And just in full disclosure, when I first started to think about what white privilege meant as somebody who was low income, I had a hard time wrapping my head around it.

1854
02:22:51,335 --> 02:22:57,060
But it soon became clear that even despite my poverty, my privilege was always intact.

1855
02:22:57,921 --> 02:22:58,802
So I'm dedicated.

1856
02:22:58,822 --> 02:23:05,808
Diane, you there?

1857
02:23:13,962 --> 02:23:14,282
Diane?

1858
02:23:14,302 --> 02:23:19,323
Encouraged by the bravery that our students have shown.

1859
02:23:19,403 --> 02:23:25,444
I've had one-on-one conversations with a lot of young adults who've been impacted by racism in this city.

1860
02:23:26,064 --> 02:23:27,784
I'm encouraged by their bravery.

1861
02:23:27,904 --> 02:23:28,485
I agree.

1862
02:23:29,765 --> 02:23:32,465
This is really about building trust in relationships.

1863
02:23:33,105 --> 02:23:41,867
When we talk about, quote unquote, inviting folks to the table, we really need to create the space that says, you are welcome and you are equal.

1864
02:23:42,652 --> 02:23:51,918
Your voice matters and you are an expert in your own experience and and we need to really listen to these voices So I'm encouraged by the discussion tonight.

1865
02:23:52,538 --> 02:24:04,446
I throw my 100% full support behind it I'm doing my you know work on my own trying to connect with a lot of these youth so that they right now can acknowledge the power that they hold and

1866
02:24:04,857 --> 02:24:05,437
people who are in power.

1867
02:24:05,457 --> 02:24:07,739
And we have to come together with those that they see in power.

1868
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:11,942
And really begin on the path towards healing.

1869
02:24:12,002 --> 02:24:13,223
Because that is really what it is.

1870
02:24:13,263 --> 02:24:15,084
And we have to acknowledge white privilege.

1871
02:24:15,625 --> 02:24:21,129
Have this discussion in ways and creative ways that we have not thought about before.

1872
02:24:21,189 --> 02:24:24,531
Again, councilor bears, councilor Morrell for taking your leadership.

1873
02:24:24,551 --> 02:24:29,234
And other councilmembers who are clearly ready to get behind this.

1874
02:24:35,742 --> 02:24:36,102
Thank you.

1875
02:24:36,122 --> 02:24:41,867
Are there any other comments or questions or would anybody like to make a statement?

1876
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:45,210
Did we get Joyce back?

1877
02:24:45,271 --> 02:24:46,351
I feel bad we lost Joyce.

1878
02:24:47,132 --> 02:24:54,619
Okay.

1879
02:24:55,480 --> 02:24:57,341
So if I may, I want to...

1880
02:24:59,485 --> 02:25:03,807
I want to thank Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell for bringing this paper forward.

1881
02:25:04,267 --> 02:25:06,108
I agree with you a thousand percent.

1882
02:25:06,729 --> 02:25:10,871
And I think Councilor Beers, you know, you hit it on the head when you said, you know, this can't be the end.

1883
02:25:11,371 --> 02:25:13,292
This has to be just the beginning.

1884
02:25:13,312 --> 02:25:14,353
You know, it's a continuation.

1885
02:25:14,373 --> 02:25:16,974
We need to work on this and we need to work on this now.

1886
02:25:17,234 --> 02:25:19,795
This has to be something that is addressed immediately.

1887
02:25:19,855 --> 02:25:22,157
It will take time, but we need to begin now.

1888
02:25:22,637 --> 02:25:24,498
So I thank you both for bringing this forward.

1889
02:25:24,598 --> 02:25:26,439
I agree with you a thousand percent.

1890
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:28,640
I look forward to working with everyone

1891
02:25:29,182 --> 02:25:31,783
throughout our community on this issue.

1892
02:25:31,823 --> 02:25:33,764
It needs to be addressed, and we need to do it now.

1893
02:25:33,824 --> 02:25:39,466
So I look forward to working with the administration, all the elected officials, everyone, the public.

1894
02:25:39,546 --> 02:25:44,488
We need involvement, and I think Councilor Marchione on the head, we need to listen, and that's really big.

1895
02:25:44,888 --> 02:25:46,229
So I thank you for bringing this forward.

1896
02:25:46,249 --> 02:25:56,793
So on the motion of Councilor Beers and Councilor Laurel, seconded by, is there a second?

1897
02:25:58,945 --> 02:26:02,088
Mr. President, does this include the B paper as well?

1898
02:26:02,108 --> 02:26:04,650
That's going to be a separate resolution.

1899
02:26:05,370 --> 02:26:06,531
I eliminated the B paper.

1900
02:26:07,011 --> 02:26:07,292
Okay.

1901
02:26:07,312 --> 02:26:09,773
No worries, no worries.

1902
02:26:09,813 --> 02:26:13,776
So on the motion of Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beers, seconded by?

1903
02:26:14,577 --> 02:26:14,897
Second.

1904
02:26:15,938 --> 02:26:18,060
Councilor Marks, Clerk Urbis, please call the roll.

1905
02:26:21,742 --> 02:26:22,383
Councilor Beers?

1906
02:26:23,324 --> 02:26:23,624
Yes.

1907
02:26:24,064 --> 02:26:24,945
Vice President Carabiello?

1908
02:26:28,618 --> 02:26:29,419
Vice President Carriello.

1909
02:26:35,764 --> 02:26:36,925
I don't have Vice President Carriello.

1910
02:26:36,965 --> 02:26:38,226
I'm gonna skip Vice President Carriello.

1911
02:26:38,246 --> 02:26:39,207
I'm gonna go to Councilor Knight.

1912
02:26:40,968 --> 02:26:49,075
Mr. President, I would vote no this evening, and I would like the record to reflect that I feel as though we need to meet with the administration and produce some action items before we move forward.

1913
02:26:58,079 --> 02:26:58,639
Councilor Marks?

1914
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,500
Yes.

1915
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:01,060
Councilor Morrell?

1916
02:27:01,741 --> 02:27:02,021
Yes.

1917
02:27:02,681 --> 02:27:03,462
Councilor Scarpelli?

1918
02:27:03,842 --> 02:27:04,042
No.

1919
02:27:10,825 --> 02:27:11,625
President Falco?

1920
02:27:12,186 --> 02:27:12,426
Yes.

1921
02:27:13,366 --> 02:27:15,467
And then we need Vice President Caravello, I didn't hear him.

1922
02:27:17,228 --> 02:27:18,909
Vice President Caravello, are you with us?

1923
02:27:19,429 --> 02:27:20,169
Hold on, Mr. President.

1924
02:27:20,189 --> 02:27:20,930
Thank you, I'm sorry.

1925
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:22,451
I left the table for a minute.

1926
02:27:23,011 --> 02:27:23,351
I'm sorry.

1927
02:27:26,202 --> 02:27:31,306
No, I'm gonna vote no, I think for the same reasons that my other two colleagues are saying.

1928
02:27:32,227 --> 02:27:36,230
We need to take action on this and not words, not pieces of paper.

1929
02:27:36,251 --> 02:27:39,653
Okay, so you're a no vote?

1930
02:27:40,014 --> 02:27:40,194
Yes.

1931
02:27:41,155 --> 02:27:43,016
Okay, thank you.

1932
02:27:43,697 --> 02:27:45,298
Clerk Artebiz, you've called the roll.

1933
02:27:45,979 --> 02:27:49,622
I have four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1934
02:27:51,117 --> 02:27:51,677
Is that what you have?

1935
02:27:52,538 --> 02:27:53,119
That's what I have.

1936
02:27:53,719 --> 02:27:54,600
Okay, correct, okay.

1937
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:57,582
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1938
02:27:57,602 --> 02:28:02,647
20406, offered by Councilor Pierce.

1939
02:28:02,807 --> 02:28:05,109
Oh, I'm sorry.

1940
02:28:05,169 --> 02:28:07,350
Councilor Scarpelli has a motion.

1941
02:28:08,211 --> 02:28:10,253
Councilor Scarpelli's motion, do you have the wording to that?

1942
02:28:12,886 --> 02:28:14,767
Councilor Scarpella, I wanna make sure I have that wording right.

1943
02:28:15,127 --> 02:28:30,352
You wanna move for an immediate meeting with the mayor, the police chief, the board of health, the diversity director, the school superintendent, and representative of communities of color.

1944
02:28:35,758 --> 02:28:37,398
Yes, and especially the youth.

1945
02:28:38,239 --> 02:28:39,419
And the youth.

1946
02:28:39,759 --> 02:28:50,222
We look to our leadership, our senior leadership, and have our high school students involved in these discussions, because that's what I'm hearing.

1947
02:28:50,242 --> 02:28:55,783
As I've gone out and talked, I've heard a lot from our students, more than anything.

1948
02:28:55,843 --> 02:28:58,724
So I would love to have them at that table.

1949
02:28:59,144 --> 02:28:59,504
Thank you.

1950
02:29:01,325 --> 02:29:02,085
Second, Mr. President.

1951
02:29:03,711 --> 02:29:07,454
The motion of Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by Vice President Caviello-Cook.

1952
02:29:07,754 --> 02:29:09,375
Mr. President, before the roll is called.

1953
02:29:09,996 --> 02:29:11,497
Councilor Marks.

1954
02:29:11,657 --> 02:29:15,279
I believe Councilor Scott Peli alluded to it, but I just want to confirm.

1955
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:20,183
This meeting is also going to be a meeting open to the general public, correct?

1956
02:29:20,423 --> 02:29:21,104
Oh, absolutely.

1957
02:29:21,424 --> 02:29:21,804
Okay.

1958
02:29:21,884 --> 02:29:22,565
It's a forum.

1959
02:29:22,765 --> 02:29:23,665
That's what I'm asking for.

1960
02:29:24,106 --> 02:29:32,252
A forum with a table where, especially as people have spoken, that people of color don't feel comfortable.

1961
02:29:33,697 --> 02:29:46,283
in our forum that we need to reach those individuals and bring them to that table so they can share and help us move forward in a positive way, and make Meffitt a better place to live.

1962
02:29:46,363 --> 02:29:47,784
So I think it's important that we do that.

1963
02:29:47,804 --> 02:29:48,584
Thank you for clarifying.

1964
02:29:50,585 --> 02:29:51,165
Mr. President.

1965
02:29:51,185 --> 02:29:51,585
Mr. President.

1966
02:29:51,605 --> 02:29:55,727
Okay, on that motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1967
02:29:56,908 --> 02:29:57,608
Councilor Pierce.

1968
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:05,045
motion to join this with paper 2406, the request for a forum with the mayor that I put on the agenda for tonight's meeting.

1969
02:30:08,167 --> 02:30:11,330
Okay.

1970
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,612
No, I don't think you can.

1971
02:30:14,412 --> 02:30:15,213
You want this separate?

1972
02:30:15,593 --> 02:30:19,156
I want this separate, please.

1973
02:30:19,416 --> 02:30:19,756
Okay.

1974
02:30:20,157 --> 02:30:23,819
On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Marks, Clerk Urnavis, please call the roll.

1975
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:25,641
Councilor Behrs.

1976
02:30:26,822 --> 02:30:27,042
Sure.

1977
02:30:28,088 --> 02:30:28,988
Vice President Carabiello?

1978
02:30:29,148 --> 02:30:29,388
Yes.

1979
02:30:30,048 --> 02:30:30,589
Councilor Nights?

1980
02:30:31,429 --> 02:30:31,669
Yes.

1981
02:30:32,169 --> 02:30:32,749
Councilor Marks?

1982
02:30:33,209 --> 02:30:33,489
Yes.

1983
02:30:34,170 --> 02:30:34,770
Councilor Morrell?

1984
02:30:35,410 --> 02:30:35,710
Yes.

1985
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,830
Councilor Scarpelli?

1986
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:37,430
Yes.

1987
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:38,591
President Falco?

1988
02:30:39,171 --> 02:30:39,451
Yes.

1989
02:30:40,311 --> 02:30:42,432
Seven affirmative, zero negative motion passes.

1990
02:30:42,452 --> 02:30:47,013
20-406 offered by council appears to be resolved at the Memphis City Council.

1991
02:30:47,973 --> 02:30:55,195
Resolved by the Memphis City Council that the council and the city administration urgently host a public community forum for residents.

1992
02:30:55,695 --> 02:31:03,819
to discuss the structural and cultural concerns regarding policing in our community as requested by numerous Methodist residents and community organizations.

1993
02:31:04,299 --> 02:31:04,919
Councilor Behrs.

1994
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

1995
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:10,902
The intent of this was very similar to the discussion that we had.

1996
02:31:11,722 --> 02:31:15,044
And I just, essentially, I think we need to have a forum.

1997
02:31:15,084 --> 02:31:19,886
But I think the most important thing is that we're going to have a bunch of councilors, the mayor, chief of police, all these folks in the room.

1998
02:31:20,426 --> 02:31:21,826
It can't be about us talking.

1999
02:31:22,127 --> 02:31:23,607
It needs to be about us listening.

2000
02:31:23,787 --> 02:31:25,248
And that's what I'm most concerned about.

2001
02:31:25,846 --> 02:31:32,987
Um, you know, we need to make sure that we are not just taking action because we want to take action.

2002
02:31:33,067 --> 02:31:49,051
And I understand the urgent desire for action, but as Divya said, if people of color don't even feel comfortable and safe coming to public meetings and spaces and speaking, you know, that forum is going to be very, it's not going to be what we need it to be.

2003
02:31:49,251 --> 02:31:53,392
So, um, the intent of this motion is very similar to, uh, to that before.

2004
02:31:53,432 --> 02:31:54,632
And I would just make one amendment.

2005
02:31:56,476 --> 02:32:00,057
It's cultural concerns regarding racism and policing.

2006
02:32:00,118 --> 02:32:02,678
So two separate topics.

2007
02:32:02,819 --> 02:32:04,939
I think we need to talk about both.

2008
02:32:05,259 --> 02:32:09,581
Racism in our community goes far beyond anything about policing.

2009
02:32:09,761 --> 02:32:10,261
It's everywhere.

2010
02:32:12,102 --> 02:32:13,163
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

2011
02:32:13,363 --> 02:32:15,143
Councilor Scarpelli.

2012
02:32:15,203 --> 02:32:16,264
Thank you, Council President.

2013
02:32:16,404 --> 02:32:17,304
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

2014
02:32:18,144 --> 02:32:24,667
Again, with what I've heard, and this is why I'm so animated, is that as I work with

2015
02:32:25,364 --> 02:32:26,805
uh, strong men of color.

2016
02:32:27,745 --> 02:32:32,287
And we sit together and they say, you know, George, that's great.

2017
02:32:32,907 --> 02:32:37,989
Um, we're going to, we're going to, you know, we're going to march and we're going to do this and we're going to do that.

2018
02:32:38,069 --> 02:32:42,151
But you know what, as the next day comes on, something else is going to happen.

2019
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:43,011
It's going to be forgotten.

2020
02:32:43,031 --> 02:32:44,672
Okay.

2021
02:32:44,712 --> 02:32:52,575
Because remember when I was a young man, Rodney King was beaten and remember everybody stood up and marched and burned the city down.

2022
02:32:53,689 --> 02:32:55,910
So I think it's important, and again, I'm gonna stress it.

2023
02:32:56,390 --> 02:33:09,715
It's important that my friends, my neighbors that have talked to me and said, George, if you're an elected official, talk is great, marches are great, do something.

2024
02:33:10,115 --> 02:33:11,056
So let's do something.

2025
02:33:11,776 --> 02:33:14,117
That's why these meetings are important that we have right away.

2026
02:33:14,557 --> 02:33:19,379
The budget's important, we know that, but we can't let another day go by without finishing this.

2027
02:33:19,999 --> 02:33:20,519
So thank you.

2028
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:21,920
Thank you, council members.

2029
02:33:23,811 --> 02:33:25,772
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

2030
02:33:25,812 --> 02:33:27,033
Vice President Caviello.

2031
02:33:27,554 --> 02:33:28,174
Thank you, Mr. President.

2032
02:33:28,194 --> 02:33:40,664
You know, Mr. President, you know, we talk about having all these meetings, all these meetings, and they're all well and great, but here we are, a bunch of white people knowing, thinking that we know all the

2033
02:33:41,893 --> 02:33:45,035
yields of African-Americans, and we don't.

2034
02:33:45,755 --> 02:33:46,076
We don't.

2035
02:33:46,656 --> 02:33:54,921
And I'm a little disappointed tonight that I didn't hear from more people in the community about their issues.

2036
02:33:59,024 --> 02:34:08,890
If all we're going to do is have meetings amongst ourselves, and people of color don't come to these meetings, then we're going nowhere, Mr. President.

2037
02:34:09,619 --> 02:34:18,306
So that's the key, is to bring people of color to the table, not a bunch of white people thinking that we know what their ills are, because we don't.

2038
02:34:18,746 --> 02:34:20,788
We haven't walked in these shoes, and we don't know.

2039
02:34:21,068 --> 02:34:22,749
We might think we know, but we don't.

2040
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:25,772
I mean, we have an idea, but again, we don't know.

2041
02:34:26,152 --> 02:34:32,177
And again, the real key idea is we need to bring them to the table to have these discussions.

2042
02:34:32,497 --> 02:34:36,200
So again, so that's the most important part, Mr. President.

2043
02:34:37,161 --> 02:34:38,562
Thank you, Vice President Capiello.

2044
02:34:39,484 --> 02:34:40,044
Councilor Morrell.

2045
02:34:42,425 --> 02:34:43,246
Thank you, Mr. President.

2046
02:34:43,306 --> 02:34:51,169
I'm not trying to delve too deep into this topic, but I think we need to watch carefully when we're asking people of color to do the unpaid labor of educating us.

2047
02:34:52,389 --> 02:35:06,014
Racism is something white people had a very good part in, and I think we could definitely think of some ways we can do better by it, and not asking people of color in Medford to answer all of our questions and do all the work for us.

2048
02:35:07,255 --> 02:35:07,735
So I just want to

2049
02:35:08,206 --> 02:35:08,846
that on the record.

2050
02:35:09,026 --> 02:35:09,386
Thank you.

2051
02:35:10,046 --> 02:35:10,466
Thank you.

2052
02:35:11,527 --> 02:35:12,327
Councilor Pierce.

2053
02:35:14,207 --> 02:35:15,247
I just want to echo.

2054
02:35:16,488 --> 02:35:26,910
I want to echo Councilor Morrell and I just want to say I just got a text from a Medford resident of color, I'm not going to put them on the spot, who said there's a lot of hate on Facebook right now and it scared people away from this meeting.

2055
02:35:27,050 --> 02:35:31,771
So I just again, you know, racism has a lot of different impacts and one of them is who shows up here.

2056
02:35:35,312 --> 02:35:35,712
Thank you.

2057
02:35:36,192 --> 02:35:36,792
Councilor Pierce.

2058
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:39,861
Let's see, any other questions from the council?

2059
02:35:40,361 --> 02:35:41,202
Any other comments?

2060
02:35:42,342 --> 02:35:43,423
Okay, let's see.

2061
02:35:44,543 --> 02:35:46,804
Curtis, we can try to unmute you.

2062
02:35:49,185 --> 02:35:51,146
Curtis, hi, name and address for the record, please.

2063
02:35:51,567 --> 02:35:54,728
Thank you, this is Curtis Tootin at 38 Early Ave in Medford.

2064
02:35:55,283 --> 02:36:03,907
And I just wanted to speak to the issue you're discussing about how there hasn't been a large number of people of color voicing their opinions tonight.

2065
02:36:04,448 --> 02:36:09,370
And I wanted to point out that especially due to the pandemic, we are a technologically segregated city right now.

2066
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:20,876
And I happen to be a white guy who happens to have multiple devices and very reliable internet, but that is not the case for a lot of the families and people who would rather be here.

2067
02:36:20,896 --> 02:36:28,198
And I know when we were all at Hormel at the vigil together, that there are a bunch of people who couldn't make it tonight that want to see progress in the city.

2068
02:36:28,298 --> 02:36:30,959
So thank you for making sure it gets on the agenda.

2069
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:36,801
And I hope that the news of the positive steps tonight reach all corners of Medford.

2070
02:36:36,961 --> 02:36:37,301
So thank you.

2071
02:36:37,321 --> 02:36:39,102
Thank you, Curtis.

2072
02:36:40,172 --> 02:36:41,613
Any other questions or comments?

2073
02:36:42,513 --> 02:36:49,696
Okay, seeing and hearing none, on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

2074
02:36:53,858 --> 02:36:54,198
Seconded.

2075
02:36:55,159 --> 02:36:58,220
Seconded by Councilor Morrell, as amended by Councilor Behrs.

2076
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,801
Clerk Carnavis, please call the roll.

2077
02:37:01,661 --> 02:37:02,242
Councilor Behrs.

2078
02:37:03,062 --> 02:37:03,342
Yes.

2079
02:37:04,283 --> 02:37:05,083
Vice President Caravaglia.

2080
02:37:09,925 --> 02:37:10,845
Yes.

2081
02:37:10,985 --> 02:37:11,186
Yes.

2082
02:37:12,546 --> 02:37:12,866
Thank you.

2083
02:37:12,966 --> 02:37:13,507
Council night.

2084
02:37:14,567 --> 02:37:14,907
Yeah.

2085
02:37:16,408 --> 02:37:17,008
Council marks.

2086
02:37:17,448 --> 02:37:17,768
Yes.

2087
02:37:18,589 --> 02:37:19,229
Council Morrell.

2088
02:37:19,889 --> 02:37:20,170
Yes.

2089
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:21,530
I'll just go Peli.

2090
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:22,310
Yes.

2091
02:37:22,691 --> 02:37:23,451
President Falco.

2092
02:37:24,091 --> 02:37:24,431
Yes.

2093
02:37:24,772 --> 02:37:27,753
So the affirmative zero the negative, the motion passes.

2094
02:37:28,943 --> 02:37:41,809
20-407 offered by Council of Mayors, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express a request to 2680 and act relative to municipal governance during the COVID-19 emergency.

2095
02:37:42,329 --> 02:37:52,634
Be it further resolved that the legislature amend the text of 2680 to allow municipalities to issue state qualified deficit financing bonds to provide revenue

2096
02:37:53,294 --> 02:37:59,039
to support essential general fund programs endangered by the current economic crisis.

2097
02:37:59,079 --> 02:38:10,948
Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Method Legislative Delegation, as well as House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker.

2098
02:38:12,249 --> 02:38:12,890
Councilor Beers.

2099
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:14,651
Thank you, Mr. President.

2100
02:38:17,826 --> 02:38:23,250
I'm happy to report that the bill actually passed late last weekend, has been signed into law.

2101
02:38:24,271 --> 02:38:26,132
Spoke with Representative Donato about it as well.

2102
02:38:26,713 --> 02:38:34,778
One thing that the bill allows the city to do is to look at special revenue funds and using those for general fund expenses if needed.

2103
02:38:35,379 --> 02:38:38,621
There's also a variety of other municipal budget items in that bill.

2104
02:38:38,741 --> 02:38:41,203
So I withdraw the paper as it's no longer relevant.

2105
02:38:43,045 --> 02:38:46,127
The paper has been withdrawn by Councilor Beres.

2106
02:38:48,078 --> 02:38:49,499
Clerk Bernabez, you have that?

2107
02:38:52,021 --> 02:38:52,742
Paper's been withdrawn.

2108
02:38:52,762 --> 02:38:54,543
Mr. President, I have it as withdrawn, yes.

2109
02:38:55,384 --> 02:38:56,445
Thank you.

2110
02:38:57,005 --> 02:38:57,526
Councilor Knight.

2111
02:38:58,825 --> 02:39:00,947
The paper has been introduced, Mr. President.

2112
02:39:01,307 --> 02:39:06,371
It's been read into the record, so I believe by the Council rules, I think we have to maybe move on it.

2113
02:39:06,431 --> 02:39:09,533
But either way, I just think this is a very slippery slope.

2114
02:39:09,613 --> 02:39:11,034
Now we're writing state law.

2115
02:39:11,755 --> 02:39:21,722
I don't think that's out of scope and purview to, you know, direct the state legislature to amend bills and pieces of legislation that are before them that are going to be impactful to the 351 cities and towns.

2116
02:39:23,373 --> 02:39:28,296
We can't even get our affairs in our own house straightened up and we're up there telling people in the statehouse what to put in bills.

2117
02:39:28,316 --> 02:39:32,799
I don't think that that's really appropriate or within the scope of function of by the city council, Mr. President.

2118
02:39:33,179 --> 02:39:43,685
Um, so as we move forward, you know, I've asked that the council president, uh, remain cognizant of that and, um, take a position as to whether or not that type of action will be out of order or allowed in the future.

2119
02:39:45,237 --> 02:39:46,118
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2120
02:39:46,958 --> 02:39:50,841
So since the paper has been introduced, what we'll do is we'll receive it and place it on file.

2121
02:39:51,922 --> 02:39:58,386
So on the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

2122
02:39:59,126 --> 02:40:00,227
Clerk, please call the roll.

2123
02:40:01,748 --> 02:40:02,329
Councilor Beers?

2124
02:40:03,109 --> 02:40:03,369
Yes.

2125
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:04,770
Vice President Caravaglia?

2126
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:05,271
Yes.

2127
02:40:05,751 --> 02:40:06,251
Councilor Knight?

2128
02:40:07,132 --> 02:40:07,412
Yes.

2129
02:40:07,872 --> 02:40:08,413
Councilor Marks?

2130
02:40:08,993 --> 02:40:09,293
Yes.

2131
02:40:09,674 --> 02:40:10,294
Councilor Morrell?

2132
02:40:10,994 --> 02:40:11,275
Yes.

2133
02:40:11,635 --> 02:40:12,435
Councilor Scarpelli?

2134
02:40:13,076 --> 02:40:13,336
Yes.

2135
02:40:13,656 --> 02:40:14,357
President Falco?

2136
02:40:15,109 --> 02:40:16,511
Yes, 70 affirmative, 0 negative.

2137
02:40:16,531 --> 02:40:18,453
The paper is received and placed on file.

2138
02:40:18,473 --> 02:40:34,189
20-408 be resolved by the Memphis City Council that our colleagues on the school committee share with us the assembled list of items designed to improve student outcomes as discussed in their budget meetings which began in February.

2139
02:40:35,102 --> 02:40:57,757
Be it further resolved that the council express its thanks to the school committee for bringing this transparency to the school budget process, and that we look forward to any information they can share regarding the criticality and prioritization of items on this list as it relates to a traditional school year and or the anticipated 2020-2021 academic year.

2140
02:40:57,857 --> 02:40:58,598
Councilor Behrs.

2141
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:00,860
Thank you, Mr. President.

2142
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:02,921
You know, I think as everyone

2143
02:41:04,989 --> 02:41:11,973
I think we really need to talk in this community about need and unmet need for the essential services that we provide.

2144
02:41:12,713 --> 02:41:16,255
I know that the school committee has had an extensive budget process.

2145
02:41:16,495 --> 02:41:20,878
Much of it was based on being in a school building and having a normal year revenue.

2146
02:41:21,578 --> 02:41:32,585
But I still think that the information discussed there is valuable so that we can see what the educators, what the parents, what the community is thinking that we are missing and that we need.

2147
02:41:33,665 --> 02:41:35,266
I know it's been referred to as a wish list.

2148
02:41:35,326 --> 02:41:37,907
I don't think reading specialists are a wish list item.

2149
02:41:37,947 --> 02:41:47,012
I think those are needs, and I would just like us to be able to see the unmet need, knowing we might not be able to address it in this year's budget, but I think it's important for that scope.

2150
02:41:47,532 --> 02:41:48,853
So that's the intent of this.

2151
02:41:49,834 --> 02:41:50,914
Thank you, Councilor Paris.

2152
02:41:50,934 --> 02:41:52,935
Councilor Knight.

2153
02:41:52,975 --> 02:41:55,797
Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and I'd like to

2154
02:41:56,507 --> 02:42:07,096
further amended and ask that the school committee or the superintendent of schools or whoever it may be that's putting this budget together, probably the assistant superintendent of finance, provide us with a draft copy of that department's budget.

2155
02:42:08,056 --> 02:42:11,679
As we discussed earlier in the meeting, it's budget time, it's time to get rolling.

2156
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:15,422
If the school department has a budget that's been put together, then we need to see it, Mr. President.

2157
02:42:15,463 --> 02:42:23,249
So if the administration's not willing to give us a whole budget book, then maybe we can seek them out as individual departments so that we can better prepare ourselves for these debates.

2158
02:42:23,716 --> 02:42:26,658
So I'd offer that in the form of an amendment, and I'd ask the council to call it to second.

2159
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,060
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2160
02:42:30,441 --> 02:42:32,363
Any other questions or comments from the council?

2161
02:42:33,164 --> 02:42:34,305
Second the motion, Mr. President.

2162
02:42:34,325 --> 02:42:41,510
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Rios, seconded by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Knight.

2163
02:42:42,211 --> 02:42:45,614
Let's see, are there any other questions, or does anybody else want to speak on this matter?

2164
02:42:51,318 --> 02:42:53,020
On that motion, Clerk, please call the roll.

2165
02:42:53,747 --> 02:42:54,308
Councilor Behrs.

2166
02:42:55,069 --> 02:42:55,309
Yes.

2167
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:56,831
Vice President Carabiello.

2168
02:42:56,931 --> 02:42:57,231
Yes.

2169
02:42:57,832 --> 02:42:58,353
Councilor Knight.

2170
02:42:59,174 --> 02:42:59,494
Yes.

2171
02:42:59,915 --> 02:43:00,515
Councilor Marks.

2172
02:43:01,096 --> 02:43:01,377
Yes.

2173
02:43:01,777 --> 02:43:02,438
Councilor Morrell.

2174
02:43:02,999 --> 02:43:03,239
Yes.

2175
02:43:03,639 --> 02:43:04,480
Councilor Spakali.

2176
02:43:04,781 --> 02:43:05,041
Yes.

2177
02:43:05,442 --> 02:43:06,223
President Falcone.

2178
02:43:07,044 --> 02:43:07,344
Yes.

2179
02:43:07,584 --> 02:43:10,168
So the affirmative, zero, the negative, the motion passes.

2180
02:43:10,788 --> 02:43:11,929
Communications from the mayor.

2181
02:43:11,949 --> 02:43:16,093
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve to partially rescind the appropriation of free cash

2182
02:43:28,305 --> 02:43:32,847
per council paper 19-671 in the amount of $87,508.00 to purchase APX-8000XE all band portable radios and assorted accessories for the fire department.

2183
02:43:32,867 --> 02:43:34,688
The radio project is complete and the total amount expended was $195,250.

2184
02:43:55,363 --> 02:43:56,925
$195,249.18 for the radios and accessories.

2185
02:43:56,945 --> 02:44:03,071
The free cash needed to fund the radios project was $120,249.18 and $75,000 was funded from a fire special revenue fund.

2186
02:44:13,022 --> 02:44:15,764
The balance of pre-cash before this vote was $10,431,282.

2187
02:44:15,804 --> 02:44:27,490
Finance Director Alicia Nunley-Benjamin is present to answer any questions, any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

2188
02:44:29,151 --> 02:44:30,272
Brianna Lungo-Kern, Mayor.

2189
02:44:31,553 --> 02:44:33,034
Move approval of the paper, Mr. President.

2190
02:44:33,074 --> 02:44:35,615
I thought the explanation was excellent.

2191
02:44:35,635 --> 02:44:35,995
Second.

2192
02:44:37,256 --> 02:44:40,258
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Peers.

2193
02:44:42,253 --> 02:44:44,374
Any questions from the council?

2194
02:44:45,455 --> 02:44:45,996
Any comments?

2195
02:44:46,056 --> 02:44:47,276
Any comments?

2196
02:44:47,296 --> 02:44:49,498
Mr. President, if we could, we have Alicia with us.

2197
02:44:49,558 --> 02:44:53,561
If she could just give a short presentation on it, Mr. President.

2198
02:44:54,061 --> 02:44:54,781
Absolutely.

2199
02:44:55,462 --> 02:44:55,962
Alicia.

2200
02:44:56,683 --> 02:44:57,763
Hi, honorable councilors.

2201
02:44:57,803 --> 02:45:03,607
So the fire department had requested some free cash for a radio project.

2202
02:45:04,328 --> 02:45:08,571
They had a special revenue fund for equipment, which includes radios.

2203
02:45:08,611 --> 02:45:08,831
That was $75,000.

2204
02:45:10,792 --> 02:45:14,894
So they didn't need that $75,000 initially from the free cash.

2205
02:45:15,334 --> 02:45:17,035
And that's why we're sending that money back.

2206
02:45:20,557 --> 02:45:22,257
Thank you.

2207
02:45:22,278 --> 02:45:22,918
Any other questions?

2208
02:45:23,058 --> 02:45:24,218
Any questions from the council?

2209
02:45:24,258 --> 02:45:25,319
Councilor Marks?

2210
02:45:25,659 --> 02:45:33,663
Mr. President, does this include repeaters and other issues that the fire department had concerns about communication citywide?

2211
02:45:36,237 --> 02:45:41,229
This includes their radio and accessories that they brought before your honorable body with paper 19-671.

2212
02:45:44,718 --> 02:45:49,660
So, do you know, Alicia, and you may not know, but do you know where we stand with the repeaters?

2213
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:52,101
Because that was a major issue.

2214
02:45:52,121 --> 02:46:04,647
You know, we can have all the updates to radios, but without the repeaters that actually forwards the message, communications fail in the community, which is a public safety concern.

2215
02:46:04,667 --> 02:46:07,008
So I want to make sure that that's addressed as well.

2216
02:46:07,748 --> 02:46:13,952
I did ask the fire chief, uh, about his radios and he said all his radios, accessories and equipment was complete and done.

2217
02:46:14,012 --> 02:46:15,313
He has everything that he needs.

2218
02:46:15,633 --> 02:46:18,815
So I hope that that covers repeaters because that's what he told me.

2219
02:46:19,495 --> 02:46:28,180
If, if I'm going to support the paper tonight, but if you could just double check with the chief regarding the repeaters, a longstanding issue for a number of years.

2220
02:46:29,521 --> 02:46:29,861
Thank you.

2221
02:46:31,042 --> 02:46:31,342
Thank you.

2222
02:46:31,382 --> 02:46:32,523
Any other questions from the council?

2223
02:46:35,825 --> 02:46:37,606
Any other questions from the public?

2224
02:46:37,646 --> 02:46:39,767
Anybody have questions on this issue?

2225
02:46:39,787 --> 02:46:49,490
Nate, name and address for the record, please.

2226
02:46:53,972 --> 02:46:54,512
Nate Barrett?

2227
02:46:58,894 --> 02:47:00,395
Okay, I think he took his hand out.

2228
02:47:04,211 --> 02:47:06,593
On the motion of council and I second advise.

2229
02:47:06,813 --> 02:47:09,154
Mr. President, I think Mr. President.

2230
02:47:09,574 --> 02:47:11,135
I apologize.

2231
02:47:11,315 --> 02:47:11,896
That's all right.

2232
02:47:11,936 --> 02:47:12,956
I think it just came up again.

2233
02:47:13,016 --> 02:47:13,817
I see it at the bottom.

2234
02:47:13,857 --> 02:47:15,778
Here we go.

2235
02:47:15,798 --> 02:47:16,398
Let's try it again.

2236
02:47:22,822 --> 02:47:23,182
I'm trying to.

2237
02:47:26,771 --> 02:47:30,034
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2238
02:47:30,554 --> 02:47:47,927
I just want to second Councilor Marks just to make sure that the fire department has all the communications gear it needs, especially with the recent development of all the large apartment complexes in the area, especially using 700 800 megahertz radios like is described in the paper.

2239
02:47:48,867 --> 02:47:51,529
They can have difficulty penetrating even through the building.

2240
02:47:51,549 --> 02:47:58,853
So we just want to make sure they get the equipment they need, especially with a lot more residents that could be using the fire department services.

2241
02:47:58,873 --> 02:48:00,754
You know, the repeaters are important.

2242
02:48:01,895 --> 02:48:05,557
Backup power, if there really is an emergency for those repeaters.

2243
02:48:05,877 --> 02:48:11,180
Just want to make sure before we take money back before the new fiscal year budget, that they have what they need.

2244
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:12,220
Thank you.

2245
02:48:13,081 --> 02:48:13,481
Thank you.

2246
02:48:14,702 --> 02:48:16,463
Any other questions or comments?

2247
02:48:18,878 --> 02:48:19,898
He's seeing and hearing none.

2248
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:22,939
Let's see on the motion of council all night.

2249
02:48:23,619 --> 02:48:24,440
Seconded by?

2250
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:26,100
Second, Mr. President.

2251
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:26,440
Second.

Vice President Carabiello.

2257
02:48:36,183 --> 02:48:36,463
Yes.

2258

Councilor Scarpelli.

2265
02:48:45,086 --> 02:48:45,386
Yes.

2266
02:48:45,706 --> 02:48:46,386
President Falco.

2267
02:48:47,130 --> 02:48:50,211
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion is passed.

2268
02:49:03,956 --> 02:49:06,817
I do believe we tabled an item until the end of the meeting, Mr. President.

2269
02:49:06,897 --> 02:49:10,858
I hope your eyes are well rested and you're ready to start reading.

2270
02:49:11,878 --> 02:49:14,379
I'm not sure if they're well rested, but I'll try my best.

2271
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:16,080
So let's see.

2272
02:49:26,165 --> 02:49:26,625
Okay, so this.

2273
02:49:35,952 --> 02:49:36,532
Give me one minute.

2274
02:49:36,552 --> 02:49:49,221
Okay, so this is a notice of a, actually, so on the motion of, do we need to take this from the table, right, Clerk Curtis?

2275
02:49:49,582 --> 02:49:51,143
Motion to take from the table, Mr. President.

2276
02:49:52,422 --> 02:50:00,727
On the motion of Vice President Carabiello, seconded by Council Appearance to take paper 20-042 from the table.

2277
02:50:01,648 --> 02:50:02,648
Clerk, please call the roll.

2278
02:50:03,229 --> 02:50:03,809
Councilor Behrs?

Yes.

2280
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:06,551
Vice President Carabiello?

2281
02:50:06,951 --> 02:50:07,171
Yes.

2282
02:50:07,551 --> 02:50:08,111
Councilor Knight?

2283
02:50:08,952 --> 02:50:09,152
Yes.

2284
02:50:09,893 --> 02:50:10,473
Councilor Marks?

2285
02:50:10,953 --> 02:50:11,273
Yes.

2286
02:50:11,774 --> 02:50:12,354
Councilor Morrell?

2287
02:50:12,974 --> 02:50:13,215
Yes.

2288
02:50:13,695 --> 02:50:14,495

2290
02:50:15,496 --> 02:50:16,256
President Falco?

2291
02:50:16,757 --> 02:50:16,957
Yes.

2292
02:50:18,393 --> 02:50:18,753
Senate affirmative.

2293
02:50:18,773 --> 02:50:19,334
Is this a public hearing?

2294
02:50:30,677 --> 02:50:35,001
You directed me to put the ordinance on the agenda for consideration.

2295
02:50:36,102 --> 02:50:49,034
The public hearing, I believe, comes later, either after the community development board hears it, because you wanted me to put it on so that you could vote either for first reading or to refer it to the community development board.

2296
02:50:49,074 --> 02:50:50,615
That was the director from last week's committee.

2297
02:50:50,635 --> 02:50:51,756
Correct.

2298
02:50:51,836 --> 02:50:54,499
Just the way it fell on the page, I just wanted to make sure I was doing it right.

2299
02:50:55,238 --> 02:51:02,364
20-042 in the ordinance amending the revised ordinances of the city of Medford zoning relative to adult use marijuana.

2300
02:51:03,485 --> 02:51:07,108
Be it resolved by the city council of the city of Medford as follows.

2301
02:51:07,508 --> 02:51:09,810
The revised ordinances of the city of Medford.

2302
02:51:10,931 --> 02:51:14,814
So when I say X, that means it hasn't really been slotted into a position yet.

2303
02:51:14,974 --> 02:51:21,099
So that'll be renumbered once it goes to, once it gets passed.

2304
02:51:23,322 --> 02:51:31,067
City Method X, B, and R hereby amended by inserting the following to section X at the end of article X as follows.

2305
02:51:31,627 --> 02:51:41,314
Whereas by vote of the state election on November 8, 2016, the voters of the Commonwealth approved legislation regulating commerce in marijuana.

2306
02:51:42,596 --> 02:51:49,018
marijuana accessories and marijuana products, and for the taxation of proceeds from sales of such products.

2307
02:51:49,458 --> 02:52:00,442
It was authorized cities and towns to adopt reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of operating marijuana business, and whereas currently the City of Manfred Code of Ordinance does not

2308
02:52:00,902 --> 02:52:13,756
specify the license requirements for persons or entities seeking to operate adult-use marijuana establishments in the city and whereas the legislature, the commonwealth has determined that cities and towns in Massachusetts

2309
02:52:14,834 --> 02:52:21,079
should not be permitted to outright prohibit adult-use marijuana facilities without a citywide referendum vote.

2310
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:34,232
Whereas the licensing commission of the city of Manford may grant local licenses for adult-use marijuana establishments regulated under Section 3 of Chapter 94G of the General Laws in 935 CMR 500.

2311
02:52:36,874 --> 02:52:46,921
Therefore, be it adopted by the Memphis City Council in session assembled that the below listed sections of the Memphis Code of Ordinances are hereby amended and created as identified.

02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:27,809
It is the aim of this ordinance to minimize any adverse impacts that marijuana establishments may have on adjacent or nearby properties and to provide standards for the placement, design, siting, safety, security, monitoring, modification and

discontinuance of marijuana establishment subject to reasonable conditions aimed to protect public health, safety and welfare.

2320

2572
03:34:38,071 --> 03:34:38,772
Mr. President.

2573
03:34:39,912 --> 03:34:40,132
Yes.

2574
03:34:41,012 --> 03:34:41,973
I didn't get that.

2575
03:34:42,013 --> 03:34:43,193
Can you repeat that, please?

2576
03:34:44,654 --> 03:34:45,334
What part?

2577
03:34:46,174 --> 03:34:47,555
The whole thing, Mr. President.

2578
03:34:47,655 --> 03:34:48,375
Councilor Knight.

2579
03:34:48,535 --> 03:34:50,016
Councilor Knight beat you to it, Councilor Marks.

2580
03:34:50,156 --> 03:34:50,516
Oh, he did.

2581
03:34:50,576 --> 03:34:51,056
I'm sorry.

2582
03:34:51,156 --> 03:34:51,696
I'm sorry.

2583
03:34:52,157 --> 03:34:54,377
Hey, we set up a pizza while you were waiting.

2584
03:34:55,238 --> 03:34:56,638
Hey, I changed my shirt.

2585
03:34:58,139 --> 03:35:00,340

03:35:00,500 --> 03:35:03,821

2587
03:35:06,091 --> 03:35:09,152
questions.

2588
03:35:09,192 --> 03:35:16,456
Before I have the clerk call the roll, are there any questions or comments from the Council or the general public?

2589
03:35:19,877 --> 03:35:23,639
Nate Merritt, name and address for the record.

2590
03:35:33,935 --> 03:35:49,559
Specifically, it's actually towards the end, page 20, section 5B, compliance, where it states that compliance with federal law, since as I'm still aware, unless I'm wrong, that distribution of marijuana is still not compliant with federal law.

2591
03:35:49,979 --> 03:35:55,840
You just wanna tighten up the language so you don't permit someone to set up an establishment and then have them get in trouble.

2592
03:35:56,640 --> 03:35:57,861
That's all, thank you.

2593
03:35:58,561 --> 03:35:58,901
Thank you.

2594
03:36:00,384 --> 03:36:06,186
And besides federal, I'm sorry, besides that item, there was a similar throughout page six at the top.

2595
03:36:06,967 --> 03:36:12,649
There's something that says this isn't supposed to supersede federal law, although the whole content therein kind of does.

2596
03:36:14,149 --> 03:36:18,571
It's avoided on page 14 in section 12 there.

2597
03:36:18,891 --> 03:36:22,693
They don't mention federal law, but did you mention state and local law?

2598
03:36:23,793 --> 03:36:26,214
So you might want to have someone take a look and tighten up the language.

2599
03:36:29,167 --> 03:36:35,371
Mr. President, Mr. President, if we can refer to KP before our second reading KP law.

2600
03:36:37,752 --> 03:36:37,972
Yes.

2601
03:36:38,052 --> 03:36:43,895
So, so, uh, so we can pass it tonight, send it to the CD board and then KP.

2602
03:36:44,196 --> 03:36:45,276
Is tonight the third reading?

2603
03:36:45,957 --> 03:36:48,298
Today's this is the first reading.

2604
03:36:49,118 --> 03:36:50,479
Yeah.

2605
03:36:50,959 --> 03:36:53,041
I'm sorry.

2606
03:36:53,061 --> 03:36:55,322
Council on information council night.

2607
03:36:56,358 --> 03:36:57,899
It's a zoning amendment, Mr. President.

2608
03:36:57,919 --> 03:37:04,064
So the first reading is us introducing this paper tonight, but by law, we have to send it to the CD board.

2609
03:37:04,985 --> 03:37:15,474
This would enact the public hearing process where once the CD board receives it, the council and the CD board are required to hold a public hearing and the CD board would be required to report back.

2610
03:37:16,485 --> 03:37:27,251
their findings to the council and the council would be precluded from voting on the measure until the CD board provides us with that information or I think got three weeks past from the close of their public hearing.

2611
03:37:28,271 --> 03:37:34,254
So this isn't the typical ordinance with three readings because it's a zoning amendment, it has to go through the CD board.

2612
03:37:34,915 --> 03:37:44,780
So the council wouldn't have, you know, a first reading and advertisement and then a third reading, it would be sent it to the CD board, have a public hearing, CD board has a public hearing provides us with their

2613
03:37:45,380 --> 03:37:49,861
recommendation, we close our public hearing that have a certain defined period to deliberate.

2614
03:37:53,502 --> 03:37:55,182
So we can make the change after that, then.

2615
03:37:57,043 --> 03:38:04,485
Yeah, but between it takes 40, it's four votes to take off to go to the CD board, but five votes to pass.

2616
03:38:05,705 --> 03:38:12,427
And you can change the language after the CD board because the idea is they're going to have a public hearing and make a recommendation on language, right?

2617
03:38:13,247 --> 03:38:13,427
Yes.

2618
03:38:16,643 --> 03:38:17,123
Sounds good.

2619
03:38:18,964 --> 03:38:24,946
Okay, so there's a motion on the floor and the motion was, I'm sorry, was the motion made by Councilor Knight?

2620
03:38:25,766 --> 03:38:27,166
Yes, I seconded it, Mr. President.

2621
03:38:28,247 --> 03:38:32,348

03:38:35,149 --> 03:38:35,429
Yes.

2624
03:38:36,049 --> 03:38:36,949
Vice President Carabiello?

2625
03:38:37,309 --> 03:38:37,670
Yes.

2626
03:38:38,050 --> 03:38:38,530
Councilor Knight?

2627
03:38:39,672 --> 03:38:39,952
Yes.

2628
03:38:40,333 --> 03:38:40,913

Councilor Scarpelli?

2633
03:38:45,017 --> 03:38:45,298
Yes.

2634
03:38:45,638 --> 03:38:46,399
President Falco?

2635
03:38:46,779 --> 03:38:49,762
Yes, I'm the affirmative, zero on the negative, the motion passes.

2636
03:38:49,882 --> 03:39:01,194
Mr. Clerk, we have committee report, your committee reports are just the records.

2637
03:39:01,646 --> 03:39:05,728
Mr. President, I actually completed a committee report, but I never made the entry on the agenda.

2638
03:39:05,829 --> 03:39:06,669
So I did not.

2639
03:39:06,909 --> 03:39:10,832
So there's, I mean, I have a committee report from last week, or you can just table it.

2640
03:39:11,192 --> 03:39:12,993
Actually, you don't need to table, it's not on the agenda.

2641
03:39:13,373 --> 03:39:14,174
Yeah, it's on the agenda.

2642
03:39:14,194 --> 03:39:15,074
We'll take it up next week.

2643
03:39:15,214 --> 03:39:16,215
Thank you, Mr. Clark.

2644
03:39:17,115 --> 03:39:18,556
I think we should stay a little longer.

2645
03:39:20,557 --> 03:39:24,560
I believe the last item then is the last two items are records and adjournment at this point.

2646
03:39:25,122 --> 03:39:28,803
Yes, so the records, let's see here.

2647
03:39:28,843 --> 03:39:33,724
The records of the meeting of June 2nd, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight.

2648
03:39:34,244 --> 03:39:36,144
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

2649
03:39:37,205 --> 03:39:37,905
Not a chance.

2650
03:39:38,025 --> 03:39:39,325
Table them please, Mr. President.

2651
03:39:40,265 --> 03:39:43,566
You could have read them while Johnny was reading the ordinance.

2652
03:39:45,807 --> 03:39:46,707
