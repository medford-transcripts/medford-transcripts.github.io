1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:09,485
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if someone can remove Declan's name.

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:11,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I, of course, can't figure it out.

4
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:15,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I was from a CCD class on Sunday morning.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,553
[SPEAKER_00]: The three dots, the three dots in the... I used to wear it doesn't say rename there.

6
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say rename.

7
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:23,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to rename mine.

8
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:31,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to do it every time, but it's not until Peter or whoever's running the Zoom gives us co-host ability.

9
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, going through doing that right now.

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Could somebody send me the agenda?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it on the school webpage calendar, please.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody has it handy.

14
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:51,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send it.

00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:52,535

[SPEAKER_15]: Just did.

[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Marissa Edwards-Vinson.

67
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon or good evening, everyone.

68
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:44,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's going to be our kickoff for our official budget process.

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a full agenda.

70
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:54,067
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information to share with the committee this evening.

71
00:05:56,417 --> 00:06:06,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Murphy has spent a significant amount of time cataloging and organizing this data for tonight's presentation for the different departments.

72
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:10,778
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a full schedule ahead of us so

73
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:23,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to tonight's presentation and passing the baton to Mr. Murphy so that he can take us through the slides and let us discuss the departments that are here today.

74
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:32,136
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank our staff members that are on the call as well, who will have an opportunity to weigh in if necessary at particular points.

75
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:33,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

76
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:37,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Murphy, please take over.

77
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,489
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, is everyone able to hear me?

78
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do a straw poll?

79
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up.

80
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

81
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:45,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

82
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:54,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dr. Cushing, I just shared with you a document that I could also share with Ms.

83
00:06:54,334 --> 00:07:06,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Galusi as a backup plan, because I, like it sounds like a few of you, are having a few technical problems this evening that I don't

84
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,784
[SPEAKER_08]: expect they're going to be solved in the next few seconds.

85
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:16,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the deck that we're going to walk through tonight, if either Dr. Cushing or Ms.

86
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Galussi are able to share that, I just got the microphone and camera on one of my computers working.

87
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:31,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't think I'm going to continue to play with this to get to the point where I can also share my screen.

88
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That would seem too ambitious.

89
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Dr. Cushing's in the document.

90
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:35,913
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be good to go.

91
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:46,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So Peter, if I could just do a few more seconds of introduction and then we'll start going through the various slides that we have for you tonight.

92
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the, thank you.

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:58,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the superintendent said, tonight is our first formal budget meeting specific to the development of the FY23 budget.

94
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,467
[SPEAKER_08]: As the school committee is aware,

95
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been updating you first quarterly throughout the year, and then over the course of the last month or two, we've been discussing in greater detail both the budgetary priorities for the Medford Public Schools coming into FY23, as well as the budgetary challenges that we know we're going to face coming into this fiscal year.

96
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:29,987
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them, frankly, are similar to budgetary challenges that we would face in any fiscal year.

97
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,432
[SPEAKER_08]: very specific to FY23.

98
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:58,818
[SPEAKER_08]: As we discussed at your meeting on May 2nd, given that the district is currently in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations with nine of our 10 unions, and given that the vast majority of our operating budget is consumed by personnel costs, as is the case for all school districts,

99
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:10,566
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a, that is a significant variable and there's a significant degree of uncertainty that we as an organization have coming into this fiscal year.

100
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:27,152
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, we have a responsibility both to continue to pursue our educational and operational objectives in the upcoming fiscal year

101
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:50,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we'll talk a little bit tonight about how those two things will interact with one another and how we'll try to adhere to our commitment to the community with respect to transparency and how we'll continue to put student interests and student outcomes at the center of all of our strategic priorities, including those that have a monetary impact.

102
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I will now, as we start to go through the slides, and I think we can go now, Peter, if you're ready,

103
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:08,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever we talk about the budget, well, I know for some committee members and particularly for some of you that have been on the committee for some time, there can be some degree of repetition and redundancy.

104
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,277
[SPEAKER_08]: as you hear me walk through the various steps and sequences.

105
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,897
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it was Ms.

106
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:29,161
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin who pointed out, as we were sort of mapping out our FY23 budgetary timeline and process, that the budget really is an opportunity for members of the community to have an opportunity to see how the organization functions, to hear about what priorities we're pursuing.

107
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:38,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And so given that, I try to sort of provide a little bit of foundation knowledge at the beginning of the budgetary process, just in terms of how school districts are funded.

108
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:46,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go through those as quickly as I can because, again, we have been discussing this on almost a weekly basis over the past month or two.

109
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,925
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I do think it's important context.

110
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:58,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So in our first substantive slide, you'll see a slightly modified version of a document that you saw last year that walks through the various steps.

111
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:01,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And that first step with regard to the strategic plan,

112
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:14,198
[SPEAKER_08]: is one that I think in any budget process, given how much we have going on, it can be easy to skip over, but it's important that we start with our goals and what the objectives are that we're looking to pursue.

113
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:28,747
[SPEAKER_08]: The members of the school committee, as well as members of the school administration filled out budget surveys in which essentially you had the opportunity to thinking in the context of the strategic plan, what are the issues and priorities that you believe the district needs to pursue?

114
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at that third step with regard to the budget meetings.

115
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:32,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we are right now.

116
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our opportunity to, in public, flesh out those priorities and to talk a little bit about how they interact with one another.

117
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:55,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, one of the things that we'll talk about tonight is how we're in a very interesting budgetary time in which we have all the uncertainty and speculation that often comes in Massachusetts with school districts without knowing what the availability of funding is going to be.

118
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:56,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time,

119
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:07,356
[SPEAKER_08]: we've been fortunate enough, both on the municipal side and on the school side, through the ARPA and ESSER funding, to have a significant amount of one-time funding resources available.

120
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:24,709
[SPEAKER_08]: But some of the strategic considerations that we in the school administration have to take into account, and that you as the school committee have to take into account, is how do we balance those one-time funding priorities against the reoccurring priorities, and how do we determine, essentially, which budget those priorities land on?

121
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:50,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll talk a little bit tonight about what the implications of those decisions are, what the risks are for potential deficits that we can't fund in the future, but then also what are the risks for immediate student needs that we know exist right now in the somewhat aftermath, or at least hopefully the later stages of the pandemic and the disruptions that it causes.

122
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:53,708
[SPEAKER_08]: These meetings lead up to the superintendent's recommendation

123
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I think oftentimes there's some confusion about that.

124
00:12:56,565 --> 00:13:05,068
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an assumption that the municipal government sends over a number and the superintendent then puts it in an envelope and hands it over to the school committee and the school committee votes on that.

125
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:20,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the points that this school committee has made, certainly in the time that I've been in this role and my impression is to some degree prior to that, is that part of the school committee's job and your responsibility is to advocate zealously on behalf of

126
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:24,111
[SPEAKER_08]: the school communities that we work with and that we serve.

127
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:34,317
[SPEAKER_08]: The municipal government we know, and this is true for the mayor and it's true for the city council, has that responsibility, but also the responsibility to balance the competing needs of the community.

128
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:41,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know that we as the school department try to be a good citizen within the constituency of municipal departments.

129
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:49,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the points that I always make at this point in the budget season, and I know you've heard me make it this year as well, is that as the school administration

130
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:54,247
[SPEAKER_08]: we understand our responsibility to be planning for all potential contingencies.

131
00:13:54,707 --> 00:14:06,470
[SPEAKER_08]: The information and the priorities that you'll hear about tonight are important priorities based on facts and based on the actual truthful needs of our students.

132
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:15,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, we understand that we are one constituent part of the city of Medford and we will be prepared to implement the budget that is appropriated to us.

133
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something you've heard me say almost verbatim each time we've talked about this.

134
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:32,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is an important step in that process of us making sure that we're able to articulate fully what are the needs of the school department and through that, the needs of the Medford Public School students.

135
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So the superintendent's recommendation will go to the school committee.

136
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:41,797
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee will then make a request based on that recommendation or a variation as you see fit to the municipal government.

137
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:45,680
[SPEAKER_08]: The municipal government through the mayor and the city council will then make an appropriation.

138
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:59,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that second vote that you took on June 24 last year, for purposes of the FY 22 operating budget is to actually adopt the budget that is that is appropriated to your recall that you made a contingent vote.

139
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year the mayor had made a recommendation to the city council.

140
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It represented a significant increase in our funding.

141
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:11,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also about, I believe, $700,000 less than that was requested.

142
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That was something that we were planning for and

143
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,706
[SPEAKER_08]: As you've heard me say before that the school administration works in conjunction with the city administration to make sure again that we're prepared for any potential contingency.

144
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:28,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that adoption after the appropriations made by the municipal council.

145
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:37,754
[SPEAKER_08]: It is our job to implement that budget so you'll see the note there that there are various components of the budget process and different levers of government that have a hand in it.

146
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,105
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a process that takes place.

147
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:47,069
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some variation depending on if it's a regional school committee or things of that nature, a city government versus a town government.

148
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:55,034
[SPEAKER_08]: But generally speaking, a process like this plays out in every city and town in Massachusetts throughout, right around this time during the fiscal year.

149
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's it for our, sorry, one more slide.

150
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:00,077
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen this one before.

151
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:03,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, our budget is made up in Medford of about 80%

152
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:34,017
[SPEAKER_08]: local contribution, that's money generated by the taxpayers of Medford, 20%, or thereabouts, Chapter 70, excuse me, Chapter 70, coming in from the Commonwealth, as we talked about a little bit at your May 2nd meeting, that is based on the belief that every taxpayer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a vested interest in the well-being of the students of Medford, but the breakdown of the formula is based on the socioeconomic dynamics of the community,

153
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,397
[SPEAKER_08]: or so says the Massachusetts State Legislature.

154
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:46,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I said on May 2nd, I would recommend we table for the time being the degree to which we either agree or disagree with the specifics of that formula.

155
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:57,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Like many communities with a high degree of need, we would prefer not to have an 80-20 split, but at the same time, that is what the formula essentially spits out at us right now.

156
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this particular fiscal year in FY23, we're fortunate to, as many

157
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:08,096
[SPEAKER_08]: districts have received a significant uptick in our Chapter 70 allocation.

158
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, as I reported in our labor update, given the actual breakdown in the ratio of the funding that has not as consequential an effect as we would have preferred, perhaps if the numbers were a little different.

159
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:28,692
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see that column on the far right there just representing the external funding that comes into the district.

160
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:32,155
[SPEAKER_08]: A large portion of that is in the special education realm.

161
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:38,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll talk a little bit tonight about the fluctuation that we have to forecast for year in and year out.

162
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now I think we can move on.

163
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I'll move quickly through this slide because it's one that you saw just a week ago.

164
00:17:49,341 --> 00:18:00,383
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the context of trying to plan for a almost or perhaps over $70 million budget, when you have nine collective bargaining agreements that represent

165
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,764
[SPEAKER_08]: a very, very large portion of your budgetary expenses on a year in and year out basis.

166
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:13,270
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't really sort of escape that as an important factor in your budgetary planning.

167
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:23,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something we obviously discussed at length last week and something that we'll continue to discuss as we move forward throughout this budget process.

168
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna make quick note of that third bullet point down.

169
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:36,302
[SPEAKER_08]: where it says that a priority for the Medford Public Schools is to increase wages to maintain competitiveness while ensuring sustainability.

170
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:43,368
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a point that you heard me articulate again in your May 2nd meeting, and I will articulate it again here.

171
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:52,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is certainly the case that it is a point that we in the administration have articulated in various forums with our various bargaining partners.

172
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:56,638
[SPEAKER_08]: We understand that we have a responsibility to maintain competitiveness.

173
00:18:57,445 --> 00:19:11,317
[SPEAKER_08]: But that responsibility is qualified by the responsibility we have to not establish financial structural deficits that would cause significant problems for the school district and the years ahead.

174
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:20,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that is our job to find that equilibrium and to negotiate in good faith toward a result that achieves both ends of that objective.

175
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:29,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that will be a part of tonight's presentation, but also part of all of our efforts with respect to negotiations moving forward.

176
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,327
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can go to the next one.

177
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, again, these are the priorities as summarized.

178
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:46,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as we walk through the specific priorities tonight and some of the initiatives that we'll be recommending that the school district fund through one means or another,

179
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: All of them, frankly, should correlate with one or multiple bullet points here.

180
00:19:53,546 --> 00:20:09,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, again, the reason that the negotiations are such an important component of the budgetary process is that we're an organization made up of people, and that's where most of our money goes.

181
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So of our $67 million budget, $67.4 million budget in FY22, 54.3,

182
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:21,359
[SPEAKER_08]: approximately was money that was put into personnel expenses.

183
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:37,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means that if we don't know how much the personnel is going to cost us in a given year, it can be very difficult to nail down our specific budgetary priorities that we'll be able to ultimately realize.

184
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:44,963
[SPEAKER_08]: But as I said, it's also important for us to continue to articulate those so that the community has a full understanding as to what exactly it is

185
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:49,682
[SPEAKER_08]: that we are looking to invest their money in, frankly.

186
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:58,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, your critical priorities there, and you'll see them in greater specificity tonight, are making sure that students have the social, emotional, and mental health supports that they need.

187
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:03,899
[SPEAKER_08]: To the degree we're able to reduce fee-based services, that's something that this committee has identified.

188
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:09,380
[SPEAKER_08]: as a critical priority, making sure that we're going through the responsible expansion of our CTE programming.

189
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,201
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a point that we'll be discussing in greater detail in tomorrow night's budget meeting.

190
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:20,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll get into a little bit of the sort of various ways in which we've tried to organize the themes in a moment.

191
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:31,868
[SPEAKER_08]: But CTE, if you're tuning in solely to see Mr. Fallon, you'll need to set your VCR for tomorrow night because we're focusing on some of the other priorities this evening.

192
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:40,469
[SPEAKER_08]: On the personnel side again you've heard us, hopefully there's nothing here that is jumping out to anyone as a surprise.

193
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,430
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason that we update you on a quarterly basis.

194
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,891
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why we solicit your feedback.

195
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:51,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why we come before you to discuss these issues is so that both the members of the school committee and frankly for members of the community at large.

196
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,016
[SPEAKER_08]: there is a general awareness.

197
00:21:54,036 --> 00:22:16,792
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't expect people to be able to detail every line item in the $67.4 million budget, but we hope that for people that are invested in the school system and paying attention to these conversations, there's a general understanding as to what it is that we're trying to do for the Medford Public Schools and maybe as importantly, why it is we think that that will have an impact on student outcomes.

198
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I think we have one more slide of our high level priorities.

199
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:20,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And again,

200
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:28,703
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll be going through with some greater specificity tonight as to what are the priorities that we're connecting to each of these.

201
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:37,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, as I said, there'll be some that we'll talk a little bit more about tomorrow at the at the second budget meeting.

202
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:44,860
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the changes that the school committee put in place the recommendation of the administration is that we're

203
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:49,379
[SPEAKER_08]: pursuing these meetings and having these discussions along thematic lines.

204
00:22:49,819 --> 00:23:01,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, as the mayor said at the beginning of the meeting, the four themes that we had identified were, one, how are we investing to provide equitable supports, particularly for high need and most vulnerable student populations?

205
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:08,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Two, how are we recovering and continuing to mitigate the impact of the disruptions caused by the pandemic?

206
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:14,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, what are the technology investments that we're seeking to make, understanding the critical role

207
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,600
[SPEAKER_08]: that technology plays in our students instruction.

208
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:28,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And number four, how are we structured as an organization and how are we seeing some of the how some of these priorities and changes are affecting how we're organized and how we're pursuing that work.

209
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:36,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight primarily will be on those first two objectives, talking about the bounce back from the pandemic and the supports to high needs students.

210
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:37,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And

211
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:57,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the sort of peculiar thing about budgeting in FY23 for school districts really across the country, and certainly in Massachusetts, is identifying how it is that we use the significant injection of federal money that has become available to us, but that we know is very time limited.

212
00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:08,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the points that you heard me make a lot during last year's budget presentation was that we know we don't want to commit one-time financial resources to recurring expenses.

213
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:24,184
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we also know that some of our financial priorities may well be, or challenges may well be recurring, and the need is exacerbated by the challenges that our students have faced over the course of the past couple of years.

214
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:37,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And when that's the case, we have to balance that potential conflict against itself and make determinations as to what we should invest in now, understanding that one of sort of three scenarios could play out.

215
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,901
[SPEAKER_08]: the need could dissipate.

216
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:45,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll hear a little bit about that tonight, particularly when Mr. Teixeira, our director of English learners joins us.

217
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:55,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Two, we could identify that something that we thought might be a one-time expenditure may well be very good for the mission of the organization.

218
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:03,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore we have a responsibility to reprioritize internally so that we're able to continue that investment in perpetuity.

219
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, we could determine that

220
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:34,312
[SPEAKER_08]: the need is there, maybe not great enough to reprioritize the whole organization, but as revenue recovers, and that's a large portion of what particularly the ARPA funding is designed for, is that it is funding that contemplates the eventual return to normalcy, and therefore there's still reprioritization that needs to occur, but hopefully it's not as difficult a lift as it would be in the second scenario.

221
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we'll talk a lot tonight about the one-time funds versus recurring and our attempt to be responsible in the allocation thereof.

222
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:43,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So we go to the next slide.

223
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:55,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, going into greater specificity, this is something every budget year, whether we have ESSER funding available or not, we walk through for the committee, the fixed cost increases.

224
00:25:56,416 --> 00:26:02,917
[SPEAKER_08]: These numbers do fluctuate over the course of the budget season, but at least for the last week or two, we've been relatively stable

225
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

226
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:14,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen, our Director of Pupil Services, who will also be addressing the committee tonight with regard to some of the special education funding priorities, and myself certainly hope that that will continue to be the case.

227
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:28,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also know that the costs are gonna fluctuate as do student needs, and it's our responsibility to strategize and make sure that we're being as responsive as we can.

228
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:32,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just spend a minute or two if we could on this slide,

229
00:26:34,415 --> 00:27:03,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Frankly, the fixed cost recitation in each budget season is one of the ways that school administrators and I think oftentimes committee members find ourselves being reminded that we don't have as much flexibility as we might prefer, because being a budget that's largely driven by personnel costs and personnel costs that are largely driven by contractual agreements negotiated a long time ago,

230
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:16,725
[SPEAKER_08]: The result is that there's always a chunk of next year's budget that's already spoken for before anyone has the chance to develop any type of strategic priorities or deliberations or anything of the like.

231
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the case here.

232
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:22,850
[SPEAKER_08]: We see that there's the first $1.1 million is spoken for.

233
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:30,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you see some other fixed costs that come in as well as special education, tuitions and transportation that are projections.

234
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we know that there's extra funding that will

235
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:43,546
[SPEAKER_08]: alleviate some of that, but because those numbers are uncertain until we actually get into the fiscal year, this is essentially what we have to plan for.

236
00:27:44,466 --> 00:28:01,477
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the numbers that's fluctuated a little bit, and I just want to point this out for purposes of transparency, because if you're someone who's doing school committee scouting and you're watching the highlight videos over and over and over again at night, if you compared what I said on April 11th to May 2nd to this evening,

237
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:11,258
[SPEAKER_08]: you would see that there's slightly different numbers associated with the investment that the district is making in the investigations three new math curriculum.

238
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:16,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And essentially the variable there is the personnel associated with the curriculum.

239
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:25,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the district has said in previous meetings is that the cost of this initiative is somewhere between 200 and $400,000 or thereabouts.

240
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:39,686
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we were to strip that down just to the fixed cost increase, this is the curriculum and professional development that come with that investment for the new elementary school math programming.

241
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:49,652
[SPEAKER_08]: In that row, that $150,000 does not include any personnel expenses, but as you've heard and as you'll hear again tonight, and Ms.

242
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Galussi can speak, and I think Dr. Khan may be on the call as well.

243
00:28:53,074 --> 00:28:55,296
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll certainly be welcome to chime in.

244
00:28:55,833 --> 00:29:07,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We think that to really make the most of this $150,000 investment, we're going to have to retain some personnel and devote FTEs to math coaches, which is something the district has not funded in recent years.

245
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:14,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll remember in the FY22 deliberations, what we said was that we think math coaches are a good idea.

246
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: There would be a sound investment taken in a vacuum.

247
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: But in a world when we were transitioning out of a math program,

248
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,243
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't think it made sense this year to invest in people coaching educators in that particular math program.

249
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:42,151
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that the district has after a pilot program that again, either Pfizer or Suzanne could speak to in greater detail, we feel very strongly and we're very hopeful about this investment, but we want to make sure that we're maximizing that investment.

250
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:46,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And then so that will require some degree of a personnel investment.

251
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, there's four elementary schools.

252
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So the sort of ceiling of that investment would be one coach per school.

253
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:57,076
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is part of the back and forth that we're anticipating over the course of this budget process.

254
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,717
[SPEAKER_08]: We want math coaches.

255
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:03,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just gonna be a capacity issue with respect to how many we ultimately invest in.

256
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:14,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna take a breath for a second because the fixed costs themselves are a big bulk of this and something that I know there are often questions about

257
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, we're talking about $2.5 million of taxpayer dollars.

258
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:23,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's certainly understand if or why there might be some questions.

259
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:37,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just, Mayor, if it's okay with you, I would, I thought maybe we could just see if anyone has any questions process related or otherwise so far, and then we will soldier on after we get to that point.

260
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also a good test to make sure everyone's awake.

261
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I also, it gives me an opportunity to thank Ms.

262
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:49,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines, our Director of Health Services for being present, as well as Ms.

263
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:52,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman, our Director of Behavioral and Counseling Health.

264
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And I apologize to both Ms.

265
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:55,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines and Ms.

266
00:30:55,188 --> 00:31:02,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman that I wasn't able to more smoothly weave in your introductions as I did our other administrators, but I know they won't take any offense.

267
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:04,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

268
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:05,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

269
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:07,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was very well said.

270
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:12,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we've heard some of that multiple times, but it's good for everybody watching from home.

271
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear it again.

272
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: If nobody has any questions, we can move on.

273
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:23,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we're not opposed to continuing on and seeing how we get done.

274
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:28,260
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't even seen how many slides there are, so I would imagine you would not be opposed to moving on.

275
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll move on as efficiently as we can.

276
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:39,006
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we move past the fixed cost increases, then now we get into, again, this is just the various components of the budget.

277
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, you did hear me make this point,

278
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:48,808
[SPEAKER_08]: it sort of can't be stressed enough that there is a significant increase in our foundation budget this year.

279
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Our local contribution has increased $2.2 million.

280
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:56,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, our required local contribution has increased $2.2 million.

281
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:59,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chapter 70 number has increased 1.6.

282
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:02,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a $3.8 million increase.

283
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:08,703
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you look at, I'm talking about the table on the right side

284
00:32:09,335 --> 00:32:09,875
[SPEAKER_05]: of the screen.

285
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Dr. Cushing, if you can scroll your pointer over it.

286
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

287
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

288
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:25,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see there, our $3.8 million budget brings us up to a minimum budget of $64.9 million.

289
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:32,191
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a significant proportional increase and one that under other, oh, there you go.

290
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

291
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:38,936
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an FY22 investment, that pointer that Dr. Cushing is using right now.

292
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:43,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, that's, it's a significant increase.

293
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:56,405
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the sort of like full context of that increase is that, um, even taking that increase into account, our FY, uh, 22 budget is already significantly North of our required FY 23 budget.

294
00:32:56,565 --> 00:33:03,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, um, we do think that that increase is reflective of the increased need that schools are experiencing.

295
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:07,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is part of our advocacy to the municipal government.

296
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:12,290
[SPEAKER_08]: that as costs go up and as needs go up, investment needs to as well.

297
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:20,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, we recognize that this is evidence of Medford making an investment in education that our students are the beneficiaries of.

298
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:22,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it's worth pointing that out.

299
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what that bottom table is.

300
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:30,019
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see on that bottom table on the right, the $69.9 million

301
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,808
[SPEAKER_08]: in the FY23 developing budget.

302
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:41,533
[SPEAKER_08]: When you hear me use the term developing budget, what I mean by that is that is the budget if the slideshow stopped right now.

303
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:44,555
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have several slides to go.

304
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:54,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you'll see, there are additional costs that need to be factored in or that the administration is recommending be factored in to the school committee's request to the municipal government.

305
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:58,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And so with that, we'll move on to the next slide.

306
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:00,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And so

307
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're at 67.4.

308
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:10,318
[SPEAKER_08]: If you factor in the FY23 fixed costs that have already been determined, we're at 69.9.

309
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:21,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That $71 million, which is an increase of $1.1 million, that represents if we were to incorporate a 2% cost of living adjustment.

310
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go back to the point that we discussed on May 2nd, and that I referenced earlier tonight.

311
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:29,907
[SPEAKER_08]: The district recognizes the need

312
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:33,505
[SPEAKER_08]: to maintain competitiveness with regard to our wage increases.

313
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:41,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also understand the need for it to be responsible.

314
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:43,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edmunds.

315
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:51,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when we look at that, we factor in that 2% increase.

316
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:57,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know ultimately what that budget line is going to represent.

317
00:34:58,035 --> 00:35:06,498
[SPEAKER_08]: But the suggestion that the district is not in any way factoring in the need to maintain competitiveness is inaccurate.

318
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:17,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, well, sometimes, you know, we can make sort of determinations as to how, if, or when we want to emphasize that point, given this context, that is something that we wanted to make note.

319
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:22,405
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, as important as competitiveness is, so is sustainability.

320
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:35,469
[SPEAKER_08]: while there would be an obvious upside to having a disproportionate increase, and we would certainly model or market ourselves accordingly to prospective staff members.

321
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:42,815
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also the case that we know that our students are presenting with needs that will be discussed in greater detail by Ms.

322
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:44,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Shulman, Ms.

323
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:44,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines, and Ms.

324
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:53,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen, and Mr. Cheshire, that require us to emphasize that sustainability at point so that we can maintain the flexibility we need

325
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:58,160
[SPEAKER_08]: to retain the staff that we need to provide the supports that our students need.

326
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:08,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of the day, there's no way of discussing our negotiations, our strategy, or our budget without understanding that that is the primary focus of the work we're trying to do.

327
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:14,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are our, so that, now that all that being said, while our flexibility is limited, it's not non-existent.

328
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:20,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you look at slides five and six, you see the sort of broad high-level priorities.

329
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:23,882
[SPEAKER_08]: In a moment, you'll see them with greater specificity.

330
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:44,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also know that oftentimes, while there may be things that we would prefer to defer to succeeding fiscal years, the significance and the severity of the need that our students are experiencing, hopefully coming out of the pandemic period, those are things that can't wait.

331
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:52,841
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when we have to make strategic decisions about the use of either recurring funds through the operating budget or the one-time funding that's available through the ESSER budget.

332
00:36:53,742 --> 00:37:02,168
[SPEAKER_08]: The third bullet there with respect to fundamental issues of equity, frankly, that can have a fairly expansive definition.

333
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:13,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see some things here where we know that there are some student programs and initiatives that we need to lend additional support to both so that the students that are participating in those programs

334
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:27,781
[SPEAKER_08]: are experiencing equitable support, but also so that the programs themselves can be treated with equity in the hope of developing deeper student engagement and attracting more students to participate.

335
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:40,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And then again, that final bullet point is just something I've already discussed a little bit tonight about there's a lot of strategic decisions to be made with regard to what funding we use and for what.

336
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:47,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I've promised several times that we're going to get into greater specificity with regard to our priorities.

337
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:49,768
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start to do that now as we move to the next slide.

338
00:37:50,188 --> 00:38:03,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll see that we have categorized all of the priorities that we're talking about tonight as somewhere between A and F. But what I want to be very clear about is that A through F is not a hierarchy of prioritization.

339
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:13,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Something can be categorized as category B and still be just as much of a priority as category A.

340
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:29,743
[SPEAKER_08]: The category system that we're using for the discussion tonight is about the strategic determination that has to be made between whether to commit to the operating budget, to the ESSER budget, or to essentially make a, you know, or neither, frankly.

341
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:42,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll see as we go through, and it may be the case that the committee feels that we need to recategorize some of these issues and some of these priorities, but I think at a minimum, you'll understand sort of the rationale behind

342
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:44,844
[SPEAKER_08]: what we put when.

343
00:38:44,884 --> 00:39:07,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's the next slide, it says this is just the definition of A through F. And again, I just want to reiterate again, because before we unveil a list of things that cost a significant amount of money, I just want to be very clear that if you pay attention to the categorization that we've used here, you'll see that the school district is not going to be making a request of $80 million.

344
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:11,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not, this is not a,

345
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:20,230
[SPEAKER_08]: a spending spree, but it is an honest look at the needs that our students are presenting with.

346
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:43,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, depending on whether they are reoccurring expenses or one-time expenses, or right now urgent expenses that we will have to determine in the future, whether they're recurring or one-time, that is sort of how we've tried to make this initial call between or amongst these six categories.

347
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:59,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, there are, for the most part, the ones that we're gonna focus on tonight and the ones that should be listed here are in, again, the theme for tonight is supporting, providing equitable supports to our high-need learners.

348
00:40:00,787 --> 00:40:12,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when we talk about our most vulnerable populations, we're talking about special ed, we're talking about students who are English learners, and the mental health and counseling supports that Ms.

349
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:12,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman

350
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:18,816
[SPEAKER_08]: department provides and the health services and medical attention that Ms.

351
00:40:18,856 --> 00:40:21,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines department provides.

352
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:32,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as we get to those priorities, I'll ask each of them to elaborate and give the committee a bit of sort of an illustration as to how and why this funding would make a difference.

353
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,909
[SPEAKER_08]: That really will be the focus is those four areas.

354
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And then tomorrow evening, I believe Ms.

355
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:39,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Layden's on the call as well.

356
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's some technology and library potential investments

357
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:46,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that is certainly welcome to speak to.

358
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:56,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but some of those other sort of, uh, structural components, uh, organization, um, number of strands, things of that nature, vocational programming.

359
00:40:56,608 --> 00:41:03,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that is something that we'll, we'll focus a little more on, uh, tomorrow evening, as well as, um, some, some of the other items on the operational side.

360
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:04,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

361
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:09,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully everyone's had a chance to look through this table and everyone understands that, uh, it's not a.

362
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:13,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Priority 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, meaning if it's 6, we'll never do it.

363
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:16,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's 1, we have to, or the world will end.

364
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll go on now to the first set of those priorities.

365
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:34,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the math coaches, both because of the instructional implications that we can, that we think it will yield for our students, as well as also wanting to make the most

366
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:37,080
[SPEAKER_08]: of the curriculum investment that we've already made.

367
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That's listed there again, this table itself does not represent a list of priorities.

368
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:45,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So please don't draw that inference from it.

369
00:41:46,623 --> 00:42:02,330
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can see in category A there, we were in all likelihood, if the pandemic had never happened, the district's decision to invest in investigations three as its math curriculum, hard to prove a negative, but presumably that would be unaffected.

370
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:10,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in that case, uh, and we think it's a good practice to have math coaches provided, uh, properly trained.

371
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,523
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a curriculum that they're coaching on, um, and that, that, that support is there.

372
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:19,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and so we see that as, as really, um, one of our top operating budget expenses.

373
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:30,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to ask, uh, I'm going to ask us to share, uh, momentarily to speak to, um, our.

374
00:42:31,572 --> 00:42:33,494
[SPEAKER_08]: English learner staffing priority.

375
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:41,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know there's actually another deck that he's going to be able to share with us for a minute to talk a little bit about that background.

376
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's only the second row in this, but I promise we don't have separate decks for each of these priorities.

377
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:50,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is the only instance in which we're going to do that.

378
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:59,672
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reason I want to stop here and give Mr. Teixeira a moment to expand upon why this is important is that the

379
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:21,310
[SPEAKER_08]: this priority, the need for additional English learner teachers at the elementary school to service our newcomer program is a really good example of something that if we didn't have the ESSER funding available, it would be a critical priority and we'd have to find a way to do it because it's responsive to an immediate need that we're seeing in our school communities.

380
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:29,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a constituency of high need learners that we have a responsibility to position for success for the remainder of their academic careers.

381
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:37,417
[SPEAKER_08]: All that being said, there are reasons to think it will not be a challenge that will last in perpetuity.

382
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:41,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a pronounced need that needs to be addressed right now.

383
00:43:41,698 --> 00:43:56,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore it is in category B, because if it doesn't make it into our operating budget, which frankly, given what you've seen about fixed costs, giving about some of the other uncertainties that we have coming into this budget, we're prepared for anything to not be able to make it.

384
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,283
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have to be particularly

385
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:02,980
[SPEAKER_08]: prepared for that, both because of this is a significant investment, and because it's so important.

386
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:15,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, assuming it doesn't make it into the operating budget, we're prepared to commit ESSER funding to that, so that we can achieve the objectives that Mr. Cheshire is now going to share with us.

387
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:18,071
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Paul, if you want to.

388
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:20,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I just could ask a question, I don't know.

389
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you pull up that slide one more time?

390
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to know, I think you said those are all additional positions that it will be our hope to fund, correct?

391
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:42,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you look on the column on the far right, these are priorities that we think are worthy, at a minimum, worthy of consideration.

392
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:51,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Only those that are categorized as category A are ones that we're saying, one way or another, we should try to incorporate into the operating budget.

393
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:52,983
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's something that's category B,

394
00:44:53,686 --> 00:45:00,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It means we have to do it, but we are prepared to commit the ESSER grants to make sure that it's done.

395
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it sort of, it winds its way down from there.

396
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:17,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we go through the priorities, I'll be able to spell out for the committee what this would translate in terms of dollars, depending on which set of categories we would incorporate into the request.

397
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:19,265
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mayor, I think you make a good point.

398
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:23,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just want to say this again, I want to emphasize it for anyone who just tuning in,

399
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:31,120
[SPEAKER_08]: and seeing this long list of positions, it is not the case that the school department is expecting to add these positions in FY23.

400
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:50,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in all likelihood not the case that we will not even recommend that we add all of these positions in FY23, but there are positions in here that we need to take, we need to think through the implications of each of these, what we're able to do, what we're not able to do, and then what we're able to do using the one-time funding and the ESSER grants that's available to us.

401
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:58,132
[SPEAKER_03]: but you including all of these numbers in that $71 million figure you gave a bit ago?

402
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:03,775
[SPEAKER_08]: In the $71 million, it represents just the fixed cost increases.

403
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:08,018
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a number at the end that is, I'll just to cut to the chase.

404
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:19,585
[SPEAKER_08]: If we just do the category A at 71.4, that would be the number if it's just category A. If it's category A and B, it goes up to approximately $72 million.

405
00:46:21,347 --> 00:46:21,847
[SPEAKER_05]: But again,

406
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not our expectation that this would end up entirely within the operating budget.

407
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:43,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if we wanna, Dr. Grisham, we wanna go back to Paul, I think he's probably, is that a good jumping off point, Mr. Chair?

408
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:45,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ready to go.

409
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,680
[SPEAKER_12]: I can share my slides.

410
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:50,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

411
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: if Dr. Cushing has them.

412
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:54,292
[SPEAKER_05]: If he does like those.

413
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to do this or you want me to show mine?

414
00:46:58,673 --> 00:47:01,293
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can show yours, I don't think I have yours at my fingertips.

415
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:16,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

416
00:47:17,076 --> 00:47:17,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

417
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy budget season.

418
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:29,042
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the chart that I give you pretty much every year when I give a presentation that discusses our enrollment numbers.

419
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:32,365
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you recall, our numbers are pretty fluid throughout the year.

420
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:38,851
[SPEAKER_12]: I always try to find that fixed moment in time that will indicate what our numbers are.

421
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:45,416
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the end of year numbers for going back to school year 17-18.

422
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:45,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So

423
00:47:48,095 --> 00:48:00,080
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, in 1718, we ended the year with 460 students, but at some point during the year, we may have had 490 students because we have students coming in and we have students going out.

424
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,284
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, our current moment, at this moment in time, we're actually up to 577 students as of today, which is the highest number I've seen in Medford.

425
00:48:12,277 --> 00:48:14,778
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of these are our newcomer students.

426
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:28,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I mentioned this in, when I presented back in January, we had, I took member Ruseau and member Graham to, you know, different schools.

427
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:33,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And we went into one of the newcomer classrooms that only had six students and that classroom exploded.

428
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:39,390
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently have 38 students between two classes in that room right now.

429
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:57,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So our numbers have grown significantly, and the majority of these students are newcomers who require the highest level of services in terms of periods of ESL a day, and also this includes content classes, as well as their English language development classes.

430
00:48:58,821 --> 00:48:59,841
[SPEAKER_12]: With that said, I

431
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:05,310
[SPEAKER_12]: predict that these numbers are going to continue to grow.

432
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,950
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still registering new students.

433
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,051
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 11 students on deck.

434
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:18,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And just in the time when I presented back in January, which was about 15 weeks ago, we've increased our numbers by 62 students.

435
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:21,033
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a result of the pandemic.

436
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,554
[SPEAKER_12]: The borders were closed last year.

437
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:29,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're basically getting two years worth of students in a one year period of time, but I don't,

438
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:33,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could predict when this would level off.

439
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:46,287
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the other struggles that we're having with our newcomer students, because they are coming in at all different times of the year, they will be newcomer students next year as well.

440
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:55,173
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are still going to continue to get new students as we do every year, but we will be keeping students in the newcomer classrooms

441
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:01,514
[SPEAKER_12]: longer than we typically would because we don't have the time with our students that we would have in a typical year.

442
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:04,376
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I expect this to continue on to next year.

443
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:09,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone have any questions on this slide before I move on?

444
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:16,425
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, does the screen change to kindergarten?

445
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, okay.

446
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:24,911
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the, starting with kindergarten, I'm trying to

447
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:29,111
[SPEAKER_12]: predict how many students were going to have a newcomers out of kindergarten.

448
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:33,595
[SPEAKER_12]: If you recall, we do not have a kindergarten newcomer program.

449
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:43,463
[SPEAKER_12]: It's best practice for our kindergarten students to be fully integrated in the mainstream, because most students are acquiring their English language development at that time.

450
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:52,237
[SPEAKER_12]: and to be in a classroom with role models, with native English speaking students, help accelerate the learning process and English language development of the students.

451
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:57,501
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, we have 86 EL students in our K classes.

452
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:03,385
[SPEAKER_12]: That number is, again, the highest I've seen in my time here in Medford.

453
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:06,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Of those 86 EL students, 44 of them are newcomers.

454
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:15,336
[SPEAKER_12]: How many of those newcomers are going to be recommended for first grade newcomers?

455
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:16,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know yet.

456
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't know until June.

457
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:26,539
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I were to look at the percentages and the rates, if you go back to the 2018-2019 school year, we had 53 EL students in kindergarten.

458
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:33,860
[SPEAKER_12]: 21 of them were newcomers.

459
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Only two were referred to first grade newcomers because these students were here all year.

460
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:43,463
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't have students missing huge chunks of school because of a pandemic.

461
00:51:43,903 --> 00:51:48,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, those students became pullout students and only two needed newcomers.

462
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:52,967
[SPEAKER_12]: In the 2019-20 school year, that number increased.

463
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,468
[SPEAKER_12]: We only had 26 newcomer kindergarten students.

464
00:51:56,428 --> 00:52:00,710
[SPEAKER_12]: but 11 were referred to newcomers because the building shut down in March.

465
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:05,652
[SPEAKER_12]: And March to June is a critical time for our kindergarten students with their language development.

466
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:12,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And then last year we had hybrid, we had students on remote learning, we referred nine students.

467
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:13,455
[SPEAKER_12]: That was out of only 15.

468
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:16,957
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three times that amount this year.

469
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:24,840
[SPEAKER_12]: I can safely say at this point in time, even though I can't predict, I am going to need another first grade newcomer classroom.

470
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:34,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So looking at our newcomer classes as of, I guess I made these slides on 425.

471
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,962
[SPEAKER_12]: These numbers have gone up, I can tell you that.

472
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:43,417
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently have 20, well, I know we have 25 in first grade now.

473
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,840
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't speak for the other classes off the top of my head.

474
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:54,286
[SPEAKER_12]: We split this grade two classroom and added another teacher this year, and they're each up to 18 students.

475
00:52:54,947 --> 00:53:01,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Grade three, we have 21, grade four, we have 20, grade five, we have 18, and then six, seven, and eight, we have 20, 22, and 18.

476
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:14,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think a larger percentage of these students that would typically be reclassified as pullout students are going to remain in EL, and we're going to continue to get new students enrolling.

477
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:19,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is why I'm asking for four more teachers.

478
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:27,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Paul.

479
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we transition back into the lengthier list

480
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: are there any questions specific for Mr. to share that the committee would like to ask at this time.

481
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:53,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ensure for folks that we know that we'll get a copy of the PowerPoint presentations I know that we will but I just sort of wanted to put that out there.

482
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

483
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I can confirm that you will.

484
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:01,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

485
00:54:02,403 --> 00:54:05,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Dr. Krishnan, I think we were on slide 12 of the original deck.

486
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:06,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

487
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:25,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, again, so just, you may hear me reiterate this point a couple of times, but I think it's important that the list in front of you and then the next couple of slides do not represent a list of positions that the district expects that we will be adding in their entirety.

488
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an articulation, as we have done in the past,

489
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:37,887
[SPEAKER_08]: the global personnel needs that the school district has, which are reflective of the priorities that we need to advance.

490
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:52,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we think this is a good opportunity to go through that exercise and also to drill down on some of the specific needs related to those objectives that you saw earlier.

491
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:55,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just trying to find in this, hopefully Ms.

492
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:56,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman's

493
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:03,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor, before we move on, can I just ask a quick question?

494
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:06,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Murphy, can you just flip back to the categorization slide for me real quick?

495
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

496
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:08,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

497
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:38,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

498
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:41,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

499
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:58,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So just on the question of those categories, again, the category A are the priorities that we believe, based on the nature of the expense, the appropriate place for the priority is in the operating budget.

500
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:07,568
[SPEAKER_08]: The category B is something that if there were no financial barriers, the operating budget would be an appropriate place.

501
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:15,754
[SPEAKER_08]: We recognize that there are financial barriers, that there are limitations, that there are competing needs within the city of Medford that need to be addressed by the municipal government.

502
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore the district is identifying category B as a place in which we can say, we are planning to implement this because the ESSER funding is available.

503
00:56:25,742 --> 00:56:28,885
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some cases, the ESSER funding may not be ideal

504
00:56:29,412 --> 00:56:37,898
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's not as problematic because of the presumed time limited implications of the challenges.

505
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:54,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are some needs that could dissipate over time as opposed to cost of living adjustments or things that weigh down the wage scale, which we know are sort of the definition of recurring.

506
00:56:55,823 --> 00:57:13,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are what can lead to unavoidable structural financial deficits, which is why, for purposes of the ESSER funding, which is the funding that is specific to the school department, those types of investments are prohibited under the federal regulations.

507
00:57:14,885 --> 00:57:15,566
[SPEAKER_08]: and state guidance.

508
00:57:15,826 --> 00:57:27,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so if we move on to the next slide and we'll go the fifth from the bottom, if we could highlight the three FTEs for school adjustment Councilors, we get our laser pointer back.

509
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:28,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

510
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:42,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you've heard the district present on several occasions over the course of the last year plus about the social and emotional needs of our students and how those challenges have been exacerbated by the pandemic

511
00:57:43,488 --> 00:57:45,889
[SPEAKER_08]: and the disruption to their schooling experience.

512
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:47,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Ms.

513
00:57:47,871 --> 00:58:01,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman presented to the committee in early April about some of those needs that our students are facing and how our personnel is deployed in a way to be responsive to that.

514
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:09,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this priority is connected to our hope of investing in an appropriate number of personnel

515
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:14,262
[SPEAKER_08]: to increase our overall number of school adjustment Councilors.

516
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, Ms.

517
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:19,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman, I'd ask you to speak a little bit to that priority and its implications.

518
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:33,468
[SPEAKER_08]: And just, I know you just did present to the committee just a few weeks ago, but maybe if you could just give sort of very brief primer on what is a school adjustment Councilor and how that compares to some of the other positions that are in your department.

519
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:36,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably lose the slide while Ms.

520
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Schulman's speaking.

521
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:42,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, and thank you for having me this evening to talk about the budget.

522
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:54,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Within the school counseling and behavioral health department, there are several different positions, and I'll just review them again so that there's more clarity on when I'm discussing the position titles, because they're very similar.

523
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:06,102
[SPEAKER_14]: School adjustment Councilors are also called school social workers, and those are Councilors who are managing the day-to-day individual and group counseling for students.

524
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:14,614
[SPEAKER_14]: They also work on FBAs, their community liaisons, and they provide consults to anyone in the school building and parents as well.

525
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:24,943
[SPEAKER_14]: School Councilors, who are also referred to as guidance Councilors, perform classes and lessons, both at the middle school and at the high school.

526
00:59:25,924 --> 00:59:32,249
[SPEAKER_14]: They also provide individual group counseling, but they carry the bulk of the academic transition and post-secondary planning.

527
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:33,410
[SPEAKER_14]: They also coordinate our 504s.

528
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,432
[SPEAKER_14]: facilitate parent meetings and provide academic supports.

529
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:46,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Our school psychologists perform the psychological evaluations for special education and also provide counseling individual and group.

530
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:53,337
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have within our department for BCBAs board certified behavior analysts.

531
00:59:53,757 --> 01:00:01,302
[SPEAKER_14]: They conduct observations and write support plans, consult with faculty and staff, provide trainings and conduct functional behavior assessments.

532
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:05,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Behavior specialists are also under this team.

533
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:06,825
[SPEAKER_14]: We have five district wide.

534
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:08,686
[SPEAKER_14]: They are all based on the elementary level.

535
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:13,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Prior to this year, we had one who was working with specialized programming.

536
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:14,970
[SPEAKER_14]: We have increased

537
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:29,105
[SPEAKER_14]: to five this year to mitigate some of the challenges from coming back in from the pandemic that we expected with students needing more supports with routines and classroom teachers meeting more assistance with behavior plans.

538
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:35,749
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also, as I've discussed earlier this year,

539
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:41,108
[SPEAKER_14]: obviously an increase in need for mental health for our students.

540
01:00:41,488 --> 01:00:43,489
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not like breaking news.

541
01:00:43,549 --> 01:00:54,633
[SPEAKER_14]: We've all seen it all over the place, certainly with adolescents, but also with our youngest learners, elementary students, children all over the place are experiencing more mental health challenges than ever before.

542
01:00:55,573 --> 01:01:03,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And certainly there is a need to increase supports in our district to meet the level of care to provide to those students.

543
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:15,343
[SPEAKER_14]: We have seen over the course of this year an uptick in crisis management to include students having mobile crisis evaluations or being hospitalized for psychiatric emergencies.

544
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:23,285
[SPEAKER_14]: We've also seen students who just need more care coming into the building and support throughout the day.

545
01:01:24,665 --> 01:01:25,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Murphy, it's okay with you.

546
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:29,846
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go through the positions specifically or do you want me to wait for that?

547
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:38,296
[SPEAKER_08]: do school adjustment councils now, and then we'll talk a little bit about the career Councilor position after that.

548
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:39,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

549
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:41,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, can I just ask a quick question?

550
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:44,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

551
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:46,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

552
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:46,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

553
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:46,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Schulman.

554
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:54,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you later said, initially in the opening, you talked about FBAs, and then later you mentioned functional behavior assessment.

555
01:01:54,122 --> 01:01:57,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So just wanted to reiterate that those are one and the same.

556
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:58,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

557
01:01:58,263 --> 01:01:59,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I understand you correctly that you said

558
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:10,568
[SPEAKER_06]: School adjustment Councilors do FBAs as well as BCBAs, the behavioral certified, you know, board certified behavioral analysts do FBAs as well.

559
01:02:11,086 --> 01:02:11,566
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

560
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:15,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone within a school can provide a school-based functional behavior assessment.

561
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:29,654
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a little bit confusing because the way a BCBA would use a functional behavior assessment outside in a clinical setting is somewhat different in the sense those are only performed by behavior analysts.

562
01:02:30,054 --> 01:02:35,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Within the school, we often include school adjustment Councilors, especially where there's a social-emotional need present.

563
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:36,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

564
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:44,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would just ask educators and the central administration leaders, folks, what have you, if we can try to just, thank you so much, that was helpful.

565
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:57,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we can just try to catch ourselves on the acronym so that we can maybe say them fully and then say the acronym too or whatever, just again, for the lay people out there, I know that when I first came on board, it was a lot of edgy speak.

566
01:02:57,527 --> 01:02:59,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you and appreciate it.

567
01:02:59,568 --> 01:02:59,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

568
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:22,234
[SPEAKER_14]: So through the analysis of looking at the services, both of what students were requiring and what the MASCA, which is the Massachusetts Association of School Counseling, is recommending for a ratio, I've determined that three additional school adjustment Councilors is necessary for next year.

569
01:03:22,434 --> 01:03:25,296
[SPEAKER_14]: The first would be an additional school adjustment Councilor at the Brooks.

570
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:29,539
[SPEAKER_14]: The Brooks, as of a few weeks ago, their roster was 527 students.

571
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:44,334
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're increasing by 1.0 school adjustment Councilors, counting the school psychologist as a 0.5 Councilor, because she does do a lot of counseling as well as evaluations, this would lead us to a ratio of 210 to one for counseling.

572
01:03:45,035 --> 01:03:49,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Considering their specialized programming needs, this seems like an appropriate ratio for that school building.

573
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:56,437
[SPEAKER_14]: The other priority here was to reduce the split positions.

574
01:03:58,523 --> 01:04:04,704
[SPEAKER_14]: three additional elementary schools in our district, each of whom has a split school adjustment counseling position.

575
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:14,546
[SPEAKER_14]: The goal is to have our professionals remain in the building five days a week so that they are able to support students with continuous care.

576
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:24,747
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would mean the McGlynn Elementary would be moving from 1.4 school adjustment Councilors, I'm sorry, 1.6 to 2.0, so an increase of 0.4.

577
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:39,468
[SPEAKER_14]: The Missituk, which currently has 1.6 full-time equivalent school adjustment Councilors would be moving to 2.0.

578
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:46,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, they'll be moving to 3.0.

579
01:04:48,112 --> 01:04:48,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, 2.0.

580
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,874
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a school psychologist as well.

581
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:57,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Roberts, which has a 1.4 school adjustment counseling position would move to 2.0.

582
01:05:01,304 --> 01:05:08,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we would be looking to increase the McGlynn Middle School to two full-time school adjustment Councilors.

583
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:12,786
[SPEAKER_14]: They currently have 1.4, which is the split position with the McGlynn Elementary.

584
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,707
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanna separate that so that they are responding to those buildings full-time.

585
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:27,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I will also say that not included in the budget is a DPH grant funded school adjustment Councilor for the high school level.

586
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:31,010
[SPEAKER_14]: We had originally written that grant for a community-based Councilor

587
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:40,267
[SPEAKER_14]: That was really difficult to fill and DPH has understood the challenges with supporting that grant this year and has allowed us to spill funding over for next year.

588
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:43,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be looking to fill that position for the high school level for another adjustment Councilor there.

589
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:55,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Stacey, if I could just jump in really quick to say that there's a little bit of an inconsistency with regard to how we're talking about some of the grants and the reason

590
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:59,684
[SPEAKER_08]: for that it's intentional, but I just want to call the committee's attention to it.

591
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:00,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Ms.

592
01:06:00,804 --> 01:06:07,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman just said, there's a DPH grant that's going to position us to have an additional adjustment Councilor at the high school.

593
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:21,478
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, or you saw on that slide, you saw a moment ago that this whole priority is category B, which means that while we're prepared to implement any contingency based on the appropriation, and we see that say that over and over again as well,

594
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:43,870
[SPEAKER_08]: in the event that this is not something that we're able to incorporate into the operating budget based on our desire to be as responsive as possible to the SEL and mental health challenges that our students are experiencing, we will prioritize this in the formation of our ESSER budget in FY23.

595
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:45,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Ms.

596
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:52,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman spoke about the ratios and certainly we want to make sure that we're adhering to all best practices, but that gives us,

597
01:06:53,121 --> 01:07:03,925
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially time as an organization to determine whether or not we're seeing a lessening of that need, which frankly would be great, but not something that any of us are counting on in the short term.

598
01:07:04,865 --> 01:07:17,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it gives us the opportunity to look in subsequent fiscal years about how we might be able to prioritize in a way that would allow us to migrate this priority from the RSR budget to the operating budget when there's capacity.

599
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:21,872
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's, so we want to, we're talking about them because,

600
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:31,328
[SPEAKER_08]: As was the case last year, we wanna make sure that the community understands both what our priorities are and how we're going to go about pursuing them.

601
01:07:32,308 --> 01:07:39,313
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also the case that we need to sort of be nimble between the operating budget and the ESSER budget available funds.

602
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:43,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, may I ask a question?

603
01:07:46,919 --> 01:07:48,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

604
01:07:49,387 --> 01:07:49,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

605
01:07:51,087 --> 01:08:01,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And did I miss the ratio and the Andrews and the full ratio for the high school and the vocational school, or are you just still getting there?

606
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

607
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Holman, I wanted to just make sure we didn't miss that.

608
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss that?

609
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,311
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm happy to review that with you as well.

610
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:12,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Just give me one second here.

611
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:13,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to pull up the numbers.

612
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:17,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to be clear, as Ms.

613
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:36,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Schallman finds those numbers, presently, when we factor in the DPH grant funded position at the high school, it will not require additional investment either from operating or S or side in order for us to fulfill those, what are our objectives as of right now, at least.

614
01:08:36,468 --> 01:08:36,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ms.

615
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Schallman, I can't speak to whether or not we're in keeping with the ratios you were referring to a moment ago,

616
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:46,175
[SPEAKER_08]: As of right now, that's not identified as an FY23 priority.

617
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:53,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And can I just ask, Mayor, is the DPH grant, is there a term on that, or is it just for the one year?

618
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:59,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to defer to either Ms.

619
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:00,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Scholz or Ms.

620
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:03,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Hines, who are more familiar with that particular grant.

621
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:06,286
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding is it runs through the end of next year.

622
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:08,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

623
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:09,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Hines just confirmed, thank you.

624
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:18,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, do we, Stacey, did you have anything else on that?

625
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:22,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Or did you want to talk a little bit about the career counseling position?

626
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:25,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute.

627
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:29,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

628
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:30,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Schallman, you're on mute.

629
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:31,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just on mute.

630
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:33,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

631
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:33,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

632
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:37,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to move on to the career counseling position if we're amenable to that.

633
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:38,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

634
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:42,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to point out again, in the slide, you see that the,

635
01:09:43,504 --> 01:09:55,933
[SPEAKER_08]: The school adjustment Councilors right now are categorized as category B, meaning that we understand that we may not have the budgetary capacity for that, but it's something that we need to do to address the immediate needs of our students.

636
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: The career Councilor- Is there supposed to be a slide?

637
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:03,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're not looking at, we're not seeing a slide.

638
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:07,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it's the same slide that we were referring to when we went to Ms.

639
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:07,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Shulman.

640
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:12,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, thank you, Peter.

641
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:20,514
[SPEAKER_08]: That's category B, meaning we're going to plan to do that and understand that we may have to resort to the ESSER funding to do it.

642
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:30,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Category D, which is the career Councilor position, that is a position that we think it would be a good practice to have.

643
01:10:30,756 --> 01:10:34,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will just be a question as to whether or not we have the budgetary capacity to do that.

644
01:10:35,757 --> 01:10:39,678
[SPEAKER_08]: It may well be something that the committee determines we want to include in the request.

645
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:48,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be the case that we don't have the capacity to address it, or at least the immediate, may not be immediately apparent how we're going to address it, depending on the appropriation.

646
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:57,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will be something that we'll have to work internally to make sure that we're able to realize the funding to do, or else we'll need to plan in the future.

647
01:10:57,884 --> 01:10:59,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ms.

648
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:07,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Stroman can talk a little bit about, with that context, Stacy, if you could just talk a little bit about what this position is, when it previously existed,

649
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:11,895
[SPEAKER_08]: and what it would position the department to do.

650
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:13,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

651
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:24,763
[SPEAKER_14]: A role shift in this year, school year 21-22 transformed the previous school community Councilor position to a house Councilor at the high school.

652
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:34,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was for a very significant reason in terms to have two school Councilors per house and not to have that divided counseling split.

653
01:11:34,674 --> 01:11:44,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Also the efforts of the school community Councilor were somewhat halted due to the pandemic and what students were able to experience or be involved in at the time.

654
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,943
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to restore that position.

655
01:11:47,963 --> 01:11:51,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why is that it includes the following responsibilities.

656
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that students are out and about going back to

657
01:11:55,128 --> 01:12:12,600
[SPEAKER_14]: more activities through the pandemic, there is a need for someone to be coordinating some of these events, which include managing our community service programs for all students, tracking their 60-hour graduation requirements, maintaining developing relationships with surrounding organizations for student community service opportunities.

658
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:18,344
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can imagine, a lot of our students need support in terms of finding those opportunities within our community.

659
01:12:19,404 --> 01:12:21,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Also coordinating college rep visits.

660
01:12:21,906 --> 01:12:24,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Those had obviously been stopped for a period of time

661
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:28,933
[SPEAKER_14]: and we need those to resume again with vigor next year.

662
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:40,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Supporting students finding employment opportunities, assisting with a local job fair, and managing our dual enrollment programs, which we have partnerships with Ben Franklin and Bunker Hill.

663
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:49,936
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been in discussions with Bunker Hill to increase our dual enrollment program, which would require an advisor to oversee these students.

664
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:54,097
[SPEAKER_14]: We are looking to have this opportunity for at least 30 of our students.

665
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:57,449
[SPEAKER_14]: to have increased dual enrollment opportunities with Bunker Hill.

666
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:12,537
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also a need to connect more of our students with just the community at large and to assist in finding them with low or no cost ways to be involved in the community.

667
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:17,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And previously this position had been very adept at doing that.

668
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly when it comes to extracurricular and scholarship opportunities,

669
01:13:23,556 --> 01:13:31,363
[SPEAKER_14]: They require an application process, which sometimes we are assisting with, and that person would help to do that.

670
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:39,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Oftentimes people come to us as well to say, I'd like to start up a scholarship for your school, and it helps to have a coordinator who can walk them through that process.

671
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:49,940
[SPEAKER_14]: as well as coordinating the scholarship programs for local scholarships that require our assistance, specifically the Connors and the Posse scholarship.

672
01:13:51,160 --> 01:14:03,723
[SPEAKER_14]: This person would also assist with school counseling workshops, creating and delivering advisory topics, scheduling and coordination of a caseload for students who need more support in managing their secondary education.

673
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:10,953
[SPEAKER_14]: and assisting with AP exams, AP potential, and in-school PSATs, which are now offered to all sophomores and juniors.

674
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:12,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

675
01:14:15,637 --> 01:14:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

676
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Shulman.

677
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:22,002
[SPEAKER_08]: If the committee is ready, I think we can just keep moving through this again.

678
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:24,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I don't want to spend- I think I have a question for Ms.

679
01:14:24,964 --> 01:14:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes with her hand up.

680
01:14:26,845 --> 01:14:28,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, just member Hays.

681
01:14:30,585 --> 01:14:40,369
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't need this slide I would recommend we take it down because it's, we've only, it's easier to tell if anyone's look for us.

682
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:47,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I apologize I actually had a question on the previous, I was just trying to I was trying to keep up with the school adjustment Councilors.

683
01:14:50,848 --> 01:14:52,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we talk about Andrews?

684
01:14:52,809 --> 01:15:00,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you talked about the Brooks and I didn't actually get what the increase from what to what that was when you went through the other schools.

685
01:15:00,352 --> 01:15:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could go through that.

686
01:15:02,153 --> 01:15:03,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we adding anything to Andrews?

687
01:15:03,914 --> 01:15:08,396
[SPEAKER_14]: This year we added an additional school adjustment counseling position to the Andrews.

688
01:15:09,356 --> 01:15:10,657
[SPEAKER_14]: At this time they're very well staffed.

689
01:15:11,288 --> 01:15:13,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what do they have total at this point?

690
01:15:13,891 --> 01:15:19,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Two school adjustment Councilors, one school psychologist, and two school Councilors.

691
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:22,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then the Brooks, can you just go back again?

692
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:23,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you said you were adding one.

693
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So what will that bring them from what to what?

694
01:15:27,264 --> 01:15:30,508
[SPEAKER_14]: They currently have one school adjustment Councilor, one school psychologist.

695
01:15:30,668 --> 01:15:34,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to increase that to two school adjustment Councilors and one psychologist.

696
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:42,096
[SPEAKER_14]: And that, again, is because... Because they have a large population of students, as well as significant need.

697
01:15:42,116 --> 01:15:48,081
[SPEAKER_14]: When I looked at what the counseling services were, they were robust at that school for a counseling caseload.

698
01:15:48,722 --> 01:15:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

699
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So even compared... I mean, I know the McGlynn is actually the largest school in the district, correct, elementary-wise, so even comparatively...

700
01:15:58,045 --> 01:15:59,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they ending up with, I'm sorry.

701
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:04,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they ending up with, so everyone's going to be bumped up basically to 2.0, it looks like.

702
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:05,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The elementary.

703
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:06,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

704
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:06,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

705
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:07,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

706
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,348
[SPEAKER_14]: The goal is to have two adjustment Councilors.

707
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:09,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

708
01:16:10,268 --> 01:16:10,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

709
01:16:10,628 --> 01:16:11,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

710
01:16:11,309 --> 01:16:11,969
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

711
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:15,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to be clear.

712
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:16,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

713
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:20,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Schulman stated that we added the position to the Andrews.

714
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:21,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an FY22 investment.

715
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:21,831
[SPEAKER_08]: So the FY23 is stable.

716
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:28,077
[SPEAKER_08]: at Andrews and staying consistent with its FY22 numbers.

717
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

718
01:16:32,866 --> 01:16:33,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other?

719
01:16:35,218 --> 01:16:35,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, didn't see it.

720
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:37,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

721
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I just ask a quick question.

722
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:54,371
[SPEAKER_17]: In past member Hays question just made me think about one of the things in prior budget books that would be helpful grounding for us all which is the population of students at each school because I

723
01:16:55,332 --> 01:17:00,157
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not my recollection that the McGlynn is the biggest elementary school in the district.

724
01:17:00,337 --> 01:17:03,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I found myself sort of thinking like, do I have that number?

725
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I shuffle through my papers and find it?

726
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:11,968
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that would be helpful to make sure we're all operating with the same enrollment set.

727
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:14,030
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be in the budget books.

728
01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:16,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ms.

729
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Galussi, can you

730
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:25,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any like brief rundown of the size of the different schools at the elementary level?

731
01:17:27,413 --> 01:17:28,613
[SPEAKER_16]: In regards to student enrollment?

732
01:17:29,753 --> 01:17:33,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, well, the two highest student enrollment schools are the Brooks and the Roberts.

733
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,648
[SPEAKER_16]: They both are around 520 to 540.

734
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:42,791
[SPEAKER_16]: The McGlynn would be next in line.

735
01:17:42,851 --> 01:17:47,193
[SPEAKER_16]: They are, I believe, at about 480, but I would have to double check that number.

736
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:51,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Missituk is a little closer to 425.

737
01:17:51,656 --> 01:17:59,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I would have to double check those numbers, but that's just the broad range of the four enrollments for the schools.

738
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:02,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

739
01:18:06,797 --> 01:18:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

740
01:18:08,357 --> 01:18:09,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

741
01:18:09,598 --> 01:18:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, thank you.

742
01:18:11,098 --> 01:18:22,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I also just want to know, and I know my colleagues know this, but also for those who are watching that, you know, that there's also this ratio of, there's numbers, but there's also a ratio of

743
01:18:25,357 --> 01:18:37,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Most vulnerable student population right so if we're talking about specific staffing it's not as we've said so many times before right equity is not that everybody gets the same equity is that everybody gets what they need.

744
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:42,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So just again, I just want to make sure that we're saying that there's nuances in the population, so even though.

745
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:52,870
[SPEAKER_06]: at face value, it might be, oh, this school has more, or that school has less, or any of those things, that there are different populations at each of the schools as well, as we know.

746
01:18:52,970 --> 01:19:04,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that as Mr. Teixeira was just saying a little while ago, and obviously I know that we as a committee are, and as central administration and other administrations are aware of that, but I'm not sure that the community as a whole is.

747
01:19:04,712 --> 01:19:06,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to point that out too.

748
01:19:07,252 --> 01:19:07,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

749
01:19:11,153 --> 01:19:11,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

750
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:13,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor.

751
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

752
01:19:19,684 --> 01:19:20,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

753
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:38,835
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think that is a really excellent point from Member McLaughlin and hoping that in the budget books, we can also, to some degree, describe some of the special ed and language-based classrooms that are happening in our barrack, because all the schools have different programming.

754
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:41,014
[SPEAKER_17]: they do have different needs.

755
01:19:41,334 --> 01:20:03,823
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's really important to be able to describe what happens in each building in a substantive way, even though that in itself is not gonna like paint the perfect picture of like who needs what, when, but I think just some commitment to like telling us like from a staffing perspective, what's going on in each building and what the student populations

756
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,340
[SPEAKER_17]: that we support there are, I think would be important.

757
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:10,381
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could just make sure that's in the final budget book, that would be great.

758
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:12,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

759
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, may I also just add to that?

760
01:20:14,502 --> 01:20:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

761
01:20:18,323 --> 01:20:18,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

762
01:20:18,843 --> 01:20:19,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member Mugla.

763
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

764
01:20:20,423 --> 01:20:30,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to point out to folks again who are watching, and I know Mike, the committee, fellow committee members and others in the field know this, but this can also be checked on Google.

765
01:20:31,305 --> 01:20:34,346
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just do Google school district profile Medford,

766
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:37,788
[SPEAKER_06]: know, Mass, DESE, and it will come up for each of the schools.

767
01:20:37,808 --> 01:20:40,991
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole breakdown, there's visuals, there's all sorts of things that are super helpful.

768
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:49,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would also just ask, and I'm happy to do screenshots if it helps, and send it to folks that are putting the budget book together, Dave, if it saves time or whatever.

769
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:54,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, as you know, I think we've talked about this before, visuals are always super helpful to me too.

770
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a really great visual on the DESE cover page for each of the

771
01:20:58,183 --> 01:21:03,587
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I know you know that the graphic would be super helpful if you wouldn't mind incorporating that with the with the brief narrative.

772
01:21:03,627 --> 01:21:05,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's helpful for others as well.

773
01:21:05,268 --> 01:21:05,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

774
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:08,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

775
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:24,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the specialized programming at each school community speaks both to how the school budgets are sort of come to life on a daily basis, but also with respect to the identity of that school community.

776
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think

777
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:35,425
[SPEAKER_08]: to the point that we discussed earlier that the budget is an opportunity for the community to get a peek inside the schools and understand how we're functioning as an organization.

778
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:38,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I think these would be critical pieces of information that we'd want to include.

779
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:40,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you to both members for that.

780
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:43,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

781
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:50,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're ready to go back to that slide and then, or a slide.

782
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:53,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

783
01:21:54,998 --> 01:22:00,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And so again, just going back to our categories that we've spent some time on tonight, I'm going to ask Ms.

784
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:06,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines to discuss a little bit about the personnel needs of the Health Services Department.

785
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:19,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the Health Services Department is a department that has grown in size considerably over the past two years for, I imagine, somewhat obvious reasons that has been made possible through the ESSER funding.

786
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:39,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a sort of determination we have to make now that we know that in some cases what we prioritize in health services during the pandemic out of necessity may well prove to be best practices that we want to pursue post pandemic.

787
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:49,704
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, we know that we as a district take great pride in the fact that we're very well staffed from a nursing perspective with two nurses

788
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:51,212
[SPEAKER_08]: per school.

789
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:55,917
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there is an exception to that in our alternative high school program at the Curtis Tufts High School.

790
01:22:56,618 --> 01:23:03,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, we fund only a .6 and that frankly was .6 more than we did prior to FY 22.

791
01:23:04,285 --> 01:23:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is one of a few staffing priorities that Ms.

792
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:09,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines will speak to.

793
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:13,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, bearing in mind that while tonight's an opportunity to articulate

794
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:27,478
[SPEAKER_08]: in totality, the priorities and objectives, there will be some decision making that needs to occur in the coming weeks with regard to the categorizing of the various priorities that we're discussing tonight.

795
01:23:27,518 --> 01:23:32,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for miscience priorities, because there's, I believe they're separated out into two slides.

796
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:35,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to point them out now.

797
01:23:37,283 --> 01:23:40,005
[SPEAKER_08]: The fifth row down in the slide that's on your screen.

798
01:23:40,645 --> 01:23:41,986
[SPEAKER_08]: We can go back to our laser pointer.

799
01:23:42,006 --> 01:23:42,486
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

800
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:53,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we go to the next slide, you'll see that there are a couple of other health services related priorities.

801
01:23:57,684 --> 01:24:00,906
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the, right.

802
01:24:00,966 --> 01:24:02,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So there, so it's essentially Ms.

803
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:04,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines I think can take it from there.

804
01:24:04,548 --> 01:24:05,789
[SPEAKER_08]: There's three staffing priorities.

805
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:07,370
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in different categories.

806
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:09,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And we thank Ms.

807
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines for the opportunity to advance

808
01:24:11,955 --> 01:24:16,216
[SPEAKER_08]: next slide and I think probably give the floor to Ms.

809
01:24:16,236 --> 01:24:16,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines.

810
01:24:18,397 --> 01:24:18,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

811
01:24:18,797 --> 01:24:19,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'll take it from here.

812
01:24:20,577 --> 01:24:32,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently we have 14.6 full-time nurses staffed, building-based, and then we also have our three float nurses through the ESSER funding.

813
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a total of 17.6 nurses.

814
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: That .6 position is at the Curtis Tufts and

815
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:49,891
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, I think the last time it was proposed to have a 1.0 full-time was in the 2018-2019.

816
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Wright proposed a full-time nurse over at the Curtis.

817
01:24:56,254 --> 01:25:05,738
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, the proposal was based off of 117 visits to nursing at the Curtis-Tufts that school year.

818
01:25:06,218 --> 01:25:09,080
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same timeframe of this year, the nurse that is there

819
01:25:10,378 --> 01:25:13,759
[SPEAKER_01]: three days out of the week has seen 578 visits this year.

820
01:25:15,379 --> 01:25:16,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite the increase.

821
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a lot of it could be considered situational due to COVID.

822
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the visits that she is experiencing over there, it is a lot of non-COVID related visits.

823
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:33,523
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few chronic health conditions that she's certainly seeing a lot of.

824
01:25:34,523 --> 01:25:35,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to

825
01:25:36,686 --> 01:25:49,626
[SPEAKER_01]: To talk about equity is every student deserves a nurse every day emergencies could happen at any time and I think it's an important thing to think about is not just, you know how many students are on the roster over there, but

826
01:25:52,576 --> 01:25:55,578
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide them the same services that we're providing every other student.

827
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And also when we're thinking about nursing services, we can't necessarily think about numbers.

828
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:07,889
[SPEAKER_01]: There are recommended numbers from the National Association of School Nurses for how many are nurses to how many students, but you also have to think about acuity.

829
01:26:08,509 --> 01:26:13,253
[SPEAKER_01]: One student, if they're significantly medically complex, could take up one nurse's full day.

830
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:18,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some things to think about, especially the way that Curtis operates.

831
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:20,899
[SPEAKER_01]: a new student could start there any day.

832
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:30,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that student needs nursing services, we, you know, we fumble to try to figure out how to fill it because we don't have that 1.0 scheduled right now.

833
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:42,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of maybe I go, maybe, you know, we get a call that there's an emergency and the closest nurse that is available gets in her car and goes, which is not fair to the school she's leaving.

834
01:26:42,116 --> 01:26:43,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not fair to the students at the Curtis.

835
01:26:44,718 --> 01:26:48,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be the reason why we are asking for a 1.0 nurse over at the Curtis.

836
01:26:50,048 --> 01:26:55,370
[SPEAKER_01]: The other position that we would like to have considered is a registration nurse.

837
01:26:55,930 --> 01:27:00,811
[SPEAKER_01]: So when students are registering for school, they have medical requirements that they need to meet.

838
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:04,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Massachusetts law that they meet those prior to beginning.

839
01:27:04,873 --> 01:27:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: We are noticing, to go back to Mr. Taxera's previous presentation, a lot of the students coming in from other countries have a lot more need in coming to school and being able to start.

840
01:27:16,956 --> 01:27:18,637
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get similar immunizations,

841
01:27:19,211 --> 01:27:21,773
[SPEAKER_01]: in infancy and childhood that we require to start.

842
01:27:21,813 --> 01:27:23,974
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of care coordination that goes with that.

843
01:27:24,675 --> 01:27:26,656
[SPEAKER_01]: They typically need several doctor's visits.

844
01:27:26,696 --> 01:27:28,197
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be set up with a doctor.

845
01:27:28,237 --> 01:27:29,818
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be set up with health insurance.

846
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are afraid to get health insurance or they don't want to, then we have to find free resources for them just for them to be able to start school.

847
01:27:38,203 --> 01:27:45,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these students have chronic health conditions that we also need to coordinate care for, for when they start school, just getting them into school

848
01:27:46,502 --> 01:27:52,003
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as much as it's important, we want them to start school early and not be waiting on a TB test.

849
01:27:52,263 --> 01:28:03,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to know that they're safe in school and we've set them up with a doctor that can fill that EpiPen prescription or can follow their asthma care because you need to be healthy to be educated and educated to be healthy.

850
01:28:03,225 --> 01:28:05,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would kind of be the role that this person would fill.

851
01:28:07,626 --> 01:28:11,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the retention of a 1.0 float nurse.

852
01:28:13,527 --> 01:28:22,615
[SPEAKER_01]: With COVID, as much as we can say, we're certainly out of the brunt of it, but we are still feeling the effects in the health services department.

853
01:28:22,955 --> 01:28:23,796
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still testing.

854
01:28:23,836 --> 01:28:25,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still getting students coming in with symptoms.

855
01:28:26,298 --> 01:28:32,523
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still vaccinations to track, and there are still significant

856
01:28:33,852 --> 01:28:44,041
[SPEAKER_01]: duties that are COVID related, including students who have previously had COVID that are now experiencing chronic health conditions because of their previous COVID diagnosis.

857
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,342
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of care coordination that goes into that.

858
01:28:46,382 --> 01:28:58,392
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some students with new onset diabetes, new onset seizure disorders, and a lot of hands-on nursing care goes into those students, and it is because of their previous diagnosis of COVID.

859
01:28:59,093 --> 01:29:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three positions that we are

860
01:29:02,047 --> 01:29:03,848
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for in the health services department.

861
01:29:05,029 --> 01:29:05,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

862
01:29:05,489 --> 01:29:05,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Hinds.

863
01:29:05,729 --> 01:29:08,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, again, just to go back.

864
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:09,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have a question?

865
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:10,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, sorry.

866
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:11,813
[SPEAKER_06]: May I have a question if no one else does?

867
01:29:12,813 --> 01:29:13,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

868
01:29:13,073 --> 01:29:13,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

869
01:29:14,594 --> 01:29:14,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

870
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:17,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what was the category for the Curtis-Tufts?

871
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:24,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're on a different slide, so I can see the categories for the registration and the float, which are E and B. What was the category?

872
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:24,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Category D, Ms.

873
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,141
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin.

874
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,982
[SPEAKER_06]: D for the Curtis-Tufts nurse.

875
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

876
01:29:28,803 --> 01:29:29,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

877
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:33,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is, and just to be clear, it's a addition of a 0.4.

878
01:29:33,837 --> 01:29:41,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not, the budgetary impact is not a full, we're estimating this year $70,000 per FTE budgetary impact.

879
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:46,204
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a slight increase from last year, reflective of the projected increases.

880
01:29:47,564 --> 01:29:57,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the, we have a good, it's the health services requests here are reflective of our categorization process with the Curtis Tufts,

881
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: $28,000 impact being Category D, meaning it is a priority, but it would be most appropriate for the operating budget if it were to be funded.

882
01:30:06,956 --> 01:30:12,401
[SPEAKER_08]: The COVID-related floating nurse related to the fact that, as Ms.

883
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:26,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines said, health services more than any other group is still addressing the pandemic-related challenges, and so that would be ESSER funded, were it not for the, frankly, that is listed as Category B, and I think

884
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:32,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Retrospect probably should be category C. So it would not be on the operating budget, but would be on the ESSER budget.

885
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:37,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And then category E is something that we believe is worthy of consideration.

886
01:30:37,351 --> 01:30:40,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we're referencing it publicly.

887
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:54,481
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, there are some additional internal deliberations that we have to go through before that were to make it into a final recommendation to the committee, which is something that Avery and I have discussed.

888
01:30:55,812 --> 01:30:57,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so thank you, Ms.

889
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:57,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines.

890
01:30:57,793 --> 01:31:04,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other, if there are no other health service-related questions, Ms.

891
01:31:04,938 --> 01:31:09,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Hines has logged a lot of time at school community meetings over the course of the last two years.

892
01:31:09,821 --> 01:31:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's anything else for Avery, it would be great to ask it now.

893
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:21,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I see one hand.

894
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:24,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Melanie, is your hand up from the previous question there?

895
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:26,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

896
01:31:26,687 --> 01:31:27,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're good.

897
01:31:27,688 --> 01:31:29,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

898
01:31:29,429 --> 01:31:30,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

899
01:31:30,129 --> 01:31:44,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we have the only other immediate specific personnel issue, if we could just go back to the previous slide, slide 12, Peter, if maybe we're already there.

900
01:31:44,817 --> 01:31:45,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Ms.

901
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:52,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen is prepared to speak a little tonight about the, you know, when we talk about special ed,

902
01:31:53,249 --> 01:31:55,410
[SPEAKER_08]: funding priorities coming into a new fiscal year.

903
01:31:55,910 --> 01:32:16,059
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always the case that the fixed costs associated with specialized transportation and tuitions are going to make up a significant bulk of the potential increase, but we do have a specific personnel-related priority with an underlying rationale that I was going to ask Ms.

904
01:32:16,099 --> 01:32:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen to expand upon briefly, and then we'll move through the remainder of the priorities.

905
01:32:23,313 --> 01:32:24,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

906
01:32:25,075 --> 01:32:31,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight I'm here to discuss with you the additional high school special education position.

907
01:32:32,382 --> 01:32:38,727
[SPEAKER_11]: We are asking for this additional position to meet the needs of our increasing population of students with disabilities.

908
01:32:39,848 --> 01:32:49,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked at, we reviewed the current programming and offerings for our special education students that are offered during this school year 21-22.

909
01:32:49,757 --> 01:33:02,608
[SPEAKER_11]: We also compared this information with course recommendations for each student and also the recommendations for their specialized services that were identified on their IEPs, which is their individualized education plans.

910
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:14,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Taking that into consideration, we also need to make sure that students are receiving all of their specialized services and meeting graduation requirements for all of their academic classes.

911
01:33:15,278 --> 01:33:27,705
[SPEAKER_11]: We reviewed the enrollment and the special education class size for the 22-23 school year and determine how many sections are required based on IEP needs.

912
01:33:28,546 --> 01:33:41,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We also, some of the significant factors that contribute to the need of the additional special education teacher is we are seeing a significant increase in the educational needs of students with disabilities

913
01:33:41,853 --> 01:33:44,554
[SPEAKER_11]: who are requiring more subseparate programming.

914
01:33:45,014 --> 01:33:53,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So that means students who require placement in one of our programs such as the therapeutic learning program or a learning group program.

915
01:33:54,177 --> 01:33:56,558
[SPEAKER_11]: We've actually, the teacher would be

916
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:03,029
[SPEAKER_11]: used or employed as a fourth TLP teacher.

917
01:34:03,809 --> 01:34:11,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And another reason for this request is that we've also seen an increase in enrollment for our rising grade nine students.

918
01:34:12,383 --> 01:34:18,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently our enrollment for grade nine students with disabilities is a total of 61 students.

919
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:24,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And the anticipated enrollment for rising grade nine students with disabilities for next school year is 80.

920
01:34:25,887 --> 01:34:35,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to give you an example, in the 2021-22 school year, there were seven students that required TLP English, which is our therapeutic learning program.

921
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:42,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is being projected that during the 22-23 school year, that 12 students will require it.

922
01:34:43,548 --> 01:34:51,532
[SPEAKER_11]: In special education, we have limitations on how many students we can have in a classroom with teachers and with paraprofessionals.

923
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So one section of the English was offered this year.

924
01:34:55,494 --> 01:34:58,596
[SPEAKER_11]: With 12 students, we would require an additional section.

925
01:34:58,976 --> 01:35:02,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And this would also be the case for the other subjects such as math,

926
01:35:02,998 --> 01:35:05,158
[SPEAKER_11]: English, Science, and Social Studies.

927
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:11,980
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's our justification for the request for an additional special education person at the high school.

928
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

929
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:15,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Fong.

930
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:26,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any specific questions for Joan that we might want to tackle at this moment?

931
01:35:26,522 --> 01:35:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

932
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:29,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

933
01:35:30,193 --> 01:35:31,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

934
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:33,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thank you, Miss Bowen.

935
01:35:33,255 --> 01:35:40,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you speak to why you're seeing an increase in subseparate programming at the high school level?

936
01:35:41,161 --> 01:35:46,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's subseparate in a therapeutic interventions.

937
01:35:46,085 --> 01:35:50,148
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeing students with increased anxiety, school phobia.

938
01:35:50,568 --> 01:35:56,512
[SPEAKER_11]: that are requiring a more substantial setting to meet their therapeutic needs.

939
01:35:56,612 --> 01:36:02,115
[SPEAKER_11]: So they need a smaller classroom, a smaller teacher to student ratio.

940
01:36:02,896 --> 01:36:16,685
[SPEAKER_11]: They also need the, there's the social emotional component to it with counseling that we're seeing an increased need for throughout the district, but especially at the high school level this year, this coming school year.

941
01:36:18,675 --> 01:36:24,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and the categorization is A, not under ESSER, is that right?

942
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:28,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Because is that not COVID related for the increase in the SEL?

943
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'm just curious about the categorization.

944
01:36:30,641 --> 01:36:32,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really good question, Ms.

945
01:36:32,422 --> 01:36:33,643
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin.

946
01:36:33,683 --> 01:36:46,129
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an instance in which, because it is staffing reflective of our priorities with regard to special education and making sure that

947
01:36:46,587 --> 01:37:10,002
[SPEAKER_08]: we're staffed in a way that continues to meet our obligation to provide a least restrictive environment, learning environments for students that yes, if it were to somehow not make it into the operating budget, we would, I'm not going to use the word exploit, but capitalize on the relatively broad eligibility criteria in the ESSER budget.

948
01:37:11,043 --> 01:37:15,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's being categorized as category A is a reflection of

949
01:37:16,442 --> 01:37:21,364
[SPEAKER_08]: the degree to which that doing this is a priority that transcends the COVID-related period.

950
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:44,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And so while I did say that this is not a hierarchy of prioritization, which is true because there's overlap within the categories, it's also true that the category A of which is the most limited group, you know, list of things, they are the most critical priorities in the sense that we, one way or another, we have to do them.

951
01:37:45,762 --> 01:37:54,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't think it's as appropriate to use the COVID-related funding because the priority extends beyond that.

952
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

953
01:37:58,654 --> 01:37:59,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

954
01:38:00,336 --> 01:38:07,103
[SPEAKER_08]: The categories, I would acknowledge, I would concede that the categorizing of some of these priorities is more of an art than a science.

955
01:38:08,037 --> 01:38:15,558
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's really reflective of how the criteria for ESSER eligibility is drafted.

956
01:38:16,138 --> 01:38:18,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a good example of that.

957
01:38:18,819 --> 01:38:20,779
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could go to the next slide in slide 13.

958
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep looking at my computer.

959
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:25,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't work.

960
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

961
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:31,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere in here is refurbishment of, oh, no, I don't think we've gotten there yet.

962
01:38:31,941 --> 01:38:36,522
[SPEAKER_08]: When we get to refurbishment of the locker rooms, I'll touch upon that point.

963
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:43,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, any other questions, uh, for miss, uh, for miss Bowen or any special education related.

964
01:38:45,398 --> 01:38:47,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, may I am there one other thing?

965
01:38:49,902 --> 01:38:50,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.

966
01:38:51,303 --> 01:38:56,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to reiterate again for, you know, folks watching, I know there are some folks watching that are concerned.

967
01:38:56,708 --> 01:39:01,452
[SPEAKER_06]: These are, these are the, uh, top priorities that we're sort of going through now.

968
01:39:01,512 --> 01:39:02,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Not obviously the entire

969
01:39:03,446 --> 01:39:04,507
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of department thing.

970
01:39:04,547 --> 01:39:16,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So just again, for folks who I think are worried about some other things that they wanna know about specifically regarding special education, these are primarily the priorities, as it says on the top of the slide.

971
01:39:17,634 --> 01:39:17,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

972
01:39:18,574 --> 01:39:18,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

973
01:39:19,015 --> 01:39:19,455
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin.

974
01:39:19,515 --> 01:39:32,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Priorities and also reflective of potential either significant strategic priorities that we think require sort of extra special attention to in public discussion of,

975
01:39:32,924 --> 01:39:37,548
[SPEAKER_08]: but also largely changes from FY22 over to FY23.

976
01:39:38,429 --> 01:39:42,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, as you know, we'll be talking a little bit tomorrow night and again next week.

977
01:39:42,752 --> 01:39:58,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if there are specific items that community members are concerned about, I would encourage you to relay those to committee members so that we can make sure that either we can answer the question offline, if that's appropriate, or use some of the time tomorrow or next week

978
01:39:59,437 --> 01:40:01,018
[SPEAKER_08]: to give each item.

979
01:40:01,239 --> 01:40:14,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, in a 67 to $70 million budget, we can't frankly highlight every single line, but that's not necessarily an indication of things important or anything along those lines.

980
01:40:14,889 --> 01:40:19,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to make sure that we're being clear about that and answering as many questions as we can.

981
01:40:21,094 --> 01:40:25,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I think then we'd be ready to go on to, it looks like slide 14.

982
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:30,933
[SPEAKER_08]: in which we move away from some of the personnel related items.

983
01:40:31,873 --> 01:40:51,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, to the point that was made, getting a personnel driven budget, that's why there's so much uncertainty and all these categories could shift and the district administration has to be prepared to implement whatever budget is ultimately appropriated and we'll do that.

984
01:40:51,668 --> 01:40:54,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're always planning to make sure that we're prepared to do that.

985
01:40:55,962 --> 01:41:05,509
[SPEAKER_08]: but you can see that the budgetary impact when we move away from some of the personnel related objectives is significantly reduced.

986
01:41:05,569 --> 01:41:07,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think Ms.

987
01:41:07,551 --> 01:41:15,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Layden is still on the call and we're gonna really talk more about some of the technology pieces tomorrow, but she's here now.

988
01:41:15,957 --> 01:41:21,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Molly, if you wanted to touch upon, actually the first one might be,

989
01:41:23,731 --> 01:41:28,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually can't remember if this was a john priority or molly priority but if either miss ball enormously and wants to speak to the iPad.

990
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:37,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it's, excuse me, john and to do you want to talk a little bit about the iPad investment and the, and the assistive technology piece.

991
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:38,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

992
01:41:38,285 --> 01:41:42,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the assistive technology for.

993
01:41:44,346 --> 01:41:54,512
[SPEAKER_11]: People who are here on the call, assistive technology in the classroom just helps to ensure students with disabilities that they have the same opportunity for education as students who do not.

994
01:41:55,593 --> 01:42:03,538
[SPEAKER_11]: So during the school year, the 21-22 school year, we've seen an increase in the need for assistive technology for our students with disabilities.

995
01:42:04,681 --> 01:42:14,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And the assistive technology is needed to meet the individual needs of students with disabilities enrolled in both in-district and out-of-district programming.

996
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:20,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of the examples of the assistive technology, as you can see on the list, is iPads.

997
01:42:20,756 --> 01:42:27,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And we use iPads as communication devices for students throughout the district, as well as our out-of-district students.

998
01:42:28,683 --> 01:42:37,446
[SPEAKER_11]: We use these for communication, and we have specific applications that we download on the iPads for the students.

999
01:42:38,206 --> 01:42:45,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And it could be communication apps such as TouchChat or Proloquo.

1000
01:42:46,349 --> 01:42:56,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And both of these apps assist students in communicating either through touching a picture, and it'll read it out loud to them, but we also,

1001
01:42:57,412 --> 01:43:06,216
[SPEAKER_11]: need to make sure that we have the appropriate cases for the iPads, any additional chargers and warranties and things like that.

1002
01:43:06,256 --> 01:43:11,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will be using these for communication devices for our students throughout the district.

1003
01:43:13,499 --> 01:43:13,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

1004
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen.

1005
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:16,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1006
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:20,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I was faking the first time I asked, but now I really mean it.

1007
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:21,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any other questions for Ms.

1008
01:43:21,682 --> 01:43:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen before we move on from the special education area?

1009
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:29,065
[SPEAKER_06]: May I, Mayor?

1010
01:43:29,846 --> 01:43:30,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1011
01:43:30,386 --> 01:43:33,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm not able to see you, but go ahead, Member McLaughlin.

1012
01:43:33,587 --> 01:43:38,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Just when you said before we move on from the special education, the next line item is the disability awareness training.

1013
01:43:38,648 --> 01:43:43,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and that looks like it's a high priority.

1014
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:48,391
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just wanted to confirm that folks know what that is.

1015
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:49,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if Ms.

1016
01:43:49,871 --> 01:43:52,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen needs to speak to it, but I knew it was the next line item.

1017
01:43:52,552 --> 01:43:57,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't want to move on until, or if she has a chance to talk about that, if folks wanted to.

1018
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:01,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Murphy, do you want me to speak to that?

1019
01:44:01,136 --> 01:44:05,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love, it's an important initiative, so I would love for you to speak to that as well.

1020
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:06,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, so we have

1021
01:44:09,471 --> 01:44:17,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was two years ago, maybe a few years ago we started a disability awareness workshop in the district.

1022
01:44:18,315 --> 01:44:28,800
[SPEAKER_11]: It was offered to all staff, administration, but we'd like to take it to the next level to continue our disability awareness training in the district, to have

1023
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:39,535
[SPEAKER_11]: either hire an outside consultant to assist us with this or to continue to continue the work that we're currently doing with in district staff.

1024
01:44:40,296 --> 01:44:43,958
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just to assist

1025
01:44:45,103 --> 01:45:08,050
[SPEAKER_11]: staff members with, you know, proper vocabulary and usage when we're talking about students with disabilities, but also how do we provide them with what they, you know, the difference between accommodations and modifications, and just making sure that everyone is truly aware of disabilities, how that impacts students, and how we can meet their needs within the district.

1026
01:45:09,286 --> 01:45:20,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And just point of information, I'm assuming also differentiated curriculum, that sort of initiatives that was also discussed around some of the disability awareness material, is that curriculum piece folded into this or not?

1027
01:45:21,853 --> 01:45:22,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's separate.

1028
01:45:22,934 --> 01:45:25,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The disability curriculum is separate.

1029
01:45:27,997 --> 01:45:28,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1030
01:45:29,057 --> 01:45:29,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1031
01:45:30,818 --> 01:45:31,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Jen.

1032
01:45:32,419 --> 01:45:36,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, again, I have seen very few

1033
01:45:37,947 --> 01:45:39,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Brady Bunch Squares right now, but if Ms.

1034
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:57,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Layden is still on the call and would like to speak a little to some of the other technology priorities, including classroom projectors, our robotics and coding supplies, and our potential, and I'll, while we determine if Ms.

1035
01:45:57,943 --> 01:46:01,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Layden is here and make sure she's able to speak, I'll just- I am still here.

1036
01:46:02,167 --> 01:46:02,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

1037
01:46:02,547 --> 01:46:02,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

1038
01:46:02,907 --> 01:46:03,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Layden.

1039
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:21,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Makerspace initiative is another piece that, again, I think we have a responsibility to capitalize on the relatively broad criteria for one-time related expenses that ESSER is a potential funding source for.

1040
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:32,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And so potentially looking at each of our elementary school libraries as a possible venue for makerspace areas is something that

1041
01:46:33,075 --> 01:46:35,916
[SPEAKER_08]: was identified by the technology department.

1042
01:46:36,116 --> 01:46:59,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And while it wouldn't necessarily be something that we ultimately would recommend being incorporated into the operating budget, we do think that it speaks to the district's responsibility for providing greater engagement opportunities amongst all learners and the heightened priority of that in the post-pandemic world.

1043
01:47:01,852 --> 01:47:15,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little more sort of, I was about to say earlier, a little bit more of a literal connection when we talk about refurbishment of some of the locker room space, in that we have locker room spaces that were used for storage during the pandemic.

1044
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:19,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the sort of tag, the DESI tagline of, that Ms.

1045
01:47:20,037 --> 01:47:30,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Kingdon from my office can remind me the specifics of, but the repair, respond, or it's not refurbished, but it's another R word.

1046
01:47:32,128 --> 01:47:51,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And the refurbishment, while we think it is a district priority, and perhaps it would have been something that we would have prioritized irrespective of the pandemic, given the funding available, we're hopeful that we'll be able to invest a modest, and just to be clear, it will be a modest investment in refurbishment.

1047
01:47:51,474 --> 01:48:01,657
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not some of the more imaginative and visionary priorities that have been discussed in the past, but a modest refurbishment to bring back our locker rooms to a more presentable,

1048
01:48:02,417 --> 01:48:13,003
[SPEAKER_08]: or more presentable landscape now that we don't need to be storing significant amounts of medical supplies in them.

1049
01:48:13,123 --> 01:48:28,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's modest both for a variety of reasons in terms of where it is in the priority list, but also everyone knows sort of the beginning stages of long-term planning for the flagship facility that we've started over the past month or so.

1050
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:35,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not the case that we're going to be looking at a wholesale rehabilitation of the locker room spaces.

1051
01:48:35,285 --> 01:48:43,189
[SPEAKER_08]: That will not be a recommendation that will be forthcoming, but a modest investment in refurbishment we think is a potential eligible expense.

1052
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:48,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But so that is a sort of, again, a more literal response to the pandemic.

1053
01:48:50,533 --> 01:48:51,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ms.

1054
01:48:51,153 --> 01:48:54,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Slater, if you want to just speak a little bit about some of our technology-related objectives.

1055
01:48:55,497 --> 01:48:59,321
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of projectors, supplies, and maker spaces.

1056
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:04,025
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also certainly very much connected to the work that we're doing now.

1057
01:49:05,518 --> 01:49:06,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, good evening.

1058
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:19,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a few items on there that although we've had significant investment in technology over the last two years, especially our one-to-one and staff device initiatives, there are some areas that we're still lacking in.

1059
01:49:19,989 --> 01:49:28,016
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those is we have about close to 40 rooms that actually do not have ceiling-mounted projectors in our K-8 schools.

1060
01:49:28,456 --> 01:49:34,461
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of those are kindergarten classrooms that when they were built didn't have projecting systems put in there, so they're using things on the cart, which is

1061
01:49:34,981 --> 01:49:36,762
[SPEAKER_10]: a little tricky for the little ones.

1062
01:49:37,243 --> 01:49:42,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So we looked at the best way to set up a projecting system in those classrooms.

1063
01:49:42,406 --> 01:49:50,372
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this point with technology being the way it is, we're looking towards putting interactive panels onto the walls rather than projectors at all.

1064
01:49:50,432 --> 01:49:56,056
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a newer, more reliable, less labor-intensive installation.

1065
01:49:56,156 --> 01:49:59,298
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've had several vendors come in and give us some

1066
01:49:59,778 --> 01:50:07,161
[SPEAKER_10]: quotes for that, and it will come to about that $90,000 to put in interactive flat panel displays.

1067
01:50:07,201 --> 01:50:16,104
[SPEAKER_10]: We brought some samples in to try in both an elementary and a middle school, although almost all of these devices that are going to get installed, at least initially, will be in the K-5 schools.

1068
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:22,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Only two in the middle schools, and actually those are both science classrooms, which just are difficult rooms to project in.

1069
01:50:22,286 --> 01:50:22,406
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1070
01:50:22,906 --> 01:50:38,469
[SPEAKER_10]: About 38 interactive panels and installed will come to about that $90,000 and those are are very badly needed that like I said everyone who needs projector has one but it's really not an ideal setup, especially for those kindergarten classroom so that's the first way we're hoping to be able to do.

1071
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,290
[SPEAKER_10]: for installations.

1072
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:55,837
[SPEAKER_10]: The maker spaces, we have a maker space that actually was funded both by city funds and Verizon at the high school, which literally was delivered right before we closed the door for COVID.

1073
01:50:55,917 --> 01:51:03,159
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are just bringing that back alive now that we can have shared spaces again and that has a lot of equipment in terms of 3D printer and

1074
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,783
[SPEAKER_10]: green screen and video production and robotics and a variety of things.

1075
01:51:10,224 --> 01:51:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Our intent was always to put those in every library in the school, in the district, but we started with the high school.

1076
01:51:17,328 --> 01:51:21,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We're bringing that one online and the hope is that we can do it in the K-8 schools as well.

1077
01:51:22,671 --> 01:51:25,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the limitation of that was our library staffing.

1078
01:51:26,174 --> 01:51:32,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if we can expand that library staff to be full-time certified librarians in each of those buildings, they can expand

1079
01:51:33,378 --> 01:51:40,602
[SPEAKER_10]: and deliver a robust library curriculum as well as support makerspace activities in each of those schools.

1080
01:51:40,642 --> 01:51:48,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So we wouldn't just put things out there that couldn't be guided use by the teachers, but we would have staff there who can actually do that.

1081
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:51,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a STEM as well as a library and literacy initiative.

1082
01:51:51,827 --> 01:51:54,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Molly.

1083
01:51:55,769 --> 01:51:57,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if there are no...

1084
01:51:59,210 --> 01:51:59,990
[SPEAKER_08]: immediate questions.

1085
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:04,051
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one more slide left on priorities, and then we can sort of talk through the implications of this.

1086
01:52:04,091 --> 01:52:15,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, you'll see here that this is an ESSER related slide, and then our loan F with an asterisk, which I foreshadowed for the committee a few weeks ago.

1087
01:52:15,193 --> 01:52:27,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year, we talked about the potential regression of students in their musical instruction based on first not being in school and then having

1088
01:52:29,135 --> 01:52:31,657
[SPEAKER_08]: heavily modified music classes.

1089
01:52:31,717 --> 01:52:41,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, and actually this is a good example along with the maker space of how we're looking at some of the $6.2 million in ESSER funding that's at the district's disposal.

1090
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:50,989
[SPEAKER_08]: While there will be some long-term initiatives and ongoing initiatives like extended school days, Camp Mustang and other summer programming that we will implement.

1091
01:52:51,329 --> 01:52:57,353
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also looking at ways in which we can essentially issue sub grants to areas of the organization that have

1092
01:52:57,786 --> 01:53:03,047
[SPEAKER_08]: specific priorities related to closing the gaps that have been caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

1093
01:53:03,147 --> 01:53:26,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the requests that came in from Dr. Rugginelli was the need to restock our instrument inventory, not just so that we can make sure that we have instruments that will attract students into one of the more engaging programmings available to them in the district, but also to make sure that we have sufficient inventory

1094
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:37,354
[SPEAKER_08]: of instruments so that when instruments need to be modified in order to afford students necessary accommodations, that we have the volume we need at our disposal.

1095
01:53:37,394 --> 01:53:53,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're looking at an estimated $20,000 or so investment in musical instruments to make sure that we never have a... First of all, so that we can attract even more students into some of the programs and that we can make sure that our music classes are

1096
01:53:54,217 --> 01:54:08,664
[SPEAKER_08]: are well positioned in terms of the equipment they need, but also to make sure that we have the level of accessibility that we need to meet students' needs, regardless of whatever other challenges they may be experiencing.

1097
01:54:09,425 --> 01:54:22,291
[SPEAKER_08]: On the note of just making sure that we're keeping students engaged, we had a successful music summer camp program that brought in a significant number of students last summer.

1098
01:54:24,076 --> 01:54:34,283
[SPEAKER_08]: that's been able to be scheduled in the latter part of August to make sure that it's not conflicting with some of the other summer programming that we have scheduled for the summer of 2022.

1099
01:54:35,283 --> 01:54:41,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we'll be investing in that again and going out and making sure that students and families are aware of that.

1100
01:54:41,987 --> 01:54:44,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something that they could address.

1101
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:48,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the visual arts side of the organization,

1102
01:54:50,227 --> 01:54:57,572
[SPEAKER_08]: in order to begin sort of thinking about the culture and climate issues that school communities are facing coming out of this period of significant disruption.

1103
01:54:58,392 --> 01:55:13,761
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at investments, ESSER funded investments in some programming that's been requested by the art educators, as well as setting up some community art displays that will help to enliven each of our school communities.

1104
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:18,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those are modest investments, but we think reflective of the broader priorities and goals

1105
01:55:19,194 --> 01:55:22,637
[SPEAKER_08]: and we wanted to just make sure that we had the opportunity to bring them to your attention.

1106
01:55:23,377 --> 01:55:31,784
[SPEAKER_08]: These last two rows speak to our stated goal of trying to reduce the fee-based services.

1107
01:55:32,204 --> 01:55:44,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna pause in case there are questions on some of those visual art and music priorities, and then we'll move on to some of the more complicated discussion on transportation and school lunch program.

1108
01:55:47,016 --> 01:55:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: May I?

1109
01:55:51,303 --> 01:56:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, yeah, I don't know if you guys can see the hand, so I also just sort of unclick, so I'm hoping I'm not jumping in front of any of my colleagues, but let me know if I am, please.

1110
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:09,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding the art programming and instruction, I wanted to ask Ms.

1111
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:12,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen, among others, and perhaps a question to her.

1112
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:18,639
[SPEAKER_06]: the director as well, or the arts teacher instruction, music teacher instruction.

1113
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:28,427
[SPEAKER_06]: We have heard, I've heard from a few people in the community, specifically around students with specialized instruction needs.

1114
01:56:29,228 --> 01:56:40,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, these are often the students who are most experienced in the most sort of exacerbation by the pandemic, around differentiation of curriculum.

1115
01:56:40,965 --> 01:56:50,009
[SPEAKER_06]: For the inclusion, we see a higher number of occlusion opportunities in these specials, specifically music arts PE.

1116
01:56:51,009 --> 01:56:55,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that obviously we've had adaptive PE this year, which is really wonderful.

1117
01:56:56,332 --> 01:57:02,875
[SPEAKER_06]: But families have talked a lot about the lack of differentiation in some music and art instruction.

1118
01:57:03,905 --> 01:57:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I think explicitly I've heard some and certainly the art.

1119
01:57:07,706 --> 01:57:17,607
[SPEAKER_06]: But so, as one can imagine, say in middle school, the students are learning about notes and sort of other aspects of theory and music instructions and what have you.

1120
01:57:17,627 --> 01:57:30,009
[SPEAKER_06]: A student perhaps with an intellectual disability or other disability not being able to access that curriculum because there's not necessarily differentiation around what is being provided in the curriculum.

1121
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Will any of this sort of

1122
01:57:33,773 --> 01:57:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Programmatic elements address that need.

1123
01:57:37,395 --> 01:57:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I don't know if this is for Ms.

1124
01:57:38,996 --> 01:57:48,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen or sort of just a question that I'm putting out in the air that we can address later, but it is something that I wanted to bring to folks' attention as something that's been brought to mind.

1125
01:57:48,822 --> 01:57:49,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1126
01:57:50,222 --> 01:57:51,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll certainly defer to Ms.

1127
01:57:51,263 --> 01:58:00,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen if she wants to expand upon this, but I will say on the musical instrument side, challenges very similar to what you're describing.

1128
01:58:01,137 --> 01:58:08,102
[SPEAKER_08]: were explicitly stated as one of the reasons that this was something that we needed to address.

1129
01:58:08,322 --> 01:58:28,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I can assure you that this is not the case for every single one of the priorities that have been discussed tonight, the number that was requested was lower than the number that we ultimately projected based on the level of concern that was met by the sort

1130
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:31,409
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of anecdotal information that was presented.

1131
01:58:31,429 --> 01:58:56,233
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea that we could have a student that we, you know, I don't think this is true widespread, so I don't want to suggest that somehow this is indicative of an issue that's overwhelmingly pervasive, but the idea that we could have a student unable to, you know, play the instrument that he or she wants because,

1132
01:58:57,701 --> 01:59:01,184
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't have enough of them to modify it, is totally unacceptable.

1133
01:59:01,804 --> 01:59:11,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I appreciate the educators in the music area who raised this concern, Dr. Ricciardelli, for voicing it.

1134
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:20,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And ultimately, based on that conversation, it's a slightly greater investment than was originally requested, because I think to your point, Ms.

1135
01:59:20,756 --> 01:59:26,059
[SPEAKER_08]: McLaughlin, there may be other instances of that type of deficiency.

1136
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,500
[SPEAKER_08]: that we don't know about.

1137
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:38,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the charge to the administration and the administrators responsible for this area is to make sure that we're going through and routing out any situations in which it does occur.

1138
01:59:38,862 --> 01:59:51,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, you know, it's under the sort of, if you know that they'll come, have a program that's well-stocked enough where no one ever has to, like, there's never the risk that could somehow deter someone from wanting to participate.

1139
01:59:51,924 --> 01:59:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my high-level answer based on sort of the story

1140
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:59,464
[SPEAKER_08]: that began us down the road of articulating this priority.

1141
01:59:59,504 --> 02:00:03,590
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, this phone may have more specifics that she could that she could speak to.

1142
02:00:04,906 --> 02:00:21,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, I think it we as a district need to look at our most vulnerable students in our elective courses and how we can better support them and also what sort of consultation and training that we can provide to our teachers that would.

1143
02:00:22,653 --> 02:00:24,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So every student can access music.

1144
02:00:24,694 --> 02:00:33,258
[SPEAKER_11]: You know we do have at the high school which I want to look into a little bit more to see how they are being modified and.

1145
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:43,008
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, what they're doing with the, how we're working with the teachers to be able to have students access those programs.

1146
02:00:43,568 --> 02:00:54,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I under, we're lucky at the high school level we have a music teacher that also has a special education background so there is an adapted music program that's going on.

1147
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:58,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know our high school teachers work really closely with ceramics and art.

1148
02:00:58,782 --> 02:01:05,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do we carry that over at the middle school and elementary levels to make sure that that's happening as well?

1149
02:01:09,206 --> 02:01:10,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

1150
02:01:10,247 --> 02:01:12,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And computer, but that's another issue.

1151
02:01:12,088 --> 02:01:12,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, thank you.

1152
02:01:14,429 --> 02:01:15,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the question.

1153
02:01:15,929 --> 02:01:16,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1154
02:01:16,249 --> 02:01:20,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we sort of, I can't see the hands as well either.

1155
02:01:20,451 --> 02:01:23,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to start talking about transportation and launch in case

1156
02:01:24,682 --> 02:01:25,543
[SPEAKER_08]: if there's any objection.

1157
02:01:26,303 --> 02:01:29,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I would say, so there's only two rows left.

1158
02:01:29,526 --> 02:01:37,633
[SPEAKER_08]: We ought to go back to the slides in a second, but just for purposes of this conversation, because I anticipate there could be questions, maybe we could just take the slide down for now.

1159
02:01:37,853 --> 02:01:40,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about these last two priorities.

1160
02:01:40,215 --> 02:01:41,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1161
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:52,605
[SPEAKER_08]: One is the transportation initiative that was implemented this year to provide free transportation for students outside of two miles through the MBTA passes.

1162
02:01:53,375 --> 02:01:56,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That program on average is costing us about $9,000 a month.

1163
02:01:57,157 --> 02:02:10,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I reported to you on April 11th, we think that that's, we have sufficient ESSER funding and the rationale with regard to that, I think continues into FY23.

1164
02:02:11,045 --> 02:02:16,868
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if the school committee chooses, we could continue to do that via the ESSER funding.

1165
02:02:18,008 --> 02:02:20,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It would frankly not be a significant,

1166
02:02:22,428 --> 02:02:26,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what I'll say for the time being and then take any questions.

1167
02:02:26,871 --> 02:02:42,182
[SPEAKER_08]: The lunch program initiative is frankly of a much different story because we at the moment are looking to get it ascertained with greater specificity where we are with regard to our revolving fund in our school lunch program.

1168
02:02:42,763 --> 02:02:49,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We're confident that we will have a surplus, but given that under the USDA regulations,

1169
02:02:50,368 --> 02:03:03,331
[SPEAKER_08]: all school lunches free right now, we are not confident that we can ascertain with certainty or with enough certainty, I should say, what the participation rate will be.

1170
02:03:03,951 --> 02:03:13,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the absence of that variable, it is difficult for us to project exactly what the potential cost would be of going to free lunch district wide.

1171
02:03:14,193 --> 02:03:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And so at this time, those numbers are too uncertain.

1172
02:03:18,054 --> 02:03:18,754
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration,

1173
02:03:19,295 --> 02:03:23,758
[SPEAKER_08]: can't recommend that we move forward with a free lunch across the district.

1174
02:03:24,179 --> 02:03:33,345
[SPEAKER_08]: We fully understand that this is a priority of the committee, and we have a responsibility to try to identify other ways in which we may be able to move in that direction.

1175
02:03:33,705 --> 02:03:43,372
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the moment, we're monitoring and hopeful about the legislation that's making its way through Beacon Hill, which would, frankly, absolve us of this problem.

1176
02:03:44,827 --> 02:03:56,730
[SPEAKER_08]: and certainly something that the district supports fully, but the implementation of that at the district level, I do think has a significant amount of financial uncertainty.

1177
02:03:56,770 --> 02:04:02,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we would be hesitant to recommend its implementation for next year, absent that legislation.

1178
02:04:07,834 --> 02:04:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

1179
02:04:11,495 --> 02:04:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1180
02:04:14,292 --> 02:04:14,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1181
02:04:15,713 --> 02:04:21,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say that implementing this is actually its current policy of the school committee that it will be included and implemented.

1182
02:04:22,635 --> 02:04:42,362
[SPEAKER_13]: So I understand that the recommendation is that we are not going to assume that we can afford this, but I would say that absent a school committee member, any one of the seven of us putting something on the agenda to reverse a decision that we have already made, I don't really see it as a optional program at this point.

1183
02:04:43,596 --> 02:04:48,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless I have the wording of the motion that we passed seven zero, which I'm happy to read.

1184
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:51,081
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody wants to see it.

1185
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:55,264
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the moment, it's the policy of the school committee that it will be free.

1186
02:04:57,146 --> 02:05:04,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I just, that's just a reminder because that didn't sound like it was being treated as our policy, when in fact it is.

1187
02:05:04,331 --> 02:05:08,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I want to say that I appreciate fully.

1188
02:05:11,894 --> 02:05:14,576
[SPEAKER_08]: the intent of the policy that was adopted.

1189
02:05:15,357 --> 02:05:23,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's from a principal perspective, it's one that the administration fully agrees with.

1190
02:05:24,843 --> 02:05:29,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not recall being consulted prior to the passing of that policy.

1191
02:05:29,806 --> 02:05:35,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that was introduced on the floor and I believe I was asked to speak to extemporaneously.

1192
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:40,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And the council that the committee was provided at the time

1193
02:05:41,238 --> 02:05:51,143
[SPEAKER_08]: was that for FY22, the implications of it were essentially non-existent because it was something that was being afforded to all school districts across the country.

1194
02:05:51,803 --> 02:06:09,872
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the committee wants us to move forward with this, we can continue to explore those options, but I have a responsibility to report to the committee that it has a uncertain financial implication and given all of the other uncertainty,

1195
02:06:12,548 --> 02:06:19,852
[SPEAKER_08]: in this budget that we're trying to develop, I think it takes on a degree of risk that would be imprudent.

1196
02:06:20,492 --> 02:06:23,414
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end, as you point out, it is up to the committee.

1197
02:06:25,475 --> 02:06:27,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

1198
02:06:28,676 --> 02:06:28,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1199
02:06:29,297 --> 02:06:32,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, for a second, want to discount what we're asking you to do.

1200
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:39,542
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a pretty heated discussion during the conversations around the discipline policy.

1201
02:06:42,076 --> 02:06:46,580
[SPEAKER_13]: even hinted that you all would just do what was right even if it was violating the policy.

1202
02:06:47,261 --> 02:06:55,909
[SPEAKER_13]: There were at least two of the senior administrative staff who were very unhappy with the notion that we would pass a policy where you could just violate it.

1203
02:06:57,090 --> 02:07:02,215
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that either we're gonna follow policy or not.

1204
02:07:02,935 --> 02:07:06,679
[SPEAKER_13]: And it can't just be when it's you don't like that sentence

1205
02:07:07,324 --> 02:07:14,369
[SPEAKER_13]: And I certainly respected and apologize for suggesting that we should just write a policy that you'll just violate when you feel the need to.

1206
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:24,797
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am completely on board with the notion that our policies are not, you know, if we leave wiggle room, we put the wiggle room in the language.

1207
02:07:26,438 --> 02:07:29,079
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we did for the discipline policy actually.

1208
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:35,421
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanna be clear that the policy we passed did not include wiggle room.

1209
02:07:35,802 --> 02:07:36,662
[SPEAKER_13]: There are seven members.

1210
02:07:37,142 --> 02:07:47,465
[SPEAKER_13]: If any one of us wants to write a motion to rescind that or it wouldn't be rescind at this point, but to make a motion to start charging kids for food, that would have to be on a regular agenda.

1211
02:07:47,585 --> 02:07:51,907
[SPEAKER_13]: And until that happens, I don't really think we're having a conversation about whether it will be in the budget.

1212
02:07:53,491 --> 02:08:03,059
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just my opinion based on the vote of seven members who in affirmative said we will no longer charge for food.

1213
02:08:03,639 --> 02:08:14,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but I think, and I appreciate that, but we're not charging for lunch right now based on the federal regulations and on the committee's directive, right?

1214
02:08:16,169 --> 02:08:17,570
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't charged anyone for lunch.

1215
02:08:18,131 --> 02:08:23,015
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm saying is that if you don't want us to charge anyone for lunch next year,

1216
02:08:23,927 --> 02:08:30,189
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to need to factor that into the budget, because there is going to be a cost associated with that.

1217
02:08:30,549 --> 02:08:36,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless, as I think we all hope, the legislature takes that out of our hands.

1218
02:08:37,551 --> 02:08:50,195
[SPEAKER_08]: At the moment, where the reason that I would be inclined to recommend that the directive be suspended, at least for the upcoming school year, is that I can't even tell you what that cost would be,

1219
02:08:50,815 --> 02:09:00,059
[SPEAKER_08]: because there's really no way of making a projection with respect to participation, which is what would in part determine the financial implication.

1220
02:09:00,439 --> 02:09:13,926
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it is necessary to talk about in the budget because if the committee feels as though we should continue to move forward with the mandate, then we're going to have to take a guess on the financial implication.

1221
02:09:15,026 --> 02:09:18,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It may cause a significant number of other disruptions

1222
02:09:19,672 --> 02:09:28,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't tell you exactly what those are because I can't tell you exactly what what the financial implication of it is so that that is why it's it's coming up in the in the context of the budget.

1223
02:09:31,123 --> 02:09:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy Thank you, Mr. Russo, and if I just may speak on on that issue I too want everybody to have free lunch and I pray that the.

1224
02:09:40,296 --> 02:09:44,338
[SPEAKER_03]: state comes through for us, cause it's a, could be upwards of a million and a half dollars.

1225
02:09:44,398 --> 02:09:47,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that that's clear.

1226
02:09:47,539 --> 02:09:59,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's between children that can afford it paying and teachers or professionals not having a job, we just, we have to weigh those options as we move forward.

1227
02:10:00,564 --> 02:10:01,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hays.

1228
02:10:06,089 --> 02:10:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I thought I, my understanding was that it was currently in the budget, the state budget to fund lunches through next year.

1229
02:10:14,814 --> 02:10:18,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone else has more information on that.

1230
02:10:18,736 --> 02:10:24,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, I thought that was kind of a done deal already, but it just, the budget isn't a done deal.

1231
02:10:24,959 --> 02:10:28,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, my understanding is that there's support, um, at the legislature.

1232
02:10:28,741 --> 02:10:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I'm hopeful, but this is something that would have a significant impact on our district.

1233
02:10:34,844 --> 02:10:34,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

1234
02:10:37,133 --> 02:11:05,777
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of one of those ones that we can't really rely on them because if we plan to implement this directive and we don't have a potential cost associated with it and the legislature for whatever reason does not, if it doesn't make it into the final version of the state budget, we could have created a significant problem for ourselves locally, which is again why I think we have a responsibility

1235
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:07,259
[SPEAKER_05]: discuss it here.

1236
02:11:12,381 --> 02:11:13,001
[SPEAKER_06]: May I, Mayor?

1237
02:11:14,741 --> 02:11:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1238
02:11:16,602 --> 02:11:22,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And but we won't know that right until July one, whether it's it's been passed in the governor's budget.

1239
02:11:23,023 --> 02:11:23,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1240
02:11:23,764 --> 02:11:26,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, presumably, yes.

1241
02:11:26,444 --> 02:11:29,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's been times where I don't think it'll be before July one.

1242
02:11:29,485 --> 02:11:32,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are times where certain provisions have ample support.

1243
02:11:32,866 --> 02:11:36,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can start to rely on it in times when you know, there are

1244
02:11:36,662 --> 02:11:41,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, continuing resolutions of some kind and it goes further into the summer.

1245
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:49,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But that sort of, I think more that sort of reaffirms the point that, um, there's a lot of uncertainty associated with this.

1246
02:11:53,688 --> 02:11:57,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor member Graham member herself.

1247
02:11:59,330 --> 02:11:59,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Um,

1248
02:12:01,132 --> 02:12:25,477
[SPEAKER_17]: If I recall back, maybe even like before the pandemic, when we were talking about a pilot, we did a pilot way back when, and a big central part of that was like tracking participation to help inform like whether we would qualify for some program or another after that.

1249
02:12:25,557 --> 02:12:28,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was this like predated Mr. Murphy for sure.

1250
02:12:31,415 --> 02:12:34,496
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I heard you say you can't size this.

1251
02:12:35,137 --> 02:12:42,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that because we're not tracking or because we lack data from the city in the revolving account?

1252
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Like why can't we size this?

1253
02:12:44,822 --> 02:12:46,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We can track participation.

1254
02:12:46,163 --> 02:12:52,986
[SPEAKER_08]: The concern is that with all of lunch being free this year, that participation could be at one number.

1255
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we were to charge, the participation would be another number.

1256
02:12:57,729 --> 02:12:58,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if it's free,

1257
02:13:00,678 --> 02:13:08,680
[SPEAKER_08]: in a second year, I mean, all of those variables could have an impact on what the potential reimbursement would be.

1258
02:13:10,901 --> 02:13:20,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that, again, if the committee wants us to attempt to do this, we can, but what would happen is we will have to come back with a number, with a projection.

1259
02:13:21,723 --> 02:13:28,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be inclined to be conservative with that projection because of the potential domino effect that would occur if we miss.

1260
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:41,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can put it to the committee for consideration, but there's a significant amount of risk involved with this.

1261
02:13:42,772 --> 02:13:55,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, the food services budget finished with an operating deficit of over a half million dollars, which we were able to pull back to some degree with some funding that we received subsequent based on

1262
02:13:56,513 --> 02:14:04,920
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriations related to specifically for food services and school districts, but the deficit was significant.

1263
02:14:05,301 --> 02:14:06,862
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect to surplus this year.

1264
02:14:07,923 --> 02:14:14,809
[SPEAKER_05]: But, again, to the point you just raised, we don't have those numbers to the penny at the moment.

1265
02:14:19,217 --> 02:14:48,284
[SPEAKER_17]: I think also before your time led by the mayor, the entire city signed a hunger-free pledge and advocates from the task force, I don't know exactly like the right term to use for the people actually trying to make sure that we politicians keep good to our commitment to make Medford hunger-free have reached out and asked us, asked several of us about

1266
02:14:49,136 --> 02:14:56,938
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, what, you know, what Medford Public Schools, you know, how Medford Public Schools fits into all of this.

1267
02:14:58,819 --> 02:15:08,941
[SPEAKER_17]: And what I have relayed to them is that I don't think there's any one on the committee who is not interested in proceeding as we have stated in our policy.

1268
02:15:09,122 --> 02:15:09,502
[SPEAKER_17]: However,

1269
02:15:12,002 --> 02:15:19,646
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, that is all contingent on funding that comes from the mayor and the city in terms of how we spend.

1270
02:15:20,027 --> 02:15:36,156
[SPEAKER_17]: And in lean times, we start to have to pit things like feeding kids lunch against administrators and that that's like never a good situation to be in because everybody loses when the community has to have that

1271
02:15:37,317 --> 02:15:45,500
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of debate about money as it relates to basic necessity and needs.

1272
02:15:45,580 --> 02:16:00,585
[SPEAKER_17]: So I say all that to say there are people who probably are or may not be on this call who are watching at the city level to make sure that the city keeps good on its promises that were unanimous.

1273
02:16:02,786 --> 02:16:04,706
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mayor, I don't know if they've reached out to you.

1274
02:16:04,726 --> 02:16:05,867
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's,

1275
02:16:07,065 --> 02:16:14,147
[SPEAKER_17]: or it sounds like there is actual activity happening on that task force that the school committee has not been made aware of, which I think is great.

1276
02:16:14,287 --> 02:16:20,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think the school committee needs to like be looped in somehow in a formal way, which I think was the intent.

1277
02:16:21,669 --> 02:16:34,552
[SPEAKER_17]: But overall, I think as we proceed, I think we do need to at least understand what it would cost to do this thing that we've all promised to do really rather excitedly and unanimously.

1278
02:16:37,048 --> 02:16:39,449
[SPEAKER_17]: at multiple times actually over the last couple of years.

1279
02:16:39,509 --> 02:16:49,891
[SPEAKER_17]: So I also think based on what I am hearing that the outlook is good and favorable from a statewide perspective.

1280
02:16:50,011 --> 02:17:03,254
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am of the mind that like, I want us to be ready with an understanding of the impact in case that goes South, but that I'm actually not overly worried that it will go South.

1281
02:17:03,374 --> 02:17:06,095
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want us to be prepared to be able to decide

1282
02:17:07,531 --> 02:17:11,663
[SPEAKER_17]: what the implications are for us if it does.

1283
02:17:12,857 --> 02:17:17,879
[SPEAKER_17]: But I know that's a lot of work and a bunch of information you may or may not have.

1284
02:17:17,939 --> 02:17:20,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know how best to proceed with that.

1285
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:22,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to be clear, it's more the latter than the amount of work.

1286
02:17:22,901 --> 02:17:25,222
[SPEAKER_08]: The amount of the work, I think is Ms.

1287
02:17:25,262 --> 02:17:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Graham's point where the committee feels unanimously about this.

1288
02:17:27,483 --> 02:17:31,565
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no one in the school administration that really wants to charge students for lunch either.

1289
02:17:31,585 --> 02:17:37,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, again, the philosophical underpinnings of this are something that we all agree with.

1290
02:17:37,167 --> 02:17:42,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've talked in the past about not wanting to have a public school system that's

1291
02:17:43,262 --> 02:17:46,965
[SPEAKER_08]: littered with with user generated fees to fund it.

1292
02:17:47,025 --> 02:17:50,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's unanimity of use on the preference here.

1293
02:17:51,328 --> 02:18:04,918
[SPEAKER_08]: But from a practical perspective, and I think just using the point that Miss Graham makes about the city, you know, when we make a budget request that's based on a number of FTEs, we can multiply those FTEs by this year 70,000.

1294
02:18:05,539 --> 02:18:09,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it turns out that some of the personnel we retain for those FTEs

1295
02:18:10,218 --> 02:18:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: costs a little bit more or a little bit less based on the experience of the individuals coming in, there's a certain level of, again, art, not science, to those projections.

1296
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:29,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can feel as though we're doing right by the committee and right by the community, as long as we're able to stay within that reasonable range.

1297
02:18:29,782 --> 02:18:39,364
[SPEAKER_08]: In a situation like this, in which we frankly, we can come up with a number, but I have a responsibility to tell the committee that it's not really based in anything

1298
02:18:40,555 --> 02:18:56,282
[SPEAKER_08]: particularly factual, and I have concerns that the number could turn out to be way off, then either the city could appropriate significant more funding that is necessary to advance this particular priority, or it could appropriate funding that could be very much short of that priority.

1299
02:18:56,682 --> 02:19:08,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that world, when we're advocating before the municipal government, the mayor and the council, I am hesitant to just not be able to recommendation that as a school administration, we can stand behind

1300
02:19:09,521 --> 02:19:10,801
[SPEAKER_08]: with a certain degree of confidence.

1301
02:19:10,921 --> 02:19:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I feel the need to flag this particular initiative.

1302
02:19:17,183 --> 02:19:22,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and I understand and appreciate that.

1303
02:19:23,524 --> 02:19:35,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think the other thing this committee needs perhaps more education on whether from the Food Security Task Force or somebody else is

1304
02:19:36,807 --> 02:19:45,295
[SPEAKER_17]: The value of providing free lunch has less to do with feeding a kid whose parents may be able to afford it.

1305
02:19:45,756 --> 02:19:47,057
[SPEAKER_17]: It is not about that at all.

1306
02:19:47,858 --> 02:19:55,365
[SPEAKER_17]: It is about opening up access to the kids who desperately need to be able to eat lunch at school.

1307
02:19:56,537 --> 02:20:06,401
[SPEAKER_17]: for a whole variety of reasons who may or may not qualify under the states program, whose parents may or may not want to qualify them under the free lunch programs.

1308
02:20:07,061 --> 02:20:13,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And when it becomes a normalized part of the process, everybody wins.

1309
02:20:13,604 --> 02:20:15,985
[SPEAKER_17]: And when every kid in school isn't hungry,

1310
02:20:17,005 --> 02:20:23,449
[SPEAKER_17]: every kid in school benefits from all the kids in school being able to focus on learning and not worrying about being hungry.

1311
02:20:23,529 --> 02:20:26,971
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like far from the expert in the room on this topic.

1312
02:20:27,151 --> 02:20:29,393
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there are people who feel way more passionately than I do.

1313
02:20:29,413 --> 02:20:41,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I think my suggestion for the superintendent, and I can follow up with you in an email, is that we find somebody from the Food Security Task Force to engage with us to make sure we're all on the same page about

1314
02:20:42,237 --> 02:20:50,423
[SPEAKER_17]: um, this program and how it fits into the master plan for the excited declaration that we made about being hunger free here in Medford.

1315
02:20:55,826 --> 02:20:59,329
[SPEAKER_05]: We can definitely follow up with that and provide that information.

1316
02:20:59,389 --> 02:21:10,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, um, I just, I think I wanted from the outset as I did last month, just flag this as something that, um, while there are some things that if, if,

1317
02:21:11,293 --> 02:21:14,315
[SPEAKER_08]: If our request is fulfilled, we know what we can do and how.

1318
02:21:14,776 --> 02:21:16,877
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, I don't even know what the request would be.

1319
02:21:16,917 --> 02:21:18,619
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just something we'll have to work on.

1320
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:21,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1321
02:21:21,041 --> 02:21:21,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1322
02:21:25,144 --> 02:21:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor.

1323
02:21:26,485 --> 02:21:28,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to call out a couple of things.

1324
02:21:29,107 --> 02:21:36,232
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I understand that there is literally no one, probably no one even in the entire Zoom here, who wants to charge kids for food.

1325
02:21:38,034 --> 02:21:38,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I'm wrong.

1326
02:21:40,397 --> 02:21:47,584
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the drop in participation is absolutely will happen.

1327
02:21:47,944 --> 02:21:54,870
[SPEAKER_13]: As we know this last year, participation was very robust over previous normal years.

1328
02:21:56,492 --> 02:21:59,434
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, the effects of the pandemic are not done.

1329
02:21:59,614 --> 02:22:01,336
[SPEAKER_13]: There are lots of people who are still hurting.

1330
02:22:02,097 --> 02:22:05,280
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Member Graham mentioned, there are lots of people for which applying

1331
02:22:07,636 --> 02:22:10,718
[SPEAKER_13]: represents in their minds a security risk to their families.

1332
02:22:11,219 --> 02:22:14,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not really an appropriate decision that anybody should have to make.

1333
02:22:15,181 --> 02:22:17,843
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think anybody here is saying that's okay either.

1334
02:22:19,304 --> 02:22:22,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a question about whether or not ESSER funds could be used for this.

1335
02:22:22,146 --> 02:22:26,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's an argument that they could.

1336
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:36,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's one of the, I mean, that might be something we have to look at, but this is one with an unknown price tag.

1337
02:22:37,396 --> 02:22:48,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And depending on what that price tag is, it could have a disproportionate impact on the availability of the ESSER funding, not in a way that I think somehow this could blow through, you know, multimillion dollars.

1338
02:22:48,939 --> 02:22:50,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that would happen.

1339
02:22:52,259 --> 02:23:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: But what could happen is that essentially we pump this issue down the road a year or two.

1340
02:23:01,361 --> 02:23:04,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as the ESSER funding is expiring, particularly if the

1341
02:23:05,586 --> 02:23:15,493
[SPEAKER_08]: if the appetite, the legislature has diminished for this, then we could just move this problem further down the road.

1342
02:23:16,354 --> 02:23:26,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would say just sort of like thinking about this from a political science perspective, if every district were to do that, the incentive for the legislature to do something about it would probably be diminished as well.

1343
02:23:28,622 --> 02:23:34,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't, again, I do think that, again, I don't want to,

1344
02:23:35,616 --> 02:23:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: interpret the ESSER eligibility in a way that is so liberal that it diminishes some of the other ways in which we're interpreting it.

1345
02:23:45,378 --> 02:23:55,660
[SPEAKER_08]: But my sort of gut reaction having reviewed ESSER 2 and ESSER 3 guidelines is yes, I do think we could probably construe them to include this.

1346
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:00,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if that would necessarily be a strategic or prudent thing to do.

1347
02:24:03,406 --> 02:24:04,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1348
02:24:04,326 --> 02:24:07,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been in contact with the Medford Food Security Task Force.

1349
02:24:08,228 --> 02:24:19,693
[SPEAKER_13]: They were reaching out about how we can, on the school committee, continue to move us towards the Hunger-Free Medford Proclamation that was made.

1350
02:24:19,713 --> 02:24:26,356
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had indicated that it is the current policy of the school committee that this will continue.

1351
02:24:28,057 --> 02:24:29,858
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't answer that as a school committee

1352
02:24:31,505 --> 02:24:34,027
[SPEAKER_13]: as our opinion, but in fact, it was already voted so.

1353
02:24:35,888 --> 02:24:44,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I think that the proclamation to make Medford hunger-free is, well, the city council made it.

1354
02:24:44,194 --> 02:24:55,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't actually remember if the mayor's office at the time was a participant in that, but, you know, it's three years old, two years old, the proclamation, three years old, I think.

1355
02:24:58,101 --> 02:25:03,105
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, that's not a lot of time to be deciding we're just gonna give up on proclamations that we made a big deal about.

1356
02:25:03,305 --> 02:25:12,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So not having this funded and free is moving us further away from making Medford hunger free.

1357
02:25:12,333 --> 02:25:14,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that should be universally understood.

1358
02:25:14,614 --> 02:25:25,143
[SPEAKER_13]: So if one direction is that there's nobody hungry in Medford, and one is that there are more people hungry in Medford, not including this in the budget will mean we have decided

1359
02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:36,059
[SPEAKER_13]: not the administrators, this is not a moral conversation about your desires and intent, but we will have decided to make Medford more hungry.

1360
02:25:37,641 --> 02:25:40,444
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a simple fact, can't be denied.

1361
02:25:40,604 --> 02:25:41,505
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1362
02:25:43,747 --> 02:25:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll report back on this.

1363
02:25:45,228 --> 02:25:48,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the committee has heard our concerns.

1364
02:25:48,832 --> 02:25:49,693
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to

1365
02:25:51,773 --> 02:25:54,794
[SPEAKER_08]: address this with as much specificity as we can.

1366
02:25:54,874 --> 02:26:03,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Just understand that I do think there's a little, there's a degree of speculation here that I'm not comfortable with that may turn out to be unavoidable.

1367
02:26:04,576 --> 02:26:07,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll present you with that information in the coming weeks.

1368
02:26:10,357 --> 02:26:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1369
02:26:10,917 --> 02:26:19,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're ready for the final two slides that sort of sum up where we've landed with regard to these priorities.

1370
02:26:19,639 --> 02:26:20,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess,

1371
02:26:20,770 --> 02:26:34,220
[SPEAKER_08]: As Dr. Cushing prepares slide 16 for us, I will say that just like the categories can potentially shift based on feedback from the committee and even some of the comments that were made tonight were very helpful and we appreciate them.

1372
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:48,270
[SPEAKER_08]: As other funding sources are identified or as we frankly just deliberate upon some of these priorities, between now and the time that the school committee adopts the budget,

1373
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:54,964
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll continue to communicate that clearly and make sure that the committee is aware of some of those fluctuations.

1374
02:26:55,344 --> 02:27:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember last year that their committee requested one number than the municipal government maybe appropriation, and there was a $760,000 Delta that needed to be bridged and so we identified some of the pieces, and I think it might have been the math coaches last year.

1375
02:27:11,371 --> 02:27:18,939
[SPEAKER_08]: we sort of had as a priority that had been listed throughout, but we had said that that might be something that there could be some wiggle room on.

1376
02:27:19,179 --> 02:27:23,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Frankly, that's another one this year that there could be some wiggle room on.

1377
02:27:23,863 --> 02:27:32,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the $71.4 million number, Representative Knight, another caveat that I always mention, and I will again, these are all approximations.

1378
02:27:32,932 --> 02:27:35,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you finally, when you get your budget book, if

1379
02:27:36,574 --> 02:27:44,857
[SPEAKER_08]: where we land is $71.4 million, it'll be $71 million, $430,000, and a few other numbers and some change.

1380
02:27:44,917 --> 02:27:56,101
[SPEAKER_08]: But for purposes of this discussion, if we were to incorporate category A only into the operating budget, we would be looking at a $71.4 million request.

1381
02:27:58,112 --> 02:28:15,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way we reach that number moving left to right is the 67.4 that includes the 2% in FY22 that has not yet been implemented and is still being negotiated, but has been identified throughout our budgeting process going back to last spring.

1382
02:28:16,584 --> 02:28:20,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's the fixed costs that bring us up to 69.9 million.

1383
02:28:20,627 --> 02:28:26,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the $2.5 million costs in contractual wage increases that are due in FY22.

1384
02:28:27,555 --> 02:28:38,221
[SPEAKER_08]: 23.

1385
02:28:27,615 --> 02:28:38,221
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your special education tuition and specialized transportation costs, and then a few other variable fixed cost increases that that we're projecting in the hundreds of thousands.

1386
02:28:39,541 --> 02:28:47,105
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to incorporate a 2% FY 23 cost of living adjustment that would bring that number up to 71 million.

1387
02:28:47,785 --> 02:28:52,168
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to incorporate all of the category a category B, that number would rise to 72

1388
02:28:53,338 --> 02:29:02,582
[SPEAKER_08]: but understanding that all of category B are items that we're prepared to support through the ESSER funding, that brings that number back down to 71.4.

1389
02:29:02,642 --> 02:29:10,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go to the next one, I think, just in terms of some final points on slide 17.

1390
02:29:12,147 --> 02:29:18,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I said this a lot last year, but we had a good conversation and appreciate Ms.

1391
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:18,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowman's

1392
02:29:19,489 --> 02:29:25,233
[SPEAKER_08]: participation tonight with regard to our special education costs, but those numbers in particular do fluctuate.

1393
02:29:25,293 --> 02:29:39,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're keeping a close eye on that, understanding that we'll see some budgetary relief in August, usually September at the latest with regard to our circuit breaker and IDEA funding.

1394
02:29:40,662 --> 02:29:42,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So there'll be some offsets there.

1395
02:29:43,224 --> 02:29:48,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Our responsibility is to continue to be looking for efficiencies and savings as we can identify them.

1396
02:29:49,172 --> 02:29:53,995
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a lot about the strategic considerations related to the operating budget and ESSER priorities.

1397
02:29:54,415 --> 02:30:09,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, that's about, is this one time, is this recurring, and also is this urgent and something that we need to implement in order to address student need and what is the nexus between that need and the pandemic and the disruptions related to the pandemic.

1398
02:30:10,604 --> 02:30:14,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Negotiations, again, that's our biggest budgetary driver.

1399
02:30:14,386 --> 02:30:17,268
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we've accounted for those to a large degree.

1400
02:30:17,844 --> 02:30:19,605
[SPEAKER_08]: and our FY23 projections here.

1401
02:30:20,206 --> 02:30:28,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And then regardless of what happens, we will continue to plan for any potential contingencies that may arise.

1402
02:30:29,413 --> 02:30:46,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And ultimately we understand that we're one component of the city of Medford and whatever that appropriation is, we are going to implement the FY23 budget in a way that prioritizes student needs and recovering from the disruption that we know all of our school communities have felt

1403
02:30:47,115 --> 02:30:48,156
[SPEAKER_08]: over the past couple of years.

1404
02:30:48,296 --> 02:30:59,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So tomorrow we'll talk a little bit more about some of our staffing issues and vocational school and some of the challenges that are facing our specific school communities.

1405
02:31:00,683 --> 02:31:03,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And we look forward to speaking with you.

1406
02:31:04,606 --> 02:31:10,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I don't, just from a timing housekeeping standpoint, we ran a little over our projected time tonight.

1407
02:31:11,610 --> 02:31:16,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I think the calendar invite suggested that the time was any longer, which I apologize for.

1408
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:17,881
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal was two hours.

1409
02:31:19,662 --> 02:31:36,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomorrow night, I wouldn't anticipate that being the case, but I do think that we'll need to pick this up again at your regular meeting on May 16th, and we'll be looking for feedback in terms of other issues or priorities that you think would be helpful to have a public platform to flesh out more fully.

1410
02:31:37,112 --> 02:31:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there are any final questions, I'm happy to take them, but I think we're good on the slides for the time.

1411
02:31:42,575 --> 02:31:42,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1412
02:31:44,569 --> 02:31:44,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1413
02:31:45,269 --> 02:31:45,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we go back?

1414
02:31:46,229 --> 02:31:46,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Nevermind, that's okay.

1415
02:31:47,870 --> 02:31:49,770
[SPEAKER_13]: We saw, that's okay.

1416
02:31:50,411 --> 02:31:53,331
[SPEAKER_13]: We saw, I was just gonna tell you what wasn't there that I wanted to see.

1417
02:31:53,411 --> 02:31:55,352
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not on the slide.

1418
02:31:56,372 --> 02:32:14,157
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see a column for if we included A, B and C, A, B, C and D, A, B, C, D, E. I really think that that, I mean, what was the point of all of the C, D and E's if we were not even gonna include them in a column anywhere?

1419
02:32:14,835 --> 02:32:20,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would hope that tomorrow we can have that same slide with all of those columns filled in.

1420
02:32:20,278 --> 02:32:27,883
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do understand there's some question marks on a few things where there's like no number at all, but I think we should have that.

1421
02:32:27,903 --> 02:32:30,264
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my opinion.

1422
02:32:30,324 --> 02:32:31,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Saad.

1423
02:32:31,505 --> 02:32:43,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more than happy to present that information, but I think the one clarifying point that I want to make is that this is most of the, these are all priorities that we think are absolutely worthy of public discussion.

1424
02:32:44,565 --> 02:32:46,346
[SPEAKER_08]: and making sure that the committee is aware of.

1425
02:32:46,926 --> 02:32:51,607
[SPEAKER_08]: They will not necessarily all make it into the superintendent's recommendation to you.

1426
02:32:52,507 --> 02:32:55,628
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still ongoing administrative vetting.

1427
02:32:56,109 --> 02:33:06,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And so while these priorities in a vacuum, frankly, if there wasn't some value to them, and in most cases, significant value, we wouldn't be taking up the committee or the community's time with them.

1428
02:33:08,524 --> 02:33:14,228
[SPEAKER_08]: our responsibility to sort of look at the budget as one complete coherent piece of information.

1429
02:33:14,308 --> 02:33:18,951
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be the case that there are some things that don't necessarily make it into that recommendation.

1430
02:33:19,011 --> 02:33:23,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So happy to provide all of that data so that you can see it and see the price tags.

1431
02:33:24,155 --> 02:33:31,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And I frankly think that's helpful for the community to see that the school department is not just showing up and asking to fund every priority we can think of.

1432
02:33:32,921 --> 02:33:37,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe, understand that this list does not represent every priority we could think of.

1433
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:37,925
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very imaginative

1434
02:33:39,006 --> 02:33:42,509
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be an endless list of ways that we could help students.

1435
02:33:43,470 --> 02:33:55,799
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think there is a responsibility to present something that is coherent and also within a certain degree of financial boundaries so that we can have a constructive conversation with the municipal government going forward.

1436
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:57,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1437
02:33:58,101 --> 02:34:05,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, you know, we have the new math curriculum that's a D or an E for the math coaches.

1438
02:34:07,901 --> 02:34:18,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And speaking to responsibility, purchasing something for which we cannot implement with fidelity is not responsible.

1439
02:34:19,563 --> 02:34:25,984
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why the math coaches are so recommended and important for the curriculum.

1440
02:34:27,125 --> 02:34:34,466
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would just say that I want the community to know when we land on a number,

1441
02:34:35,155 --> 02:34:55,864
[SPEAKER_13]: because we will eventually land on a number, that here's the list of things, and if you cared about a full-time nurse at the Curtis-Tufts, and that's C, D, or E, which forgive me for not having it memorized, you know, that there was a way for us to have funded those, and it was not about what the school committee asked for.

1442
02:34:56,144 --> 02:34:58,365
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's, you know,

1443
02:35:00,330 --> 02:35:08,214
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's the awkwardness that the mayor is also the school committee chair that we have to talk about the mayor and the third person sometimes, which I think is very weird.

1444
02:35:08,294 --> 02:35:14,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, we do not have direct taxation and we can't run a deficit.

1445
02:35:14,537 --> 02:35:23,361
[SPEAKER_13]: So everything that people want that's not on that list already, that's where it isn't happening from is the,

1446
02:35:24,912 --> 02:35:37,215
[SPEAKER_13]: City is not allocating the resources and Mr. Murphy does beat it up a little bit over and over again about how we're just part of the city's portfolio, but as is the case in many school committees, we are not.

1447
02:35:38,015 --> 02:35:44,317
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one responsibility, and it is not about how bad the roads are, how much money the rec department needs.

1448
02:35:44,903 --> 02:35:46,343
[SPEAKER_13]: have any other departments need money.

1449
02:35:46,383 --> 02:35:48,504
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not our responsibility to consider.

1450
02:35:48,644 --> 02:35:51,145
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have any way to get information about their needs.

1451
02:35:51,605 --> 02:35:52,705
[SPEAKER_13]: How could we consider it?

1452
02:35:53,905 --> 02:36:04,988
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that focusing on what the schools need to the complete exclusion of the other stuff, since we cannot ask or know anything about it is just responsible.

1453
02:36:05,028 --> 02:36:07,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's the only reasonable thing.

1454
02:36:07,209 --> 02:36:09,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think our roads are abysmal.

1455
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,710
[SPEAKER_13]: I drive them too.

1456
02:36:12,642 --> 02:36:15,823
[SPEAKER_13]: but we and the school committee don't have anything to do with the roads.

1457
02:36:16,103 --> 02:36:18,504
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your presentation tonight.

1458
02:36:18,524 --> 02:36:19,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I did appreciate it.

1459
02:36:22,925 --> 02:36:23,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hays.

1460
02:36:25,866 --> 02:36:29,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a question about process since this is my first time.

1461
02:36:31,687 --> 02:36:38,309
[SPEAKER_02]: As we digest all of this information, because there's a lot of detail, is there a chance to,

1462
02:36:40,346 --> 02:36:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to prolong the process, but is there a chance to ask questions about some of the things tonight?

1463
02:36:46,568 --> 02:36:54,630
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have more questions to ask later or to ask, I don't know, somebody outside of the meeting to ask.

1464
02:36:56,011 --> 02:36:59,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think both would be the answer to that question.

1465
02:37:00,552 --> 02:37:08,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there will be probably more time for questions tomorrow, but the sort of overall presentation and for a variety of reasons, sort of we dipped into some of what

1466
02:37:09,178 --> 02:37:13,161
[SPEAKER_08]: would be discussed particularly from a staffing perspective tomorrow night.

1467
02:37:13,241 --> 02:37:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So assuming people don't want to go through the whole list again, I would be inclined to do a more concise version tomorrow night.

1468
02:37:21,387 --> 02:37:29,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I want to make sure that Mr. Fallon has the opportunity to speak to some of the CTE programming that I know a number of committee members had asked about through the survey.

1469
02:37:30,273 --> 02:37:34,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have a few pieces on the operational side that we need to go through.

1470
02:37:34,517 --> 02:37:37,839
[SPEAKER_08]: But beyond that, tomorrow is sort of the one opportunity

1471
02:37:38,366 --> 02:37:40,747
[SPEAKER_08]: and then also at your meeting on Monday night.

1472
02:37:41,587 --> 02:37:58,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the other thing I would say in terms of the sequence, after the request is made to the municipal government, and then ultimately an appropriation is made, there's still the committee has the opportunity or has a responsibility to vote to adopt the budget based on that appropriation.

1473
02:37:59,394 --> 02:38:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at that time, there's opportunity for more discussion.

1474
02:38:03,556 --> 02:38:06,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And since at that point, we have more of a sense as to what the actual

1475
02:38:07,198 --> 02:38:14,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, quote unquote number is, um, bearing in mind that we still have some Esther operating considerations that we'll have to take into account at that point.

1476
02:38:14,762 --> 02:38:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that would be another opportunity to flush that out.

1477
02:38:19,024 --> 02:38:19,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1478
02:38:19,364 --> 02:38:20,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1479
02:38:21,305 --> 02:38:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1480
02:38:21,765 --> 02:38:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1481
02:38:22,505 --> 02:38:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1482
02:38:30,689 --> 02:38:33,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the presentation to all the department heads.

1483
02:38:35,992 --> 02:38:36,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1484
02:38:37,233 --> 02:38:39,234
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no further questions.

1485
02:38:39,454 --> 02:38:41,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have a meeting tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

1486
02:38:41,736 --> 02:38:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: after the McGlynn open house, right?

1487
02:38:46,939 --> 02:38:48,880
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a McGlynn open house tomorrow.

1488
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a few other meetings that the administration is involved in that will be coming out of immediately prior to the budget meeting.

1489
02:38:55,364 --> 02:39:00,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we look forward to seeing you tomorrow night.

1490
02:39:01,927 --> 02:39:02,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great, thank you.

1491
02:39:05,629 --> 02:39:06,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1492
02:39:07,315 --> 02:39:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn.

1493
02:39:07,896 --> 02:39:08,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor?

1494
02:39:08,236 --> 02:39:11,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Graham?

1495
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:17,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we take a vote to adjourn, I just wanted to say thank you to the team who put this together.

1496
02:39:17,906 --> 02:39:24,452
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually really like this format over what we've done in past years.

1497
02:39:24,512 --> 02:39:25,734
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's concise and it's

1498
02:39:27,814 --> 02:39:37,316
[SPEAKER_17]: a bit easier to follow given that it doesn't like stretch out over a series of like months, essentially, which is what has happened in the past.

1499
02:39:37,376 --> 02:39:42,857
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to say, I like this format.

1500
02:39:42,917 --> 02:39:51,999
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's clean and concise and it gives us like kind of gets us quickly to the place that we need to be to be having the right discussions.

1501
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,280
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that, I will second the motion to adjourn.

1502
02:39:58,135 --> 02:40:01,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn, seconded by Member Graham.

1503
02:40:01,839 --> 02:40:02,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

1504

02:40:05,782 --> 02:40:06,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

02:40:06,943 --> 02:40:07,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Hays?

1507
02:40:07,944 --> 02:40:08,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_13]: Member Kreatz?

1509
02:40:10,306 --> 02:40:10,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1510
02:40:11,708 --> 02:40:13,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

1511
02:40:14,891 --> 02:40:15,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:40:16,732 --> 02:40:17,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Mistel?

1513
02:40:17,753 --> 02:40:18,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1514
02:40:19,115 --> 02:40:20,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Soyes, Mayor Longo?

1515
02:40:21,757 --> 02:40:21,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1516
02:40:22,077 --> 02:40:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.
