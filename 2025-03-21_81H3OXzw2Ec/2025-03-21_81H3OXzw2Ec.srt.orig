00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:35,528
[SPEAKER_24]: The purpose of the Committee of the Whole meeting was to receive the recommendations and discuss the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Ad Hoc Committee for implementation of that, the parts of that act, and to create an audience for the city of Medford and to have the Community Preservation Committee established.

25
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:55,769
[SPEAKER_24]: The council reviewed those recommendations from the ad hoc committee, which was chaired by Councilor Knight and voted to accept the recommendations and to have them implemented into an ordinance to be sent by the city solicitor to the council for consideration.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,512
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to accept

27
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:02,883

[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

29
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:04,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

30
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:05,644
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

31
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:09,705
[SPEAKER_24]: That paper is accepted.

32
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:28,411
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-586 offered by Vice President Longo Kern be resolved that the city solicitor provide a written opinion of how the board of appeals was granting use variances, considering that the city council revoked the use variance in 1998 after initiative petition in November of 1987.

33
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:42,047
[SPEAKER_24]: be it further resolved that an opinion be issued with regards to how this affects the most recent use variance issued from the development on Middlesex Ave.

34
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:42,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

35
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

36
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:50,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have some questions with regards to the use variance issue.

37
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,993
[SPEAKER_05]: This resolution should read 1988, not 1998.

38
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1987, an initiative petition was placed on the ballot in which the people voted to get rid of the use variance, at which time the city council, Medford City Council, voted in 1988 to eliminate the use variance.

39
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:23,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that is in our ordinance right now, and I know there's obviously that issue that we're bringing an appeal for the Locust Street development, but I also question

40
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: the use of areas that was issued for Middlesex Ave in December of 2014.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that that was brought to court, I believe, by abutters, and it was back before the Board of Appeals to—it was sent back, remanded to the Board of Appeals, which they met on that issue a couple weeks ago.

42
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:52,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question—I'd like to just amend this paper, and in addition to asking the solicitor these questions, also ask

43
00:03:53,661 --> 00:04:08,191
[SPEAKER_05]: how the building department can issue a use variance for this Middlesex Ave property, when in fact we don't even, you know, they're not allowed by our city ordinance and by council vote of 1987.

44
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:15,755
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion as amended by Vice President Longo Kern.

45
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:17,677
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

46
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,318
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

47
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:20,479
[SPEAKER_24]: Carries.

48
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:20,519
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-587.

49
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:38,794
[SPEAKER_24]: offered by Vice President Lago-Curran, be it resolved that the city administration provide an update to the Medford City Council with regard to why Wright's Pond had an unexpected closure last week and what is being done to make sure that the pond remains open for the rest of the summer.

50
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:39,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

51
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

52
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:45,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I received complaints that Wright's Pond was closed last week.

53
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I also received additional complaints that I believe two or three days ago the pond was

54
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:54,499
[SPEAKER_05]: cut-offs, stating reasons that it was to capacity.

55
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:58,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just would like to get an answer of what happened last week.

56
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:07,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I guess we have an announcement that was on our desk tonight from Amaya Burke announces pawn regulations.

57
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:19,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if, you know, one of us wants to read it, but it looks like they're going to, just to summarize, it looks like we may not have enough lifeguards and they're going to start rotating people in and out of the water.

58
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:27,082
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're not going to stop people from coming into the pond unless the parking lot is full.

59
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:33,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, they're going to allow people with passes in, and they're going to rotate them out of the water.

60
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:37,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I understand, a couple days ago, people were quite upset they were being turned away.

61
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,615
[SPEAKER_05]: They buy their pass for the summer, which is only about eight weeks, and then they were being turned away and not allowed to come into the pond.

62
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:54,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was rumor or not, but somebody mentioned that the day passers were even allowed to go in, and then people who had bought the pass for the full summer weren't allowed.

63
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure.

64
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:02,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, something might have happened with regards to not having enough lifeguards and planning back a couple months ago.

65
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:11,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like this is something that should be planned on or about February of the year, because you do want to make sure that we have enough lifeguards to

66
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:17,249
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously allow anybody that has a pass to come to the pond for each and every day.

67
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:26,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just hope that next year we can plan a little better, get a few extra lifeguards, and hopefully we are turning anybody away for the rest of the summer.

68
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:28,012
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

69
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:32,353
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Vice President Longo-Kern, for approval, all those in favor?

70
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:33,533
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

71
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:37,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries, 16-588, offered by Vice President Longo-Kern.

72
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Office of Community Development update the Memphis City Council

73
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:54,719
[SPEAKER_24]: with regard to the speed bump that was supposed to be installed on South Street, be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council be provided a list of any locations that will have speed bumps installed within the next six months.

74
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President.

75
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

76
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: This more or less has to do with raised speed bumps.

77
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:09,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's a few councilors, especially Council Marks, who brought this issue up many times, and I know there's a few raised

78
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: speed bumps that were supposed to be installed and never were.

79
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we talked about this probably a month or two ago.

80
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:28,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also a speed bump that was supposed to be implemented, a raised speed bump for the Memorial Park, all the people that are using Memorial Park and parking on South Street.

81
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:33,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was supposed to be a raised speed bump on South and Winthrop on or about.

82
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:39,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember specifically talking to the OCD director about this probably a year and a half, two years ago.

83
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:46,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to get an update with regards to where we are with that speed bump.

84
00:07:46,788 --> 00:08:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only do we have an issue with everybody parking on South Street and going to Memorial Park and the safety, we also have the no trucking on Harvard, which is now bringing the trucks down South Street, starting to get complaints with heavy trucking going down South Street, getting onto the highway.

85
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:06,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think a raised speed crosswalk

86
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:15,792
[SPEAKER_05]: raised speed bumps are what is needed on South Street, and I hope that we can get that implemented, especially since that was in the works over a year ago.

87
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to move approval.

88
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:25,234
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval, I'd like to ask President Longo to concur, and all those, Councilor Marks.

89
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:32,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I think what Councilor Longo is referring to is raised crosswalks and not the speed bumps.

90
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Speed bumps are a little different.

91
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:34,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Raised crosswalks.

92
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Raised crosswalks.

93
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:49,206
[SPEAKER_17]: The pilot program and this council voted several times to get an update on Central Ave and Harvard when the raised crosswalk was going to be put in under the pilot program that then Mayor McGlynn implemented.

94
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:55,747
[SPEAKER_17]: The one on Winthrop street has been in place now for probably close to two years and it's doing its job over there.

95
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,968
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would agree with council Longo.

96
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:04,889
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole idea with this pilot program that was initiated two years ago was to see where else in the community

97
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:08,673
[SPEAKER_17]: we can use these raised crosswalks as a traffic calming approach.

98
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:15,534
[SPEAKER_17]: And now it's over two years and we only have a third of what we were promised in raised crosswalks.

99
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:24,156
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are other areas like Salt Street and other areas throughout the community that have been asking why aren't we seeing more of these throughout the community?

100
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,156
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would ask that we get a response back.

101
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:33,638
[SPEAKER_17]: This is at least the third time that I've personally requested a response on the two initial ones on the pilot program.

102
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,758
[SPEAKER_17]: that still have not been installed, Mr. President.

103
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,379
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I thank my colleague for bringing this up tonight.

104
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,481
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Longo Kern, seconded by Councilor Marks.

105
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,342
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

106
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:46,622
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

107
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,342
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion carries.

[SPEAKER_24]: I recognize Councilor Caviello.

109
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:53,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caviello requests for a suspension of the rules.

110
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:53,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:54,885
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

112
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:55,666
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_24]: Motion is recommended to take papers pertaining to the licensing subcommittee.

114
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:01,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if we could take paper 16-598,

115
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:30,381

236
00:16:52,834 --> 00:17:10,985
[SPEAKER_05]: During our budget hearings, we requested the lead levels that were last tested by the MWRA, and we were given the breakdown, which levels, the collection date was from August, the last week in August of 2015 on about 15 different, in 15 different areas.

237
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:16,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just asking, I know that recently the city hall water was tested and there were high levels of lead.

238
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:23,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could get a new lead level testing in 2016, it would be greatly appreciated.

239
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:34,484
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to make sure we're continuing to monitor and figure out ways that we can reduce the levels of lead in the city, obviously, for the benefit of the people that live here and work here.

240
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just ask that we request that the MWRA do another test, whether that be in August again or sometime within the next couple months, so that we can keep on top of it.

241
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:45,635

00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:30,056
[SPEAKER_22]: were contenders for the state title, however, things didn't pan out as well as we would have liked to see.

286
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:37,379
[SPEAKER_22]: The girls on the softball team certainly had a tremendous year, and I think Mr. Dempsey had a lot to do with that, Mr. President.

287
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:46,463
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been a dedicated public servant in our school system for a very long time, and he's also been a dedicated coach, mentor, and role model to the student athletes in Medford High School.

288
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,864
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd like to congratulate him on this achievement.

289
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,805
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that doesn't happen to

290
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:52,427
[SPEAKER_22]: coaches every day.

291
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:53,968
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't happen to coaches every year.

292
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:57,169
[SPEAKER_22]: It certainly is something that doesn't happen to coaches in their career.

293
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,850
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that being said, I think this is something that's worthy of recognition from the Medford City Council.

294
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,291
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd like to thank Mr. Dempsey once again for all he does for our community.

295
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,312
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion is approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Belli.

296
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:10,452
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

297
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,753
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

298
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,074
[SPEAKER_24]: Carries 16-592 offered by Councilor Knight.

299
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:19,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Ashley Eisner,

300
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:25,097
[SPEAKER_24]: on being named a Boston Globe 2016 High School Girls Softball All-Scholastic.

301
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:33,561
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved that in recognition of this momentous achievement, she be invited to a future council meeting for the presentation of a council commendation.

302
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:34,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor?

303
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:35,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Mr. President.

304
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,783
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this item and the prior item go hand in hand.

305
00:22:39,404 --> 00:22:44,646
[SPEAKER_22]: As many of you know, my father was a coach for a long time and he said it's easy to win games when you have great players.

306
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:46,748
[SPEAKER_22]: And he had a great player on his team.

307
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:51,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Ashley Eisner has done amazing things over her tenure as a Medford Mustang softball pitcher.

308
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:58,636
[SPEAKER_22]: And being named to the Boston Globe 2016 high school girls softball all scholastic team was really the capstone.

309
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:02,119
[SPEAKER_22]: She's going to go on and continue her career at the next level.

310
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,360
[SPEAKER_22]: And I wish her all the best of luck.

311
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,562
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'd like to thank her for her work here and her dedication as a Lady Mustang.

312
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:13,939
[SPEAKER_22]: The amount of success and attention that she's brought to the program is really unprecedented, Mr. President.

313
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:21,047
[SPEAKER_22]: The youth softball program is off the charts right now, and I think a lot of it has to do with the success of some of the older players that have gone through the program.

314
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:25,572
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that being said, congratulations to Ashley Eisner on being named an All-Scholastic.

315
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:28,396
[SPEAKER_22]: This too is an achievement that doesn't happen every day.

316
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:29,337
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not something that

317
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:38,898
[SPEAKER_22]: This is really a capstone to a great career, Mr. President, and I'm really just very, very happy for her and her family to see the fruits of her labor pay off.

318
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,060
[SPEAKER_24]: A motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

319
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,220
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

320
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,421
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

321
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

322
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:48,963
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-593 offered by Councilor Knight.

323
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:57,287
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby congratulate Marion King-Morata on her recent retirement from the Medford Public Schools.

324
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:58,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved that Mrs.

325
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:08,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Marauder be invited to a future council meeting for presentation of an official council commendation recognizing her service to the community.

326
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:09,054
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

327
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

328
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:22,198
[SPEAKER_22]: I think when we all think back to our times as students in elementary school or grade school or middle school and high school, you remember some teachers that had an impact on your life.

329
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:27,579
[SPEAKER_22]: And I first met Miss King at the time when I was a student in seventh grade.

330
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,788
[SPEAKER_22]: And we were at the Brooks Hobbs Elementary School, and Ms.

331
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:31,908
[SPEAKER_22]: King was my math teacher.

332
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:39,810
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just really think back to all that she did to help me achieve and succeed and to challenge me, Mr. President.

333
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:51,072
[SPEAKER_22]: And when I think back on those teachers that really helped make me the person that I am today, she's one of those that come to mind, along with people like Jack McDevitt and John McAdam and Buddy Kelly and Steve Maskell.

334
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,753
[SPEAKER_22]: But Ms.

335
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:53,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Murata was certainly

336
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:58,311
[SPEAKER_22]: one of the first people I met as a teacher that really inspired me to do more.

337
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:05,479
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can't thank her enough for her service to the community here, to the students in Medford, and to her dedication going above and beyond the call of duty.

338
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:11,885
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that she warrants a little bit of recognition based upon her many, many years of service, Mr. President.

339
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:14,468
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

340
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:19,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Her mother was the secretary at the Kennedy Elementary School when I was a kid.

341
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:26,335
[SPEAKER_24]: And those beautiful blue eyes of hers, the way she looked at you, you felt like a million bucks and you could do anything.

342
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:27,995
[SPEAKER_24]: And she was a wonderful woman.

343
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,156
[SPEAKER_24]: And Marianne's the same way.

344
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:31,497
[SPEAKER_24]: We're grateful to her.

345
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:33,798
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

346
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:34,878
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

347
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:35,798
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

348
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:36,639
[SPEAKER_24]: Carries.

349
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:39,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Councilor Knight, 16-594 be it resolved

350
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:52,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Let the Medford City Council hereby recognize and thank Cosmo Volpe on his service to the City of Medford as City Council appointee to the Hormel Commission.

351
00:25:53,338 --> 00:26:00,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved that Mr. Volpe be invited to a future council meeting for the presentation of a council commendation.

352
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:00,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

353
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, as I look at the agenda, I see Councilor Mox has a similar resolution congratulating Mr. Volpe.

354
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:10,022
[SPEAKER_22]: And I defer to Councilor Mox as the senior member.

355
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:11,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

356
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:23,764
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-596 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the long-time Home Health Commissioner, Cosmo Volpe, be recognized for his many years of committed service to the city of Medford.

357
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:26,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Marks, I apologize for me missing that Councilor.

358
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:30,649
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to clarify, I am the senior member in terms of length, not age.

359
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,411
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make that known.

360
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:41,217
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank Mr. Volpe, Cosmo Volpe, who served again with distinction

361
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:42,638
[SPEAKER_17]: for a number of years.

362
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:48,940
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember when he first got on the O'Hare-Mell Commission back some years ago, and we all remember how that field was.

363
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,640
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really a mud pit.

364
00:26:51,460 --> 00:27:02,243
[SPEAKER_17]: And when the City of Meffitt took over that field, Cosmo said his one wish was to create a state-of-the-art field for our students.

365
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:04,764
[SPEAKER_17]: And his vision came true.

366
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:09,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank him for his diligence on that particular issue.

367
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:22,255
[SPEAKER_17]: for the yeoman's work that has been done by not only Cosmo but the Hormel Commission itself to bring that park up to a nationally recognized park.

368
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:35,038
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's sought after and has a waiting list of different organizations throughout Massachusetts that are looking to rent that particular field because of its condition and the work that's being done.

369
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:37,118
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also been a number of

370
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:45,879
[SPEAKER_17]: projects to improve the infrastructure in regards to the lockers that are underneath.

371
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:52,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Most people see the stadium and the surface and the seats, and you don't realize there's a whole network underneath of locker rooms.

372
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:58,649
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's been a lot of work and a lot still needs to be done in improving the locker room area.

373
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:03,132
[SPEAKER_17]: But I want to thank Cosmo Volpe for his many years of service.

374
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:05,314
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with Councilor Knight that

375
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,724
[SPEAKER_17]: It would only be appropriate that he come up and receive a council accommodation.

376
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

377
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,894
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think anybody could put it better than that, Mr. President.

378
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:20,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Volpe has been a dedicated and committed member of the commission.

379
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:25,243
[SPEAKER_22]: He's kept this council and members of the council informed of the goings on just as required by his appointment.

380
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:35,665
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we can all see the transformation of Mr. Volpe's vision, and that of Mr. Buckley, actually, who he worked alongside with as members of the Whole Milk Commission to bring us to where we are today.

381
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:37,567
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to thank him for his service.

382
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:41,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Cosmo's been around a long time, and I hope he enjoys his retirement.

383
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

384
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:47,374
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval of 16-594, all those in favor?

385
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:48,755
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

386
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:53,879
[SPEAKER_24]: And on the motion of Councilor Marks for the approval of 16-596, all those in favor?

387
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,140
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

388
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Motions carry.

389
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:08,983
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-595, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of retired Medford firefighter Alan Jenkins on his recent passing.

390
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:09,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

391
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

392
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:17,727
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's safe to say that the Jenkins family is legendary in the city of Medford, especially in the Barry Park area.

393
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:21,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Alan served with distinction as a member of the Medford Fire Department.

394
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:27,596
[SPEAKER_22]: And he recently passed away due to some complications from, I believe, exposure to cancer, Mr. President.

395
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:39,521
[SPEAKER_22]: And as we spoke with the chief of police — I mean, the chief of fire during our budget debates, he said that one of the leading killers of firefighters and retired firefighters is actual exposure to cancer after retirement.

396
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:48,805
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I commend the fire chief for his initiative to begin to try to study that a little bit harder and put some safeguards in place.

397
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:52,489
[SPEAKER_22]: However, that does nothing to help the Jenkins family, Mr. President.

398
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,552
[SPEAKER_22]: And the Jenkins family is going to sorely miss Alan.

399
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:56,213
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I am.

400
00:29:56,273 --> 00:30:00,417
[SPEAKER_22]: I know many of the members down at the Medford Firefighters Club will as well.

401
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:06,423
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd just really like to extend my condolences to his family on his recent passing, because he was a great guy, and it will be sadly missed.

402
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:10,106
[SPEAKER_24]: So please join us in a moment of silence.

403
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:10,566
[SPEAKER_24]: All rise.

404
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,902
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-597, offered by Councilor Caviello.

405
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:42,732
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Hallmark Health on its arrangement with Tufts New England Medical Center that will ensure the Lawrence Memorial Hospital remain vibrant and healthy.

406
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:43,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caviello.

407
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:46,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

408
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:55,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a couple of weeks ago, it's been in the paper now, that Hallmark Health is on the verge of reaching an agreement with Tufts New England Medical Center, which will

409
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:59,379
[SPEAKER_19]: hopefully be the boost that it needs to keep it going within the community.

410
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:10,043
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity to talk with Alan McDonald the day before it was announced, and he was very excited about the things that are coming forward.

411
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:25,350
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things we talked about was keeping the emergency room open, and the possibility of maybe bringing a children's unit into Memphis, because of their affiliation with the Tufts Floating Hospital.

412
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:37,939
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a natural fit, you have Tufts University, Tufts-New England Medical Center, I think it'll be a good fit to the community, and I hope the Attorney General sees fit to pass this.

413
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:39,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

414
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:43,140
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Carfiello, all those in favor?

415
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,780
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

416
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

417
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:49,041
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend.

418
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:55,242
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take paper.

419
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Out of order 16601, communications from the mayor.

420
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:04,432
[SPEAKER_24]: To the president, all those in favor?

421
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:05,273
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

422
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:06,413
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

423
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:12,215
[SPEAKER_24]: Communications from the mayor, to the president, to members of the city council, from Stephanie M. Burke, mayor.

424
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:16,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Reappropriation request from Metro Public Library, OPM, and Architect.

425
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:23,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve

426
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:29,946
[SPEAKER_24]: an appropriation of $135,000 from certified free cash for the following purpose.

427
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:30,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Library.

428
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:33,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Library building renovations, 320-610-5303, 000-0000-896-2117, 000, of $135,000.

429
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:38,648
[SPEAKER_24]: As you are aware, the city is attempting to apply for funding from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners

430
00:32:53,568 --> 00:33:02,853
[SPEAKER_24]: which requires that the city hire an OPM, Owners Project Manager, and architect to facilitate the application for grant funding.

431
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:12,179
[SPEAKER_24]: The estimate is for $35,000 for the OPM and $100,000 for the architect, which is for the services to be rendered through grants submission.

432
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,220
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your consideration on this request.

433
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:21,304
[SPEAKER_24]: Director of Library Barbara Kerr will be on hand to answer any questions you may have.

434
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:23,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

435
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:27,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I'd like to commend the mayor for bringing this paper forward.

436
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:38,166
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this is probably on the heels of one of Councilor Caviello's resolutions to petition the State Board of Library Commissioners for some funding to see what type of work we can do to upgrade and renovate our library.

437
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:45,507
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a paper that I'm wholeheartedly in support of, but whereas it's an appropriation of $135,000, I think it might be nice to have Ms.

438
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:49,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Kerr come up and give us a little bit of a synopsis to back up this letter a little bit, Mr. President.

439
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:55,139
[SPEAKER_22]: But ultimately, it sounds like we're making steps in the right direction to fully fund our library and bring it up to a state-of-the-art facility.

440
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:55,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

441
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Cavillo.

442
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:57,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, of full disclosure, I am going to be part of the library building committee.

444
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:06,243
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want everybody to know that.

445
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:10,484
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I congratulate Barbara.

446
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:13,285
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first meeting we had.

447
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,806
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a daunting task for the city.

448
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,487
[SPEAKER_19]: We are under a pretty good timeline to get this done.

449
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:22,840
[SPEAKER_19]: If we miss this funding, the next one doesn't come around until 22.

450
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:33,983
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we're going to work hard and fast and hopefully get this done quickly so we can get the funding to put that second floor in the library and get the library refurbished.

451
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:37,604
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your positive leadership, Councilor, in this matter.

452
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Longo-Curran.

453
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:43,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to ask some questions after Barbara gives her overview.

454
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

455
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:45,642
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

456
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,404
[SPEAKER_24]: State your name and address for the record, Barbara.

457
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton, Massachusetts.

458
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,305
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, we're applying for a construction grant.

459
00:34:55,445 --> 00:35:02,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The Board of Library Commissioners issues them at irregular intervals, so fortunately, we are able to apply for the one.

460
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The grant submission is due in January.

461
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:10,391
[SPEAKER_06]: We are compressing two years' worth of work into about six months, but we are on track.

462
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:16,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a giant space building plan that is currently on file.

463
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being reviewed at Library Commissioners.

464
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:24,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And they gave us the okay to move forward to hire the project manager.

465
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:26,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And the project manager will help us to hire an architect.

466
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:30,105
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a building committee that's meeting tomorrow night for the first time.

467
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:31,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are on track.

468
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:34,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awful lot to do in six months, but I'm very confident.

469
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And our response from library commissioners has been terrific.

470
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:42,649
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very supportive, very up and they're doing everything they can to make sure that we succeed.

471
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:43,629
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

472
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:44,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam vice president.

473
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

474
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:45,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

475
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:53,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The application is due in January, you mentioned, and what does the application entail besides a building space plan?

476
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:56,155
[SPEAKER_05]: What else will the city and yourself have to get together?

477
00:35:56,475 --> 00:36:06,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll have the space plan, architectural drawings, schematics, feasibility study, cost estimates, a whole lot of different kinds of reports.

478
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,302
[SPEAKER_06]: hazardous materials, something from the Mass Historical Commission.

479
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:17,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know all of them offhand, but you end up giving them a very giant, a large binder full of reports.

480
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And the project manager and the architect guide you through the report part.

481
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:25,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And how much exactly are we requesting?

482
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:27,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know yet.

483
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:27,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for this, it's 135.

484
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:30,250
[SPEAKER_06]: For the whole building, we're not sure.

485
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:45,821
[SPEAKER_06]: At the moment, the space plan that I came up with turns us into 51,000 square feet as opposed to 29, and the library commissioner says it's a very ballpark figure of $400 per square foot, so we're looking at 20 million.

486
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:49,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably not gonna be that much, but it could be.

487
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:54,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice if it was, but we won't know

488
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,675
[SPEAKER_06]: definite numbers until the architect is finished.

489
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:02,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But what are we requesting, to redo the entire library?

490
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't know that either.

491
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,982
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to depend on feasibility studies and the condition of the existing building.

492
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:18,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And my suspicion is that they'll keep the shell, but we'll build up and they'll redesign it significantly, because there are a lot of accessibility issues at the moment, because it's built into the side of a hill, basically.

493
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:23,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really don't, the library commissioner said, don't try and design it in your head.

494
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:27,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait until the architect shows you what they're planning to do.

495
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:32,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll have a better idea of what the definite cost and the definite project will be.

496
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:42,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could just remind myself and the council and the public, I know we talked about it in committee of the whole meeting when we discussed the budget, but with regards to reimbursement and what,

497
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: what's the percentage of the grant and what will the city have to come up with?

498
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:47,521
[SPEAKER_06]: They pay for about half.

499
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Library Commissioners pays for half.

500
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They cover construction costs, they cover floors, ceilings, walls, the finished building, they pay for cabling wires, and they pay for shelving.

501
00:37:58,265 --> 00:38:10,289
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't pay for furniture, they don't pay for equipment, they don't pay for landscaping, and they don't pay for any of the costs involving moving us out of the building because at some point we're going to have to go somewhere else for probably 18 months while

502
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:12,684
[SPEAKER_06]: they do whatever they're going to do.

503
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's about half.

504
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:20,127
[SPEAKER_06]: We're intending to, as soon as we know whether we are on the list for a grant, we're going to mount a capital campaign.

505
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:32,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't know for sure if we're on the list until next June, but my impression is that unless we really mess everything up terribly in the next six months, we'll be fine, somewhere on the list.

506
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:37,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll find out if we get the grant sometime June 2017?

507
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:37,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

508
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're saying that we could get up to

509
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:45,703
[SPEAKER_05]: to 20 million, it could cost it up to 20 million, so that means the city portion would have to be about 10 million?

510
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, yes.

511
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:53,430
[SPEAKER_06]: They also, we aren't necessarily going to be constructing right away either.

512
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,393
[SPEAKER_06]: They put you on a waiting list and then they release the funds.

513
00:38:57,173 --> 00:39:01,437
[SPEAKER_06]: There is an option to go ahead with the construction and be reimbursed as well.

514
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:01,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

515
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did, do you know what the waiting time is?

516
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a couple of years, usually.

517
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:07,787
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.

518
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,447
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, what did she say?

519
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:13,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That within eight years, everybody who was on the list was taken care of.

520
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And she said at the last meeting that we would probably be in the middle of the list.

521
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:20,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is why the next application period isn't until 2020.

522
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

523
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:21,032
2022.

524
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:21,392
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

525
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:30,456
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to release funds every five years, and then they hit the last bunch for 10 because of the economic situation.

526
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:31,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

527
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:32,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it'll be a few years.

528
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:33,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

529
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:35,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

530
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:37,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

531
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

532
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:44,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, I'm very pleased to see this moving forward.

533
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:58,699
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, uh, it's also important to remember the history on this, that, uh, state law requires municipalities, uh, to put a certain percentage in their budget each year for maintenance and upkeep of public libraries.

534
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,781
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's also a provision within state law that allows for a waiver

535
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:16,733
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, when communities can't for whatever reason or don't prioritize forever, whatever reason, uh, funding for their library and the city of method put in a waiver for, I believe it was the past six years.

536
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:21,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, uh, that was, uh, unfortunate.

537
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:29,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also was unfortunate, Mr. President, because it took us out of the running for any state grants for the past six years.

538
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:42,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am very pleased to see we're moving forward on this now, but I am equally as disappointed in this administration and the past administration on the lack of funds for a public library.

539
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:47,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank Councilor Caviello because soon after last year,

540
00:40:48,367 --> 00:41:02,982
[SPEAKER_17]: When residents got together, and I believe that's the only reason why it happened, the administration in last year's budget funded it up to the allocation that we needed to be at to be eligible for state funds.

541
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:07,928
[SPEAKER_17]: We also lost recognition in the Minuteman regional library system.

542
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,931
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what I was told that- We were okay.

543
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:17,267
[SPEAKER_17]: I was told that our library card didn't work in other libraries because we weren't fully funding.

544
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:17,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.

545
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:22,470
[SPEAKER_06]: If we hadn't gotten a waiver, we wouldn't have been able to, but we were okay with that.

546
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:39,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I heard from, I heard from residents that went out of the network or I should say within the network and we're told that they couldn't use their card and because of the issues that we were having with the funding, but we can discuss that at another time.

547
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:41,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm pleased that this is, uh,

548
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:59,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving forward, Mr. President, many people in this community, you know, people I've spoken with feel that, yes, in this day and age with technology, there's a move away from books and so forth, but the library is much more of a resource than a paperback book.

549
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,596
[SPEAKER_17]: The library is a gathering place.

550
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:06,678
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a place where members of this community can meet and associate with each other.

551
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,340
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a place that someday I'd like to see

552
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,474
[SPEAKER_17]: have more particular gatherings and functions.

553
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:24,660
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you used to have a little kiosk in the front that every so often would be changed with one time you had political buttons from the last 100 years in a case.

554
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And I envision that within our library, something that can be used for much more than the purpose of a so-called library that we all have.

555
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:38,927
[SPEAKER_17]: And that may even involve getting a cup of coffee and a scone or, you know,

556
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,994
[SPEAKER_17]: much more than we currently use the library for now.

557
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:45,714
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank councilor Caviello for his insight.

558
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:53,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, and I hope we do get this fun, uh, funding and move forward on a state of the art library, which all of our residents deserve.

559
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:54,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

560
00:42:54,457 --> 00:42:54,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor.

561
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:56,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Falco.

562
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:57,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:42:58,017 --> 00:43:02,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I am too also very pleased that we're heading in the right direction with this.

564
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a far too long.

565
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:09,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see that we're moving forward and hopefully this, uh, project will come to fruition.

566
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:17,847
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as, and I know this is looking kind of further down the road, but you had mentioned that construction could take up to 18 months if things go as planned.

567
00:43:19,608 --> 00:43:24,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you given any thought to what would happen to the library during those 18 months and maybe where it would be?

568
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:28,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if Springstep is still empty, that would be a good place.

569
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually, probably isn't going to work here.

570
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:37,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually when they move a library out for construction, it's into a school or a

571
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:43,965
[SPEAKER_06]: depending, I don't know, we're pretty big, so there aren't any school buildings.

572
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:49,507
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend spent a year and a half in the gym at an elementary school, so I don't know.

573
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:53,888
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something we're gonna have to look at pretty seriously, because we do have a very substantial collection.

574
00:43:53,908 --> 00:44:03,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't take the whole thing with us, but we'd take my staff and a lot of our patrons, and we would need a significant space to operate out of for that period.

575
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:05,212
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a concern, because I know that there's

576
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:13,356
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a ton of books, computers, employees, and a lot of people use the library.

577
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:15,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great resource.

578
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:16,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great building.

579
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great community resource.

580
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:23,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just my concern, is that 18 months, a year and a half, that's a long time.

581
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to make sure that that service is still there for the residents of this community.

582
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it will be.

583
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:32,863
[SPEAKER_07]: but it'll be interesting to hear what the long range plan is.

584
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll have to look into that.

585
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:37,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Call the building committee as of tomorrow, we'll look into that.

586
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:37,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, good.

587
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:37,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

588
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:38,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

589
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, councillor.

590
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:48,416
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by councillor Caraviello, seconded by councillor Knight, I think the citizen behind you, ma'am wishes to speak.

591
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:50,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, sir.

592
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,639
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

593
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

594
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:53,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

595
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:57,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford Mass.

596
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:01,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Barbara Kerr for her excellent work at the library.

597
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,501
[SPEAKER_09]: She's wonderful.

598
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:04,022
[SPEAKER_09]: She does a great job.

599
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:24,080
[SPEAKER_09]: As libraries have computers, the educational and archival aspect of Access TV, specifically documenting our history, is a good reason, and we've discussed this before, of taking monies and creating a satellite at the library

600
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:29,716
[SPEAKER_09]: with this new construction as Arlington Mass now has a satellite across the street from Arlington High School.

601
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:33,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So their main headquarters is up in the heights at the old library.

602
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Coincidentally, it's the old library in Arlington that is the access center.

603
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:40,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they've put a satellite at the high school.

604
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,084
[SPEAKER_09]: We have access going into the high school.

605
00:45:42,464 --> 00:45:51,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Now is the time to look at this construction and say, wow, computers can go into here, tapes history of our sports teams,

606
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:54,524
[SPEAKER_09]: of the plays at the Chevalier.

607
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,606
[SPEAKER_09]: These can be documented month by month and put into the library.

608
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:11,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The library and AXS TV are a perfect synergy, exactly what the family that bequeathed the land to the city wanted it for, the documentation of things in an archive.

609
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:13,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think Barbara Kerr is the right person.

610
00:46:14,428 --> 00:46:20,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that this needs to be seriously considered because we have money sitting down there at City Hall, over half a million dollars.

611
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:35,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Now is the time if we don't get the money as Mr. Marks was talking about, Councilor Marks, maybe Councilor Marks and Brianna Longo-Kern can lead the charge and we can do this for the community and archive our sports history right there at the library where it belongs.

612
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:36,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

613
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight on the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello.

614
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:43,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Move approval, Mr. President.

615
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:45,756
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:49,480

00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:53,123
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

622
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:54,664
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Lowell-Kern?

623
00:46:54,824 --> 00:46:55,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

624
00:46:55,224 --> 00:46:55,765
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Marks?

625
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:56,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

626
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:57,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Scarpelli?

627
00:46:57,466 --> 00:46:57,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

628
00:46:57,807 --> 00:46:58,727
[SPEAKER_25]: President De La Russa?

629
00:46:58,887 --> 00:46:59,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

630
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:02,771
[SPEAKER_24]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

631
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:04,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Sixteen, Councilor?

632
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,289
[SPEAKER_24]: While we're under suspension, can we take 16602, please?

633
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:11,690
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-602.

634
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:22,234
[SPEAKER_24]: To the President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall Medford Mass, re-gift of $10,000 from East Cambridge Savings Bank.

635
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:35,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear Mr. President and members of the Medford City Council, in accordance with provisions of General Law, Chapter 44, Paragraph 53A, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the acceptance of a

636
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:43,819
[SPEAKER_24]: $10,000 gift from East Cambridge Savings Bank for the purpose of supporting the summer parks program in the city of Medford.

637
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:52,342
[SPEAKER_24]: This is the sixth consecutive year that East Cambridge Savings Bank has generously donated for this purpose.

638
00:47:52,522 --> 00:47:53,062
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

639
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:56,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, the summer's almost over.

640
00:47:56,723 --> 00:48:01,084
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we better accept this donation before Parks and Recreation is ended for the season.

641
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:12,787
[SPEAKER_22]: I certainly commend East Cambridge Savings Bank on their ongoing commitment to the youth of our community in helping subsidize our ability to provide recreational services to the youth of our community, Mr. President.

642
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,628
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that I've supported in the past and I'll continue to support.

643
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:26,412
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to thank them for the free money and thank you for being a great neighbor, but I think it's certainly a great gesture and I support it wholeheartedly and I move for approval and ask my colleagues to support it as well and ask for a roll call vote.

644
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:30,254
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

645
00:48:43,240 --> 00:49:07,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes with the vote of seven the affirmative none the negative the gift is a madam vice president Resident who wishes to approach Please state your name and address for the record Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

646
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:08,845
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 2d1 Park Street and

647
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:10,442
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys were really fast.

648
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:14,024
[SPEAKER_23]: I threw out my back, so it took me a little longer to get here.

649
00:49:14,044 --> 00:49:17,925
[SPEAKER_23]: You got through the rights pond thing already, which was what I had come in to speak on.

650
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,406
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you don't want to hear it, but that's too bad.

651
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:24,727
[SPEAKER_23]: The opening weekend was on June 25th, and I attended the pond.

652
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:32,370
[SPEAKER_23]: And they had hourly safety checks after 3 p.m., where they kicked everyone out of the beach because all the lifeguards needed to have breaks at the exact same time.

653
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:36,944
[SPEAKER_23]: I sent several, I made several calls and emails.

654
00:49:37,145 --> 00:49:38,805
[SPEAKER_23]: They were all returned from the mayor's office.

655
00:49:39,205 --> 00:49:42,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I had contacted the parks department because I've been going to the ponds for over 30 years.

656
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:44,448
[SPEAKER_23]: This was a new rule.

657
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:50,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Jeanne Camuso told me that these checks were a mandate from the Red Cross.

658
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,631
[SPEAKER_23]: So I called the Red Cross.

659
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:54,212
[SPEAKER_23]: The Red Cross says we don't make mandates.

660
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:55,352
[SPEAKER_23]: We just do training.

661
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,071
[SPEAKER_23]: Not sure why she would have said that.

662
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:00,672
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I read the lifeguard manual.

663
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:08,896
[SPEAKER_23]: I was lifeguard trained in my youth and they recommended rotations of lifeguards at 20 to 30 minute intervals so that they don't, their eyes don't glaze over.

664
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:12,478
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what the exact language was, just to keep them moving around.

665
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:14,739
[SPEAKER_23]: They did not recommend hourly breaks.

666
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:16,620
[SPEAKER_23]: No job recommends hourly breaks.

667
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,601
[SPEAKER_23]: On the 4th of July weekend,

668
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:22,328
[SPEAKER_23]: I tried to go to the pond again, and I was turned away.

669
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:23,829
[SPEAKER_23]: I was told that they were at capacity of 70.

670
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,332
[SPEAKER_23]: My mother and daughter were already in the pond.

671
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:28,734
[SPEAKER_23]: I texted them to say that I was not able to get in.

672
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,316
[SPEAKER_23]: They told me there were less than 30 people in the pond.

673
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:39,303
[SPEAKER_23]: So even when the crisis of having 70 people at the pond had passed, they did not allow more people into the pond.

674
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,861
[SPEAKER_23]: On Tuesday, July 7th, we had the first MFN concert.

675
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:52,863
[SPEAKER_23]: If we're only going to allow 70 people in the pond, perhaps we can't have these events because a lot of people do come on that night that don't wish to purchase a pass and swim.

676
00:50:52,923 --> 00:50:58,524
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we're going to shut it off at 70 for people that have paid for a pass, we probably can't have more than 150 were there on the July 7th.

677
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:06,484
[SPEAKER_23]: On Saturday, July 16th, I again attempted to go to the pond.

678
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,006
[SPEAKER_23]: At 4.30, I went by.

679
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:09,107
[SPEAKER_23]: I was told it was closed.

680
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,028
[SPEAKER_23]: At 6 o'clock, I drove by again.

681
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,009
[SPEAKER_23]: It was still closed.

682
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,232
[SPEAKER_23]: I find it hard to believe that during that time, no one had left the pond.

683
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:27,182
[SPEAKER_23]: So I called and spoke to Linda this time at the mayor's office, and although she was very polite, she told me that it must have been for safety and told me that it was a DCR mandate.

684
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:34,291
[SPEAKER_23]: So I read up on the Massachusetts law on DCR, which is number 302 under section 12.

685
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:37,972
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no regulations for Cassidy at beaches.

686
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:41,873
[SPEAKER_23]: I also looked at every single beach controlled by the DCR.

687
00:51:41,953 --> 00:51:45,374
[SPEAKER_23]: None of them had capacity limitations in any of their rules.

688
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:49,355
[SPEAKER_24]: So— Point of information, Counselor Knight.

689
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:53,076
[SPEAKER_24]: I do not believe the DCR has jurisdictional control over Wrights Point.

690
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:57,257
[SPEAKER_23]: Which is part of my point, because that's the answer that I was given by the City Hall.

691
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,398
[SPEAKER_23]: that they're pulling at straws, just attempting to give me an answer.

692
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:09,522
[SPEAKER_23]: I know when I used to call the mayor, the old mayor, I would speak to Rose, and if she didn't know the answer, she would say, I don't know.

693
00:52:09,562 --> 00:52:13,324
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me get back to you, which would have been a very acceptable answer.

694
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:18,227
[SPEAKER_23]: It would have been the preferred answer, because most citizens won't say, oh, it's a Red Cross mandate.

695
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,549
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, let me look up and see what the Red Cross mandate is.

696
00:52:21,229 --> 00:52:21,569
[SPEAKER_23]: I did.

697
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,550
[SPEAKER_23]: Called back.

698
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not true.

699
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:25,512
[SPEAKER_23]: Then I get, it's a DCR mandate.

700
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:26,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, research.

701
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:27,373
[SPEAKER_23]: Find out.

702
00:52:27,553 --> 00:52:28,093
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not true.

703
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:30,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Most people just say, oh, that must be the rule.

704
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:32,136
[SPEAKER_23]: That rule stinks, and I don't like it.

705
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:38,008
[SPEAKER_23]: So my biggest issue is that they seem to want to protect the new person.

706
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:39,128
[SPEAKER_23]: Her name is Helen.

707
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:47,874
[SPEAKER_23]: I was told by the Parks Department that she was hired by the mayor, which is fine, but she needs to learn how to do her job and do it properly.

708
00:52:48,754 --> 00:52:53,437
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I called- Ma'am, this isn't a public forum to criticize people specifically or to call them out.

709
00:52:53,457 --> 00:52:54,138
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it isn't criticism.

710
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:55,118
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not criticizing the mayor.

711
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:57,700
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not appropriate to conduct yourself in that manner.

712
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,255
[SPEAKER_23]: I think my manner is pretty appropriate.

713
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:04,357
[SPEAKER_23]: I said that I don't mind who hired her, but I do feel that she should learn to do her job.

714
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:09,578
[SPEAKER_23]: If she is saying that this is a Red Cross mandate and or a DCR mandate, then she does not know her job.

715
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:10,678
[SPEAKER_23]: I have researched these laws.

716
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:11,618
[SPEAKER_23]: You are welcome to do so.

717
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:14,599
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be more than happy to provide you with links to read them.

718
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,180
[SPEAKER_23]: I've spent quite a bit of time.

719
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:16,900
[SPEAKER_23]: I read the Lifeguard.

720
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,600
[SPEAKER_23]: I read the management manual.

721
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,021
[SPEAKER_23]: I read the lifeguard training manual.

722
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,381
[SPEAKER_23]: I've gone through lifeguard training.

723
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:23,202
[SPEAKER_23]: I read the DCR regulations.

724
00:53:23,862 --> 00:53:30,725
[SPEAKER_23]: So now I've learned that the mayor has posted information that she has decided that the pond is now a pool.

725
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:34,846
[SPEAKER_23]: The reason why the pond is a pool is because there are ropes around the swimming area.

726
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:36,807
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not what a pool is.

727
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:42,789
[SPEAKER_23]: A pool is not a body of water that's on, I believe she said, 148 acres.

728
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:51,981
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm concerned that we have a mayor now that can make ponds into pools.

729
00:53:52,882 --> 00:54:01,709
[SPEAKER_23]: She said it's 148 acres, according to her Facebook page, and they're going to be going by the regulations of CMR 105-435.23, which is about lifeguards in a swimming pool.

730
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:16,009
[SPEAKER_23]: It also states that if you go further down to the bathing capacity, section 27, the bathing capacity is anything under five feet is considered non-swimmable.

731
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:21,729
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyone who's been to Wright's Pond knows that the entire swimming area of Wright's Pond is a non-swimming area.

732
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:22,770
[SPEAKER_23]: It's under five feet.

733
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:32,571
[SPEAKER_23]: So the regulation would be that each person in the water would need a minimum of 10 square feet of swimming space, which is a capacity greater than 75.

734
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:35,972
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would welcome you to

735
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:44,323
[SPEAKER_23]: please have the pond turned back into a pond and not a pool to... Point of information, Councilor Knight.

736
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:55,530
[SPEAKER_22]: I do believe that the pond falls under the jurisdiction of the Parks Board and the pool, I mean the pond rules and regulations are established by the Parks Board or through the administration and the Parks Board's meeting this evening.

737
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:56,518
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

738
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,024
[SPEAKER_23]: I was, my mother was at that meeting and the mayor issued this in response to that.

739
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:13,477
[SPEAKER_23]: They did read this into the record at the meeting, which is why I'm here because the mayor has injected herself into this scenario and declared the pond a pool, which point of information, the pond is not a pool.

740
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:16,274
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not a pool.

741
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:17,955
[SPEAKER_23]: It should not be treated as a pool.

742
00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:23,099
[SPEAKER_23]: The pond's been running fine for 30 years, 40 years, however many years, maybe you know.

743
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,001
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's not a pool.

744
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:33,948
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that it's ridiculous that they're so bent on being correct that they're making things up in order to be correct.

745
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Even if you make them up, they're still not correct.

746
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:39,013
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hoping that somebody can fix this issue.

747
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:42,936
[SPEAKER_23]: I've had three weekends of problems at Wright's Pond.

748
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:43,877
[SPEAKER_23]: There's only five left.

749
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:48,401
[SPEAKER_23]: If they can't handle lifeguard management, perhaps we need to turn the pond into swim at your own risk.

750
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:49,662
[SPEAKER_23]: You can buy the pass.

751
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:52,824
[SPEAKER_23]: The parks people can check your pass, and you can go in and swim.

752
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:56,928
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that that's what people who don't like the length of time that the pond is open currently do.

753
00:55:57,428 --> 00:56:04,054
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that we need to, you know, I don't think her biggest act as mayor in July should be to ruin the pond.

754
00:56:04,074 --> 00:56:05,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

755
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,651
[SPEAKER_24]: On motion of council.

756
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Marianne Tomazook.

757
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:24,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 29 Garfield Avenue in Medford and I was at the Parks Commission meeting earlier.

758
00:56:24,238 --> 00:56:31,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed this part and I was dismissed and I was told they were not interested in the law.

759
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:35,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to speak about Rights Pond.

760
00:56:35,793 --> 00:57:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been having a problem since the first weekend and I have called the Mayor's Office and the Parks Commission and I have called the Parks and Recreation Office because of the, I was there the first weekend when they decided to have these, what Helen has called this new supervisor, well she said she was the director and she said she was the director and that the Parks Commission was now defunct and she was in charge of making all the rules.

761
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: She had a meeting with the Parks, Ranges, and the Lifeguards.

762
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:10,447
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the ones that told me this.

763
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:25,241
[SPEAKER_03]: She also told me that the safety checks that she was having every 50 to one hour for 20 minutes were mandated by the Red Cross, and it was a new state regulation, and that I could call the Red Cross and find out about it.

764
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:31,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did, and I spoke to Kay Thompson, who is the Aquatics Director of Massachusetts.

765
00:57:32,513 --> 00:57:36,535
[SPEAKER_03]: and said that the Red Cross instructs and certifies they do not make mandates.

766
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:42,398
[SPEAKER_03]: She wanted to know what state this woman was from because she'd never heard of anything like this before.

767
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not do these things.

768
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:53,144
[SPEAKER_03]: She said that Helen had told me that these safety checks, the reason they didn't check the water was because bodies float, so there's no need to check.

769
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:58,527
[SPEAKER_03]: The lifeguards leave so that they can get rehydrated and reapply their sunscreen.

770
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:01,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of rotating, the lifeguards

771
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: every 20 to 30 minutes as the lifeguard manual instructs.

772
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:07,455
[SPEAKER_03]: She was having them rotate every hour.

773
00:58:08,396 --> 00:58:12,838
[SPEAKER_03]: She is now doing it every 20 to 30 minutes, I'm happy to say.

774
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: But other things are not going as planned.

775
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,661
[SPEAKER_03]: On the July 4th, she closed it.

776
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I was one of the people that got in.

777
00:58:21,622 --> 00:58:29,585
[SPEAKER_03]: She was not allowing the people to get in as the pawn got lower and lower, down to 12 people at the end of the evening.

778
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:50,831
[SPEAKER_03]: She did start this past weekend going to the mothers of infants and toddlers and telling them they could not use the flotation devices that they had on their infants that our parents supervised, because as I said, they're infants and toddlers, so the parents have to be with them.

779
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Coast Guard certified.

780
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:56,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It says in the rights upon the Park Commission set these rules up last September.

781
00:58:56,195 --> 00:58:57,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there at those meetings.

782
00:58:57,936 --> 00:59:01,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says in the rules that are established there and are published there,

783
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:03,248
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are allowed to use them.

784
00:59:03,288 --> 00:59:05,029
[SPEAKER_03]: They say Coast Guard certified on them.

785
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:07,570
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents have to be there and supervise the children.

786
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was there present.

787
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:13,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I go at 4 o'clock usually in the evenings, and I stay till closed.

788
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:16,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And she saw them, and she let them use them all week.

789
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But on Saturday evening, she decided to tell them that it was no longer permitted.

790
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:30,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And she went up to each mother, she asked them their names, and then she told them how they couldn't use it anymore and told them to take the children out of the water.

791
00:59:32,538 --> 00:59:33,899
[SPEAKER_03]: The mothers all objected.

792
00:59:34,899 --> 00:59:38,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all over Facebook.

793
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: But the things that were allowed, and I tried to tell the Parks Commission, were mermaid tails, inner tubes, three-foot boogie boards, which she allowed the children to hold and then jump off of, noodles.

794
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:59,511
[SPEAKER_03]: She allowed Styrofoam boards, which were breaking apart, which I think are wrong, because these little pieces of Styrofoam all over not only pollute the water, but then

795
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:05,910
[SPEAKER_03]: animals in the water, the turtles, the fish, and the ducks and geese will choke on them.

796
01:00:06,191 --> 01:00:06,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hazard.

797
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to hear about that.

798
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They told me that that's not true because they don't allow it.

799
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was there.

800
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw them.

801
01:00:14,613 --> 01:00:15,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's allowed.

802
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:17,014
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask any of the people in Wright's Pond.

803
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: They are there.

804
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:19,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look at the Facebook posts.

805
01:00:20,135 --> 01:00:20,795
[SPEAKER_03]: They were there.

806
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But they told me, no, I'm a liar because that's not true.

807
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't allow them.

808
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:31,772
[SPEAKER_03]: The sand fights are unbelievable this year.

809
01:00:31,872 --> 01:00:34,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never seen sand fights like this.

810
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:37,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one of the lifeguards has stopped them.

811
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about older boys, 10 to 14 years old, having big globs of sand and throwing them.

812
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the lifeguards have stopped them.

813
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:47,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been telling the boys all year, stop.

814
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,940
[SPEAKER_03]: They just look at me like I'm crazy.

815
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, if you're not going to stop, your parents don't want you to stop, just go over there away from me.

816
01:00:54,065 --> 01:00:54,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

817
01:00:55,006 --> 01:00:56,207
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all fine.

818
01:00:57,048 --> 01:01:02,172
[SPEAKER_03]: But babies in the little flotation devices with their parents, that's not fine.

819
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:07,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the last straw was this letter, and I said that that letter was wrong.

820
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:09,039
[SPEAKER_03]: That law is wrong.

821
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:12,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, the mayor is using the wrong law.

822
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,825
[SPEAKER_03]: If she wants to use a law, she has to use the proper law.

823
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That law is a bathing area capacity for a pool.

824
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:22,653
[SPEAKER_03]: The swimming area is under five feet.

825
01:01:23,894 --> 01:01:26,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Wright's Pond, the whole bathing area is under five feet.

826
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:30,716
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I was out there with my granddaughter in the lap area.

827
01:01:31,297 --> 01:01:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That area is under five feet that I was swimming with my granddaughter in.

828
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:40,140
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole swimming area is under five feet.

829
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't use that rule.

830
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been going there for 57 years.

831
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never had a problem with capacity.

832
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:52,314
[SPEAKER_03]: The 4th of July, when it was closed, there were eight cars in that parking lot.

833
01:01:52,814 --> 01:01:56,595
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason for that pond to have been closed.

834
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:59,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is gross mismanagement.

835
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:02,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never had a problem like this in the 57 years I've been there.

836
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:07,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see that we should start ruining the pond now.

837
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:11,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't need to treat it like a pool, and somebody needs to do something about it.

838
01:02:12,281 --> 01:02:14,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's not pretend it's a pool.

839
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:16,303
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a pool.

840
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:18,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not over five feet.

841
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:23,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't use a rule that says it's over five feet and it's 25 lifeguards.

842
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:27,810
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to use the rule, go find the correct one and go by square footage.

843
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd have to have over 300 people in that water.

844
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:35,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And there has not been over 300 people in that water all summer.

845
01:02:36,014 --> 01:02:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

846
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:45,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, please state your name and address for the record.

847
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:47,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

848
01:02:47,336 --> 01:02:49,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Rob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

849
01:02:49,756 --> 01:02:50,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to be really brief.

850
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:55,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to the park department meeting earlier tonight.

851
01:02:56,678 --> 01:03:09,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, there's, there's a little bit of conflicting information based on what the park ranger that was there, what, what he said and the citizens that, that came before us.

852
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:12,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I mean, if it's,

853
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:20,616
[SPEAKER_10]: if it's in the purview of this city council, if you have any bearing over the parks department, I don't know if you fund them, if you vote for them on the budget.

854
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:29,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I would suggest that the rules, that somebody from the parks department that should come here and give their side of the story.

855
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:42,071
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, the park ranger that was there is saying that there was always two officers at the base of Wright's Pond, and as people left, he allowed people to come in.

856
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:50,102
[SPEAKER_10]: But according to the citizen that was here tonight, that is conflicted, and she's reporting something else.

857
01:03:50,282 --> 01:03:59,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it is what the citizen said, it comes down to that the residents of Medford are paying a fee to use this.

858
01:04:00,326 --> 01:04:07,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, it's sometimes getting denied, even after they're paying for it.

859
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:20,050
[SPEAKER_10]: With all due respect, that translates to other things in the city of Medford, where our tax dollars and we're not getting the basic fundamental services.

860
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:38,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very serious issue that I just hope that, based on the conflicting reports that are there from an objective outside observer, from having been at the meeting earlier and hearing what my fellow citizens said,

861
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:43,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an important issue to look into further, and that's my humble suggestion.

862
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:44,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

863
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:53,208
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Nyland.

864
01:04:53,429 --> 01:05:02,955
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, through the chair, I know we have the city solicitor in the audience, and I'm sure that he has not reviewed CMR 105.435.23, but if we could maybe make a request that

865
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:19,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We do look into that and see if there's any way we can make sure that the proper rule is covering rights pawn versus being a pawn, not a pool.

866
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the capacity levels are completely different, and I think that's probably if we could

867
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:31,192
[SPEAKER_05]: respectfully request that the mayor relook at this announcement she sent out on the 19th, that maybe we can resolve the matter.

868
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:34,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm not so sure that it needs resolution.

869
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:36,517
[SPEAKER_15]: The acting director of the Board of Health is here.

870
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,718
[SPEAKER_15]: He may be able to address those concerns tonight.

871
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:39,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

872
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:47,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Dr. Marino.

873
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:49,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Not quite.

874
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Councilors.

875
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:53,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Richard Marino,

876
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:55,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Interim Director of Public Health for the city.

877
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:04,234
[SPEAKER_16]: There are distinct standards for swimming pools and for bathing beaches.

878
01:06:05,274 --> 01:06:09,937
[SPEAKER_16]: The regulations of the Commonwealth for bathing beaches address water quality only.

879
01:06:10,978 --> 01:06:13,559
[SPEAKER_16]: They do not govern beta load or lifeguards.

880
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:20,443
[SPEAKER_16]: The lifeguards are trained though for pool safety.

881
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:23,525
[SPEAKER_16]: They take their water safety very serious

882
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:40,185
[SPEAKER_16]: In their defense, it's not a bad axiom to limit the bather load within the pond so that the lifeguards have a comfort level that they're achieving safety.

883
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:46,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Periodic census checks, accounts, probably not a bad idea.

884
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,875
[SPEAKER_16]: yet there are no standards for the bathing beaches.

885
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:54,257
[SPEAKER_16]: They're using what I would call a good operating principle.

886
01:06:56,759 --> 01:07:02,943
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a law, but I think that it's something that I would support and endorse.

887
01:07:03,544 --> 01:07:11,450
[SPEAKER_16]: I would want the lifeguards to always feel comfortable that they're supervising to a diligent level of safety.

888
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:17,474
[SPEAKER_16]: However regrettable, I don't see that there would be any need

889
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:20,430
[SPEAKER_16]: to limit cars in the parking lot.

890
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:27,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Neither the pool code nor the bathing beach standards address capacity of the car parking lot.

891
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:35,738
[SPEAKER_16]: We would hope that on a voluntary basis that they would be able to cycle people in and out of the water.

892
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:42,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that when there's thunder, there's an all-out order.

893
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:45,282
[SPEAKER_16]: When there's lightning, there's a different all-out order.

894
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:53,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the history that occurred here.

895
01:07:53,928 --> 01:07:57,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just hearing what was reported and purported tonight.

896
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:07,499
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could, I'd entertain any questions, but I just wanted to clarify that there are distinct regs and the pertinent sections were provided for you.

897
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:11,722
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Max.

898
01:08:12,803 --> 01:08:13,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Marino.

899
01:08:14,664 --> 01:08:15,805
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess my question is then,

900
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:22,060
[SPEAKER_17]: why do we have to distinguish whether we want to refer to it as a pool or a pond?

901
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:34,368
[SPEAKER_17]: If a CMR only applies to pools, according to what I'm hearing, why can't we apply safe standards, which I agree with you, there should be standards and so forth for public safety.

902
01:08:34,928 --> 01:08:37,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do we need to then revert and say, this is a pool?

903
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:40,451
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not calling it a pool.

904
01:08:41,232 --> 01:08:43,293
[SPEAKER_17]: According to the mayor, she's calling it a pool.

905
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:50,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's a conclusion that I didn't understand.

906
01:08:52,955 --> 01:08:56,256
[SPEAKER_16]: The rule is a pool rule, but it's not a bad rule.

907
01:08:56,616 --> 01:08:59,157
[SPEAKER_16]: But she's not saying that Wrights Pond is a pool.

908
01:08:59,217 --> 01:08:59,737
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not.

909
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:00,537
[SPEAKER_16]: It certainly is.

910
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:02,158
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a freshwater bathing beach.

911
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:04,879
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

912
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:09,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe some of the confusion would be then that we're setting new standards.

913
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I don't remember these standards in the past.

914
01:09:13,827 --> 01:09:18,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and we're setting new standards now, which is under the authority of the park commission, correct?

915
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,773
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't speak to what has gone on before this, you know, before today.

916
01:09:25,614 --> 01:09:25,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

917
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:31,657
[SPEAKER_17]: But, but any rules and regulations is under the authority according to city ordinance under the authority of the park commission.

918
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:44,733
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the mayor unilaterally wanted to make pool regulations implemented, she would have to go before the park commission to do so.

919
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:56,399
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time, I believe that the mayor's guidelines are to rotate swimmers on a voluntary basis.

920
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,540
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a hard rule.

921
01:09:59,881 --> 01:10:00,541
[SPEAKER_16]: It just is not.

922
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:02,683
[SPEAKER_16]: At a bathing beach, it is not.

923
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:08,114
[SPEAKER_16]: So the lifeguards would have to volunteer to be rotated?

924
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:10,355
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

925
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:33,083
[SPEAKER_16]: That if the lifeguards feel uncomfortable after doing a census of the number of bodies within the water, and they determine that the bather load exceeds their comfort level of, say, 25 bathers per lifeguard in supervision, that they could ask for people to come out and give other people a chance.

926
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:37,935
[SPEAKER_17]: And has that happened in the past or you're not aware because you're relative?

927
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:39,595
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not aware because that was not present.

928
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:46,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I made only one inspection all season and the, uh, the attendance was sparse, but it was early in the day.

929
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:57,644
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess what I'm saying, if, if this isn't past practice, then maybe this should have been a rule and regulation that was voted on by the park commission and maybe they did vote on it, but I'm not aware of it.

930
01:10:58,205 --> 01:11:04,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's why we're hearing concerns from residents because people that have gone to rights pawn for many, many years,

931
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,216
[SPEAKER_17]: are unfamiliar with these new rules and regulations.

932
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:16,082
[SPEAKER_16]: I can only assume that they're displeasures from being excluded altogether.

933
01:11:18,284 --> 01:11:25,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Not every person that drives to the pond will empty the entire car load into the water area.

934
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:33,014
[SPEAKER_16]: So in other words, if five people are in a car, maybe two might go in the water, maybe five might go in the water, maybe none of them may go in the water.

935
01:11:35,383 --> 01:11:40,786
[SPEAKER_16]: parking spaces has little to do with the bather load, in my opinion.

936
01:11:40,866 --> 01:11:48,930
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that I'm interested in health and safety and I want to respect the lifeguards comfort level.

937
01:11:50,771 --> 01:12:04,438
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it's a huge responsibility to try to determine how many people are in the pond, you know, without doing periodic head checks, how safe the pond is

938
01:12:06,132 --> 01:12:09,235
[SPEAKER_16]: if there's so many people in there that they can't even see the bottom.

939
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:15,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Plus, the sand is, you know, not an easy background.

940
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:25,008
[SPEAKER_16]: In a modern pool, you know, it's a light blue color, and it's very easy to see how many people are in the pool.

941
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,230
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a lot more difficult to see how many people are in the pond.

942
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:29,291
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with you.

943
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,213
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it was last year or the year before we had

944
01:12:31,573 --> 01:12:33,474
[SPEAKER_17]: an incident up there where a life was saved.

945
01:12:33,494 --> 01:12:36,357
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure that that exacerbated their safety concern.

946
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:36,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

947
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:45,163
[SPEAKER_17]: A life was saved, and we recognize that particular lifeguard for heroic response, actually, in saving a young child's life at Wrights Pond.

948
01:12:45,684 --> 01:12:47,925
[SPEAKER_17]: So I agree with everything you're saying.

949
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:50,447
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think maybe the communication could be better.

950
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:54,630
[SPEAKER_17]: The openness and transparency could have been a lot better.

951
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,812
[SPEAKER_17]: And if a rule and regulation was changed

952
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,440
[SPEAKER_17]: or being strictly enforced.

953
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, uh, it's easy to get that message out.

954
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:03,762
[SPEAKER_17]: So people know in the community that are buying passes.

955
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:07,464
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:13:07,624 --> 01:13:07,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

957
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:08,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Counsel marks.

958
01:13:09,505 --> 01:13:10,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Director.

959
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:11,245
[SPEAKER_24]: You're welcome.

960
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:14,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam citizen.

961
01:13:15,815 --> 01:13:16,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Marion Tomazuk again.

962
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:26,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to ask one question, is that this year we have the same amount of lifeguards as we did in previous years.

963
01:13:26,484 --> 01:13:30,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this because I asked the Parks and Recreation who hires the lifeguards.

964
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:42,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is it, and we also sold the same number of passes this year as we did in past years, so why is it that this year all of a sudden we have a problem?

965
01:13:44,915 --> 01:13:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: with capacity, with these issues.

966
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:56,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all of a sudden, now, like I say, I've been going to the pond for 57 years.

967
01:13:57,582 --> 01:13:59,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been turned away before.

968
01:14:00,343 --> 01:14:07,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been told to get out of the water and go use the bathroom repeatedly for 20 minutes.

969
01:14:09,094 --> 01:14:10,235
[SPEAKER_03]: which I find very demeaning.

970
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:15,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And other mothers and grandmothers like myself have been told that they really don't need to be parented in that way.

971
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,681
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three ladies' rooms.

972
01:14:18,182 --> 01:14:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many men's rooms there are.

973
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been in there.

974
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:30,032
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you imagine if everyone in the pond got up and went into the bathroom at the same time, what that would do to the plumbing, what that would do to the lines up there?

975
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first weekend, it was 95 degrees.

976
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:35,916
[SPEAKER_03]: The water was ice cold.

977
01:14:36,257 --> 01:14:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a disabled senior.

978
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:55,219
[SPEAKER_03]: When I called the mayor's office and told them that I did not find it very pleasant every 15 minutes to get out of the water and go sit in the heat for 20 minutes at a time, they told me to go walk up to the snack bar and go in the shade, and I could sit up there.

979
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I just told you I'm a disabled senior.

980
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, it's just a real shock to go back into that cold water.

981
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, well, then why didn't you just go home?

982
01:15:06,843 --> 01:15:08,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that very rude and condescending.

983
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:13,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bad enough listening to the lifeguard tell me how, you know, to keep going and using the bathroom.

984
01:15:14,325 --> 01:15:19,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went there to go relax, cool off, be with my granddaughter.

985
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:22,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go there to be harassed.

986
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:27,409
[SPEAKER_03]: The fifth time in three and a half hours, I left.

987
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But why, like I say, if it's the same amount of lifeguards, if it's the same amount of passes, is this going on?

988
01:15:36,773 --> 01:15:42,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say the bathing area, if you look at the laws, is under five feet.

989
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:45,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, it is not considered a pool.

990
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,922
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor declaring it a pool is wrong.

991
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Wrights Pond.

992
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:53,526
[SPEAKER_03]: We just used the Home Rule petition to declare it our gem.

993
01:15:53,726 --> 01:15:55,087
[SPEAKER_22]: So please, Scott.

994
01:15:55,307 --> 01:15:58,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that the mayor is declaring Wrights Pond a pool.

995
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:05,175
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what the mayor is doing is adopting a pool safety standard because there is no pool safety standard for freshwater bathing areas.

996
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:10,230
[SPEAKER_22]: So what the mayor is doing is adopting a ratio of one lifeguard per 25 swimmers.

997
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:14,791
[SPEAKER_22]: If there's four lifeguards, 100 people can go in the water is my understanding and my reading of this.

998
01:16:18,892 --> 01:16:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in order to do that, she has to declare it a pool.

999
01:16:22,174 --> 01:16:25,855
[SPEAKER_22]: And a pool— No, she's adopting—at the municipal level, she's adopting safety standards.

1000
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:27,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's going above the park commission.

1001
01:16:28,276 --> 01:16:34,878
[SPEAKER_22]: She's adopting safety standards, and she's using CMR—105 CMR 435 as the basis or as the mirroring language.

1002
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:42,824
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think right now what's taking place is there was no safety standard in place for the number of swimmers that are in the water and the ratio for swimmers to lifeguards.

1003
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:46,666
[SPEAKER_22]: The mayor has looked at this and said it's a safety issue, and she's implemented a safety standard.

1004
01:16:46,926 --> 01:16:48,787
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the way that I'm reading this and I'm looking at this.

1005
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:59,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I can certainly understand people being frustrated and not being able to access the pond and enjoy the pond in the fashion that they see fit, but I think that people are going to enjoy it a lot less if someone drowns in the pond and dies.

1006
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:04,055
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I certainly have concerns over the implementation.

1007
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:11,998
[SPEAKER_22]: But in terms of the rationale, the policy change focuses on the overall safety of bathers and permits lifeguards to ensure the safety of all persons in the swimming area.

1008
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:20,904
[SPEAKER_22]: If this is the policy that they have adopted and this is the reason that they have adopted it, I certainly have no problem with adopting strong public safety policies so that people don't die in the pond, Mr. President.

1009
01:17:20,924 --> 01:17:22,065
[SPEAKER_22]: I certainly have no problem with that.

1010
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:26,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Do I have a problem with the way it was communicated and maybe the way it is implemented and the way maybe it is handled?

1011
01:17:26,348 --> 01:17:27,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, absolutely.

1012
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:29,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we need someone with a softer touch up there?

1013
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:29,690
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, maybe.

1014
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we do.

1015
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:33,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I think based on the conversations that we are hearing, yes, we do.

1016
01:17:34,137 --> 01:17:38,519
[SPEAKER_22]: But ultimately, it's a communication issue, I think, more or less than a bad policy.

1017
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:52,963
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think when we have the Director of the Board of Health here endorsing the policy that's in place and saying this is why it's in place, because there's no safety standard at a freshwater bathing pond, but there are safety standards for ratios for lifeguards to swim at a pool, this is a basis.

1018
01:17:54,024 --> 01:18:00,746
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the mayor is saying because there is a rope that clearly delineates the swimming area,

1019
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:05,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Wright's Pond is delineated as to where you can swim, just like a pool is delineated where you can swim.

1020
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:08,558
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't go on the other side of the ropes and swim at Wright's Pond.

1021
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:13,901
[SPEAKER_22]: So they're saying this is the area, this is what's considered the pool or the swimmable area at the pond.

1022
01:18:15,262 --> 01:18:21,186
[SPEAKER_22]: So they've adopted safety standards to reflect what they feel is what's going to keep the people and the patrons there the safest so they can enjoy it.

1023
01:18:21,706 --> 01:18:24,528
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't necessarily have a problem with adopting safety standards, Mr. President.

1024
01:18:24,548 --> 01:18:26,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've all behind this rail set at one time or another.

1025
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Our number one job is to keep people in this community safe.

1026
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:32,572
[SPEAKER_22]: If we're going to provide an amenity, we need to make sure that it's safely provided.

1027
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:34,193
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't have a problem with that.

1028
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:44,861
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a problem with the communication and with the way that it's been delivered in the rollout, and it probably should have happened like three months before the pool opened, and everybody should have probably got something in the mail or something with their permit when they signed up.

1029
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:46,262
[SPEAKER_22]: That I do have a problem with.

1030
01:18:46,282 --> 01:18:51,986
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a problem with the communication, but I don't have a problem with adopting a safety standard to make sure that everybody who utilizes the pool is going to be safe.

1031
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:53,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Counselor.

1032
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:53,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Ma'am?

1033
01:18:53,807 --> 01:18:55,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the big problem here is that

1034
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:59,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of you probably have not really been to the pond.

1035
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:02,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And a pond versus a pool is a very different atmosphere.

1036
01:19:03,093 --> 01:19:04,753
[SPEAKER_03]: A pool is mostly children.

1037
01:19:05,434 --> 01:19:08,274
[SPEAKER_03]: A pond is basically a family.

1038
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:11,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It's parents with their kids or grandparents with their kids.

1039
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's more adult supervision.

1040
01:19:14,715 --> 01:19:16,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I go with my grandchild.

1041
01:19:16,495 --> 01:19:20,476
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm there, I usually see fathers with their kids, mothers with their kids.

1042
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:25,117
[SPEAKER_03]: There are parents, the parent ratio to children is a lot

1043
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: higher so that you don't have – and when you look at the lifeguard, the Red Cross manual, the lifeguard ratio to bathers takes that into effect with the children and the adults factor.

1044
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:54,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The 25 bathers to one lifeguard is 25 children to one bather, not 25 bathers

1045
01:19:55,676 --> 01:19:56,296
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively.

1046
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to take into effect the parents watching.

1047
01:19:59,298 --> 01:19:59,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1048
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Counselor Scott Pelley.

1049
01:20:03,281 --> 01:20:04,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Disagree with me?

1050
01:20:05,022 --> 01:20:07,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1051
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:10,585
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I do for a living.

1052
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:13,487
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm a little confused with this whole policy.

1053
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:16,429
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why I think we need more clarification.

1054
01:20:16,469 --> 01:20:25,434
[SPEAKER_14]: But when people enter our pool, there's no question in our own standards that

1055
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:28,384
[SPEAKER_14]: When a person walks through the door, that's a person that's going in the pool.

1056
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:32,866
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't delineate who's not going to go in the pool, who's a parent, who can oversee.

1057
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:35,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the same issues in our facilities.

1058
01:20:35,887 --> 01:20:43,630
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand your frustration, but I really think that that's something that's not something that we should entertain.

1059
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,271
[SPEAKER_14]: The number of people is what the key is going to be.

1060
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:50,233
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be 200 people, but only 100 are going to go in because they're children.

1061
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:54,795
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that's very difficult to do, especially when you're asking lifeguards.

1062
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:56,834
[SPEAKER_14]: to maintain a safe level there.

1063
01:20:57,094 --> 01:20:58,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very difficult.

1064
01:20:58,535 --> 01:21:04,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't disagree with what you're saying and the frustrations you feel because I've heard it.

1065
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:06,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I've talked to a lot of people and I understand that.

1066
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:18,567
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, I think that what I'm reading and what I'm trying to understand, at least hopefully trying to understand, is that there hasn't been a safety ordinance in place in the past.

1067
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:23,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was when I was working as a supervisor for recreation back in the days when

1068
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,386
[SPEAKER_14]: we had a director of recreation.

1069
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:33,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one of the biggest pieces we have that's fallen is having that person that we can direct every single day to.

1070
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:43,601
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a director of recreation here that was at the pond every single day, that was checking the water levels with the head life guides, and that's difficult.

1071
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:44,342
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have that.

1072
01:21:44,762 --> 01:21:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that as we're moving forward and having discussions about recreation in our community, having that person, unfortunately,

1073
01:21:52,457 --> 01:21:59,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Your family directly has seen the hiccups of change without people in place to help with that change.

1074
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:08,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think moving forward, these are the issues we need to vet with the head of recreation that would oversee that day-to-day operations.

1075
01:22:08,441 --> 01:22:13,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the truth of the matter is, someone sitting at City Hall is not going to have an answer for you.

1076
01:22:15,422 --> 01:22:16,602
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the safety ratio?

1077
01:22:16,642 --> 01:22:17,163
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the rule?

1078
01:22:17,203 --> 01:22:17,743
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the law?

1079
01:22:19,954 --> 01:22:21,675
[SPEAKER_14]: that's designated for that area.

1080
01:22:21,735 --> 01:22:33,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we have our director, she is certified with water safety, waterfront safety, pool safety, she has all those certifications that when you have a question, you call and she can answer those questions.

1081
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:40,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Our biggest concern, we've talked about this in many areas, we need that person in place moving forward.

1082
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:48,451
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that that'll help, but you know, we have to look at least at the positive of this

1083
01:22:48,915 --> 01:22:53,438
[SPEAKER_14]: At least we're trying to look at an ordinance in place to make it positive for safety.

1084
01:22:53,938 --> 01:22:59,762
[SPEAKER_14]: But I agree with your frustration, believe me.

1085
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,764
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have been up there.

1086
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:04,286
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife takes my children up there, and we love it.

1087
01:23:04,466 --> 01:23:08,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And we haven't been there in the last few weeks, but I can understand your frustration.

1088
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:09,709
[SPEAKER_14]: So believe us.

1089
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the Parks Commission tonight telling me that I'm the only one complaining and that they don't care about the law is wrong.

1090
01:23:17,308 --> 01:23:20,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really frustrated me tonight, and that's why I'm here.

1091
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1092
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:21,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1093
01:23:22,371 --> 01:23:22,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1094
01:23:23,751 --> 01:23:24,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we have a motion?

1095
01:23:27,073 --> 01:23:27,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1096
01:23:27,773 --> 01:23:28,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Vice President?

1097
01:23:28,654 --> 01:23:30,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1098
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:34,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask if the Parks Department adopted the mayor's announcement.

1099
01:23:34,537 --> 01:23:37,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they make that in tonight's meeting?

1100
01:23:37,058 --> 01:23:37,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they?

1101
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:40,500
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the Parks Department could speak to us on that.

1102
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:51,665
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just get a copy of the minutes of the Parks Department, see if they actually voted on this, or if the mayor's been doing this herself.

1103
01:23:53,326 --> 01:24:00,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I think standards are important, but I feel that what's going on at Wrights Pond is nothing but a mess.

1104
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:13,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only lack of communication, but lack of planning, lack of discussing issues that might arise, and possibly putting standards into place is something that should have been talked about in February.

1105
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,761
[SPEAKER_05]: not in the middle of the summer.

1106
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:22,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are, there are many other people besides the two that have spoke tonight that have complained to myself or are complaining online or have sent us emails.

1107
01:24:23,045 --> 01:24:27,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an issue for many, although you have the two people that have come to the council tonight.

1108
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:37,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we need to clear this up and get some answers and some clarification on this announcement and do some proper planning, better planning before next season.

1109
01:24:37,992 --> 01:24:38,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And our motion is?

1110
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:47,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was, we already asked the question for clarification in my resolution earlier in the evening.

1111
01:24:49,778 --> 01:24:50,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you have that, Mr. Clerk?

1112
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:52,119
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1113
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,201
[SPEAKER_05]: From the previous paper.

1114
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:57,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, there was no paper, so she stated a request.

1115
01:24:59,025 --> 01:24:59,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1116
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:02,208
[SPEAKER_24]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1117
01:25:03,254 --> 01:25:05,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1118
01:25:07,415 --> 01:25:11,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for further clarification on the announcement.

1119
01:25:16,017 --> 01:25:16,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And a copy of the minutes.

1120
01:25:17,218 --> 01:25:18,238
[SPEAKER_24]: And a copy of the minutes.

1121
01:25:18,318 --> 01:25:18,998
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favour?

1122
01:25:19,018 --> 01:25:19,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1123
01:25:19,919 --> 01:25:20,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1124
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:22,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councillor.

1125
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:27,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good.

1126
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:29,521
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll take that up.

1127
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:32,662
[SPEAKER_24]: This was placed under suspension.

1128
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:39,735
[SPEAKER_24]: On our desk tonight, I'm told that this just came up under suspension, July 19th, 2016.

1129
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:53,222
[SPEAKER_24]: President Fred DelaRusso and members of the Medford City Council request for approval under General Laws Chapter 30B, Chapter, Paragraph 12B to extend Brown and Caldwell contract.

1130
01:25:53,763 --> 01:26:01,207
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President and Councilors, I respectfully request the City Council authorized a second extension to Brown and Caldwell's contract

1131
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:13,848
[SPEAKER_24]: for engineering and consulting services through the completion of remediation services for a period that is as long as necessary to remediate the site and to conduct post-remediation work, including site closure.

1132
01:26:14,328 --> 01:26:26,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Brown and Caldwell was awarded a three-year contract with the city beginning August 2, 2010, ending August 1, 2013 for engineering and consulting services for contaminated municipal sites.

1133
01:26:27,172 --> 01:26:27,652
[SPEAKER_24]: On June 11, 2013,

1134
01:26:29,713 --> 01:26:40,081
[SPEAKER_24]: City Council granted Brown and Caldwell a three-year extension to August 1, 2016, for work at the site at 448 High Street only.

1135
01:26:40,561 --> 01:26:59,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Pursuant to the contract, Brown and Caldwell has, since the completion of the peer review of the May 2013 remedy implementation plan, modified its remediation approach and has advanced the work meeting both Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection

1136
01:26:59,885 --> 01:27:02,566
[SPEAKER_24]: and Environmental Protection Agency requirements.

1137
01:27:03,266 --> 01:27:15,730
[SPEAKER_24]: At this juncture, the revised phase four remedy implementation plan has been reviewed by MassDEP, and we need to respond to their comments and submit a final plan.

1138
01:27:16,391 --> 01:27:25,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Following completion of the phase four documents, Brown and Caldwell will prepare key procurement documents to aid in the hiring of a remediation contractor.

1139
01:27:26,694 --> 01:27:28,855
[SPEAKER_24]: The proposed remediation is anticipated

1140
01:27:29,397 --> 01:27:34,159
[SPEAKER_24]: take approximately two years with monitoring and site closure activities to follow.

1141
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:42,322
[SPEAKER_24]: I recommend your approval because it would be detrimental to the cleanup effort to change and engineering firms at this time.

1142
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:44,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Here are my reasons.

1143
01:27:44,463 --> 01:27:58,488
[SPEAKER_24]: One, Brown and Caldwell has been the LSP of record since January, 2009, when the DEP reopened the 448 high street site and issued a notice of responsibility to the city at Alia.

1144
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:11,828
[SPEAKER_24]: It has fulfilled all the requirements imposed thus far by the 2013 EPA cleanup grant and has developed a productive relationship with EPA relative to this project.

1145
01:28:11,848 --> 01:28:17,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Three, DEP timelines must be met in the implementation of the phase four plan.

1146
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:28,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Four, it has provided all the investigations, monitoring, and remediation reports to the DEP, including monitoring of the vapor capture and treatment system

1147
01:28:29,327 --> 01:28:30,407
[SPEAKER_24]: at 7 Canal Street.

1148
01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:45,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Five, failure to extend the contract will result in delays in the implementation of the right mediation plan and have a prohibitive impact on the city's ability to meet the DEP deadlines and EPA cleanup grant timelines.

1149
01:28:45,971 --> 01:28:53,812
[SPEAKER_24]: City Engineer Cassandra Koudelikas is present this evening to answer any questions you may have, councillors.

1150
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Engineer,

1151
01:28:57,876 --> 01:28:59,377
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could explain this to us.

1152
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:02,458
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I'd be happy to.

1153
01:29:02,478 --> 01:29:03,398
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening, everybody.

1154
01:29:03,618 --> 01:29:08,000
[SPEAKER_29]: Cassandra Koudelidis, 29 Crystal Street, Melrose, Massachusetts.

1155
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:16,643
[SPEAKER_29]: So three years ago, Louise Miller came to you and asked for the extension of the Brown and Caldwell contract for 448 High Street only.

1156
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:22,739
[SPEAKER_29]: so that we could continue with the work as was described in that letter.

1157
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:33,107
[SPEAKER_29]: They had started in 2009 working for us and they had advanced a number of different reports and studies at that time.

1158
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:38,231
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm here on behalf of the city to request more time so that we can continue with the work.

1159
01:29:42,414 --> 01:29:43,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caviello.

1160
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:48,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Chair, what's the status of that project over in the parking lot over there?

1161
01:29:49,822 --> 01:30:02,804
[SPEAKER_29]: The status of the project is that we have removed the imminent hazard, so everybody who had an imminent hazard notice, such as the buildings, have taken care of it, but it's a temporary solution.

1162
01:30:02,944 --> 01:30:04,004
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just fending, correct?

1163
01:30:04,385 --> 01:30:08,585
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, they're capturing the fumes and treating it and sending it out.

1164
01:30:09,245 --> 01:30:10,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a plan to actually dig?

1165
01:30:10,546 --> 01:30:18,767
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's been talked about actually digging up the parking lot at some point and spraying some chemical on the ground.

1166
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:23,009
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, the plan for digging up the parking lot was abandoned.

1167
01:30:23,069 --> 01:30:25,810
[SPEAKER_29]: What happened was there was a peer review in 2013.

1168
01:30:26,931 --> 01:30:32,794
[SPEAKER_29]: While the request was being made for the continuance, there was a company called GZA who was conducting a peer review.

1169
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:35,856
[SPEAKER_29]: And they finished in early September and October.

1170
01:30:35,896 --> 01:30:47,742
[SPEAKER_29]: And we decided at that point that instead of digging up the parking lot adjacent to that building and doing some other more aggressive work, that we would go through the chemical process, which is an in-situ chemical oxidation.

1171
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:52,589
[SPEAKER_29]: And you would not see a major disruption to the site.

1172
01:30:52,629 --> 01:31:06,481
[SPEAKER_29]: You would see a short-term closure while the chemical oxidation was proceeding, and then there would be a time period where they monitor it, then they come back and do another round of ISCO, then they monitor it again, and then they do a third round and then monitor it.

1173
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,523
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1174
01:31:08,543 --> 01:31:09,624
[SPEAKER_29]: You're welcome.

1175
01:31:11,245 --> 01:31:11,806
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor Knight.

1176
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:13,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1177
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:15,749
[SPEAKER_22]: And, Ms.—I always butcher it,

1178
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:19,409
[SPEAKER_22]: How are you doing today?

1179
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:20,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much for coming.

1180
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:23,491
[SPEAKER_21]: How much is it going to cost to extend the contract?

1181
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:39,457
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, the contract, there are a number of items and we have to first fund the procurement piece for Brown and Caldwell, which is around, the last time I had a proposal from them, it needs to be looked at again because some time has passed, was around $48,000 to go to the next step.

1182
01:31:43,174 --> 01:31:49,456
[SPEAKER_29]: The total cost at this point for the remediation, including their time, would be around $900,000.

1183
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:53,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Going forward, or is this including going back six years?

1184
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:55,178
[SPEAKER_29]: Going forward.

1185
01:31:55,238 --> 01:31:55,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Going forward.

1186
01:31:55,778 --> 01:32:00,640
[SPEAKER_21]: So how much have we spent already with Brown and Caldwell, going back to 2000 and what looks like?

1187
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Nine.

1188
01:32:02,521 --> 01:32:02,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Nine?

1189
01:32:04,461 --> 01:32:05,502
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't have a tally.

1190
01:32:05,602 --> 01:32:06,482
[SPEAKER_29]: I could provide that.

1191
01:32:18,308 --> 01:32:27,273
[SPEAKER_22]: And do you see any benefits in doing a shorter term of a contract, a 1-year contract, as opposed to a 2-year or a 3-year going forward?

1192
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:36,278
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it seems like we have had them on the hook now for quite a bit of time, and they have certainly been receiving some extensive amount of funds.

1193
01:32:37,138 --> 01:32:40,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we think it is in the best interest of the city to tie them up for another 3 years?

1194
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,462
[SPEAKER_22]: And 9 years with the same company and a contract seems to be a little long.

1195
01:32:44,777 --> 01:32:56,325
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not unusual, I mean, as the LSP of record, and for the amount of investigations that they've conducted, the intimate knowledge they have of the site, they have been judicious in spending money.

1196
01:32:56,965 --> 01:32:59,447
[SPEAKER_29]: I really haven't had a problem with them going over budget.

1197
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:05,931
[SPEAKER_29]: Any time anything's happened that's been an extra is because the scope of work has changed, and they've had to do more as responding.

1198
01:33:05,951 --> 01:33:09,654
[SPEAKER_29]: They had to make a lot of extra effort in response to EPA.

1199
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:12,896
[SPEAKER_29]: And one of the things that was not foreseen in 2013

1200
01:33:14,592 --> 01:33:27,254
[SPEAKER_29]: was the award of the EPA grant and the requirements that the EPA imposed on the project, such as special studies and quality project plans for the way that the investigations are being handled.

1201
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:29,475
[SPEAKER_29]: So a lot of that is outside of our control.

1202
01:33:29,515 --> 01:33:36,116
[SPEAKER_29]: We've got the grant money, and we're spending it, but we're using the grant money to help respond to the grant requirements.

1203
01:33:37,936 --> 01:33:42,557
[SPEAKER_29]: I would recommend that we continue with them through the end of the process, which could be

1204
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,230
[SPEAKER_29]: more than three years.

1205
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:45,171
[SPEAKER_29]: It could be five years.

1206
01:33:45,231 --> 01:33:46,151
[SPEAKER_29]: It could be seven years.

1207
01:33:46,231 --> 01:33:47,852
[SPEAKER_29]: It's really hard to predict right now.

1208
01:33:50,933 --> 01:33:54,054
[SPEAKER_29]: We go through these periods of activity, and then there's a lull.

1209
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:58,295
[SPEAKER_29]: There's sometimes a funding issue or a approval issue.

1210
01:33:58,315 --> 01:34:03,077
[SPEAKER_29]: We had a report that we submitted last summer that went out for public comment.

1211
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:08,139
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, that required a certain pausing in the progress of the work.

1212
01:34:11,268 --> 01:34:15,150
[SPEAKER_22]: And is there a reason why a contract of this size wouldn't have to go out to bid, like most other contracts?

1213
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:25,074
[SPEAKER_29]: You could, but then when you're hiring a new consultant, let's say you don't, you know, you find somebody else, then they have to start with review of all the material that's been generated today.

1214
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:26,755
[SPEAKER_29]: So that will cost the city more money.

1215
01:34:26,775 --> 01:34:31,357
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a question for the solicitor, too, Mr. President.

1216
01:34:31,893 --> 01:34:40,154
[SPEAKER_29]: And the other thing I would point out is that we have an ongoing monthly requirement to maintain the system at 7 Canal Street.

1217
01:34:40,815 --> 01:34:42,875
[SPEAKER_29]: So every month there has to be an inspection.

1218
01:34:44,575 --> 01:34:46,175
[SPEAKER_29]: The vacuum system has to be checked.

1219
01:34:46,715 --> 01:34:49,656
[SPEAKER_29]: The canisters have to be checked to make sure that the carbon isn't spent.

1220
01:34:50,256 --> 01:34:57,837
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm concerned that if you're going to go out for a new contract and take months to do that, then somebody has to step in to conduct this work.

1221
01:34:58,357 --> 01:35:00,078
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm just concerned about losing momentum.

1222
01:35:00,098 --> 01:35:01,558
[SPEAKER_29]: We seem to be at a point now where

1223
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:06,162
[SPEAKER_29]: We've, you know, submitted our report to DEP, our modified design.

1224
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:07,223
[SPEAKER_29]: They've reviewed it.

1225
01:35:07,263 --> 01:35:11,725
[SPEAKER_29]: They have minor comments, but a couple of large ones that they want to talk to us about.

1226
01:35:12,305 --> 01:35:14,987
[SPEAKER_29]: And then at that point, you know, we're able to be released.

1227
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:17,708
[SPEAKER_29]: We get the green light to go ahead for procurement.

1228
01:35:17,788 --> 01:35:28,113
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, EPA seems pretty satisfied with the quality project plan that we presented to them for how all the tests and studies are going to be conducted on the field work.

1229
01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:31,255
[SPEAKER_29]: So we have a new procurement officer on board.

1230
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,761
[SPEAKER_29]: who can help us with this.

1231
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:38,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1232
01:35:39,423 --> 01:35:40,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, uh, Councilor Knight.

1233
01:35:41,203 --> 01:35:42,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1234
01:35:44,984 --> 01:35:45,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1235
01:35:46,665 --> 01:35:49,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Cassandra, you, you mentioned, uh, seven canal street.

1236
01:35:50,106 --> 01:35:50,366
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1237
01:35:50,746 --> 01:36:00,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, what about the properties on high street that have, uh, had to undertake the same ventilation, uh, that was done on canal street at the owner's expense?

1238
01:36:02,245 --> 01:36:04,387
[SPEAKER_29]: They undertook less ventilation.

1239
01:36:04,487 --> 01:36:13,615
[SPEAKER_29]: They didn't have to do as much there because they have typical HVAC systems and a pretty tight cellar, basements.

1240
01:36:14,195 --> 01:36:18,419
[SPEAKER_29]: So their imminent hazard treatment was far less expensive.

1241
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,262
[SPEAKER_29]: And the city has been picking up the bills since, I think, 2014, 2013.

1242
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:27,916
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1243
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:34,880
[SPEAKER_29]: For that LSP at both 438 High Street and 452 High Street.

1244
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So as of 2014?

1245
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:37,481
[SPEAKER_29]: Roughly 2014.

1246
01:36:37,781 --> 01:36:42,963
[SPEAKER_29]: So at those two locations, they're really just these air purification units.

1247
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:43,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1248
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:45,004
[SPEAKER_29]: So they're much simpler.

1249
01:36:45,105 --> 01:36:45,705
[SPEAKER_29]: You plug them in.

1250
01:36:45,725 --> 01:36:50,067
[SPEAKER_29]: It's like a radon system, you know, a simple radon system, because 7 Canal didn't have

1251
01:36:50,783 --> 01:37:00,310
[SPEAKER_29]: proper basement, some of it slab on grade and there are a lot of cracks in the foundation and the floor, we went to what's called a sub-slab depressurization system.

1252
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:15,260
[SPEAKER_29]: You drill all these holes in the floor and you put in these vacuum points, you draw the air out from below ground, and then you route it through pipes into a carbon filter, which purifies the air and sends it out the side of the building.

1253
01:37:16,601 --> 01:37:19,903
[SPEAKER_17]: So Brown and Caldwell was at the original LLP, correct?

1254
01:37:20,674 --> 01:37:23,655
[SPEAKER_29]: Brown and Caldwell was the original LSP when the site was reopened.

1255
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:27,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they, at some point, did they stop?

1256
01:37:28,117 --> 01:37:28,337
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

1257
01:37:28,837 --> 01:37:35,599
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought there was another LSP that recommended, they came in and recommended digging of the lot.

1258
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:42,822
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a study that was done, not by Brown and Caldwell, that recommended the digging of the lot.

1259
01:37:43,362 --> 01:37:49,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And we as council members received different dollar amounts depending on what was going to be done.

1260
01:37:49,935 --> 01:37:51,856
[SPEAKER_17]: the magnitude of the digging and so forth.

1261
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:54,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember what company that was?

1262
01:37:54,497 --> 01:38:00,119
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we hired GZA to do a peer review, and they recommended against digging of the lot.

1263
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,321
[SPEAKER_17]: So who recommended digging?

1264
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:04,981
[SPEAKER_17]: No one recommended digging originally?

1265
01:38:05,242 --> 01:38:09,323
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, what happens in the process is you have to go through an alternatives analysis.

1266
01:38:10,244 --> 01:38:18,067
[SPEAKER_29]: And the message to Brown and Caldwell, or the message they picked up, was that the city was very anxious to get it all cleaned up as soon as possible.

1267
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:22,483
[SPEAKER_29]: So the most aggressive approach would be to dig up the parking lot.

1268
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:30,348
[SPEAKER_29]: So out of the six or seven alternatives that they presented to us, it was chosen to go with the digging of the parking lot.

1269
01:38:31,529 --> 01:38:33,190
[SPEAKER_29]: I had some concerns about that.

1270
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:36,632
[SPEAKER_29]: And I wanted to have a peer review just to see if we were on the right track.

1271
01:38:37,133 --> 01:38:39,474
[SPEAKER_29]: The peer review came in and said, yes, you could do that.

1272
01:38:39,514 --> 01:38:45,778
[SPEAKER_29]: But there are a number of unknowns that you'll still be chasing contaminated groundwater for quite a long period of time, potentially.

1273
01:38:46,419 --> 01:38:48,520
[SPEAKER_29]: And you have to think about the foundation of that building.

1274
01:38:49,342 --> 01:38:50,743
[SPEAKER_29]: and the disruption to the parking lot.

1275
01:38:50,783 --> 01:38:58,468
[SPEAKER_29]: So after looking at it and weighing everything, it was decided not to go in that direction, but to take a different kind of approach with the ISCO.

1276
01:38:58,988 --> 01:39:00,990
[SPEAKER_17]: So is this chemical treatment working?

1277
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:06,153
[SPEAKER_29]: This chemical treatment works, particularly for dry cleaning fluid, which is what's out there.

1278
01:39:06,934 --> 01:39:10,916
[SPEAKER_17]: So have we done testing since the chemical has been implemented?

1279
01:39:11,077 --> 01:39:13,098
[SPEAKER_29]: We haven't gone that far yet at this site.

1280
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,603
[SPEAKER_29]: We haven't gone to hire the contractor to do the ISCO.

1281
01:39:17,003 --> 01:39:26,812
[SPEAKER_29]: What's been happening so far is that they've done some bench tests, and they've studied the soils to see how it would react with this particular substance.

1282
01:39:27,453 --> 01:39:35,240
[SPEAKER_29]: They've also looked at what would be the uptake from the ISCO treatment, how long would it run.

1283
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,843
[SPEAKER_29]: But we have not hired a contractor.

1284
01:39:37,883 --> 01:39:39,084
[SPEAKER_29]: We have not started anything.

1285
01:39:39,983 --> 01:39:54,786
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so what's, what's the likelihood that, uh, at some point when we have submitted our final plan and all the work is done from Caldwell, that, uh, there still will be a problem with contaminants in that property?

1286
01:39:55,667 --> 01:40:01,788
[SPEAKER_29]: I would say the likelihood is small because this, um, this particular ISCO revision that we're looking at now,

1287
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:03,631
[SPEAKER_29]: is an enhanced one.

1288
01:40:03,911 --> 01:40:05,912
[SPEAKER_29]: It has a surfactant in it, which is like soap.

1289
01:40:06,472 --> 01:40:12,876
[SPEAKER_29]: It attaches on to the contaminant in the ground, and it does a better job of destroying it.

1290
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:18,820
[SPEAKER_29]: So what you have, you're going from PCE, and you're going from PCE down to hydrogen and water.

1291
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:21,101
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's time.

1292
01:40:22,002 --> 01:40:27,885
[SPEAKER_29]: You're blasting it with VSCO, and you're watching the hydraulic gradient, because the groundwater is moving across the site.

1293
01:40:28,325 --> 01:40:31,067
[SPEAKER_29]: And then you're monitoring it to track its efficacy.

1294
01:40:32,677 --> 01:40:34,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And just one last question.

1295
01:40:34,478 --> 01:40:45,943
[SPEAKER_17]: At some point, we were notified that some of these contaminants have leached outside of the particular area that we're aware of and made their way down Canal Street.

1296
01:40:47,743 --> 01:40:48,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you speak to that?

1297
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:51,765
[SPEAKER_29]: We have no information to that at all.

1298
01:40:51,805 --> 01:41:01,549
[SPEAKER_29]: In fact, DEP put in wells at their own cost at the corner of Canal and High and also opposite the street where the daycare center is, and they found nothing.

1299
01:41:02,802 --> 01:41:10,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now you're saying it's the contaminants isolated to the area that we've been treating and not anywhere else?

1300
01:41:10,566 --> 01:41:11,827
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't find them anywhere else.

1301
01:41:11,847 --> 01:41:13,247
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't find them across the street.

1302
01:41:15,549 --> 01:41:15,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1303
01:41:16,609 --> 01:41:17,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1304
01:41:17,269 --> 01:41:17,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1305
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:21,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

1306
01:41:22,472 --> 01:41:23,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair awaits a motion.

1307
01:41:26,094 --> 01:41:28,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval, Madam Vice President.

1308
01:41:28,993 --> 01:41:45,947
[SPEAKER_05]: the roll calls vote, if we could get just a breakdown of how much we've spent since 2009, and also, I don't know if you're able to tell us a breakdown of, you had mentioned to Councilor Knight's question, 900,000 will have to be spent in the next, is that gonna be in the next three years?

1309
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:55,455
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an approximate figure, and it would be spent probably within the next four to five years.

1310
01:41:55,715 --> 01:41:58,157
[SPEAKER_29]: So you'd have, that cost includes

1311
01:41:58,932 --> 01:42:06,696
[SPEAKER_29]: some of the procurement, the initial treatment, and then follow-up monitoring.

1312
01:42:08,858 --> 01:42:13,020
[SPEAKER_29]: So when they monitor, they sample the groundwater, and they send it in for analysis.

1313
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,441
[SPEAKER_29]: Those are the lab costs.

1314
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're spending on the three-year contract with just the company, Brown and Caldwell, will be the $48,000 you had mentioned earlier?

1315
01:42:26,928 --> 01:42:39,376
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, that's the next piece is to hire them to do the procurement, but then we would want them to stay around, you know, during the construction to be the resident engineer to assist us.

1316
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:40,457
[SPEAKER_29]: So there'd be a cost there.

1317
01:42:40,497 --> 01:42:47,121
[SPEAKER_29]: And essentially, we'd be spending down the remainder of the grant and then obtaining funding from the source to be identified.

1318
01:42:47,622 --> 01:42:49,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the remaining of the grant?

1319
01:42:50,224 --> 01:42:53,586
[SPEAKER_29]: My understanding is that it's anywhere from the low to mid $200,000 still remaining.

1320
01:42:58,464 --> 01:42:58,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1321
01:42:58,704 --> 01:43:06,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the, so the additional seven, seven to seven and a half, we're not sure where it will come from.

1322
01:43:06,546 --> 01:43:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1323
01:43:09,187 --> 01:43:09,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1324
01:43:09,487 --> 01:43:14,529
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a motion for approval from counselor.

1325
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:18,030
[SPEAKER_24]: Curve yellow as yellow as amended.

1326
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:19,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by counselor night.

1327
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1328
01:43:21,891 --> 01:43:22,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1329
01:43:22,311 --> 01:43:22,471
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1330
01:43:28,997 --> 01:43:33,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

1331
01:43:35,524 --> 01:43:36,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1332
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:40,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1333
01:43:40,268 --> 01:43:42,290
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-603, while we're under suspension.

1334
01:43:44,252 --> 01:43:52,641
[SPEAKER_24]: The president and members, honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Stephanie M. Burke, common mayor, re-amendment to chapter six of the revised ordinances.

1335
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion granted, Mr. Solicitor, please.

1336
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:08,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mr. President and members of the council.

1337
01:44:08,417 --> 01:44:09,378
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Mark Rumley.

1338
01:44:09,398 --> 01:44:10,358
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the city solicitor.

1339
01:44:10,398 --> 01:44:12,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

1340
01:44:15,302 --> 01:44:22,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to the budget, I'll just give this little, a couple of entry remarks before I speed through this proposed pilot ordinance.

1341
01:44:22,847 --> 01:44:28,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to the budget, the mayor met with some residents who have utilized an area of Tufts Park

1342
01:44:29,767 --> 01:44:58,219
[SPEAKER_15]: to exercise or walk their dogs off leash and the mayor asked me to look into the possibility of Well to use just this expression to bless this with a pilot program Because having a dog off leash in the city of Medford is against two specific ordinances the first ordinance is one which Prohibits dogs being off leash in the entire city the second one is

1343
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:25,413
[SPEAKER_15]: uh... under the park department to prevent dogs from being off leash in a park now this area of the park is where the old tufts pool is uh... back in the section of tufts park so as we said during the budget time this was going to come out after the budget and i had some time since the budget passed to craft this pilot program as you know from the other pilot programs we've had

1344
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:37,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Pilot ordinance means that this ordinance is one which would be looked at and reviewed within a certain finite period to see whether or not it worked and if there were any adjustments or whether or not to go forward with it.

1345
01:45:38,115 --> 01:45:47,418
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a pilot ordinance for off leash dogs only in Tufts Park in that designated area.

1346
01:45:48,178 --> 01:45:53,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if the larger plans came to you in your packet, but I have some copies of the plans here if you need them.

1347
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:54,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Now,

1348
01:45:55,179 --> 01:45:57,360
[SPEAKER_15]: just to go through, and I'm not gonna read every word.

1349
01:45:57,780 --> 01:45:59,101
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on the council agenda.

1350
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:04,823
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be an amendment to chapter six of the revised ordinances.

1351
01:46:05,143 --> 01:46:11,346
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason it was chosen to be chapter six is that after consultation with the city clerk, we felt that was the best place to put it.

1352
01:46:12,226 --> 01:46:19,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the preamble just basically says that there are residents in the city of Medford who are the owners or keepers of well-behaved dogs.

1353
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:23,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, keep that in mind for a second, the term well-behaved dogs.

1354
01:46:23,658 --> 01:46:26,839
[SPEAKER_15]: who want to have their dogs off leash in certain areas.

1355
01:46:27,259 --> 01:46:30,620
[SPEAKER_15]: So in order to see if this would work, we have this pilot ordinance.

1356
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:33,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, going to part one, pilot ordinance.

1357
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:37,683
[SPEAKER_15]: The first section, 6-49 are the different definitions.

1358
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:50,287
[SPEAKER_15]: The keeper of a dog, the owner of a dog, the location, this would be in Tufts Park, the applicable hours, which would be daily between 6 and 8 a.m.

1359
01:46:50,467 --> 01:46:51,787
[SPEAKER_15]: and 6 and 8 p.m.

1360
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:53,348
[SPEAKER_15]: More on that later.

1361
01:46:54,073 --> 01:46:56,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, well-behaved dogs.

1362
01:46:57,374 --> 01:47:03,916
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no definition of well-behaved dogs in the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1363
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:13,698
[SPEAKER_15]: So I talked with Patrick Hogan, our animal control officer, about how we could handle this well-behaved dog definition.

1364
01:47:13,998 --> 01:47:16,079
[SPEAKER_15]: And we decided to do it in a very simple way.

1365
01:47:17,042 --> 01:47:26,005
[SPEAKER_15]: All dogs that are properly licensed, which means they have their required shots, would be considered by definition to be well-behaved dogs.

1366
01:47:26,685 --> 01:47:45,391
[SPEAKER_15]: And then drawing off of that would be those who fit into the ordinance definition or the state law definition of dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, a disturbing dog, a barking dog, a nuisance dog, a dangerous dog, or a dog that is subject to complaint under Chapter 140.

1367
01:47:46,453 --> 01:47:54,298
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you have is all dogs that are licensed are well-behaved dogs because they have their shots, et cetera, and they're registered.

1368
01:47:54,838 --> 01:48:00,621
[SPEAKER_15]: And those that fit into any of these other categories that are the more nefarious dogs are not well-behaved dogs.

1369
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:02,082
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how we defined it.

1370
01:48:02,762 --> 01:48:04,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's that part of it.

1371
01:48:05,384 --> 01:48:11,608
[SPEAKER_15]: The next part, section 650 means that this off-leash dog pilot ordinance would go until January 1st.

1372
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:14,029
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason we chose January 1st was

1373
01:48:14,762 --> 01:48:19,344
[SPEAKER_15]: sound like a pretty good day to end the pilot program and to take a look at this.

1374
01:48:19,724 --> 01:48:28,567
[SPEAKER_15]: And oftentimes during December it's not heavily snow or anything like that, so people would be walking their dogs in a park even during December right through the first of the year.

1375
01:48:29,928 --> 01:48:40,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this doesn't mean that the owners or keepers of the dog wouldn't have to make sure that their dog's waste is picked up on things of that nature because that's required.

1376
01:48:41,992 --> 01:48:58,721
[SPEAKER_15]: The enforcement of this pilot ordinance during the duration of the ordinance would be the animal control officer of the city of Medford, who is Patrick Hogan, the police chief of the city of Medford or his designees, or the director of the board of health or his designees.

1377
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:01,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So they would be the ones who would be keeping an eye on it.

1378
01:49:01,982 --> 01:49:05,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Now part two of the additional provisions of the pilot program.

1379
01:49:06,193 --> 01:49:13,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Under section 6-52, you see 11 different conditions that the animal control officer would monitor.

1380
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:16,763
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, he is the author of those 11 conditions.

1381
01:49:18,225 --> 01:49:30,577
[SPEAKER_15]: And they are that they must be leashed when entering and exiting the area, that they must have a leash for each dog on hand at all times, their dogs must be in view and under the physical or vocal control

1382
01:49:31,067 --> 01:49:36,189
[SPEAKER_15]: of their owners or keepers, no dogs in heat, no dogs under four months old.

1383
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:39,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Owners or keepers must dispose of waste immediately.

1384
01:49:40,912 --> 01:49:46,554
[SPEAKER_15]: And the owners or keepers are legally and financially responsible for the actions of their dogs.

1385
01:49:47,515 --> 01:49:49,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Each owner or keeper is limited to three dogs.

1386
01:49:50,476 --> 01:49:58,280
[SPEAKER_15]: All dogs must have a properly fitted collar or harness to which a current dog license is attached and rabies tag also.

1387
01:49:58,982 --> 01:50:03,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And anyone entering the off-leash area does so at their own risk.

1388
01:50:04,026 --> 01:50:07,008
[SPEAKER_15]: And the City of Medford is not responsible for any injuries.

1389
01:50:07,448 --> 01:50:10,570
[SPEAKER_15]: That type of language, by the way, always has a big footnote to it.

1390
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,632
[SPEAKER_15]: We're always responsible for our negligence.

1391
01:50:13,612 --> 01:50:19,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And any dog that does not meet the definition of a well-behaved dog shall be removed from the area.

1392
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:22,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we have the term.

1393
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:27,142
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the final portion of this is a portion which talks about review.

1394
01:50:27,626 --> 01:50:49,557
[SPEAKER_15]: And it says that at the end of the pilot period, which is January 1st, the ordinance would be looked at by the Board of Health, Fire Department, Police Department, Public Works, City Clerk, and the Law Department to meet and to discuss the program, essentially to see how it went, and to make any recommendations, either positively, negatively, whether to expand or even eradicate the program.

1395
01:50:50,357 --> 01:50:53,159
[SPEAKER_15]: The last thing I'd say about this is that

1396
01:50:54,859 --> 01:51:02,927
[SPEAKER_15]: While I worked on this ordinance itself with Patrick Hogan, we also had the input from other departments in the city of Medford.

1397
01:51:03,647 --> 01:51:06,950
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of them in particular was the Department of Public Works.

1398
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:19,062
[SPEAKER_15]: We have asked that if this pilot program is implemented, that there be a suitable and aesthetically proper fencing around the area so that a dog that's off-leash doesn't get out.

1399
01:51:20,103 --> 01:51:25,767
[SPEAKER_15]: So the last thing I'd say before I invite my colleague Patrick Hogan to make any statement he'd like to make is this.

1400
01:51:26,507 --> 01:51:30,550
[SPEAKER_15]: As I said to you during budget time, this is something that should never be taken lightly.

1401
01:51:31,891 --> 01:51:35,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a dog owner, or my children are dog owners, but I walk them pretty often.

1402
01:51:36,674 --> 01:51:37,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've had dogs all my life.

1403
01:51:38,055 --> 01:51:38,876
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love dogs.

1404
01:51:39,556 --> 01:51:49,103
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also, as part of the law department, I've been part of other cases dealing with dogs that aren't so snuggly and aren't so nice and cause personal injury.

1405
01:51:49,928 --> 01:52:04,374
[SPEAKER_15]: So an ordinance like this might seem to some to be a little bit too much, but we had to strike a balance between the desire to have a dog off leash and a paramount desire to make sure that human beings are protected.

1406
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:13,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the ramifications of not protecting human beings with a dog that might be vicious are very, very significant, and we had to try to strike that balance.

1407
01:52:14,378 --> 01:52:18,620
[SPEAKER_15]: So that essentially is the pilot ordinance which is before you this evening.

1408
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:24,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would invite, with your permission, my colleague to add anything he would like to on this.

1409
01:52:32,691 --> 01:52:35,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Patrick Hogan, the Animal Control Officer with the City of Medford.

1410
01:52:36,992 --> 01:52:52,396
[SPEAKER_20]: So this proposal was brought up while I was enforcing some off-leash areas at Tufts, and some of the residents came forward and said that they wanted an area to allow their dogs to be off-leash.

1411
01:52:52,796 --> 01:53:00,418
[SPEAKER_20]: There are benefits to having dogs off-leash that can't be had when a dog is kept on leash all the time, including the dog is exercised,

1412
01:53:00,938 --> 01:53:03,881
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's a benefit for everyone, not just the dog owner, but also for neighbors.

1413
01:53:04,441 --> 01:53:07,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Dogs that are exercised are much less likely to bark and annoy the neighbors.

1414
01:53:08,265 --> 01:53:13,450
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, they become much better socialized with other dogs and with people, much less likely to bite.

1415
01:53:15,031 --> 01:53:23,199
[SPEAKER_20]: And going to Tufts Park, the dog owners there have been very responsible with cleaning up in the winter when the trash barrels are removed.

1416
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:31,544
[SPEAKER_20]: They bring their own trash bags, remove the trash out, and they actually have a dispenser there to dispense their own poop bags, feces removal.

1417
01:53:31,564 --> 01:53:42,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1418
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:45,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Pat, we don't see anything in our package here about the fence.

1419
01:53:46,613 --> 01:53:48,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you explain what the fence is there?

1420
01:53:49,454 --> 01:53:49,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1421
01:53:49,674 --> 01:53:52,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have a picture of what the fence, what the area is going to be?

1422
01:53:53,153 --> 01:53:56,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it, are we talking just that square area where the pool used to be?

1423
01:53:57,195 --> 01:53:58,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly, just that rectangular area.

1424
01:53:58,716 --> 01:53:59,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Just that, and that's gonna be fenced in?

1425
01:54:00,256 --> 01:54:00,717
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, yeah.

1426
01:54:00,737 --> 01:54:02,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So the dog can't run outside of that fence.

1427
01:54:02,457 --> 01:54:03,058
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, yeah.

1428
01:54:03,398 --> 01:54:06,139
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, okay.

1429
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:14,283
[SPEAKER_20]: So the area is just that, well, I'll wait till you have it in front of you.

1430
01:54:28,179 --> 01:54:32,623
[SPEAKER_20]: So the area that we're talking about is that rectangular area in the rear there.

1431
01:54:33,484 --> 01:54:47,678
[SPEAKER_20]: There'll be one fence that goes just past the parking lot on the Granville Ave side towards Marion Street, and there'll be another one

1432
01:54:48,517 --> 01:54:53,300
[SPEAKER_20]: on the Winchester Street side in that little alleyway, before the alleyway.

1433
01:54:54,001 --> 01:55:01,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Each one will have double gates so that you can bring the dog in, shut the gate behind you, take the dog off a leash, open the other gate, the dog will go in.

1434
01:55:02,467 --> 01:55:09,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well, now is this, I mean, what you're proposing here is a second dog park, if I'm understanding you correctly.

1435
01:55:09,832 --> 01:55:14,996
[SPEAKER_20]: It is, but this fencing is temporary, so it could be removed at any time.

1436
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:20,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, are they going to have to adhere to the same standards that the other dog park is going to?

1437
01:55:21,593 --> 01:55:23,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the other dog park doesn't have any standards yet.

1438
01:55:24,474 --> 01:55:30,098
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, all this is, it's just a basic dog park.

1439
01:55:31,638 --> 01:55:34,300
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think you're right, yeah.

1440
01:55:35,321 --> 01:55:36,661
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you going to be there monitoring this park?

1441
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:38,843
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be there as much as I can, yes.

1442
01:55:40,824 --> 01:55:43,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's the part that concerns me.

1443
01:55:44,526 --> 01:55:46,387
[SPEAKER_19]: And most of the dogs that are off leash,

1444
01:55:46,813 --> 01:55:47,774
[SPEAKER_19]: tend to be the bigger dogs.

1445
01:55:49,095 --> 01:55:55,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the thing is this, this area has been in use for this purpose without a leash, without a fence for quite a while.

1446
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:56,860
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've had very few problems.

1447
01:56:01,864 --> 01:56:13,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, if it's been used for a purpose that's outside the ordinances of both the city of Medford and the ordinances established by the parks department in violation thereof, but then to say that there are very few problems,

1448
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:15,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's right.

1449
01:56:15,278 --> 01:56:18,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I don't think that you were down there enforcing off-leash hours by accident.

1450
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,901
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you got a phone call, and that's why you were down there at that point.

1451
01:56:21,102 --> 01:56:22,602
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I called you.

1452
01:56:23,303 --> 01:56:30,667
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are some neighbors that are complaining about the off-leash use down there, and there are some people that are utilizing the park for off-leash use, but there are people that are abutting the property that are opposed to it.

1453
01:56:30,727 --> 01:56:31,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that what I'm understanding?

1454
01:56:31,967 --> 01:56:32,127
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1455
01:56:32,308 --> 01:56:35,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1456
01:56:35,389 --> 01:56:37,330
[SPEAKER_19]: What about these people that do a dog business?

1457
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:42,273
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I know you took care of a group that there was a

1458
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,521
[SPEAKER_19]: running a business that would dog classes.

1459
01:56:45,742 --> 01:56:47,563
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, are they going to be using this too?

1460
01:56:47,943 --> 01:56:55,207
[SPEAKER_20]: So under the definitions here, they would be considered a keeper, and they would be allowed a maximum of each person would be allowed a maximum of three dogs.

1461
01:56:55,728 --> 01:56:57,909
[SPEAKER_20]: So whether you're a business or an individual, you could do that.

1462
01:56:57,929 --> 01:57:12,338
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also being told now that this area is being considered for a community garden in the future.

1463
01:57:13,292 --> 01:57:18,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Will the dog feces and the dog urine contaminate that property if that happens?

1464
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:24,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I don't know anything about a community garden, but when I see community gardens, they have raised beds.

1465
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:28,655
[SPEAKER_20]: And so the dogs aren't going to be jumping up into the beds to do their business.

1466
01:57:33,169 --> 01:57:38,933
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry, I wasn't going to say anything, but Alicia Hunt, 41 Waston Street, is the environmental director.

1467
01:57:39,033 --> 01:57:40,674
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm working with the Community Garden Commission.

1468
01:57:41,074 --> 01:57:46,937
[SPEAKER_33]: There is a different part of Tufts Park that's been under discussion.

1469
01:57:47,418 --> 01:57:53,141
[SPEAKER_33]: No, if you know where the Tufts pool currently is, and on this map there's a basketball court

1470
01:57:53,568 --> 01:58:02,733
[SPEAKER_33]: It's actually that small area between the basketball court and the current Tufts pool, where there's grass and it's outside.

1471
01:58:02,793 --> 01:58:04,573
[SPEAKER_33]: It's actually- In back of the school.

1472
01:58:04,774 --> 01:58:06,354
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry, between the school, sorry.

1473
01:58:06,694 --> 01:58:08,695
[SPEAKER_33]: Yep, I didn't focus on that very well.

1474
01:58:09,156 --> 01:58:18,580
[SPEAKER_33]: Between the school and basketball court, that's the area that the community garden commission has interest in community.

1475
01:58:19,361 --> 01:58:21,902
[SPEAKER_33]: So it is a completely separate part of Tufts Park.

1476
01:58:22,303 --> 01:58:26,824
[SPEAKER_33]: I just don't want there to be confusion that there are two groups vying for the same space.

1477
01:58:28,785 --> 01:58:28,985
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1478
01:58:29,025 --> 01:58:29,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1479
01:58:29,325 --> 01:58:32,226
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, like I say, I grew up in this area.

1480
01:58:32,566 --> 01:58:35,507
[SPEAKER_19]: I grew up in Tufts Park, and I was there when the pool was there.

1481
01:58:36,447 --> 01:58:39,728
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if I'm sold on this.

1482
01:58:39,888 --> 01:58:45,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, who is going to determine the well-behaved dog?

1483
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:47,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that's written in the ordinance.

1484
01:58:47,931 --> 01:58:51,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but who—well, everybody thinks the dog is well-behaved.

1485
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1486
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:54,660
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a dog.

1487
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:59,583
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll have to be licensed, but if it meets any of the definitions of a dog that's not well behaved, then we remove it.

1488
01:59:02,885 --> 01:59:03,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1489
01:59:03,285 --> 01:59:05,546
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm, I'm, I'm skeptical about this.

1490
01:59:05,566 --> 01:59:08,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, was there a clarification?

1491
01:59:08,828 --> 01:59:10,569
[SPEAKER_24]: Is this restricted to Medford dogs only?

1492
01:59:10,929 --> 01:59:14,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I guess it says, I think there's something that says the dog has to be licensed in Medford.

1493
01:59:15,592 --> 01:59:16,012
[SPEAKER_19]: That correct.

1494
01:59:17,873 --> 01:59:18,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1495
01:59:18,433 --> 01:59:21,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight, did you have something?

1496
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:23,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I do.

1497
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,851
[SPEAKER_22]: That was my point of information.

1498
01:59:26,732 --> 01:59:29,373
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1499
01:59:30,574 --> 01:59:31,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1500
01:59:31,714 --> 01:59:51,324
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, I, I think, uh, over the last several years, uh, there's been a number of residents that have approached this council that have approached the administration, uh, regarding the need for a dog park in this community and looking at Arlington, Somerville, Malden,

1501
01:59:52,497 --> 01:59:56,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Brookline, Boston, you can go through all the surrounding communities.

1502
01:59:56,499 --> 01:59:59,781
[SPEAKER_17]: They all have one or multiple parks in a community.

1503
02:00:00,482 --> 02:00:04,084
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were fortunate in a city to have 23 parks.

1504
02:00:05,004 --> 02:00:07,446
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, it's one thing you hear quite often mentioned.

1505
02:00:07,486 --> 02:00:10,227
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a fair amount of open space in this community.

1506
02:00:11,088 --> 02:00:21,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, you know, I was part and still am part of, uh, pause for method, which was a citizen group that got together out of frustration, to be quite honest,

1507
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:33,493
[SPEAKER_17]: back about two years ago and did our own research and found grant funding for the creation of a first dog park.

1508
02:00:34,413 --> 02:00:46,036
[SPEAKER_17]: And it took about two years with countless meetings, hiring an outside consultant that builds dog parks.

1509
02:00:46,936 --> 02:00:48,997
[SPEAKER_17]: And really it was an eye opener to see

1510
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:52,250
[SPEAKER_17]: that a dog park is not just erecting a fence.

1511
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:57,093
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think what we're hearing tonight is we're going to put up a fence.

1512
02:00:58,434 --> 02:01:03,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, what we need in this community is not a fenced area to have dogs run.

1513
02:01:04,177 --> 02:01:05,818
[SPEAKER_17]: We need a dog park.

1514
02:01:06,619 --> 02:01:10,461
[SPEAKER_17]: We have one that's going to be proposed behind the McGlynn School.

1515
02:01:11,201 --> 02:01:17,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the time, the mayor, Mayor McGlynn, did his due diligence.

1516
02:01:18,837 --> 02:01:32,639
[SPEAKER_17]: contacted the local paper and I believe sent out a blast in the reverse 911 and got feedback regarding that particular site and several other sites throughout the community.

1517
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:42,401
[SPEAKER_17]: And based on the fact that that site is centralized, there's not a lot of neighbors in that particular area behind the McGlynn School on Riverbend.

1518
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:44,701
[SPEAKER_17]: It was handicap accessible.

1519
02:01:45,142 --> 02:01:47,562
[SPEAKER_17]: There's already water that's piped into the area.

1520
02:01:48,037 --> 02:01:51,659
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be ample lighting that's going to be put on the site.

1521
02:01:53,540 --> 02:02:02,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And other considerations that were made, and we heard over and over again, is that small dog owners said, I can't let my dog run with a larger dog.

1522
02:02:03,304 --> 02:02:05,465
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not because larger dogs run friendly.

1523
02:02:06,306 --> 02:02:07,426
[SPEAKER_17]: My dog will get trampled.

1524
02:02:07,666 --> 02:02:10,888
[SPEAKER_17]: My six-pound terrier will get trampled and possibly killed.

1525
02:02:11,828 --> 02:02:17,451
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when we took into consideration creating a first-ever dog park,

1526
02:02:18,063 --> 02:02:23,487
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one of the first things, to make a small and large dog park, have it separated.

1527
02:02:23,507 --> 02:02:28,290
[SPEAKER_17]: The park that we're proposing also has an obstacle course.

1528
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:30,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a state-of-the-art park.

1529
02:02:30,972 --> 02:02:35,195
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to have the latest infiltration systems.

1530
02:02:37,436 --> 02:02:39,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really a lot of thought and effort went into it.

1531
02:02:40,478 --> 02:02:43,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hate to say it, I'm not seeing it with this park.

1532
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:45,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And I realize it's a pilot.

1533
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:47,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I went out and I walked the site.

1534
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:51,071
[SPEAKER_17]: I noticed that it's 6 p.m.

1535
02:02:51,091 --> 02:02:51,711
[SPEAKER_17]: to 8 p.m.

1536
02:02:52,871 --> 02:02:55,011
[SPEAKER_17]: October, November, it's dark at 7.30.

1537
02:02:56,172 --> 02:02:57,032
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no light there.

1538
02:02:58,092 --> 02:03:05,633
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, our first concern has to be public safety and then pet safety.

1539
02:03:06,513 --> 02:03:11,594
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, you need proper lighting down there in the hours that they're proposing.

1540
02:03:12,054 --> 02:03:13,094
[SPEAKER_17]: So that doesn't exist.

1541
02:03:13,715 --> 02:03:16,015
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also discarded building materials.

1542
02:03:17,074 --> 02:03:22,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I took a walk around and there's cinder blocks scattered along the fences around the perimeter.

1543
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:36,469
[SPEAKER_17]: There are actually gaping, and I just found out tonight you're putting a fence up, but if you go a little further, like you're going out to Winchester Street, there's actually a gaping hole into a neighbor's yard that the fence has not secured.

1544
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:45,917
[SPEAKER_17]: You have the pole that is hanging down off the fence that could be a real safety concern in the area.

1545
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:51,563
[SPEAKER_17]: I talked to some of the abutters, and many of the abutters were great.

1546
02:03:51,583 --> 02:03:53,504
[SPEAKER_17]: They said, you know, these people are excellent.

1547
02:03:54,285 --> 02:03:55,025
[SPEAKER_17]: We've talked to them.

1548
02:03:55,445 --> 02:03:56,326
[SPEAKER_17]: They're very courteous.

1549
02:03:56,346 --> 02:03:57,627
[SPEAKER_17]: They pick up after the dog.

1550
02:03:58,547 --> 02:04:01,389
[SPEAKER_17]: They said something else about people using the park to play ball.

1551
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:08,794
[SPEAKER_17]: They mentioned how people are urinating and defecating in the area, and that's a whole other issue.

1552
02:04:09,334 --> 02:04:12,516
[SPEAKER_17]: But they spoke very highly about the dog walkers.

1553
02:04:13,217 --> 02:04:14,778
[SPEAKER_17]: The one thing they weren't aware of,

1554
02:04:17,021 --> 02:04:23,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is really a concern is that when you propose something, you have to talk to the director about it.

1555
02:04:24,527 --> 02:04:25,889
[SPEAKER_17]: That's politics 101.

1556
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:35,637
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to go knock the doors, do a reverse call on Randall, on Winchester, just to those neighbors.

1557
02:04:35,677 --> 02:04:36,417
[SPEAKER_17]: We can target it.

1558
02:04:36,878 --> 02:04:38,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Let them know what's going on.

1559
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the neighbors I talked to said, you know what, we don't mind.

1560
02:04:40,961 --> 02:04:43,283
[SPEAKER_17]: We may see seven, eight people out there walking their dog.

1561
02:04:44,044 --> 02:04:45,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you say, do you realize,

1562
02:04:46,023 --> 02:04:50,744
[SPEAKER_17]: this will be the only off leash park in the city right now.

1563
02:04:51,685 --> 02:04:56,266
[SPEAKER_17]: And you may have from eight to nine, you may have 30 to 40 to 50 people.

1564
02:04:56,626 --> 02:04:57,066
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know.

1565
02:04:57,166 --> 02:05:00,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure there wasn't a study done potentially on how many people will use this park.

1566
02:05:01,507 --> 02:05:06,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think these are the things that had to be vetted before we just say, Oh, we're throwing up a fence.

1567
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:08,789
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll create some rules and regulations.

1568
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,410
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll let it look good.

1569
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:12,030
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll let it appear to be a dog park.

1570
02:05:12,411 --> 02:05:13,191
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll look like one.

1571
02:05:13,211 --> 02:05:14,011
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll smell like one.

1572
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:16,030
[SPEAKER_17]: but it's not really a dog park.

1573
02:05:17,171 --> 02:05:18,291
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the problem I have.

1574
02:05:18,791 --> 02:05:20,332
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see a full-fledged dog park.

1575
02:05:20,932 --> 02:05:27,354
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know we're not going to have them in every park, but if we strategically have them throughout the community, that's a win-win.

1576
02:05:28,114 --> 02:05:29,495
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a win-win for this community.

1577
02:05:30,135 --> 02:05:41,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And the hope of the pause committee was to show that a dog park is needed in the city, which we all know, show that we didn't need to get city funding, which we approached the Stanton Foundation.

1578
02:05:41,878 --> 02:05:44,019
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Gary that's on the committee with me is in the audience.

1579
02:05:44,422 --> 02:05:45,803
[SPEAKER_17]: a few other members that couldn't make it.

1580
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:49,566
[SPEAKER_17]: And we got $250,000 for a dog park.

1581
02:05:50,086 --> 02:05:52,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've given us $10,000 for upkeep.

1582
02:05:52,648 --> 02:05:54,029
[SPEAKER_17]: The first, I think it's three years.

1583
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:59,713
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is what happened when citizens got together and say, there's a need out there.

1584
02:06:00,213 --> 02:06:02,335
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you'll find there's a need throughout the community.

1585
02:06:02,635 --> 02:06:03,816
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here in a car park.

1586
02:06:04,136 --> 02:06:05,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I live near Harris Park.

1587
02:06:05,517 --> 02:06:09,280
[SPEAKER_17]: The same people out there with their dogs off the leash, you probably get the same calls.

1588
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:10,501
[SPEAKER_17]: It's throughout the city.

1589
02:06:10,881 --> 02:06:12,022
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's telling me there's a need.

1590
02:06:13,385 --> 02:06:17,788
[SPEAKER_17]: In a $162 million budget, there's a need for dog parks in this community.

1591
02:06:18,929 --> 02:06:24,934
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and last year, the city of Medford licensed, I think it was 340 dogs.

1592
02:06:26,475 --> 02:06:28,336
[SPEAKER_17]: I have 340 dogs on my street.

1593
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:31,099
[SPEAKER_17]: That's no joke.

1594
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:36,383
[SPEAKER_17]: We have thousands of dogs living in this city, and there is a need in this community.

1595
02:06:38,084 --> 02:06:41,507
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, so, you know, I don't want to seem like a Debbie Downer, but,

1596
02:06:42,393 --> 02:06:45,815
[SPEAKER_17]: This particular ordinance, I think, was just a quick fix.

1597
02:06:47,537 --> 02:06:49,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get the few people that approached the mayor.

1598
02:06:50,919 --> 02:06:51,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's give them something.

1599
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:56,443
[SPEAKER_17]: The people that called me up and wanted to talk about it, the first thing I asked them, did you read the ordinance?

1600
02:06:57,123 --> 02:06:59,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Said, oh, no, we didn't know there was an ordinance.

1601
02:06:59,345 --> 02:07:01,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Jeez, I didn't see an ordinance.

1602
02:07:02,567 --> 02:07:09,272
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the things I think you have to do your homework and your due diligence, like the PAWS Committee did for two years.

1603
02:07:10,098 --> 02:07:14,019
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not saying this park should take two years, but what I'm saying is there's a need.

1604
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:20,220
[SPEAKER_17]: And residents in this community should be reaching out to the administration and saying there's a need in this community.

1605
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:23,380
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a need to be dog friendly in this community.

1606
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:30,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not quite sure a pilot program, I've seen a million pilot programs by this administration and the previous administration.

1607
02:07:31,522 --> 02:07:34,862
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have the street sweeping pilot program that was implemented 10 years ago.

1608
02:07:36,603 --> 02:07:38,323
[SPEAKER_17]: 10 years ago, it's still a pilot program.

1609
02:07:39,532 --> 02:07:49,398
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sold on this, that in January 1st, they're gonna come back with recommendations and they're gonna say, well, these are the parks that are gonna be off-leash and so forth.

1610
02:07:51,099 --> 02:07:54,241
[SPEAKER_17]: I find it ironic that I didn't get this until tonight.

1611
02:07:55,742 --> 02:07:57,403
[SPEAKER_17]: So up until tonight, I didn't think there was a fence.

1612
02:07:58,463 --> 02:08:00,745
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew there was a fence around where the neighbor's yards were.

1613
02:08:01,005 --> 02:08:02,106
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't think it was fenced off.

1614
02:08:03,967 --> 02:08:09,090
[SPEAKER_17]: So these are the things that should have been distributed to us.

1615
02:08:10,318 --> 02:08:13,880
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and I'm just disappointed.

1616
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:17,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And I see a lot of residents up here, some pro, some con.

1617
02:08:18,103 --> 02:08:19,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I was also told St.

1618
02:08:19,083 --> 02:08:22,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Clement's uses that and some of their football equipment is still on the field.

1619
02:08:23,726 --> 02:08:25,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And some people said they still use it.

1620
02:08:25,267 --> 02:08:27,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people said they haven't seen anyone up there.

1621
02:08:27,488 --> 02:08:31,811
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not quite sure if it's still being used for that.

1622
02:08:35,293 --> 02:08:38,695
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess what we can hope to do

1623
02:08:39,175 --> 02:08:45,180
[SPEAKER_17]: as a council, and I'm not going to speak for anyone else, is number one, send a message back to the administration.

1624
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's great.

1625
02:08:46,481 --> 02:08:51,825
[SPEAKER_17]: We're moving forward with the first ever dog park behind the McGlynn, but method is seven square miles.

1626
02:08:52,285 --> 02:08:53,426
[SPEAKER_17]: We have 23 parks.

1627
02:08:54,347 --> 02:08:57,890
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to expand the program and it can't take 30 years to do it.

1628
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:00,132
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to expand the program.

1629
02:09:00,432 --> 02:09:03,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I went on the website and looked up a green dog in Brookline.

1630
02:09:03,634 --> 02:09:06,917
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know a gentleman just passed out some information on it.

1631
02:09:07,597 --> 02:09:08,118
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um,

1632
02:09:08,913 --> 02:09:16,740
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, their parks, from what I can understand, don't have any fencing, or the ones that are off-leash are not fenced at all.

1633
02:09:17,581 --> 02:09:26,610
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have a system of alerting residents on inclement weather, when the park is not used because it's too rainy or too muddy and so forth.

1634
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:30,574
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not even sure we're at that level in this community.

1635
02:09:31,314 --> 02:09:32,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Has anybody been on the city website?

1636
02:09:34,375 --> 02:09:44,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we're capable, and this is no disrespect to you, to monitor this for four months and then come up with a meaningful resolution to it.

1637
02:09:44,583 --> 02:09:47,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we're capable of doing it right now.

1638
02:09:48,465 --> 02:10:03,376
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd rather see residents get together and start discussing the potential of other dog parks throughout the community and how we can get funding for that and how we can maybe tap up the Stanton group again and move forward in that.

1639
02:10:03,964 --> 02:10:08,085
[SPEAKER_17]: rather than just a knee-jerk reaction that may solve a problem for four months.

1640
02:10:09,225 --> 02:10:12,986
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in four months, these residents are going to be back in January saying, OK, what are we doing?

1641
02:10:13,006 --> 02:10:13,547
[SPEAKER_17]: What are we doing?

1642
02:10:13,987 --> 02:10:15,907
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to say, well, we're meeting on this.

1643
02:10:16,307 --> 02:10:17,268
[SPEAKER_17]: And nothing's going to happen.

1644
02:10:18,368 --> 02:10:20,168
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you, nothing's going to happen.

1645
02:10:20,609 --> 02:10:27,871
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd rather see it as a united front, a united effort in this community.

1646
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:33,252
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think this resolution is the way to go right now.

1647
02:10:34,172 --> 02:10:35,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't believe that.

1648
02:10:36,234 --> 02:10:43,079
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to put lighting on the site, I was there the other day, the barrel was overflowed with trash.

1649
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:48,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Boston Athletic Club was playing softball 30 feet from the park.

1650
02:10:49,224 --> 02:10:52,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I know you're saying there's going to be a fence, but the park's utilized.

1651
02:10:53,607 --> 02:11:00,072
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have to do our homework really before we approve anything.

1652
02:11:00,372 --> 02:11:01,673
[SPEAKER_17]: And in particular, this ordinance.

1653
02:11:02,374 --> 02:11:03,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the city solicitor

1654
02:11:04,057 --> 02:11:14,264
[SPEAKER_17]: for putting it together, but I don't think this merits a vote tonight on a dog park in this community, this particular ordinance.

1655
02:11:15,024 --> 02:11:18,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be the first to sit down with any group that wants to sit down and move this forward.

1656
02:11:18,747 --> 02:11:23,570
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um, I don't think this is the avenue to be quite honest with you.

1657
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:28,914
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate your time and you've done a great job as a dog officer in the community.

1658
02:11:29,694 --> 02:11:30,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1659
02:11:30,715 --> 02:11:33,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Counselor chair recognizes Councilor Falcon.

1660
02:11:33,788 --> 02:11:34,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1661
02:11:35,948 --> 02:11:38,449
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, thank you to City Solicitor Romley for putting this together.

1662
02:11:38,469 --> 02:11:40,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Mr. Hogan, for being here tonight.

1663
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:42,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a dog owner.

1664
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:43,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my dog.

1665
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:47,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, he's a big part of our family.

1666
02:11:48,031 --> 02:11:52,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've received many calls both for and against.

1667
02:11:52,751 --> 02:11:56,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and Councilor Marks brings up a good point.

1668
02:11:56,832 --> 02:12:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: There's almost a need for dog parks in different areas throughout our community.

1669
02:12:03,175 --> 02:12:04,076
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a demand for it.

1670
02:12:05,336 --> 02:12:13,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It was interesting to get this tonight because actually a lot of the questions that it got from people that were concerned were, is there going to be a fence?

1671
02:12:14,539 --> 02:12:16,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was under the assumption that there was no fence.

1672
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:19,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy that they're suggesting a fence.

1673
02:12:20,621 --> 02:12:31,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know anything about if this passes the fence, what type of fence, how long it'll take to implement this as far as actually getting a temporary fence set up?

1674
02:12:32,195 --> 02:12:36,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, when Patrick and I had talked to Brian Kerins, we were talking about the height of the fence.

1675
02:12:36,999 --> 02:12:39,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were a couple of suggestions.

1676
02:12:39,481 --> 02:12:40,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he started at four feet.

1677
02:12:41,763 --> 02:12:45,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we talked about the aesthetics of the fence, color and material.

1678
02:12:46,066 --> 02:12:55,614
[SPEAKER_15]: But there has not been any order or anybody looking at any manufacturer's product or anything of that nature, because that would be premature without the ordinance in place.

1679
02:12:55,914 --> 02:12:59,717
[SPEAKER_15]: But we did have that discussion, and it would have been followed up on.

1680
02:13:01,167 --> 02:13:02,287
[SPEAKER_15]: but not at this junction.

1681
02:13:03,267 --> 02:13:11,469
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the, um, and I know you said earlier that, you know, uh, because a lot of, a lot of the questions I'm getting is who's going to monitor this.

1682
02:13:11,529 --> 02:13:13,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Is anyone going to monitor this?

1683
02:13:13,109 --> 02:13:16,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, and I know you said, you know, you, you, you're going to be at the park as much as possible.

1684
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:17,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you work a full day.

1685
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:25,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so right now, do you have specific hours as far as your current regular hours is supposed to be 830 to 430, 830 to 430.

1686
02:13:25,572 --> 02:13:25,652
[SPEAKER_20]: So,

1687
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:28,856
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm called in on emergencies.

1688
02:13:28,996 --> 02:13:29,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry?

1689
02:13:29,516 --> 02:13:30,776
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm also called in on emergencies.

1690
02:13:30,816 --> 02:13:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yeah, I would imagine.

1691
02:13:31,617 --> 02:13:31,857
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1692
02:13:32,597 --> 02:13:40,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as, because a lot of the calls I'm getting are from people saying, you know, is someone going to be there to, you know, what if something goes wrong?

1693
02:13:40,521 --> 02:13:42,082
[SPEAKER_07]: What if a dog needs to be removed?

1694
02:13:42,522 --> 02:13:43,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to remove the dog?

1695
02:13:43,963 --> 02:13:49,705
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, if you're not there, you know, it's impossible to be there all the time.

1696
02:13:50,125 --> 02:13:51,866
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, are they going to have to call the police?

1697
02:13:51,926 --> 02:13:53,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something the police is going to have to do?

1698
02:13:54,287 --> 02:13:55,668
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that is addressed in the ordinance.

1699
02:13:56,232 --> 02:14:05,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think people are concerned about that, too, as far as should the police really be diving into monitoring a dog park.

1700
02:14:05,494 --> 02:14:07,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there are concerns there as well.

1701
02:14:08,654 --> 02:14:13,555
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as a well-behaved dog is a dog that has a valid license.

1702
02:14:14,995 --> 02:14:15,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

1703
02:14:15,795 --> 02:14:23,237
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as if there's no one there constantly monitoring the dog, it could be anyone showing up with a dog, just letting him run wild.

1704
02:14:23,377 --> 02:14:25,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think a lot of the calls that I've gotten

1705
02:14:26,764 --> 02:14:32,088
[SPEAKER_07]: from concerned residents saying, you know, is there any type of monitoring at all?

1706
02:14:32,148 --> 02:14:41,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like there might be some, but not, you know, on a regular—not on a—every night from 6 to 8, there's going to be someone there opening up, locking up, that type of thing.

1707
02:14:45,683 --> 02:14:47,044
[SPEAKER_20]: overwhelmingly self-policing.

1708
02:14:47,504 --> 02:14:51,266
[SPEAKER_20]: The people that are there using it really want it to function well.

1709
02:14:51,326 --> 02:14:56,149
[SPEAKER_20]: And if there's someone there who's abusing it or their dog isn't functioning well, they will use peer pressure to move the person out.

1710
02:14:56,169 --> 02:14:58,591
[SPEAKER_20]: And if the person won't move out on their own, then they'll call.

1711
02:14:59,031 --> 02:14:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1712
02:14:59,691 --> 02:15:00,192
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to know.

1713
02:15:00,232 --> 02:15:05,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I definitely support the dog park that's going to go beyond the schools.

1714
02:15:05,515 --> 02:15:06,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great idea.

1715
02:15:07,256 --> 02:15:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see it happen.

1716
02:15:09,337 --> 02:15:12,919
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just have some concerns from people that have called me.

1717
02:15:13,559 --> 02:15:14,380
[SPEAKER_07]: With regard to

1718
02:15:15,470 --> 02:15:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: In the ordinance, there are conditions.

1719
02:15:18,051 --> 02:15:19,271
[SPEAKER_07]: There are about 11 conditions here.

1720
02:15:19,331 --> 02:15:23,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those conditions going to be posted at the park?

1721
02:15:24,573 --> 02:15:25,193
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it makes sense.

1722
02:15:25,213 --> 02:15:28,234
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be some sort of signage that there'll be expectations.

1723
02:15:30,095 --> 02:15:34,216
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case that this ordinance is adopted on a pilot basis, yes.

1724
02:15:34,256 --> 02:15:41,559
[SPEAKER_15]: There would be notice to those participating that these conditions are applicable along with any of the others which are in the ordinance that they should be aware of.

1725
02:15:42,357 --> 02:15:46,198
[SPEAKER_15]: We certainly wouldn't want people to operate without knowledge of what is prohibited.

1726
02:15:47,018 --> 02:15:57,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1727
02:15:58,021 --> 02:15:59,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for now.

1728
02:15:59,962 --> 02:16:00,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1729
02:16:04,063 --> 02:16:04,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1730
02:16:08,604 --> 02:16:10,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Being a doggone old myself of over 30 years,

1731
02:16:11,287 --> 02:16:16,471
[SPEAKER_19]: and like Councilor Mark says, I know in my neighborhood, there's probably 300 dogs in my neighborhood.

1732
02:16:17,171 --> 02:16:23,876
[SPEAKER_19]: I see my wife walking with the dogs, there's dogs everywhere, and they're all good dogs, and occasionally they don't pick up the stuff, but that's another issue.

1733
02:16:25,077 --> 02:16:35,684
[SPEAKER_19]: There's like 20, almost 20 houses here that border this park, and like Councilor Mark said, what's the condition of their fence on the Granville side and on the Marion Street side?

1734
02:16:35,704 --> 02:16:39,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I say, I'm a former resident of that area, of William Street,

1735
02:16:41,636 --> 02:16:43,037
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I used to go to that pool.

1736
02:16:43,297 --> 02:16:52,319
[SPEAKER_19]: But I say, you know, is there anybody here from that in the Marion Street or Granville Ave that's in favor or not in favor?

1737
02:16:52,339 --> 02:16:54,020
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to hear their opinion.

1738
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if they would know if I didn't mean that, are they going to be happy if there's going to be a light on there all the time?

1739
02:17:00,742 --> 02:17:02,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there going to be water for these dogs there?

1740
02:17:03,103 --> 02:17:08,665
[SPEAKER_19]: But I say I'd like to hear from the residents of the area and see what their opinion is.

1741
02:17:11,181 --> 02:17:13,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1742
02:17:13,302 --> 02:17:15,123
[SPEAKER_11]: David Livingston, 20 Bow Street.

1743
02:17:15,703 --> 02:17:16,103
[SPEAKER_11]: What street?

1744
02:17:16,983 --> 02:17:17,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Bow.

1745
02:17:17,444 --> 02:17:18,004
[SPEAKER_11]: B-O-W.

1746
02:17:18,784 --> 02:17:19,284
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 Bow Street.

1747
02:17:21,945 --> 02:17:22,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1748
02:17:23,066 --> 02:17:24,406
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right along.

1749
02:17:25,286 --> 02:17:28,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to address everything that's been brought up, if I may have the time.

1750
02:17:28,408 --> 02:17:31,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I can answer your question simply, sir.

1751
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:40,052
[SPEAKER_11]: The defense, Mr. Marks, you came and saw.

1752
02:17:41,183 --> 02:17:42,404
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in fair condition.

1753
02:17:42,984 --> 02:17:46,606
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one small hole behind 5 Granville Avenue.

1754
02:17:47,507 --> 02:17:55,492
[SPEAKER_11]: That's to let a cat out, who is an outdoor cat, a rescue cat, by my friend, my neighbor, a neighbor of the park.

1755
02:17:56,473 --> 02:17:58,234
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to let his cat in the park.

1756
02:17:58,434 --> 02:18:03,597
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a large proponent of having the dogs there.

1757
02:18:06,059 --> 02:18:08,400
[SPEAKER_11]: The back section near Winchester Street,

1758
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:17,052
[SPEAKER_11]: A very large tree came down during Hurricane Irene and damaged the fence and neighbors have been asked for it to be repaired.

1759
02:18:18,672 --> 02:18:22,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I am the originator of this proposal.

1760
02:18:22,453 --> 02:18:29,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I met with the mayor and, and, and asked him along with Patrick Hogan for a program like this to be inserted.

1761
02:18:31,035 --> 02:18:36,677
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I did mention that I do not support fencing of any sort whatsoever.

1762
02:18:37,937 --> 02:18:38,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1763
02:18:39,578 --> 02:18:50,360
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole philosophy of open space, off-leash time with dogs is that dogs are so much more relaxed when they are not confined.

1764
02:18:52,421 --> 02:18:53,681
[SPEAKER_17]: I can barely hear you.

1765
02:18:54,541 --> 02:18:55,141
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

1766
02:18:56,982 --> 02:18:58,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you say you don't support fencing?

1767
02:18:58,882 --> 02:19:02,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not of any kind, and I recommended against it in my meeting.

1768
02:19:04,323 --> 02:19:10,365
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole philosophy of open space, off-leash time for dogs is that they are so much more relaxed in open spaces.

1769
02:19:10,946 --> 02:19:14,207
[SPEAKER_11]: When you confine them, their anxiety levels are raised.

1770
02:19:15,187 --> 02:19:19,288
[SPEAKER_11]: When dogs have a conflict of any sort, they have fight-or-flight instincts.

1771
02:19:20,029 --> 02:19:30,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you confine them in a space, however large, and remove their flight instincts, you end up with a conflict.

1772
02:19:31,113 --> 02:19:32,353
[SPEAKER_11]: You end up with a problem.

1773
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:38,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you add fencing there, the dog's anxiety levels will be raised.

1774
02:19:38,483 --> 02:19:42,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And they will see anything on the other side of that fence as bad, as a problem.

1775
02:19:42,785 --> 02:19:43,706
[SPEAKER_11]: They will react to it.

1776
02:19:44,766 --> 02:19:45,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm there every day.

1777
02:19:45,647 --> 02:19:49,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I confess to you, I've been bringing my dog there off leash 11 years every single day.

1778
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:52,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm there all the time.

1779
02:19:52,351 --> 02:19:55,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I've spent over 5,000 hours of my life there.

1780
02:19:55,692 --> 02:20:01,876
[SPEAKER_11]: The dogs that visit there regularly do not react to a kid riding his bike or the softball players

1781
02:20:02,552 --> 02:20:05,674
[SPEAKER_11]: two people playing frisbee or jogger because they see it every day.

1782
02:20:06,334 --> 02:20:19,381
[SPEAKER_11]: But as soon as you put up a barricade of any sort, they're going to think that's bad and they will all rush the fence and they will bark and it will go from a friendly, peaceful, positive experience to a very negative experience.

1783
02:20:20,442 --> 02:20:22,243
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't care about

1784
02:20:24,013 --> 02:20:28,194
[SPEAKER_11]: about what's on the other side, because there's no fence.

1785
02:20:28,574 --> 02:20:30,115
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the paved path right there.

1786
02:20:30,595 --> 02:20:34,396
[SPEAKER_11]: We use that to teach the dogs that they are not allowed over the paved path.

1787
02:20:34,716 --> 02:20:38,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And any dog that goes near it is expected to be recalled.

1788
02:20:39,597 --> 02:20:42,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And this happens, by and large.

1789
02:20:42,598 --> 02:20:43,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It can be done better.

1790
02:20:43,358 --> 02:20:43,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not 100%.

1791
02:20:43,678 --> 02:20:51,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of the newcomers and some of the younger dogs, the puppies that haven't been taught this yet, we work with them.

1792
02:20:52,168 --> 02:20:53,148
[SPEAKER_11]: We install this.

1793
02:20:53,208 --> 02:20:53,869
[SPEAKER_11]: We teach them.

1794
02:20:54,009 --> 02:20:55,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a very strong community.

1795
02:20:56,590 --> 02:20:58,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have our own set of unwritten rules.

1796
02:20:59,411 --> 02:21:02,132
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want any trouble for anyone, of course.

1797
02:21:03,493 --> 02:21:12,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as some of the other items that you mentioned, and I'd like to address everyone's as well, if anyone has questions.

1798
02:21:12,237 --> 02:21:14,018
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is lighting there.

1799
02:21:14,838 --> 02:21:15,478
[SPEAKER_11]: There is lighting.

1800
02:21:16,019 --> 02:21:17,359
[SPEAKER_11]: There are two very bright lamps.

1801
02:21:17,419 --> 02:21:18,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're 1,000 watt lamps.

1802
02:21:20,105 --> 02:21:24,868
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the street grid, the National Grid controls.

1803
02:21:25,868 --> 02:21:29,390
[SPEAKER_11]: It's run off of Granville Avenue, the end of Granville Ave.

1804
02:21:31,231 --> 02:21:34,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And they light up the park well enough at night.

1805
02:21:34,913 --> 02:21:35,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm there at night.

1806
02:21:37,734 --> 02:21:42,857
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a pole with two lamps, one facing the parking lot and one facing the back section of the park.

1807
02:21:43,637 --> 02:21:43,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1808
02:21:44,958 --> 02:21:49,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've called many times to have those lamps repaired when the lights are out.

1809
02:21:50,133 --> 02:21:51,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And National Grid does respond.

1810
02:21:54,834 --> 02:21:57,075
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm very strongly against fencing of any sort.

1811
02:21:58,315 --> 02:22:02,837
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as any of the other issues you have, any questions anyone has for me, I'm sorry.

1812
02:22:03,197 --> 02:22:04,677
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a lot spoken about tonight.

1813
02:22:06,358 --> 02:22:06,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1814
02:22:08,118 --> 02:22:09,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I please mention one more thing?

1815
02:22:11,479 --> 02:22:12,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We're organized.

1816
02:22:12,599 --> 02:22:15,860
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a Facebook group page with about 90 members on it.

1817
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:18,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And we organize cleanup days.

1818
02:22:18,618 --> 02:22:19,718
[SPEAKER_11]: volunteer cleanup days.

1819
02:22:19,778 --> 02:22:26,481
[SPEAKER_11]: We have dozens of people come and clean up every piece of litter and any type of leftover dog waste.

1820
02:22:27,381 --> 02:22:40,086
[SPEAKER_11]: We, I find one pile of waste on average a week and I purchased a mailbox and I hung it and I myself and others replenish it with empty dog bags.

1821
02:22:40,946 --> 02:22:43,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Cleanliness is absolutely supported.

1822
02:22:44,047 --> 02:22:46,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you that when you have a community setting,

1823
02:22:47,151 --> 02:22:52,355
[SPEAKER_11]: there is a social responsibility to pick up after your dog, whereas... Yes, sir.

1824
02:22:52,455 --> 02:22:54,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Scott.

1825
02:22:54,837 --> 02:23:01,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate what you're saying, but as we talk about a pilot program, we're actually notifying everybody in the community now.

1826
02:23:01,983 --> 02:23:04,425
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just your backyard anymore.

1827
02:23:04,766 --> 02:23:04,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1828
02:23:05,166 --> 02:23:12,112
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's happening is we're gonna be inviting everybody, and there are gonna be people that have dogs that aren't gonna have the same philosophy as you.

1829
02:23:13,053 --> 02:23:15,635
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a little alarming to me, to be honest with you.

1830
02:23:16,795 --> 02:23:21,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reference, the way you're putting this, you're making it sound that there's a great community and I can appreciate that.

1831
02:23:21,497 --> 02:23:22,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is a great community.

1832
02:23:23,057 --> 02:23:31,460
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I hear that you maintain the park in ways, but we're opening it up to everybody, the whole community.

1833
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:39,763
[SPEAKER_14]: So if people come into that area and don't go with your Facebook group or how is that gonna be handled?

1834
02:23:39,803 --> 02:23:40,803
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you gonna handle that?

1835
02:23:41,384 --> 02:23:43,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, I agree with you entirely.

1836
02:23:43,744 --> 02:23:45,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I met with the mayor,

1837
02:23:46,051 --> 02:23:48,833
[SPEAKER_11]: mentioned that this can't succeed in one space.

1838
02:23:48,853 --> 02:23:50,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with you, too.

1839
02:23:50,615 --> 02:23:51,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It cannot.

1840
02:23:51,576 --> 02:23:59,503
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be a neighborhood-based program spread out around the city in the appropriate spaces, car park, the other parks.

1841
02:24:00,003 --> 02:24:05,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't vouch for parks and neighborhoods that I'm unfamiliar with.

1842
02:24:06,008 --> 02:24:07,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So I couldn't have a list.

1843
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:12,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a major crackdown after see, click, fix was initiated.

1844
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:20,683
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people started complaining and Mr. Hogan got very, very busy enforcing the leash law because the complaints were just flooding in all over the city.

1845
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:29,829
[SPEAKER_11]: That made it nearly impossible for me to visit the neighborhoods and find people who brought their dogs regularly to parks and get organized.

1846
02:24:31,109 --> 02:24:33,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I could only do that successfully in my neighborhood.

1847
02:24:33,831 --> 02:24:41,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree 100% I would like this proposal modified to remove the fencing,

1848
02:24:42,183 --> 02:24:46,705
[SPEAKER_11]: and to add additional spaces, three, four, five, six, whatever would work best.

1849
02:24:47,565 --> 02:24:54,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hoping to do this citywide and I was not able to do it because the parks are empty suddenly.

1850
02:24:56,709 --> 02:24:58,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, thank you.

1851
02:24:59,351 --> 02:24:59,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1852
02:25:02,412 --> 02:25:02,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

1853
02:25:02,952 --> 02:25:04,693
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1854
02:25:05,113 --> 02:25:05,353
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1855
02:25:05,413 --> 02:25:06,634
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is a Philip Osino.

1856
02:25:06,774 --> 02:25:09,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll leave a grant at 55 at Granville Ave in Memphis.

1857
02:25:09,863 --> 02:25:12,443
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Councilman, to listen to what I have to say.

1858
02:25:14,624 --> 02:25:18,665
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been a resident of South Medford for the last 44 years.

1859
02:25:19,605 --> 02:25:26,826
[SPEAKER_27]: That park there has been a recreational park for everybody that plays over there, that plays softball, that play football.

1860
02:25:27,526 --> 02:25:34,087
[SPEAKER_27]: The particular area that they're trying to block it off, that particular area has been used by St.

1861
02:25:34,107 --> 02:25:35,248
[SPEAKER_27]: Clement's football team.

1862
02:25:35,428 --> 02:25:37,388
[SPEAKER_27]: They come and practice and

1863
02:25:37,860 --> 02:25:43,244
[SPEAKER_27]: Not only that, if you block it off, they have no place to go to practice.

1864
02:25:43,264 --> 02:25:46,267
[SPEAKER_27]: In the summertime, there's little kids that come to the park.

1865
02:25:47,067 --> 02:25:53,612
[SPEAKER_27]: They have a recreational area that they play on the particular area right beside the parking lot.

1866
02:25:54,933 --> 02:25:59,497
[SPEAKER_27]: They have an hour, two hours, they play games, and they go to the pool.

1867
02:26:00,397 --> 02:26:05,822
[SPEAKER_27]: In the last two weeks that I talked with the staff members of St.

1868
02:26:05,842 --> 02:26:06,262
[SPEAKER_27]: Clement's,

1869
02:26:08,355 --> 02:26:19,541
[SPEAKER_27]: kindergarten kids that they have a program, and two of the kids that step on dog poop, and they had to clean it up with a towel that they were going to the swimming pool.

1870
02:26:20,641 --> 02:26:22,442
[SPEAKER_27]: Now this one here to me is disturbing.

1871
02:26:23,383 --> 02:26:33,588
[SPEAKER_27]: I raised three kids on that area there, and to have kids step on dog poop and then they have to take it home, that's unsanitary in my book.

1872
02:26:36,309 --> 02:26:43,678
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, now if you, this program, this pilot program gets approved, okay, it's going to create a lot of problems.

1873
02:26:44,579 --> 02:26:49,765
[SPEAKER_27]: On the left side where you guys see where it's all yelled off from across from

1874
02:26:52,112 --> 02:26:54,293
[SPEAKER_27]: the parking lot on the opposite side.

1875
02:26:54,914 --> 02:26:58,035
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a seven family that live on that, on those property there.

1876
02:26:58,215 --> 02:27:00,116
[SPEAKER_27]: And they, and they raise gardens.

1877
02:27:01,077 --> 02:27:04,179
[SPEAKER_27]: Now there is dogs that they go all over the place and everything else.

1878
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:11,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Three of the gentlemen that they live on that side there had to come out and yell at the people that they had the dog, the dogs there.

1879
02:27:15,305 --> 02:27:17,526
[SPEAKER_27]: I called the Board of Health many times.

1880
02:27:18,294 --> 02:27:20,895
[SPEAKER_27]: I complained, laws are being broken.

1881
02:27:21,315 --> 02:27:24,016
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a sign over there that says, no off-leash dog.

1882
02:27:25,477 --> 02:27:30,058
[SPEAKER_27]: I spoke with some of the mothers that they have little kids at St.

1883
02:27:30,078 --> 02:27:30,458
[SPEAKER_27]: Clement's.

1884
02:27:31,159 --> 02:27:33,240
[SPEAKER_27]: They told me, says, we afraid to go down the park.

1885
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:38,461
[SPEAKER_27]: One of my kids are practicing for soccer because there is dogs off-leash.

1886
02:27:39,482 --> 02:27:41,463
[SPEAKER_27]: So I got three dogs on my own.

1887
02:27:41,543 --> 02:27:42,143
[SPEAKER_27]: I love dogs.

1888
02:27:43,183 --> 02:27:44,204
[SPEAKER_27]: I was raised with 17 dogs.

1889
02:27:45,693 --> 02:27:46,333
[SPEAKER_27]: in my country.

1890
02:27:47,173 --> 02:27:48,094
[SPEAKER_27]: So I love dogs.

1891
02:27:48,114 --> 02:27:49,634
[SPEAKER_27]: There is no doubt about that.

1892
02:27:50,094 --> 02:27:54,815
[SPEAKER_27]: But when it comes to kids, that's the first priority that it's supposed to be.

1893
02:27:55,875 --> 02:27:56,896
[SPEAKER_27]: Not anything else.

1894
02:27:56,916 --> 02:27:58,476
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, dogs, they can run wild.

1895
02:28:01,077 --> 02:28:04,077
[SPEAKER_27]: Buy a farm, put them in the farm, let them run wild in the farm.

1896
02:28:04,637 --> 02:28:08,058
[SPEAKER_27]: Not in the park where there is human beings and there is kids.

1897
02:28:12,199 --> 02:28:13,780
[SPEAKER_27]: I thank you very much to listen to me.

1898
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:15,520
[SPEAKER_27]: And I appreciate it.

1899
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:23,504
[SPEAKER_27]: And I would appreciate if you both know on this proposal, because this proposal is gonna create more problems than it is.

1900
02:28:24,905 --> 02:28:25,285
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1901
02:28:25,745 --> 02:28:28,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1902
02:28:29,827 --> 02:28:35,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Alana... Hi, good evening.

1903
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:37,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1904
02:28:37,711 --> 02:28:39,172
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Alana Pierkowski.

1905
02:28:39,372 --> 02:28:40,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 5 Russell Street.

1906
02:28:41,653 --> 02:28:44,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to

1907
02:28:45,458 --> 02:28:49,199
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about this issue, which is very near and dear to me.

1908
02:28:49,559 --> 02:28:54,261
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of questions that you guys have brought up that I just wanted to give my own points on.

1909
02:28:55,501 --> 02:29:07,985
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that I wouldn't necessarily think of this as a dog park in the same way as the one that Councilor Marks has been working on so hard, which I think is a great thing.

1910
02:29:08,325 --> 02:29:14,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost consider this as an option for dog owners who live in Medford right now

1911
02:29:15,687 --> 02:29:26,691
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a place where they can take their dogs and get them the exercise that Patrick talked about now, as opposed to a year plus from now when we're going to be getting a dog park.

1912
02:29:26,731 --> 02:29:28,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we have nowhere to go.

1913
02:29:30,352 --> 02:29:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So dogs need to exercise.

1914
02:29:34,334 --> 02:29:37,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Off-leash is the best way, especially for young dogs, to be able to do that.

1915
02:29:40,624 --> 02:29:43,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a dog park in a traditional sense?

1916
02:29:43,605 --> 02:29:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not, but it's a place where Medford residents who are paying taxes to be able to use our parks, dog owners can use our parks.

1917
02:29:54,749 --> 02:30:02,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that, you know, I understand what he was saying about children, but part of the beauty about it having specific hours

1918
02:30:02,653 --> 02:30:08,536
[SPEAKER_02]: is there are specific hours where the dogs can be there and everybody can know this is the time when the dogs are there.

1919
02:30:08,576 --> 02:30:14,079
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're afraid of dogs, there's plenty of hours during the day and plenty of other parks that children can go to.

1920
02:30:14,919 --> 02:30:26,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarding Councillor Falco's very good question about policing, I don't know anywhere that has a dog park in any city that has a cop right there watching.

1921
02:30:27,251 --> 02:30:31,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's not the way dog parks work, and it is a lot of self-policing.

1922
02:30:31,377 --> 02:30:34,982
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when there's a problem, you call and you have somebody come.

1923
02:30:35,083 --> 02:30:37,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You call the cops if there's a problem with anything.

1924
02:30:38,087 --> 02:30:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't usually happen, because for the most part, the way it's supposed to work, and the way it does work,

1925
02:30:42,613 --> 02:30:50,237
[SPEAKER_02]: is that responsible dog owners take their dogs and they play and then they leave and they clean up after them.

1926
02:30:50,577 --> 02:30:57,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole cleaning up after poop, having a leash on your dog or not having a leash on your dog has nothing to do with cleaning up the poop.

1927
02:30:57,961 --> 02:31:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: People who don't clean up after their dogs, they're not cleaning up after their dogs when they're walking them in front of my house and they're pooping in front of my house.

1928
02:31:04,697 --> 02:31:07,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a totally separate matter that also should be policed.

1929
02:31:08,259 --> 02:31:12,622
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't clean up after your dog, you should get a ticket, regardless of where you're at.

1930
02:31:13,743 --> 02:31:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's a separate issue from the idea of a place where dogs can go and get the exercise that they need, that we desperately need in this city.

1931
02:31:23,208 --> 02:31:25,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, we don't have it all.

1932
02:31:26,951 --> 02:31:33,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea of having to take your dogs daily to another city to exercise them

1933
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: is really hard.

1934
02:31:36,031 --> 02:31:43,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who would wanna have to take their kids to Somerville to play every day or to Arlington or to anywhere?

1935
02:31:44,156 --> 02:32:01,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if this is the exact right answer for us, but I'm hoping that you as a city council can work with the mayor to figure out something for me and the thousands of other people in Medford that have dogs.

1936
02:32:01,446 --> 02:32:02,707
[SPEAKER_02]: My dog is my child.

1937
02:32:05,631 --> 02:32:16,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to use our wonderful resources, and I don't know how I can do that, and I don't know how to get organized about that.

1938
02:32:18,158 --> 02:32:20,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried contacting the mayor.

1939
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried contacting several of you.

1940
02:32:22,941 --> 02:32:24,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else I can do.

1941
02:32:28,802 --> 02:32:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: please help me, help us.

1942
02:32:31,644 --> 02:32:39,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are a lot of us that have dogs and we would be willing, I get my dog licensed, I get both my dogs licensed every year.

1943
02:32:39,629 --> 02:32:43,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the first ones, I think I'm number 14 and 15 on my licenses.

1944
02:32:44,172 --> 02:32:53,218
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have more options for dog owners to use, they'd have more reason to go get licensed.

1945
02:32:55,039 --> 02:32:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1946
02:32:59,996 --> 02:33:00,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councillor Marks.

1947
02:33:01,397 --> 02:33:04,258
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, do you support fencing or no fencing?

1948
02:33:05,219 --> 02:33:13,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, honestly, I prefer no fencing for my dogs because I've got two golden retrievers.

1949
02:33:13,283 --> 02:33:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the sweetest things.

1950
02:33:14,223 --> 02:33:15,243
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need to run.

1951
02:33:15,384 --> 02:33:24,288
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest thing about fencing is it usually ends up being a small park that doesn't give me the option to throw the ball the 200 feet that they'd like to be able to go.

1952
02:33:25,068 --> 02:33:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's going to take a fence in order for me to be able to let them off leash,

1953
02:33:30,031 --> 02:33:30,652
[SPEAKER_02]: have a fence.

1954
02:33:31,072 --> 02:33:44,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know the answer to fencing to not fencing, but I do know that for the most part of the year, when I want to go to the park, there's nobody else there, and it wouldn't matter if there's a fence or not.

1955
02:33:45,839 --> 02:33:48,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Like during the winter, nobody's using the parks.

1956
02:33:49,121 --> 02:33:55,006
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nobody there except the people with the dogs when it's 20 degrees, when there's three feet of snow.

1957
02:33:55,326 --> 02:33:56,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not even just 6 p.m.

1958
02:33:56,827 --> 02:33:58,588
[SPEAKER_02]: to 8 p.m., that's all day long.

1959
02:33:59,269 --> 02:34:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And the parks are being completely underutilized, but they could be.

1960
02:34:05,585 --> 02:34:10,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, insofar as what makes the most sense, I've seen it both ways.

1961
02:34:10,727 --> 02:34:12,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just in Brooklyn.

1962
02:34:12,267 --> 02:34:13,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooklyn can make this work.

1963
02:34:14,148 --> 02:34:23,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Brooklyn, and they have awfully showers in a park with no fence from, I think it was, I can't remember, sometime after dinner, all night, until 9 a.m.

1964
02:34:23,931 --> 02:34:24,511
[SPEAKER_02]: the next morning.

1965
02:34:26,442 --> 02:34:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, I think a lot of it's a matter of having confidence that people are going to be responsible for their dogs, and if they're not, then go and figure out how to deal with it, rather than trying to overthink it and make it hard.

1966
02:34:46,117 --> 02:34:51,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's plenty of places that have dog parks with fences, and there's plenty that have them without.

1967
02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:54,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of it also depends on the location of the park.

1968
02:34:54,742 --> 02:34:59,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if your park is right near a major road, I'd absolutely want a fence.

1969
02:35:00,526 --> 02:35:06,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it was right off of 28, I wouldn't feel comfortable having my dogs play right near 28.

1970
02:35:07,470 --> 02:35:14,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's in a safe location where, if they happen to stray a little bit off, I don't have to worry about them getting hit by a car,

1971
02:35:15,071 --> 02:35:22,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the need for a fence for my dogs and for all of the dogs that I know that play in the parks that I particularly go to.

1972
02:35:22,713 --> 02:35:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been taking my dogs down to Hingham because I can, because it's legal there to let them go swimming.

1973
02:35:30,555 --> 02:35:37,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no fences, it's this great little isthmus and they go swimming and they run around and it's fabulous and it works great.

1974
02:35:40,457 --> 02:35:40,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1975
02:35:45,530 --> 02:35:58,515
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Solicitor, Mr. Solicitor, do we know if this proposal will displace any existing arrangements that are there?

1976
02:35:59,055 --> 02:36:00,296
[SPEAKER_24]: In particular, will St.

1977
02:36:00,316 --> 02:36:06,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Clement's School football be displaced by the initiating of this program?

1978
02:36:06,598 --> 02:36:10,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard this issue raised by one of the councilors yesterday, a telephone call.

1979
02:36:10,879 --> 02:36:12,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I've asked Mr. Hogan about it.

1980
02:36:13,733 --> 02:36:16,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have any personal knowledge of that.

1981
02:36:17,235 --> 02:36:18,075
[SPEAKER_15]: When I heard about St.

1982
02:36:18,356 --> 02:36:21,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Clement's football team, I hadn't heard that before.

1983
02:36:21,638 --> 02:36:23,939
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can't affirm or disaffirm that.

1984
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,941
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Solis.

1985
02:36:26,861 --> 02:36:27,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, ma'am.

1986
02:36:27,622 --> 02:36:27,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

1987
02:36:28,002 --> 02:36:29,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1988
02:36:29,963 --> 02:36:31,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Laura Osino, 55 Granville Ave.

1989
02:36:32,425 --> 02:36:32,745
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

1990
02:36:33,317 --> 02:36:33,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1991
02:36:35,237 --> 02:36:40,418
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to ask you to not vote for anything without offense.

1992
02:36:41,039 --> 02:36:42,759
[SPEAKER_28]: I've lived on Granville Ave all my life.

1993
02:36:43,619 --> 02:36:48,300
[SPEAKER_28]: And within the last several years, I've encountered many problems with the off-leash dogs.

1994
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:52,461
[SPEAKER_28]: My dog has gotten bitten a couple of times.

1995
02:36:53,161 --> 02:36:58,862
[SPEAKER_28]: One instance was a pit bull latched onto the rear end of my 13-pound dog and would not let go.

1996
02:36:59,362 --> 02:37:00,863
[SPEAKER_28]: And I yelled, whose dog is this?

1997
02:37:00,903 --> 02:37:02,063
[SPEAKER_28]: And nobody came forward.

1998
02:37:02,903 --> 02:37:08,146
[SPEAKER_28]: The person that was with the dog was on the far side of the park with another off-leash dog.

1999
02:37:08,166 --> 02:37:10,748
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I've seen them run into the neighborhood.

2000
02:37:11,248 --> 02:37:13,449
[SPEAKER_28]: I've had two of them run in my yard.

2001
02:37:13,469 --> 02:37:17,872
[SPEAKER_28]: The owners have had to come in my yard and chase the dogs to get them.

2002
02:37:18,672 --> 02:37:22,554
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would really appreciate if you do not vote on anything without offense.

2003
02:37:23,875 --> 02:37:25,936
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a safety issue as far as I'm concerned.

2004
02:37:27,677 --> 02:37:28,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mrs. Rusty.

2005
02:37:28,578 --> 02:37:28,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2006
02:37:33,285 --> 02:37:33,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2007
02:37:33,865 --> 02:37:35,686
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2008
02:37:35,766 --> 02:37:38,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Gary DeStefano, 31 Goldsmith Ave at Medford.

2009
02:37:39,748 --> 02:37:43,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So I heard about this Friday night and I wasn't too sure if I was fired against it.

2010
02:37:43,849 --> 02:37:46,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So I came here tonight to see what it's all about.

2011
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:48,311
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the concerns was the fence.

2012
02:37:48,851 --> 02:37:51,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Another concern was the definition of a well-behaved dog.

2013
02:37:52,632 --> 02:37:55,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's been answered tonight by the council.

2014
02:37:56,014 --> 02:37:59,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically all the concerns you have

2015
02:38:00,308 --> 02:38:03,791
[SPEAKER_08]: of the same concerns for the dog park that we've already voted and said we're going to put in.

2016
02:38:04,752 --> 02:38:07,194
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as policing goes, it's always self-policed.

2017
02:38:07,935 --> 02:38:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as fence, I think we should have a fencing, but David's against fencing.

2018
02:38:14,581 --> 02:38:17,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That's neither here nor there for me.

2019
02:38:18,064 --> 02:38:22,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think the main difference between the dog park that we voted for and having

2020
02:38:23,436 --> 02:38:25,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one, the biggest difference, is $350,000.

2021
02:38:26,137 --> 02:38:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to cost you $10,000 for a fence.

2022
02:38:30,119 --> 02:38:33,260
[SPEAKER_08]: We're putting in a dog park that's going to end up costing $375,000.

2023
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:39,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can put up a bunch of these little guys, I'm all for it.

2024
02:38:40,363 --> 02:38:42,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer.

2025
02:38:42,644 --> 02:38:46,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I just came down to listen, but I decided I'm for it.

2026
02:38:50,268 --> 02:38:50,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2027
02:38:55,776 --> 02:38:57,817
[SPEAKER_24]: The chair recognizes the gentleman from East Medford.

2028
02:38:59,758 --> 02:39:00,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2029
02:39:00,298 --> 02:39:05,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Counselor, president Andrew Kasten, Eddie Cushion street method mass.

2030
02:39:06,982 --> 02:39:15,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, first off everything body and pet deserves to have us place.

2031
02:39:15,666 --> 02:39:18,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely agree with it and away.

2032
02:39:19,028 --> 02:39:24,971
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I do like some dogs and at times even more than some of the people.

2033
02:39:26,809 --> 02:39:39,157
[SPEAKER_00]: But dogs, if they're unleashed in a public area, they must be in a fenced-in area, or else we may for sure have an extra safety problem in 02155.

2034
02:39:39,357 --> 02:39:52,046
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's approved, therefore, would the city, although they say maybe no, be responsible for any dog attacks in the future?

2035
02:39:54,905 --> 02:39:56,826
[SPEAKER_00]: for dogs behaving badly?

2036
02:39:59,026 --> 02:40:05,848
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the so-called $1.5 million, whatever the figure was, dog park?

2037
02:40:06,988 --> 02:40:09,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, maybe we don't need the dog park.

2038
02:40:11,009 --> 02:40:17,571
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we cancel that dog park and give our money back to the taxpayers or grant money?

2039
02:40:19,711 --> 02:40:22,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, who decides if a dog is well-behaved?

2040
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:31,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is true, according to GOP, is it not possible for any dog to have a bout of rage?

2041
02:40:34,116 --> 02:40:49,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, if you, the political leaders, allow this, you may have, maybe you should have dog owners post a bond in the city also to cover all possible dog attacks and injuries.

2042
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:56,671
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, maybe my godfather was right.

2043
02:40:57,311 --> 02:41:02,713
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, in this country, they care more about the dogs than they do the people.

2044
02:41:05,314 --> 02:41:19,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my friend's daughter, as a girl, was brutally mauled in her face and attacked by a dog and required multiple surgeries and, I'm sure, trauma to this day.

2045
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:22,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sad.

2046
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:34,546
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S., the average lawsuit, I believe I told the mayor at a meeting over a month ago about this, is about $40,000 per dog attack in the United States of America.

2047
02:41:37,368 --> 02:41:41,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally speaking, I would not repeal your city's leash law.

2048
02:41:43,251 --> 02:41:46,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, I would reason on the side of caution and safety.

2049
02:41:47,373 --> 02:41:48,694
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog is in your court.

2050
02:41:48,834 --> 02:41:49,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.

2051
02:41:53,102 --> 02:41:53,482
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2052
02:41:53,582 --> 02:41:54,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

2053
02:41:55,884 --> 02:41:57,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2054
02:41:57,726 --> 02:42:03,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, at the beginning of a solicitor Runley's presentation, he said there are two ordinances that need to be changed.

2055
02:42:03,971 --> 02:42:12,418
[SPEAKER_22]: So the first ordinance would be the city council's ordinance, which says that off leash dogs are prohibited citywide.

2056
02:42:13,159 --> 02:42:15,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Then he also said that there's a parks department ordinance.

2057
02:42:15,621 --> 02:42:18,303
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like the solicitor to come up and explain this a little bit further.

2058
02:42:19,523 --> 02:42:26,827
[SPEAKER_22]: because the way I'm looking at it is we could pass this piece of legislation tonight, and it goes forward, and it goes to the Parks Department, and they say, so what?

2059
02:42:27,927 --> 02:42:33,430
[SPEAKER_22]: We have the authority to determine whether or not we're gonna allow dogs in our parks off-leash or not.

2060
02:42:34,390 --> 02:42:36,571
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd just like a little clarification from the solicitor if that's.

2061
02:42:36,611 --> 02:42:41,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, the reason that the two ordinances are referred to is that they kind of overlap.

2062
02:42:41,354 --> 02:42:48,497
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the Parks Commission that has jurisdiction over the parks, this particular dog,

2063
02:42:49,138 --> 02:42:51,140
[SPEAKER_15]: off leash dog area would be in a park.

2064
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:52,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore it's under their jurisdiction.

2065
02:42:53,241 --> 02:42:58,645
[SPEAKER_15]: The second ordinance we have is a wider jurisdiction, which is the entire city.

2066
02:42:58,925 --> 02:43:00,566
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not supposed to have a dog off a leash.

2067
02:43:00,986 --> 02:43:04,469
[SPEAKER_15]: So indeed, if this is to go forward, it has to go forward.

2068
02:43:04,869 --> 02:43:06,630
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is very odd and very unique.

2069
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:12,494
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to be approved two places here and before the park commission.

2070
02:43:13,054 --> 02:43:18,378
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is possible that the city council could, these are the arrays of choices that you have.

2071
02:43:18,867 --> 02:43:24,908
[SPEAKER_15]: If you pass this in whatever form, whether it's tonight or another night, it still has to go to the parks board.

2072
02:43:25,868 --> 02:43:31,750
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you passed it and they didn't, it doesn't happen because you can't overrule their decision or their discretion.

2073
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:39,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Secondly, you could send it to them first for them to make a decision before you do, which is not an invalid choice either.

2074
02:43:39,751 --> 02:43:41,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they said no, then it would stop there.

2075
02:43:42,912 --> 02:43:46,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the different and unique combinations that occur

2076
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:50,791
[SPEAKER_15]: because of the location of this particular endeavor.

2077
02:43:51,031 --> 02:43:51,691
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in a park.

2078
02:43:52,351 --> 02:44:00,234
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's under the jurisdiction of the park board, and the city is under the jurisdiction of the general ordinances, which is you.

2079
02:44:01,074 --> 02:44:02,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's the relationship between the two.

2080
02:44:02,914 --> 02:44:07,736
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, has the park board been consulted at all?

2081
02:44:08,016 --> 02:44:09,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I've talked to Mr. Graham about it.

2082
02:44:12,197 --> 02:44:16,678
[SPEAKER_15]: He shared with me some of his feelings, but I'm sure that those are his to share, not mine.

2083
02:44:17,868 --> 02:44:45,719
[SPEAKER_15]: uh... he said that he would await its receipt if indeed it comes and they will handle it in due course and uh... just one more minute monthly at this point in time yeah i didn't know if they were meeting tonight uh... but uh... they they certainly were talking apparently about rights bond for a great deal of fear their meeting in the head of the business but this would not have been something that i would start there anyway because if it's if it's not okay from the point of view of the council then i don't think it'd be

2084
02:44:48,192 --> 02:44:51,515
[SPEAKER_15]: not wise to send it, it would be inappropriate to send it to the Park Board.

2085
02:44:52,135 --> 02:44:58,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Conversely, it could have started there, but it's really an equivocal choice, one or the other.

2086
02:44:58,660 --> 02:45:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: It's here, and you could refer it to the Park Board for their determination, or you could put it into a committee, or you could act on it tonight.

2087
02:45:08,048 --> 02:45:11,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm preaching to the choir here, because I know you're well-versed in what your options are.

2088
02:45:11,751 --> 02:45:14,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2089
02:45:14,593 --> 02:45:14,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2090
02:45:15,734 --> 02:45:16,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2091
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:18,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes council Scott Peller.

2092
02:45:19,882 --> 02:45:21,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, thank you.

2093
02:45:21,783 --> 02:45:22,383
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a solicitor.

2094
02:45:22,423 --> 02:45:26,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I just to go over a direct question to you.

2095
02:45:26,346 --> 02:45:29,808
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know that I know that Mr. Caviello wants to say something quickly.

2096
02:45:30,308 --> 02:45:31,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I can yell to him.

2097
02:45:31,849 --> 02:45:33,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

2098
02:45:33,950 --> 02:45:39,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Peel the two audits that we have already actually, because this is a pilot, they would stay in effect.

2099
02:45:39,554 --> 02:45:41,415
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be kind of like a relief.

2100
02:45:41,855 --> 02:45:43,016
[SPEAKER_19]: They kind of run contrary to each other.

2101
02:45:43,036 --> 02:45:43,376
[SPEAKER_19]: You're saying,

2102
02:45:43,950 --> 02:45:45,290
[SPEAKER_19]: One's saying, yes, you know, you.

2103
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:45,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no, no.

2104
02:45:45,870 --> 02:45:47,911
[SPEAKER_15]: The park board would still have to pass it if you do.

2105
02:45:48,271 --> 02:45:48,931
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to have both.

2106
02:45:50,451 --> 02:45:52,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can't, they're not going to be conflicting.

2107
02:45:52,972 --> 02:46:04,734
[SPEAKER_15]: If the pilot program passes here and before the park board, the application of those two ordinances on that area would be, or we could use the word waived for a particular window of time.

2108
02:46:05,374 --> 02:46:05,954
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's all.

2109
02:46:06,735 --> 02:46:13,616
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what this, that's I, I, I understand the point about different pilot programs and the number of pilot programs.

2110
02:46:14,050 --> 02:46:16,892
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is the type of area that you would want to have some study on.

2111
02:46:17,332 --> 02:46:19,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether or not this is the one you want is another issue.

2112
02:46:20,794 --> 02:46:22,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say this about fence.

2113
02:46:23,536 --> 02:46:40,746
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no, fence to me, I don't want to, in 32 years here at City Hall, the different dog cases that we've had to be involved in, myself, Mr. Hogan have been involved in a couple that are very serious.

2114
02:46:41,587 --> 02:46:43,248
[SPEAKER_15]: The fence is not negotiable.

2115
02:46:44,472 --> 02:47:08,372
[SPEAKER_15]: If you ask, if there was ever a sense to remove the fence, then I would recommend that this not pass, not because I don't trust the opinions or the experiences of those who have spoken tonight, but because the experiences that we've had with dog cases that have gone wrong have injured children, some seniors significantly and human life is sacred and must be protected.

2116
02:47:13,834 --> 02:47:15,255
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll set council.

2117
02:47:15,955 --> 02:47:16,256
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

2118
02:47:16,296 --> 02:47:16,856
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you.

2119
02:47:16,916 --> 02:47:17,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

2120
02:47:17,937 --> 02:47:19,618
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes the council Scott.

2121
02:47:19,958 --> 02:47:22,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2122
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:33,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I've, I've had phone calls for and, um, against this, this, this, um, this process and, and I've had great dialogue with many different community members.

2123
02:47:33,487 --> 02:47:40,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And I concur with my fellow colleagues done such a great job and Mr. Marks and bringing a true dog park to our community.

2124
02:47:41,086 --> 02:47:51,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I work in a community that has dog parks set aside all over the areas, and they're all fenced in, and they're a great option for their constituents.

2125
02:47:53,592 --> 02:48:00,415
[SPEAKER_14]: I also look at this process with a fence being something I wouldn't give in with.

2126
02:48:00,555 --> 02:48:09,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's important that if you look at the area, it's a big enough area that if you throw a ball, that the dogs are going to be able to run

2127
02:48:10,225 --> 02:48:11,346
[SPEAKER_14]: freely in that area.

2128
02:48:11,586 --> 02:48:13,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can understand that.

2129
02:48:13,887 --> 02:48:26,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also feel that this is something that being a pilot program and being first time on the committee and understanding that this is the first pilot program that's coming to our desk and looking at a time limit on that.

2130
02:48:26,812 --> 02:48:29,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that time limit be complete?

2131
02:48:29,533 --> 02:48:34,655
[SPEAKER_14]: The pilot program will be complete as of January 1st, 2017 and then revisited.

2132
02:48:34,715 --> 02:48:37,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that's the intention of the ordinance as presently written.

2133
02:48:37,156 --> 02:48:38,897
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that pilot program,

2134
02:48:39,772 --> 02:48:51,456
[SPEAKER_14]: putting in place safety being the number one concern, and the opportunity to have an area where our dog families can run.

2135
02:48:51,796 --> 02:48:58,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that my wife will be there with our dog, because she has the 60-foot leash.

2136
02:48:58,859 --> 02:49:03,100
[SPEAKER_14]: And my wife's a marathon runner, so my dog runs with my wife six miles a day.

2137
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:05,841
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know the importance.

2138
02:49:05,861 --> 02:49:07,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, maybe she tells me I should take him out

2139
02:49:09,377 --> 02:49:10,038
[SPEAKER_14]: That won't happen.

2140
02:49:10,358 --> 02:49:14,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but I look at, I look at the situation and it's something our community needs.

2141
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:19,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's, it cries for something as long as it's policed the right way.

2142
02:49:20,262 --> 02:49:38,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the biggest concerns I had were without that fence and having a dog that the people that follow those ordinances and have the dogs on the leash and having a dog that might not be part of the program or part of this group that's there now that maybe is a little more rambunctious and jumping on that dog or that person.

2143
02:49:38,818 --> 02:49:41,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I think frightens me and I think that's my number one concern.

2144
02:49:42,781 --> 02:49:49,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so if, if it is moving forward, I think that, uh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't entertain it without that.

2145
02:49:49,827 --> 02:49:58,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and then the case that I want to get to as a liability piece, I know that we say that we're not liable, but truth of the matter is we are correct.

2146
02:49:58,794 --> 02:50:04,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Truth of the matter is that the city of Medford, like any other municipality is responsible for its negligence.

2147
02:50:05,239 --> 02:50:08,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and if, if the negligence of the city led to some,

2148
02:50:09,605 --> 02:50:15,029
[SPEAKER_15]: damage or some injury, then, depending upon the facts of the case, yes, indeed, we could be liable.

2149
02:50:15,289 --> 02:50:15,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2150
02:50:15,709 --> 02:50:16,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2151
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:17,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Solisa.

2152
02:50:20,073 --> 02:50:21,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

2153
02:50:21,794 --> 02:50:22,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair awaits a motion.

2154
02:50:25,457 --> 02:50:27,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caravaglio.

2155
02:50:27,119 --> 02:50:30,461
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I'll make a motion that we refer this to the Parks Department for their opinion.

2156
02:50:31,162 --> 02:50:38,408
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Caravaglio that the matter be referred to the Parks Department

2157
02:50:39,075 --> 02:50:39,495
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

2158
02:50:43,278 --> 02:50:47,382
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, that this be sent to the Parks Department.

2159
02:50:48,062 --> 02:50:52,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am, if you would like to please present yourself, please state your name and address for the record.

2160
02:50:53,186 --> 02:50:53,546
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2161
02:50:53,606 --> 02:50:56,849
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Alexis Smith at 4 Bellevue Terrace in Medford.

2162
02:50:57,530 --> 02:51:01,793
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to thank you all, councilors, for considering this and the city for its work.

2163
02:51:02,774 --> 02:51:06,957
[SPEAKER_31]: And I want to just express my strong, strong support for this ordinance.

2164
02:51:07,557 --> 02:51:08,198
[SPEAKER_31]: I love talking

2165
02:51:08,438 --> 02:51:34,855
[SPEAKER_31]: park I don't have a backyard myself and so this is my backyard this is the whole community's backyard and I love that on any given night there's kids riding bikes and kicking a soccer ball around and people playing softball and and we the dog owners are there too it's amazing for my dog to be able to run around and to socialize with other dogs it's a lot healthier for him that way and honestly it's amazing for me having a dog now I know more of my neighbors here in Medford

2166
02:51:35,275 --> 02:51:38,696
[SPEAKER_31]: than I have known in any other place I've lived, all combined.

2167
02:51:38,816 --> 02:51:39,457
[SPEAKER_31]: And I love that.

2168
02:51:40,837 --> 02:51:42,978
[SPEAKER_31]: We are a responsible group.

2169
02:51:43,498 --> 02:51:44,379
[SPEAKER_31]: We self-police.

2170
02:51:44,699 --> 02:51:48,300
[SPEAKER_31]: We want this area to be clean and safe.

2171
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:55,943
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that, as was mentioned before, you know, the six to eight hours of usage really make short

2172
02:51:56,623 --> 02:52:02,126
[SPEAKER_31]: It ensures that this is going to be a thing that an area that can be used by everyone if kids want to play during the day That's fine.

2173
02:52:02,166 --> 02:52:13,491
[SPEAKER_31]: They can there's just a specific set of hours when the dogs will be there With regards to the fence, um, I'd prefer not be there But if if that's what it takes to get a dog park here, then then so be it.

2174
02:52:13,531 --> 02:52:21,495
[SPEAKER_31]: That's fine I just I want to be able to bring my dog to the park and have him be able to play with other dogs I love being a part of it here and I thank you for your consideration.

2175
02:52:21,515 --> 02:52:22,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you

2176
02:52:27,554 --> 02:52:29,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

2177
02:52:29,816 --> 02:52:31,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Brian Pilcher.

2178
02:52:31,337 --> 02:52:34,879
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm at 41 Winchester street in Medford, um, abutting this park.

2179
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:37,801
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate your consideration here for this ordinance.

2180
02:52:37,862 --> 02:52:39,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to hit a couple of points.

2181
02:52:39,823 --> 02:52:47,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I concur with another, uh, commenter that I would like you to, you know, as best possible, not consider this to be a traditional dog park.

2182
02:52:48,329 --> 02:52:54,053
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't think anyone in this group that's on the pro side or anyone in the city that's put forth this and visions of $400,000,

2183
02:52:55,452 --> 02:52:56,133
[SPEAKER_12]: expense here.

2184
02:52:57,434 --> 02:53:01,136
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an area for dogs to exercise limited hours during the day.

2185
02:53:01,476 --> 02:53:03,958
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that's been happening for over a decade here already.

2186
02:53:03,978 --> 02:53:17,088
[SPEAKER_12]: The bites and the poop and the cleanliness and the safety issues and the litany of other things that, you know, are real concerns or legitimate concerns, I can tell you for the year and a half that I've been going there,

2187
02:53:18,496 --> 02:53:28,901
[SPEAKER_12]: This community, and Councilor Scarpelli hits a key point as far as you're getting newcomers in, you know, how do you keep that similar responsible culture going?

2188
02:53:29,401 --> 02:53:33,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been mentioned here several times already tonight, the self-policing factor is

2189
02:53:34,997 --> 02:53:37,498
[SPEAKER_12]: is paramount to these, and particularly this park.

2190
02:53:37,598 --> 02:53:50,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would continue regardless of if you get 50 more newcomers from outside of this neighborhood, because there's a core group, quite frankly, of people who don't want to lose the benefit of being able to exercise their dogs here.

2191
02:53:50,602 --> 02:53:55,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a permanent dog park that takes 24-7, but exercise their dogs here.

2192
02:53:56,114 --> 02:54:01,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it doesn't need to be, and I mean this very respectfully, but bureaucratized and overthought.

2193
02:54:01,317 --> 02:54:10,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it can be done in a way that strikes a balance that would meet the solicitor's goals as far as making it legitimate and not exposing the municipality to risk.

2194
02:54:11,084 --> 02:54:12,245
[SPEAKER_12]: There are ways to structure this.

2195
02:54:12,285 --> 02:54:13,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very confident in that.

2196
02:54:13,746 --> 02:54:21,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really ask you to consider it and really, you know, think carefully about it because this group is not a safety hazard.

2197
02:54:21,791 --> 02:54:23,272
[SPEAKER_12]: We will self-police effectively.

2198
02:54:23,312 --> 02:54:25,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we don't, you can revoke that privilege.

2199
02:54:26,202 --> 02:54:40,996
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing is that even during the four hours of usage it gets right now as an unofficial off-leash dog park, without offense, there hasn't been any incidences of bites in that period.

2200
02:54:41,016 --> 02:54:47,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish we had a couple videos to show you, but there's folks who

2201
02:54:48,487 --> 02:54:56,071
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not born in America who, you know, aren't really accustomed to our whole culture of, you know, pets being kind of as prevalent as they are here.

2202
02:54:56,651 --> 02:55:05,076
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a small, I believe she's Indian, adorable girl who regularly is brought over by her father to expose her to pets.

2203
02:55:05,156 --> 02:55:06,696
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they're a citizen of Medford.

2204
02:55:07,177 --> 02:55:12,199
[SPEAKER_12]: The dad is purposely walking her daughter, his daughter, over to this group of people.

2205
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:16,001
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's done very respectfully.

2206
02:55:16,081 --> 02:55:16,982
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a really good, this is,

2207
02:55:17,927 --> 02:55:27,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't underscore enough that this dynamic is the dynamic that you hopefully, I don't know any of you very well, if you're good city councilors, this is the dynamic that you're gonna want in your community.

2208
02:55:27,753 --> 02:55:29,294
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a community that's active.

2209
02:55:29,334 --> 02:55:34,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if you wanna talk about neighborhood watch, this is a neighborhood watch group.

2210
02:55:34,237 --> 02:55:35,818
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a force for good in the neighborhood.

2211
02:55:36,158 --> 02:55:37,159
[SPEAKER_12]: People are getting together.

2212
02:55:37,179 --> 02:55:41,301
[SPEAKER_12]: This group of people that is already going there wouldn't know each other otherwise.

2213
02:55:41,802 --> 02:55:47,245
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing I'll say is I know in Medford there's a lot of strife about gentrification and back and forth.

2214
02:55:47,872 --> 02:55:53,454
[SPEAKER_12]: We understand that there's dynamics of old and new Medford here, and we're not trying to rub it in people's faces.

2215
02:55:53,494 --> 02:56:00,697
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to do this respectfully, and we're trying to just carry on our daily lives in a way here that we hope you don't interfere with.

2216
02:56:01,017 --> 02:56:03,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want to work with you to carry this out effectively.

2217
02:56:04,599 --> 02:56:12,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to see, personally, a pro-vote on this, as opposed to just, frankly, kicking it to another committee and dying a slow death of bureaucracy.

2218
02:56:12,102 --> 02:56:16,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean that respectfully, but I've learned in my time here and a year and a half in Medford

2219
02:56:17,493 --> 02:56:22,979
[SPEAKER_12]: quite frankly, I see a lot of room for improvement in the city, a significant room for improvement in public administration.

2220
02:56:23,399 --> 02:56:26,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to start paying a little more attention a little more carefully because.

2221
02:56:26,819 --> 02:56:33,524
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just very unfortunate that we can't figure out how to kind of thread the needle and run a city a little more efficiently and get things done.

2222
02:56:33,684 --> 02:56:38,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And I get the risk factor, and I'm not trying to belittle that, but this does not need to be overkilled.

2223
02:56:38,847 --> 02:56:40,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we have to do a fence, great.

2224
02:56:40,529 --> 02:56:51,076
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you'll find there is a healthy group of people who want to help make this happen, self-police it, and won't negatively impact safety at this park.

2225
02:56:52,357 --> 02:56:52,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2226
02:56:58,135 --> 02:57:00,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Hike, please state your name and address for the record.

2227
02:57:00,736 --> 02:57:01,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2228
02:57:01,717 --> 02:57:03,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2229
02:57:05,179 --> 02:57:07,800
[SPEAKER_10]: My question in all of this is on discretion.

2230
02:57:08,320 --> 02:57:15,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the laws are in place, and we are a city, a state, and a nation of laws that we must follow.

2231
02:57:16,104 --> 02:57:23,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm worried about, you know, just applying these laws no matter what.

2232
02:57:23,288 --> 02:57:27,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, are we going to hire people now that the animal control officer is here?

2233
02:57:27,926 --> 02:57:32,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, when do they apply the law of dogs being off the leash?

2234
02:57:34,488 --> 02:57:36,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked this for a specific instance.

2235
02:57:36,609 --> 02:57:47,592
[SPEAKER_10]: A few weeks ago, actually earlier in the spring, a woman, a senior citizen who walks her dog in the park near my house, Morrison, the dog's name is Noodle.

2236
02:57:47,953 --> 02:57:51,394
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about a foot and a half long, six inches high.

2237
02:57:51,814 --> 02:57:54,595
[SPEAKER_10]: She left the dog off the leash and she got hit with a $200 ticket.

2238
02:57:56,073 --> 02:58:00,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And she asked the officer, you know, don't you give a warning first?

2239
02:58:00,456 --> 02:58:02,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, yeah, this is the warning, here.

2240
02:58:02,837 --> 02:58:04,398
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a $200 ticket.

2241
02:58:04,919 --> 02:58:08,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we should definitely respect and follow the laws.

2242
02:58:08,941 --> 02:58:20,309
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also think that there are times when, you know, I mean, we hire police and teachers and we elect city councilors to also be, you know, of good judgment.

2243
02:58:21,162 --> 02:58:28,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was a bad judgment call to give this woman a $200 ticket for noodle that you wouldn't even feel if it was sitting on your foot.

2244
02:58:30,208 --> 02:58:39,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think looking at this and talking about offense and everything else, you know, we should just, like the last gentleman spoke about, about discretion and improvement.

2245
02:58:40,034 --> 02:58:44,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think terms of judgment calls is one of the areas we should also look at.

2246
02:58:44,837 --> 02:58:46,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people know their dogs.

2247
02:58:46,378 --> 02:58:47,158
[SPEAKER_10]: They know their city.

2248
02:58:47,518 --> 02:58:49,940
[SPEAKER_10]: They know when the dog should be off the leash and when not.

2249
02:58:50,377 --> 02:58:58,221
[SPEAKER_10]: And every dog owner I've seen across Medford always picks up after their dog and looks out when other dogs are present.

2250
02:58:58,702 --> 02:58:59,782
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are my two cents.

2251
02:58:59,822 --> 02:59:00,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Mr. President.

2252
02:59:02,524 --> 02:59:02,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2253
02:59:06,806 --> 02:59:07,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

2254
02:59:07,326 --> 02:59:09,067
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2255
02:59:09,547 --> 02:59:11,428
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm Linda Julian, 25 Edward Street.

2256
02:59:13,890 --> 02:59:19,773
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess I would like to thank all of you for your consideration and encourage you to vote in favor of this.

2257
02:59:21,656 --> 02:59:24,438
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to echo other people, this is not traditional dog park.

2258
02:59:25,538 --> 02:59:27,179
[SPEAKER_32]: As others have said, it's been going on for a long time.

2259
02:59:27,919 --> 02:59:29,199
[SPEAKER_32]: I knew it before I got a dog.

2260
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:32,341
[SPEAKER_32]: I've visited on a few occasions since I got a dog.

2261
02:59:32,981 --> 02:59:33,701
[SPEAKER_32]: These people are great.

2262
02:59:33,961 --> 02:59:36,042
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't see them very often, but they're awesome.

2263
02:59:36,622 --> 02:59:37,883
[SPEAKER_32]: And they are absolutely correct.

2264
02:59:38,353 --> 02:59:44,835
[SPEAKER_32]: I would say as a semi-outsider that they do self-police, and I've always felt safe there.

2265
02:59:45,275 --> 02:59:46,295
[SPEAKER_32]: I've always felt welcome there.

2266
02:59:46,876 --> 02:59:48,776
[SPEAKER_32]: My daughter loves to play in the playground.

2267
02:59:49,236 --> 02:59:55,078
[SPEAKER_32]: She loves to meet all the dogs at the dog park, the area where the dogs like to play.

2268
02:59:56,178 --> 02:59:57,959
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think this is a threat to the dog park at all.

2269
02:59:58,099 --> 03:00:00,940
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm completely in favor of the proper official dog park.

2270
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:02,320
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope it comes soon.

2271
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:04,321
[SPEAKER_32]: Can't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned.

2272
03:00:06,302 --> 03:00:11,684
[SPEAKER_32]: I think when I heard this was being the works, I wondered how they could possibly get it to work.

2273
03:00:12,104 --> 03:00:15,665
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm so encouraged to know that other cities are doing this successfully.

2274
03:00:15,685 --> 03:00:16,846
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we can learn a lot from them.

2275
03:00:17,646 --> 03:00:23,348
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that Mr. Rumley's writing of this proposal is brilliant.

2276
03:00:24,468 --> 03:00:28,710
[SPEAKER_32]: I think he's addressed so many concerns that I could imagine.

2277
03:00:29,130 --> 03:00:39,475
[SPEAKER_32]: And the fact that it's a pilot program with a limited time period, with the ability for the city to impose additional restrictions on the fly if they are deemed necessary, I think that's great.

2278
03:00:39,575 --> 03:00:44,677
[SPEAKER_32]: I think there's very little risk here to the city or to anybody.

2279
03:00:45,157 --> 03:00:47,699
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a wonderful opportunity to try it out, see how it works.

2280
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:48,759
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be adjusted.

2281
03:00:48,859 --> 03:00:52,361
[SPEAKER_32]: It can be called quits if it's not working.

2282
03:00:56,740 --> 03:00:59,621
[SPEAKER_32]: Other people have spoken more articulately than I have, but I really hope you will consider this.

2283
03:01:00,281 --> 03:01:02,462
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's a great addition to our city.

2284
03:01:02,682 --> 03:01:02,902
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks.

2285
03:01:03,142 --> 03:01:04,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

2286
03:01:06,463 --> 03:01:09,804
[SPEAKER_30]: All right, I can see you guys are falling asleep, so I'll try to talk quickly.

2287
03:01:09,824 --> 03:01:11,404
[SPEAKER_24]: State your name and address for the record.

2288
03:01:11,464 --> 03:01:13,405
[SPEAKER_30]: Sarah Pilcher, 41 Winchester Street.

2289
03:01:14,601 --> 03:01:16,944
[SPEAKER_30]: I am pro for the dog park.

2290
03:01:17,445 --> 03:01:19,808
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd also be for the dog park not having a fence.

2291
03:01:20,729 --> 03:01:22,691
[SPEAKER_30]: If it has to have a fence, then it has to have a fence.

2292
03:01:23,573 --> 03:01:29,460
[SPEAKER_30]: I would like to bring up the area that you said has a hole in it is actually outside of the proposed fenced area.

2293
03:01:29,661 --> 03:01:30,602
[SPEAKER_30]: So that wouldn't be a problem.

2294
03:01:31,282 --> 03:01:34,525
[SPEAKER_30]: Another thing I heard people talk about is kids that are scared to come to the field.

2295
03:01:34,585 --> 03:01:37,607
[SPEAKER_30]: There are lots of kids that come over and say hello all the time to the dogs.

2296
03:01:38,188 --> 03:01:44,253
[SPEAKER_30]: I know more people in this neighborhood who are scared of leash dogs that bark and try to bite them and lunge at them.

2297
03:01:45,093 --> 03:01:46,815
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we're expecting our first child.

2298
03:01:46,855 --> 03:01:48,696
[SPEAKER_30]: We want to raise a child in this community.

2299
03:01:49,257 --> 03:01:53,580
[SPEAKER_30]: And I guess I'd really just like to say how much this would mean to everybody.

2300
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:57,283
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, the dogs are going to continue to be off leash there.

2301
03:01:57,828 --> 03:02:00,875
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think we should try to work together and figure something out.

2302
03:02:02,078 --> 03:02:02,299
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks.

2303
03:02:06,285 --> 03:02:07,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, one more.

2304
03:02:07,726 --> 03:02:08,686
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Courtney Knights.

2305
03:02:09,206 --> 03:02:09,726
[SPEAKER_04]: No relation.

2306
03:02:09,926 --> 03:02:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't asked you, don't.

2307
03:02:11,547 --> 03:02:12,487
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 Morton Ave.

2308
03:02:13,007 --> 03:02:16,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been going to the park for several years, for five years.

2309
03:02:16,889 --> 03:02:18,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a little French bulldog.

2310
03:02:18,169 --> 03:02:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Her name's Coco.

2311
03:02:18,889 --> 03:02:19,449
[SPEAKER_04]: She's my life.

2312
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:29,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I and my fellow neighbors have been using the small area in the back, which we were talking about tonight, as a dog park with no reported issues or

2313
03:02:30,333 --> 03:02:34,095
[SPEAKER_04]: incidents, we all pick up after ourselves.

2314
03:02:34,795 --> 03:02:36,956
[SPEAKER_04]: If my dog's pooping, somebody else is picking it up.

2315
03:02:36,996 --> 03:02:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: That dog's pooping, I'm picking it up.

2316
03:02:38,397 --> 03:02:39,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We take care of each other.

2317
03:02:40,918 --> 03:02:45,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The unofficial small section of the rear has brought fine qualities.

2318
03:02:45,921 --> 03:02:48,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I've met neighbors that I wouldn't normally have befriended.

2319
03:02:48,956 --> 03:02:51,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It has become a pleasant social experience for all of us.

2320
03:02:51,999 --> 03:02:52,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Our dogs love it.

2321
03:02:54,801 --> 03:03:04,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a fan of the fence because I do feel that they do feel like they're closed in when they have a fence, but if that's what it takes, then by all means, give us the fence.

2322
03:03:04,749 --> 03:03:12,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope you guys would take this time to really consider it and not push it on to somebody else to make the decision for us.

2323
03:03:12,876 --> 03:03:13,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, have a good night.

2324
03:03:18,228 --> 03:03:23,310
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a motion on the floor that this matter be sent to the Parks Commission.

2325
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:28,492
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

2326
03:03:29,333 --> 03:03:29,753
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry?

2327
03:03:32,554 --> 03:03:33,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Marks was first in queue.

2328
03:03:33,895 --> 03:03:34,455
[SPEAKER_24]: You're all set?

2329
03:03:36,155 --> 03:03:38,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Vice President Legault-Kern.

2330
03:03:39,277 --> 03:03:39,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2331
03:03:40,553 --> 03:03:45,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm President De La Russo, and I appreciate everybody coming and speaking, whether you're for or against it.

2332
03:03:45,296 --> 03:03:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see what the community wants.

2333
03:03:47,517 --> 03:03:51,639
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, not everybody's in unison, so that makes it tougher for us.

2334
03:03:51,759 --> 03:03:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is something that I would definitely want to look into further and explore.

2335
03:03:58,002 --> 03:04:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had calls also from the car park area where people are unleashing their dogs, and there are good, responsible dog owners that want a space up in that area, too.

2336
03:04:10,597 --> 03:04:14,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see this definitely possibly expanding if we can do it the right way.

2337
03:04:16,098 --> 03:04:19,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the concerns I would have is I would definitely want to see a fence.

2338
03:04:19,599 --> 03:04:26,200
[SPEAKER_05]: As a personal injury attorney, I have seen dog bite cases myself, as City Solicitor has mentioned.

2339
03:04:26,541 --> 03:04:30,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the fence, although I understand the argument, is necessary.

2340
03:04:30,441 --> 03:04:36,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that we've had, I think, five or six direct abutters.

2341
03:04:38,576 --> 03:04:42,038
[SPEAKER_05]: two or three are in favor and two and three are opposed.

2342
03:04:42,218 --> 03:04:58,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's extremely important, I think, for transparency reasons to have notified all, you know, before we actually take a specific vote, I think we should have to notify everybody that is a direct abutter and just see if there are any other people that are for or against it.

2343
03:04:59,986 --> 03:05:02,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to look into the lighting and the St.

2344
03:05:02,107 --> 03:05:03,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Clements school issue.

2345
03:05:04,294 --> 03:05:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: and we need to know what the park board would do.

2346
03:05:06,835 --> 03:05:10,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe within the next month, we can get some of those answers.

2347
03:05:10,896 --> 03:05:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think probably a good thing to do is to start this in September, even if we have to push the pilot program, possibly another month to September to February, maybe a good time to do that would be when the park is less full with children, just to get it off the ground, whether that be September, October until January, February.

2348
03:05:31,854 --> 03:05:36,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that we do need to create more than just one official dog park in the city.

2349
03:05:37,015 --> 03:05:41,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this quite possibly could be the way to do it.

2350
03:05:41,856 --> 03:05:56,398
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to do it the right way and make sure all our questions are answered and cross all the T's and dot all the I's and make sure we inform the neighborhood in full what's going on and make sure everybody is aware.

2351
03:05:56,478 --> 03:05:59,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Because from what I understand, not many people knew about this ordinance

2352
03:06:00,383 --> 03:06:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a specific interest for or against it, and I think that's important.

2353
03:06:04,385 --> 03:06:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Notification, we discussed it at our last meeting, notifying people with regards to hearings before the Board of Appeals.

2354
03:06:13,490 --> 03:06:19,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just extremely important to make sure that the community knows what's going on and can have a say, whether that's for or against.

2355
03:06:20,093 --> 03:06:22,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are just my opinions, and I'm glad I got to hear.

2356
03:06:23,375 --> 03:06:28,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spoken to people about this before tonight, for and against, and I'm glad I got to hear more comments

2357
03:06:29,758 --> 03:06:30,358
[SPEAKER_05]: from the public.

2358
03:06:32,219 --> 03:06:33,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

2359
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:35,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Cavanagh.

2360
03:06:35,580 --> 03:06:36,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2361
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:38,161
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want people to think that we're fluffing this off.

2362
03:06:38,781 --> 03:06:39,882
[SPEAKER_19]: We were given this on Friday.

2363
03:06:40,522 --> 03:06:42,402
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, Councilor Malauulu was right.

2364
03:06:42,983 --> 03:06:44,783
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to do it, you do it correctly.

2365
03:06:44,803 --> 03:06:46,104
[SPEAKER_19]: You make sure you have all the answers.

2366
03:06:46,804 --> 03:06:50,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it's from Friday afternoon, we all work.

2367
03:06:50,845 --> 03:06:56,087
[SPEAKER_19]: And to today, it was only a few days that we've had to digest changing an ordinance for the whole city of Medford.

2368
03:06:56,667 --> 03:06:58,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So please don't think that we're to fluff off.

2369
03:06:58,717 --> 03:07:05,099
[SPEAKER_19]: But I say there are questions that need to be answered and ramifications that we need to answer.

2370
03:07:05,539 --> 03:07:16,622
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would like to amend my motion that the abutters be notified of the park meeting for the date that they have it so they are aware of it.

2371
03:07:17,062 --> 03:07:18,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Because again, I've spoken to the same people.

2372
03:07:19,203 --> 03:07:21,043
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some in favor, there are some that aren't.

2373
03:07:21,103 --> 03:07:24,224
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd say I'm a dog owner myself and I understand the needs.

2374
03:07:24,264 --> 03:07:26,925
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, please don't assume that this isn't being fluffed off.

2375
03:07:28,572 --> 03:07:37,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Four days to adopt an ordinance is not really enough time for us to really do our job and to represent the people of the community correctly.

2376
03:07:37,719 --> 03:07:40,681
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you understand that.

2377
03:07:41,542 --> 03:07:42,683
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not a fluff off.

2378
03:07:43,904 --> 03:07:44,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2379
03:07:45,105 --> 03:07:57,875
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor Caviello that the matter be sent to the Park Commission as amended, that there be a proper notification of all bodies to the proposed areas.

2380
03:07:59,712 --> 03:08:02,394
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

2381
03:08:03,255 --> 03:08:04,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2382
03:08:05,076 --> 03:08:09,520
[SPEAKER_22]: And I certainly concur with both Councilor Longo and Councilor Caviello.

2383
03:08:09,560 --> 03:08:10,661
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this needs to be looked at.

2384
03:08:10,681 --> 03:08:13,984
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that we can reach a compromise or a balance.

2385
03:08:15,445 --> 03:08:17,947
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would certainly support sending the matter to the Parks Board.

2386
03:08:18,567 --> 03:08:23,451
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I'd like to have a joint public hearing with the Council and the Parks Board on the topic.

2387
03:08:24,472 --> 03:08:29,096
[SPEAKER_22]: If, in fact, there are two ordinances that need to be changed and we change one and they don't, then it's moved.

2388
03:08:29,578 --> 03:08:31,879
[SPEAKER_22]: If we don't change it, they can't move forward and change theirs.

2389
03:08:31,939 --> 03:08:32,299
[SPEAKER_22]: It is moved.

2390
03:08:32,379 --> 03:08:38,341
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that the best course would be to put everybody in a room together, sit down and have a joint public hearing where people can come up and express their concerns.

2391
03:08:38,361 --> 03:08:38,761
[SPEAKER_22]: The President.

2392
03:08:38,781 --> 03:08:39,122
[SPEAKER_22]: Public meeting?

2393
03:08:39,142 --> 03:08:39,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Zients.

2394
03:08:39,342 --> 03:08:45,164
[SPEAKER_22]: A public meeting or a public hearing where people can express their opposition or support of the initiative and why.

2395
03:08:45,584 --> 03:08:55,988
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we can sit down and, you know, we can deliberate as our individual bodies as to what our concerns are and then make some recommendations back and forth and maybe come up with a medium, a happy ground.

2396
03:08:57,641 --> 03:09:03,446
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be a public meeting upon which positive, negative, or other comments are received.

2397
03:09:03,767 --> 03:09:12,915
[SPEAKER_15]: But you have to be careful not to use the word hearing if it's not a hearing under a regulation, ordinance, or statute, because that's a different kettle of fish entirely.

2398
03:09:13,336 --> 03:09:19,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be a meeting, a joint meeting of two governmental bodies for a particular purpose, which is noticed under the open meeting law.

2399
03:09:23,263 --> 03:09:30,525
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's what I would like to propose, Mr. President, by way of an amendment to the councilor's referral to the Parks Commission.

2400
03:09:30,565 --> 03:09:32,225
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a great idea to send it to the Parks Board.

2401
03:09:32,905 --> 03:09:35,506
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly, that's something that I was going to vote in favor of.

2402
03:09:35,546 --> 03:09:40,607
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think that we do have a lot of questions and a lot of concerns, and we want to bring the neighbors and the butters in.

2403
03:09:41,167 --> 03:09:42,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's do it all together and all at once.

2404
03:09:44,188 --> 03:09:47,489
[SPEAKER_24]: As amended by Councilor Knight, chair recognizes Councilor Maxx.

2405
03:09:48,469 --> 03:09:49,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2406
03:09:49,650 --> 03:09:51,050
[SPEAKER_17]: And not to belabor the point,

2407
03:09:51,876 --> 03:10:03,299
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, section six dash 54, uh, which in my opinion is probably one of the most important parts of this ordinance is the review by the department heads, uh, does not have a timeframe.

2408
03:10:03,959 --> 03:10:13,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So it says, uh, all these particular departments show me to discuss, uh, the phases of the off leash dog pilot program, uh, talk about something that could last forever.

2409
03:10:14,942 --> 03:10:19,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, you know, we, we would need to put a timeframe if, if the administration serious about this,

2410
03:10:20,485 --> 03:10:25,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I would say that they should come back with a recommendation by a certain date and not leave it open ended.

2411
03:10:26,329 --> 03:10:31,992
[SPEAKER_17]: The second point I have is, uh, you know, I'm probably even more confused now than it was when this first started.

2412
03:10:33,033 --> 03:10:40,317
[SPEAKER_17]: I was under the impression this was a pilot program because we were introducing something that's never happened in the city before.

2413
03:10:40,878 --> 03:10:45,761
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was allowing dogs to run off leash without being fenced in.

2414
03:10:47,101 --> 03:10:49,423
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is a major change in this community.

2415
03:10:50,251 --> 03:11:02,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'm hearing the proposal had, from the start, fencing, so the area would be fenced in, which in my opinion, whether you wanna call it a dog park or not, is a dog park.

2416
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:08,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why we need a program to implement a dog park.

2417
03:11:08,943 --> 03:11:10,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do we need a pilot program?

2418
03:11:11,045 --> 03:11:17,409
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the chief, what is the dog officer gonna tell me that I already don't know about a dog park?

2419
03:11:18,388 --> 03:11:20,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I know a dog park will be successful.

2420
03:11:21,571 --> 03:11:23,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I know this will work in our community.

2421
03:11:23,392 --> 03:11:24,313
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's a need.

2422
03:11:25,253 --> 03:11:31,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Now the off-leash rail fencing, I agree that that may deserve a warrant, a larger discussion.

2423
03:11:32,439 --> 03:11:39,404
[SPEAKER_17]: But to me, in my opinion, I'd rather see come forward with a proposal and say, these have to due diligence.

2424
03:11:39,745 --> 03:11:44,128
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the five locations strategically placed around the city

2425
03:11:44,515 --> 03:11:50,438
[SPEAKER_17]: that we're going to have a pop-up dog park, we're going to put fencing up, and we're going to provide these conditions, and we're going to provide this.

2426
03:11:50,818 --> 03:11:54,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And this way, it'll be located in every section of the community.

2427
03:11:55,260 --> 03:11:57,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are we starting off with a pilot program?

2428
03:11:59,462 --> 03:12:00,403
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't make any sense.

2429
03:12:01,043 --> 03:12:04,305
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's a fenced-in area, why are we starting off with a pilot program?

2430
03:12:06,146 --> 03:12:08,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, I'm more confused now than I was before.

2431
03:12:08,867 --> 03:12:10,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe I can help you with your confusion.

2432
03:12:11,208 --> 03:12:15,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there are two ordinances that prohibit dogs being unleashed in the city of Medford.

2433
03:12:15,851 --> 03:12:16,552
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

2434
03:12:16,612 --> 03:12:18,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

2435
03:12:18,193 --> 03:12:18,613
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no.

2436
03:12:18,673 --> 03:12:20,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's address the questions that you've raised.

2437
03:12:20,835 --> 03:12:35,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, in order to do this and to have it compatible with our regulatory scheme, which we call ordinances, what we would be doing for a particular period of time, whenever that would begin, is to waive that requirement in this area.

2438
03:12:35,506 --> 03:12:37,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why a pilot program would be

2439
03:12:38,035 --> 03:12:39,236
[SPEAKER_15]: prudent in this instance.

2440
03:12:39,776 --> 03:12:40,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's your opinion.

2441
03:12:40,796 --> 03:12:42,977
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's also the Lord's common sense.

2442
03:12:43,357 --> 03:12:44,697
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not common sense.

2443
03:12:44,717 --> 03:12:45,478
[SPEAKER_15]: It's your opinion.

2444
03:12:45,498 --> 03:12:46,358
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not an opinion.

2445
03:12:46,438 --> 03:12:47,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Opinion is like supposition.

2446
03:12:48,198 --> 03:12:56,521
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm telling you is that this is necessary in order to get around the prohibitions which are presently in our ordinance in two places.

2447
03:12:56,541 --> 03:13:00,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we heard from residents that when they met with the mayor said absolutely they don't want fencing at all.

2448
03:13:01,503 --> 03:13:07,425
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was the mayor's opinion to put fencing around this and that's her prerogative with the legislative body.

2449
03:13:07,905 --> 03:13:12,606
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see a need for a pilot program in this circumstance.

2450
03:13:13,007 --> 03:13:14,007
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see a need for it.

2451
03:13:14,287 --> 03:13:16,067
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not creating the wheel here.

2452
03:13:16,768 --> 03:13:20,749
[SPEAKER_17]: We know what a dog pile, they're in every community, you heard around the, they're in every community.

2453
03:13:21,009 --> 03:13:23,990
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't something new that the city of Meffitt just designed.

2454
03:13:24,370 --> 03:13:27,171
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't need to sit back and review it for four months.

2455
03:13:27,511 --> 03:13:28,291
[SPEAKER_17]: That's ridiculous.

2456
03:13:28,531 --> 03:13:29,832
[SPEAKER_17]: That's your opinion.

2457
03:13:29,892 --> 03:13:31,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and I was elected to give my opinion.

2458
03:13:32,152 --> 03:13:33,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, and I was appointed to give mine.

2459
03:13:34,773 --> 03:13:35,973
[SPEAKER_17]: I was elected to give my opinion.

2460
03:13:36,073 --> 03:13:37,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Solicitors give opinions.

2461
03:13:37,534 --> 03:13:40,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Solicitor, you wrote it, we don't need you to back it now.

2462
03:13:40,554 --> 03:13:42,075
[SPEAKER_17]: You wrote it, we don't need you to back it.

2463
03:13:42,435 --> 03:13:46,456
[SPEAKER_17]: If the mayor wanted to back it, she'd find her way up here as the newly elected mayor of the city.

2464
03:13:46,776 --> 03:13:49,857
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor is represented through her department heads here tonight.

2465
03:13:50,077 --> 03:13:56,158
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that you're up here, but I'm not here to debate an ordinance with you, because I don't know when you were elected.

2466
03:13:56,487 --> 03:13:57,589
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as I'm concerned, you are elected.

2467
03:13:57,629 --> 03:13:58,270
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I was appointed.

2468
03:13:58,450 --> 03:13:58,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, right.

2469
03:13:58,770 --> 03:13:58,750
1984.

2470
03:13:58,930 --> 03:14:00,493
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not here to debate this with you.

2471
03:14:00,853 --> 03:14:01,214
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the date.

2472
03:14:01,234 --> 03:14:11,308
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm giving my opinion as elected official why I don't think a pilot program is necessary, especially a pilot program that talks about a fenced-in area, in my opinion, which is a dog park.

2473
03:14:12,335 --> 03:14:14,776
[SPEAKER_17]: which still would require relief from ordinances.

2474
03:14:15,476 --> 03:14:16,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And we know that.

2475
03:14:16,697 --> 03:14:18,217
[SPEAKER_17]: You keep on stating the obvious.

2476
03:14:18,537 --> 03:14:19,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand that.

2477
03:14:19,338 --> 03:14:23,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes stating the obvious is necessary because it doesn't get through.

2478
03:14:24,100 --> 03:14:25,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, thank you very much.

2479
03:14:25,040 --> 03:14:28,601
[SPEAKER_17]: We know you're here to do the mayor's bidding, and I think you're all done right now.

2480
03:14:29,022 --> 03:14:31,262
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not here to discuss this with you.

2481
03:14:31,282 --> 03:14:32,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

2482
03:14:32,963 --> 03:14:33,763
[SPEAKER_15]: All evidence to the contrary.

2483
03:14:33,783 --> 03:14:35,324
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not here to discuss this with you.

2484
03:14:35,804 --> 03:14:36,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2485
03:14:36,384 --> 03:14:37,345
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm giving my opinion.

2486
03:14:38,047 --> 03:14:41,268
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't need you to come up and fight me on my own opinion.

2487
03:14:41,428 --> 03:14:41,989
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not fighting you.

2488
03:14:42,029 --> 03:14:42,949
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm giving you facts.

2489
03:14:43,229 --> 03:14:43,709
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

2490
03:14:43,729 --> 03:14:46,991
[SPEAKER_17]: You gave me the facts, and I realize which sections have to be amended.

2491
03:14:47,351 --> 03:14:50,732
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'm saying is, we don't have to do this by way of a pilot program.

2492
03:14:51,493 --> 03:14:52,213
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm saying.

2493
03:14:52,593 --> 03:14:53,413
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to do this.

2494
03:14:53,674 --> 03:14:55,014
[SPEAKER_17]: And you've heard from residents here.

2495
03:14:55,274 --> 03:14:57,895
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want to belabor this any longer than it has to be.

2496
03:14:58,195 --> 03:15:02,978
[SPEAKER_17]: And creating a pilot program for four months, to me, is skirting the issue.

2497
03:15:03,918 --> 03:15:04,798
[SPEAKER_17]: It's skirting the issue.

2498
03:15:09,013 --> 03:15:23,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm prepared tonight if we want to send a response to the park department to have them look at other parks in the community and not just make it this four month, uh, uh, pilot program.

2499
03:15:23,559 --> 03:15:27,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, in my opinion, that doesn't have a timeframe for review.

2500
03:15:27,841 --> 03:15:38,485
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, as many of the conditions are in here, uh, although they, they may seem warranted, uh, a suspect in nature, because at any time the dog officer could come up and say,

2501
03:15:38,912 --> 03:15:41,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Geez, your dog barked, in my opinion, excessively.

2502
03:15:41,654 --> 03:15:42,975
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not welcome back here anymore.

2503
03:15:43,535 --> 03:15:45,856
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you, as a dog owner, say, oh my God, what do you mean?

2504
03:15:45,896 --> 03:15:46,577
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my life.

2505
03:15:46,997 --> 03:15:49,498
[SPEAKER_17]: What am I?

2506
03:15:49,879 --> 03:15:51,780
[SPEAKER_17]: This needs to be thought out in a better way.

2507
03:15:52,360 --> 03:15:53,061
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I'm saying.

2508
03:15:53,661 --> 03:15:59,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, creating a four-month temporary park in this community

2509
03:16:00,610 --> 03:16:06,314
[SPEAKER_17]: that doesn't call for any type of review or timeframe for a review is not the way to go in this.

2510
03:16:06,654 --> 03:16:06,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2511
03:16:07,514 --> 03:16:11,917
[SPEAKER_24]: But then what do you propose to us in relation to the motion that's already on?

2512
03:16:11,937 --> 03:16:17,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think we have to put something together because the mayor had months and months to propose this.

2513
03:16:18,241 --> 03:16:29,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have to put a thoughtful proposal out that includes the entire city and not just one little section for four months and then say, Oh, we've arrived at what, how we think we're going to go.

2514
03:16:30,986 --> 03:16:49,063
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if the mayor really wanted to put someone forward, there's been a pause committee created for two years of activists in this community, and no one's putting down these other residents from Tufts area, and not one of the activists that put together this pause committee and have done yeoman's work in finding private funding

2515
03:16:49,362 --> 03:16:53,005
[SPEAKER_17]: wherever contracted, contacted or said, Hey, would you like to participate?

2516
03:16:53,185 --> 03:16:54,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any thoughts?

2517
03:16:54,146 --> 03:16:55,848
[SPEAKER_17]: We know you worked on this for two years.

2518
03:16:56,148 --> 03:16:56,969
[SPEAKER_17]: What are your thoughts?

2519
03:16:57,549 --> 03:17:01,132
[SPEAKER_17]: So this was a quick knee jerk reaction to please some residents.

2520
03:17:01,753 --> 03:17:05,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, you know, and in my opinion, this, this is not the way to go.

2521
03:17:05,196 --> 03:17:06,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think you've seen it from the council.

2522
03:17:06,817 --> 03:17:07,818
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not the way to go.

2523
03:17:08,539 --> 03:17:09,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go back to the mayor.

2524
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:11,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get your 90 group strong.

2525
03:17:12,419 --> 03:17:17,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's go wait in the mayor's door and say, Madam Mayor, we want something that makes sense in this community.

2526
03:17:18,064 --> 03:17:20,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Because ultimately we're going to need funding from the mayor.

2527
03:17:20,666 --> 03:17:21,867
[SPEAKER_17]: We can approve everything we want.

2528
03:17:22,067 --> 03:17:24,869
[SPEAKER_17]: The funding comes from initiated by the mayor's office.

2529
03:17:25,310 --> 03:17:34,797
[SPEAKER_17]: So whatever it might take to create these parks throughout the city, even if it's just fencing or whatever it might be, some lighting, it's going to have to be an appropriation by the mayor's office.

2530
03:17:35,238 --> 03:17:40,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd rather go with the paper in hand and say, we want five parks after our work and our due diligence.

2531
03:17:40,844 --> 03:17:48,308
[SPEAKER_17]: throughout the community, we want them fenced in, this is the way we want it, and this is the way it's going to work, rather than do a four-month approach.

2532
03:17:48,588 --> 03:17:51,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you're going to be back here in January saying, where are we?

2533
03:17:51,070 --> 03:17:53,891
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to be back here in February saying, where are we?

2534
03:17:53,951 --> 03:17:55,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you what's going to happen.

2535
03:17:57,413 --> 03:17:58,274
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to happen.

2536
03:17:58,614 --> 03:18:03,137
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to be back, and all of a sudden, January 1st, you can't bring your dog there, because they're going to start enforcing it.

2537
03:18:03,177 --> 03:18:08,360
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're going to say, well, these committees are getting together, and they're going to discuss this, and we'll see what's happening.

2538
03:18:08,380 --> 03:18:09,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it now.

2539
03:18:09,805 --> 03:18:10,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it now.

2540
03:18:11,186 --> 03:18:12,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get this out of the way.

2541
03:18:12,266 --> 03:18:14,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I think that's what we need to do then.

2542
03:18:15,008 --> 03:18:19,210
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it calls for — I know in the summer we don't — we only meet once in July and once in August.

2543
03:18:19,590 --> 03:18:22,652
[SPEAKER_17]: If it calls for an emergency meeting, I think this is an important issue.

2544
03:18:23,152 --> 03:18:37,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should get together, the Committee of the Whole meeting, invite the Park Commission, and discuss the potential park sites, and discuss a full-fledged dog park program throughout our community.

2545
03:18:37,879 --> 03:18:39,140
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to take baby steps.

2546
03:18:40,345 --> 03:18:42,867
[SPEAKER_17]: All you have to do is look at Brookline and look at these other communities.

2547
03:18:43,147 --> 03:18:49,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Somerville as council Scott Kelly mentioned that are doing it right now and as successful doing it, we don't need a pilot program.

2548
03:18:49,612 --> 03:18:50,233
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we create?

2549
03:18:50,253 --> 03:18:51,894
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a dog park.

2550
03:18:53,976 --> 03:18:55,197
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be my recommendation.

2551
03:18:55,217 --> 03:18:56,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Mr. Mr. President.

2552
03:18:58,119 --> 03:18:58,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2553
03:19:03,963 --> 03:19:08,487
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of council Caviello as amended by council Caviello and councilor night,

2554
03:19:09,045 --> 03:19:11,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

2555
03:19:11,646 --> 03:19:12,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a quick question.

2556
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:19,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of that meeting just wanted to see, through the park board, what permits would be affected in the children's programs.

2557
03:19:20,451 --> 03:19:21,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously it doesn't look, and St.

2558
03:19:21,931 --> 03:19:37,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Clement's, it doesn't look like the way that it's set up, it really is going to affect any program, but we want to see, I know that last year's talk was when I met with U Soccer, they were thinking of using that area as a rotating system for their U12, U10 soccer.

2559
03:19:38,610 --> 03:19:46,236
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that's not going to be the case anymore, we, we need to make sure that they're informed and, um, and, and this is vetted.

2560
03:19:46,256 --> 03:19:48,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is, this is the biggest, the bigger issue.

2561
03:19:49,179 --> 03:19:56,464
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anybody here doesn't want to see, uh, growth and movement to what other communities are having.

2562
03:19:56,524 --> 03:20:04,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that that's the question I think, or the question that the community policing of the Tufts organization

2563
03:20:05,350 --> 03:20:12,676
[SPEAKER_14]: is an issue, but when you talk about a pilot program, which is what it's called right now, you're opening it up for everybody.

2564
03:20:13,356 --> 03:20:24,304
[SPEAKER_14]: And it might not be, you know, when you open up that type of area, you're gonna have people that might not want the same, or have the same philosophy or opinion that you have already established there.

2565
03:20:25,025 --> 03:20:31,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are issues that I like to see the idea of moving it in different parts of the neighborhoods and different areas.

2566
03:20:31,650 --> 03:20:34,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see that being an issue, but I do think that

2567
03:20:35,117 --> 03:20:38,420
[SPEAKER_14]: doing it, you know, through the proper steps.

2568
03:20:38,640 --> 03:20:39,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the most important.

2569
03:20:40,502 --> 03:20:50,511
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, yeah, making sure, I think there's going to be a key mending it that the tax department updates us with whose permit, who, what, what affected permits.

2570
03:20:51,372 --> 03:21:00,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no, not just, I think moving forward too, because I, you know, ultimately I think that this program, I have no doubt that it'll be successful.

2571
03:21:01,416 --> 03:21:07,820
[SPEAKER_14]: if it's, if it moved through that, what effect will we have throughout the total year?

2572
03:21:07,840 --> 03:21:12,483
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, even if it's not looked at as a pilot program, it's implemented as a full program.

2573
03:21:12,843 --> 03:21:17,667
[SPEAKER_14]: How would it affect our programming for our children year round?

2574
03:21:17,747 --> 03:21:18,507
[SPEAKER_24]: So in the parks.

2575
03:21:18,687 --> 03:21:19,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2576
03:21:19,608 --> 03:21:19,988
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2577
03:21:20,569 --> 03:21:28,834
[SPEAKER_24]: So on motion of council Caviello as amended by council Caviello, councilor Knight and councilor Scott Pelly chair recognizes council marks.

2578
03:21:29,924 --> 03:21:33,467
[SPEAKER_17]: if we're going to send this to the park commission, I agree with a joint meeting.

2579
03:21:33,507 --> 03:21:35,528
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a great suggestion having a joint meeting.

2580
03:21:35,548 --> 03:21:38,010
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was councilor night that brought that up.

2581
03:21:38,771 --> 03:21:47,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but why not ask the experts, the park commission, what are the parks out of the 22 or 23 parks we have throughout this entire city?

2582
03:21:47,857 --> 03:21:51,479
[SPEAKER_17]: What are the parks baby suitable for a pop up dog park?

2583
03:21:52,140 --> 03:21:53,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not ask that question?

2584
03:21:53,801 --> 03:21:58,404
[SPEAKER_17]: And they may come back and say, we can cover each north method, south method, west method, the hillside,

2585
03:21:58,858 --> 03:22:05,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Salt, you know, we can, Haines Square, we can cover each section of the city by one or two parks in some of the neighborhoods.

2586
03:22:06,519 --> 03:22:22,822
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, that'll go a long way to making a recommendation back to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, I know you're looking at a four month pilot program and putting a fence at Tufts Park, but we're looking at possibly doing this at five other parks throughout the community.

2587
03:22:23,283 --> 03:22:25,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And if she wants to call a pilot program, fine.

2588
03:22:26,271 --> 03:22:28,052
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's expanded.

2589
03:22:28,352 --> 03:22:30,493
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no reason why this shouldn't be expanded.

2590
03:22:30,754 --> 03:22:36,117
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no reason why we have to take a look back and say, you know, let's see how it goes.

2591
03:22:36,617 --> 03:22:37,377
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a dog park.

2592
03:22:38,098 --> 03:22:38,938
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all it is.

2593
03:22:40,199 --> 03:22:41,040
[SPEAKER_17]: And now it's fenced in.

2594
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:42,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Before, it wasn't fenced in.

2595
03:22:42,320 --> 03:22:46,383
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, that's somewhat more controversial, and I appreciate the residents that don't want it.

2596
03:22:46,423 --> 03:22:47,984
[SPEAKER_17]: I can see that claim.

2597
03:22:48,024 --> 03:22:50,945
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's a far easier sell having a fenced-in area.

2598
03:22:51,526 --> 03:22:55,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll be done in a minute, Mr. President.

2599
03:22:57,541 --> 03:23:01,343
[SPEAKER_17]: it's, it's, it's a far easier sell to have a fenced in area.

2600
03:23:01,823 --> 03:23:05,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And also to say, that's not just do it for four months in one area.

2601
03:23:05,204 --> 03:23:06,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it throughout the city.

2602
03:23:07,165 --> 03:23:09,786
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be my recommendation.

2603
03:23:10,146 --> 03:23:13,127
[SPEAKER_17]: The joint meeting, I don't know if councilor Knight's still off of that.

2604
03:23:13,768 --> 03:23:15,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that part of the, that's part of it.

2605
03:23:16,269 --> 03:23:24,792
[SPEAKER_17]: And that the park commission come up with alternate sites so that each and every section of the neighborhood is covered with the dog park.

2606
03:23:25,947 --> 03:23:27,708
[SPEAKER_17]: and have them make recommendations to us.

2607
03:23:29,369 --> 03:23:32,131
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not going to happen overnight, but we can move forward on this.

2608
03:23:33,792 --> 03:23:34,972
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been in the city a year and a half.

2609
03:23:35,032 --> 03:23:39,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me tell you, things don't happen overnight in this city.

2610
03:23:39,175 --> 03:23:39,895
[SPEAKER_17]: You figure that out.

2611
03:23:39,955 --> 03:23:46,780
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh, in a pilot program, a pilot program, you might as well just write it off on the motion of council.

2612
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:50,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Caviello has amended all those in favor roll call vote, Mr. President.

2613
03:23:54,867 --> 03:23:55,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make it quick.

2614
03:23:55,688 --> 03:24:06,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if we could, uh, also just amend the resolution to just get a report back from, uh, Mike Nestor with regard to parks and park maintenance and just to see what the impact will be as far as, uh, his concerns.

2615
03:24:06,598 --> 03:24:10,081
[SPEAKER_24]: As amended by council Falco, all those in favor.

2616
03:24:13,925 --> 03:24:20,551
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to put the dog officer on the spot, but, uh, in looking through some of the city ordinances,

2617
03:24:21,102 --> 03:24:29,628
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a section in here that requires the dog officer to provide quarterly reports, October, 1st, January, April, and July.

2618
03:24:29,648 --> 03:24:31,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Has that ever been done?

2619
03:24:35,212 --> 03:24:42,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a section in here of our ordinances, 6-42, quarterly reports by dog officer.

2620
03:24:43,378 --> 03:24:49,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's section A and B. And the section B also states that the dog officer shall meet with the city clerk

2621
03:24:50,370 --> 03:24:53,813
[SPEAKER_17]: to get a census on how many dogs there are in the community.

2622
03:24:54,293 --> 03:24:58,317
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure how you would do that, but there's also a requirement under city ordinance.

2623
03:24:59,217 --> 03:25:08,385
[SPEAKER_17]: And section eight states that you should provide a quality report on the number of complaints, number of dog bites in the community.

2624
03:25:09,626 --> 03:25:12,448
[SPEAKER_17]: So you may want to take, take a peek at that too.

2625
03:25:12,488 --> 03:25:13,249
[SPEAKER_17]: That may be helpful.

2626
03:25:16,431 --> 03:25:17,232
[SPEAKER_17]: It's done monthly now.

2627
03:25:18,033 --> 03:25:19,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So you are, so you are doing reporting.

2628
03:25:23,036 --> 03:25:23,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2629
03:25:24,156 --> 03:25:25,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And what type of reports?

2630
03:25:32,599 --> 03:25:32,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2631
03:25:33,060 --> 03:25:33,760
[SPEAKER_24]: So, so, okay.

2659
03:26:17,012 --> 03:26:20,453
[SPEAKER_24]: Honorable members of the Metro City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke,

2660
03:26:21,016 --> 03:26:27,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Amendment to Chapter 14 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Mobile Food Truck Ordinance.

2661
03:26:27,938 --> 03:26:44,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President De La Ruzo and honorable members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following amendment to Chapter 14 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Mobile Food Truck Ordinance.

2662
03:26:44,861 --> 03:26:48,482
[SPEAKER_24]: This amendment will allow the City to license food trucks in the City of Medford

2663
03:26:48,897 --> 03:26:54,100
[SPEAKER_24]: with appropriate safeguards for public safety, neighborhoods, and also existing businesses.

2664
03:26:54,940 --> 03:27:05,906
[SPEAKER_24]: An ordinance of this nature is overdue as various public gatherings, community and charitable events become more commonplace and varied in our city.

2665
03:27:06,506 --> 03:27:17,372
[SPEAKER_24]: Given that this council may want to have the comfort of additional time to review this amendment and to offer possible changes or additions, this paper may possibly be referred

2666
03:27:17,790 --> 03:27:20,871
[SPEAKER_24]: to a council subcommittee or committee of the whole meeting.

2667
03:27:21,711 --> 03:27:37,115
[SPEAKER_24]: If this occurs, it is my recommendation then to the council that the pilot program that has been permitted mobile food trucks to be at the farmer's market be extended to the following upcoming events while this ordinance is being considered.

2668
03:27:37,615 --> 03:27:47,617
[SPEAKER_24]: The events are Hoops of Hope, August 20th, Mystic River Celebration, September 24th, Harvest Your Energy Festival,

[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your consideration.

2671
03:28:01,503 --> 03:28:06,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

2672
03:28:09,508 --> 03:28:12,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Do any of the councillors want me to read the entire ordinance?

2673
03:28:12,710 --> 03:28:13,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Read the reading, Mr. President.

2674
03:28:13,310 --> 03:28:14,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Read the reading.

2675
03:28:18,255 --> 03:28:19,996
[SPEAKER_24]: On that motion, Mr. Solicitor.

2676
03:28:22,818 --> 03:28:23,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be very brief.

2677
03:28:26,100 --> 03:28:31,504
[SPEAKER_15]: This ordinance is one which has been talked about in various incarnations over the course of the last four or five years.

2678
03:28:32,345 --> 03:28:41,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Food trucks you may see at the farmer's market when the farmer's market days are in back of city hall because that was an outgrowth of city council pilot program a few years back.

2679
03:28:42,472 --> 03:28:45,254
[SPEAKER_15]: This particular ordinance is not a pilot ordinance.

2680
03:28:45,334 --> 03:28:45,714
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a,

2681
03:28:46,184 --> 03:28:52,970
[SPEAKER_15]: an ordinance which would deal with mobile food trucks in the city of Medford in order to license, inspect them, et cetera.

2682
03:28:53,871 --> 03:29:04,921
[SPEAKER_15]: There is great discretion which is given here to the Director of the Board of Health in examining and making sure a prospective licensee for a food truck license is appropriate.

2683
03:29:05,802 --> 03:29:08,124
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll just go through the ordinance quickly.

2684
03:29:10,708 --> 03:29:24,245
[SPEAKER_15]: 14-495 the purpose it's to regulate food trucks and then there's the definitional section under 496 which after going through the board and the director of the Board of Health talks about the food vendor license and

[SPEAKER_15]: a Mobile Food Vendor, a Mobile Food Vendor License, a One Day Mobile Food Vendor License, Mobile Food Vendor Licensee, which is the holder, and a Special Event Mobile Food Vendor License, which would be a license given for special events.

2686
03:29:40,434 --> 03:29:51,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Then there is the 497 section, which deals with the application, and the applications are applied, the applications are submitted to the Director of the Board of Health.

2687
03:29:52,587 --> 03:30:02,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, permit fees would be set for a mobile food vehicle by the Board of Health under Chapter 40, Section 22F.

2688
03:30:02,851 --> 03:30:04,872
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there are application requirements.

2689
03:30:05,192 --> 03:30:06,413
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll skip through them quickly.

2690
03:30:06,453 --> 03:30:07,973
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're under 499.

2691
03:30:08,693 --> 03:30:20,018
[SPEAKER_15]: And they are a description of the business and the menu of every food item that'll be offered, proposed hours of operation, and a schedule of times and locations where the vendor will be stationary and serving food.

[SPEAKER_15]: And a description of sanitary facilities, access to hand washing facilities,

2697
03:30:50,215 --> 03:30:57,980
[SPEAKER_15]: that would be available for the use of employees and also proof of lease or rental of a garage or commercial parking space.

2698

2702
03:31:41,139 --> 03:31:43,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, considering their application,

2703
03:31:44,519 --> 03:31:48,662

2706
03:32:03,773 --> 03:32:14,140

03:33:00,839 --> 03:33:12,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Next operating requirements under section 500, no license shall be granted to operate on a public way within 200 feet of any school between the hours of 8 AM and 3 PM on days when school are open.

2715
03:33:13,042 --> 03:33:16,063
[SPEAKER_15]: This shall not include post-secondary schools or colleges.

2716
03:33:16,583 --> 03:33:20,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Measurement shall be taken from the boundary line of the lot on which the school rests.

2717
03:33:21,584 --> 03:33:34,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Licensees are not permitted to operate within 200 feet of a person or entity currently holding a common vitualist license, which would be a restaurateur in the city of Medford without written permission from that licensed victualist.

2718
03:33:35,106 --> 03:33:40,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Such permission shall not be required in instances where the licensee and the vitualist have common ownership.

2719
03:33:43,721 --> 03:33:44,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information?

2720
03:33:44,662 --> 03:33:53,888
[SPEAKER_17]: I would just respectfully request that this paper be sent to the licensing commission, licensing subcommittee, where it could be duly vetted.

2721
03:33:54,248 --> 03:33:56,170
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a number of page ordinance.

2722
03:33:56,950 --> 03:33:58,451
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great that the mayor wants to support.

2723
03:33:58,571 --> 03:34:00,933
[SPEAKER_24]: This isn't a point of information, counselor.

2724
03:34:01,073 --> 03:34:03,775
[SPEAKER_24]: You're interjecting into the person's reading.

2725
03:34:05,207 --> 03:34:06,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely, it was a point of information.

2726
03:34:06,327 --> 03:34:09,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I just gave information that I'd like to send this to the licensing subcommittee.

2727
03:34:10,089 --> 03:34:10,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2728
03:34:13,450 --> 03:34:14,310
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Counselor.

2729
03:34:17,731 --> 03:34:19,111
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not a point of information.

2730
03:34:19,831 --> 03:34:24,533
[SPEAKER_24]: The gentleman, I gave the gentleman the floor.

2731
03:34:24,653 --> 03:34:28,674
[SPEAKER_24]: A point of information is a statement of a salient fact

2732
03:34:29,213 --> 03:34:31,895
[SPEAKER_24]: pertinent to facts being discussed, Counselor.

2733
03:34:32,175 --> 03:34:33,135
[SPEAKER_24]: You know better than that.

2734
03:34:33,295 --> 03:34:34,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor, please continue.

2735
03:34:34,956 --> 03:34:35,557
[SPEAKER_17]: You had the floor.

2736
03:34:35,577 --> 03:34:35,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2737
03:34:35,797 --> 03:34:40,580
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've just finished that about two... That does that.

2738
03:34:40,600 --> 03:34:41,180
[SPEAKER_17]: That does that.

2739
03:35:07,803 --> 03:35:07,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2740
03:35:10,104 --> 03:35:10,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Ends all debate.

2741
03:35:10,864 --> 03:35:11,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it ends all debate.

2742
03:35:12,585 --> 03:35:15,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and then it ends all debate on the paper.

2743
03:35:16,086 --> 03:35:31,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, on the motion of counselor, vice president Lungo Kern to return to the regular order of business.

2744
03:35:31,811 --> 03:35:34,331
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

2745
03:35:35,032 --> 03:35:36,092
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

2746
03:35:36,912 --> 03:35:53,987
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-605, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, to address the city council on free access TV from Medford and other cable TV matters.

2747
03:35:54,007 --> 03:35:55,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

2748
03:35:55,048 --> 03:35:55,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council President.

2749
03:35:55,648 --> 03:35:57,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2750
03:35:57,450 --> 03:35:57,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

2751
03:35:57,930 --> 03:35:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council President.

2752
03:35:59,091 --> 03:36:01,434
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue.

2753
03:36:01,754 --> 03:36:02,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be very brief.

2754
03:36:04,563 --> 03:36:08,987
[SPEAKER_09]: In Springfield, Massachusetts, major city, free access TV for the residents.

2755
03:36:09,627 --> 03:36:16,113
[SPEAKER_09]: In Pepperall, Mass., where they'll be playing my show now, good friend of mine lives up there, free access TV for him.

2756
03:36:16,933 --> 03:36:22,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So residents in these communities, in this evolving world of access, and it is evolving, they're getting free television.

2757
03:36:22,958 --> 03:36:32,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, since we've had no TV, and since the ratepayers have been paying into this for years and years and years, millions of dollars, I think it's only fair that our

2758
03:36:33,723 --> 03:36:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: new mayor, consider free TV for everyone, because 80% of the monies go to the city hall, 60% to the general fund, 20% of the government channel to three salaries at the high school.

2759
03:36:47,652 --> 03:36:52,896
[SPEAKER_09]: That 20% that we're paying is just a fraction, and we're not getting much.

2760
03:36:53,737 --> 03:37:02,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So because we're paying millions, why not open the doors to residents, businesses, and civic groups in Medford, free access television for them?

2761
03:37:03,622 --> 03:37:04,542
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a key issue.

2762
03:37:04,963 --> 03:37:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank the city council for hearing this very brief speech because, as you know, we're going to have an access station at the high school.

2763
03:37:14,026 --> 03:37:15,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to make it accessible.

2764
03:37:15,647 --> 03:37:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of accessibility is making it feel free.

2765
03:37:19,348 --> 03:37:20,588
[SPEAKER_09]: People have already paid for it.

2766
03:37:20,628 --> 03:37:21,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not double hit them.

2767
03:37:22,289 --> 03:37:23,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's give them free TV.

2768
03:37:23,730 --> 03:37:24,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

2769
03:37:39,802 --> 03:37:41,182
[SPEAKER_07]: take a paper from the table.

2770
03:37:41,642 --> 03:37:45,963
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Falco to suspend the rules to take a paper from the table.

2771
03:37:46,364 --> 03:37:47,224
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

2772
03:37:47,244 --> 03:37:47,604
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

2773
03:37:47,984 --> 03:37:48,824
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

2774
03:37:49,424 --> 03:37:50,125
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

2775
03:37:50,145 --> 03:37:53,465
[SPEAKER_24]: What paper would you like off the table, Councilor?

2776
03:37:53,485 --> 03:37:53,505
[SPEAKER_24]: 16-534.

2777
03:37:54,286 --> 03:38:02,167
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Falco to take 16-534, Authorized City of Medford Community Electricity Aggregation.

2778
03:38:02,988 --> 03:38:04,528
[SPEAKER_24]: The matter is before us, Councilor.

2779
03:38:05,213 --> 03:38:06,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2780
03:38:06,294 --> 03:38:17,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we had talked about this, uh, previously in, um, the subcommittee meeting and it came up, uh, before us in our regular meeting, uh, back, I think it was in the month of June, uh, maybe May.

2781
03:38:18,324 --> 03:38:22,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know, uh, this is an issue where I think time is of the essence.

2782
03:38:22,788 --> 03:38:28,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, so I think it's something that we should, uh, move on and act upon, uh, as a council tonight.

2783
03:38:32,176 --> 03:38:32,957
[SPEAKER_24]: So was there a motion?

2784
03:38:34,457 --> 03:38:35,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make a motion to approve.

2785
03:38:36,538 --> 03:38:49,407
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval of, uh, the, uh, to authorize the city of Medford to enter into community electricity aggregation offered by Councilor Falco.

2786
03:38:54,710 --> 03:38:55,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval.

2787
03:38:55,931 --> 03:38:56,831
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor.

2788
03:38:57,712 --> 03:38:58,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Marks.

2789
03:38:59,793 --> 03:39:00,254
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure.

2790
03:39:00,294 --> 03:39:03,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe the gentlemen can state the reason we took up this issue.

2791
03:39:04,828 --> 03:39:08,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, not too long ago, uh, I think a month, month and a half ago.

2792
03:39:08,849 --> 03:39:19,653
[SPEAKER_17]: And if maybe the gentleman can state his reasoning why he's asking for approval tonight, where there seemed to be a lot of opposition, uh, uh, regarding this particular.

2793
03:39:20,273 --> 03:39:30,717
[SPEAKER_24]: If the chair recalls correctly, the, uh, opposition was just, uh, uh, the desire for people to examine the, uh, uh, matter in greater detail and to have the luxury to do that.

2794
03:39:31,197 --> 03:39:34,338
[SPEAKER_24]: It was before the council on June 7th is now July.

2795
03:39:35,397 --> 03:39:37,058
[SPEAKER_24]: 19th council.

2796
03:39:37,799 --> 03:39:40,801
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically, I mean, it was, it was basically tabled.

2797
03:39:41,261 --> 03:39:43,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I know I, I was prepared to vote that night, but it was tabled.

2798
03:39:44,304 --> 03:39:46,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to give everyone an opportunity to look into it further.

2799
03:39:47,546 --> 03:39:50,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's, uh, it's, it's been over a month now.

2800
03:39:51,268 --> 03:39:55,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think, you know, if we vote for it or against it, you know, that, that's what we get paid to do to make votes.

2801
03:39:56,292 --> 03:39:59,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know, I, I know I'm prepared to vote for it tonight.

2802
03:40:00,075 --> 03:40:01,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I know, uh, Alicia hunts here.

2803
03:40:02,945 --> 03:40:09,206
[SPEAKER_07]: She could probably answer if there are any unanswered questions, but I think it's something that we need to move upon.

2804
03:40:11,267 --> 03:40:12,027
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

2805
03:40:12,827 --> 03:40:16,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Do any of the Councilors have any questions for the Director of Energy and Environment?

2806
03:40:20,829 --> 03:40:21,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caviello.

2807
03:40:22,389 --> 03:40:26,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia, again, only 300 people responded to your thing.

2808
03:40:26,150 --> 03:40:28,991
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got 17,000 households in the city of Medved.

2809
03:40:31,355 --> 03:40:37,257
[SPEAKER_33]: So we put out a survey to the residents of Medford as city council requested.

2810
03:40:37,277 --> 03:40:38,457
[SPEAKER_28]: It was online.

2811
03:40:38,817 --> 03:40:40,218
[SPEAKER_33]: It was in the newspaper.

2812
03:40:40,238 --> 03:40:47,740
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, it was around and 80% of the people who responded to the survey said they were in favor of it.

2813
03:40:47,760 --> 03:40:50,761
[SPEAKER_19]: 200 people responded out of 17, 17,000 homes.

2814
03:40:50,821 --> 03:40:56,322
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I am sorry that more people, this is what I mean.

2815
03:40:56,642 --> 03:40:59,003
[SPEAKER_19]: People, people aren't going to know they have this until they have it.

2816
03:40:59,652 --> 03:41:02,954
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when it goes wrong, it's going to come back to this party.

2817
03:41:05,456 --> 03:41:06,737
[SPEAKER_19]: It should have a public hearing if you want.

2818
03:41:06,757 --> 03:41:09,759
[SPEAKER_19]: This is where you want to go, have a public hearing, get some people down here.

2819
03:41:09,779 --> 03:41:15,503
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, 200 people responded, and they said, like I said, when it goes bad, it goes bad.

2820
03:41:15,943 --> 03:41:22,347
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't interrupt you, but at the same time, if we got people down here, we would never get more than 15 or 20 people pro or con.

2821
03:41:22,367 --> 03:41:24,089
[SPEAKER_33]: We got almost 240 people to voice their opinion online.

2822
03:41:29,905 --> 03:41:33,407
[SPEAKER_33]: You are, I'm so sorry, but it's very late.

2823
03:41:33,867 --> 03:41:41,030
[SPEAKER_33]: And the idea that 10 people at the podium are more persuasive than 200 people online.

2824
03:41:41,690 --> 03:41:43,311
[SPEAKER_19]: 17,000 houses in the city.

2825
03:41:45,172 --> 03:41:46,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, people aren't gonna know they have this.

2826
03:41:48,253 --> 03:41:51,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Is the city gonna take responsibility if the rate goes up?

2827
03:41:52,475 --> 03:41:53,495
[SPEAKER_33]: That's the answer.

2828
03:41:54,036 --> 03:41:57,217
[SPEAKER_33]: The way the process works is that when there's a plan in place.

2829
03:41:57,237 --> 03:41:59,098
[SPEAKER_19]: And does this company have the funding

2830
03:41:59,485 --> 03:42:02,468
[SPEAKER_19]: The backup, the contracts.

2831
03:42:02,508 --> 03:42:02,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

2832
03:42:03,168 --> 03:42:07,752
[SPEAKER_33]: When there's a plan in place, then there would be a public hearing on the plan.

2833
03:42:08,192 --> 03:42:19,522
[SPEAKER_33]: But to ask people to come to a public hearing on no plan is difficult to do, and frankly, is not something that any of the other 80 communities that are involved in aggregation have done.

2834
03:42:19,982 --> 03:42:26,588
[SPEAKER_33]: They have a consultant prepare a plan, and then it's a coherent plan that they ask the community to comment on.

2835
03:42:27,187 --> 03:42:29,729
[SPEAKER_33]: that's what we would ask the community to comment on.

2836
03:42:30,250 --> 03:42:38,618
[SPEAKER_33]: Nothing would actually go into effect without a public hearing, but I can't ask people to come to a public hearing on an idea.

2837
03:42:38,918 --> 03:42:40,559
[SPEAKER_33]: They have to have a plan to discuss.

2838
03:42:42,101 --> 03:42:46,905
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't support this with, with, with, um, I'm telling people what to do.

2839
03:42:48,226 --> 03:42:48,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

2840
03:42:49,848 --> 03:42:50,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2841
03:42:50,168 --> 03:42:51,870
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have a motion for approval on the floor.

2842
03:42:52,911 --> 03:42:52,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Um,

2843
03:42:59,706 --> 03:43:03,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, I think it would be a majority vote.

2844
03:43:06,370 --> 03:43:06,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2845
03:43:07,751 --> 03:43:07,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2846
03:43:10,293 --> 03:43:10,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2847
03:43:12,674 --> 03:43:16,677
[SPEAKER_24]: Chair recognizes Vice President Langel-Kern.

2848
03:43:17,317 --> 03:43:18,038
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a tough one.

2849
03:43:18,138 --> 03:43:20,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to back up Councilor Carvio a little bit.

2850
03:43:21,723 --> 03:43:29,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great that a number of people, a lot of the comments, because I have it right here on my phone, more renewable energy.

2851
03:43:30,050 --> 03:43:43,863
[SPEAKER_05]: You see that a lot, but every third comment has a question, and I think that's where public hearing would be beneficial, because then you could even say, you know, whether we're here or not, I'm sure some of us would try to go.

2852
03:43:45,047 --> 03:43:53,712
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 people showed up, then we would know we had a survey, we had a public hearing, we've had two council meetings on it, next one's gonna be three, and it would give us more to go on.

2853
03:43:53,772 --> 03:44:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when people did complain, we could say there was a public hearing, maybe even something that's sent out in the tax bills to let people know this is a possibility, the city council is exploring this, it's something that is gonna lock you in unless you make an effort to opt out of this program, and then if you have any questions, this is where you direct your questions to.

2854
03:44:14,866 --> 03:44:21,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling this is going to also, if something goes wrong with this, it's going to backfire on us 100%, and that's what makes me nervous.

2855
03:44:21,831 --> 03:44:26,674
[SPEAKER_05]: But would it be something that I would want my, I know Councilor Scarpelli has it in his home.

2856
03:44:26,694 --> 03:44:29,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be something that I probably would do with my family?

2857
03:44:29,656 --> 03:44:43,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually got calls to my office, and I have been thinking about it for my business, but it's just, putting it on us to mandate and make, you know, have every household involved with this is risky.

2858
03:44:45,008 --> 03:44:48,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is a risk involved, and I think you said that to us last meeting.

2859
03:44:48,671 --> 03:44:57,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a 100 percent savings guarantee, and that's where I find that it is, you know, not as risky as the stock market, but this is risky.

2860
03:44:57,899 --> 03:45:05,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And to have the taxpayers' energy bills on our backs is a whole other burden that I'm not ready for without a public hearing.

2861
03:45:06,205 --> 03:45:13,211
[SPEAKER_33]: So there would not be an implementation without a public hearing that is a required part of the process.

2862
03:45:14,477 --> 03:45:15,718
[SPEAKER_33]: you couldn't do that.

2863
03:45:16,118 --> 03:45:21,341
[SPEAKER_33]: So that would have to occur in order for the implementation to actually occur.

2864
03:45:26,163 --> 03:45:34,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it would come back to the council for a vote, you'd still only need a 4-3 vote to pass it through?

2865
03:45:35,128 --> 03:45:39,010
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know under what situations you need more than a 4-3 vote.

2866
03:45:39,050 --> 03:45:43,452
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why at any point, yeah.

2867
03:45:44,790 --> 03:45:45,370
[SPEAKER_33]: What's the question?

2868
03:45:45,390 --> 03:45:50,991
[SPEAKER_33]: She asked if, um, if so, after the public hearing, it would come back to the city council for, for approval of the plan.

2869
03:45:51,271 --> 03:45:52,692
[SPEAKER_33]: That would again, need a four, three vote.

2870
03:45:52,772 --> 03:45:56,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless legislation or ordinance calls for a two thirds vote.

2871
03:45:56,653 --> 03:45:57,873
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always four, three.

2872
03:45:58,353 --> 03:46:00,974
[SPEAKER_15]: That's that's, that's the general statement of law.

2873
03:46:01,574 --> 03:46:01,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2874
03:46:02,434 --> 03:46:02,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

2875
03:46:03,034 --> 03:46:07,995
[SPEAKER_24]: I just have motion for approval on the floor.

2876
03:46:09,656 --> 03:46:10,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

2877
03:46:11,236 --> 03:46:11,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor.

2878
03:46:12,653 --> 03:46:21,480
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm kind of amazed that it's such an important issue, uh, that affects each and every resident of this community is brought up under suspension.

2879
03:46:23,022 --> 03:46:29,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Mr. President, in the middle of the summer, I'm really, I really point of information council night.

2880
03:46:29,742 --> 03:46:33,324
[SPEAKER_22]: The matter was tabled on January 7th, and the councillor moved to bring the matter off the table.

2881
03:46:33,424 --> 03:46:35,325
[SPEAKER_22]: So it wasn't like it's filed under suspension.

2882
03:46:35,545 --> 03:46:36,906
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand where you're coming from, councillor.

2883
03:46:36,926 --> 03:46:40,748
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's 11 o'clock at night, and it's an issue that's going to affect 17,000 households in the community.

2884
03:46:40,808 --> 03:46:41,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, right.

2885
03:46:41,348 --> 03:46:46,531
[SPEAKER_22]: But in terms of, you know what I mean, it wasn't like he filed a paper under suspension and waited until the bail indoctrinates to pull it out.

2886
03:46:46,551 --> 03:46:46,951
[SPEAKER_17]: It was on the agenda.

2887
03:46:46,971 --> 03:46:54,916
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't filed under suspension, but as you stated, you know, this is a real controversial issue that impacts a lot of people in this community.

2888
03:46:55,436 --> 03:46:57,317
[SPEAKER_17]: And whether you like green energy or not,

2889
03:46:58,222 --> 03:47:00,043
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to opt out of certain things.

2890
03:47:00,523 --> 03:47:09,065
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, this could end up costing people more money, depending on how much green energy you want and so forth.

2891
03:47:09,706 --> 03:47:13,847
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, this is not a quick fix by any stretch.

2892
03:47:14,447 --> 03:47:20,089
[SPEAKER_17]: As was mentioned, there's 80 communities out of 360 whatever-odd communities in Massachusetts.

2893
03:47:21,329 --> 03:47:25,731
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, this isn't the panacea of saving money that everyone talks about.

2894
03:47:27,545 --> 03:47:27,985
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sorry.

2895
03:47:28,025 --> 03:47:28,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, go ahead.

2896
03:47:28,766 --> 03:47:30,368
[SPEAKER_33]: We would be presented with the plan.

2897
03:47:30,808 --> 03:47:37,314
[SPEAKER_33]: The plan would absolutely involve paper mailings to every single household.

2898
03:47:38,074 --> 03:47:53,088
[SPEAKER_33]: It would absolutely involve, but we can't, like, I don't have a plan until you give me permission to make one, but there's no idea that a plan wouldn't involve a paper mailing to every household, as well as articles in the newspapers.

2899
03:47:54,287 --> 03:47:55,968
[SPEAKER_33]: because we have the robocall system.

2900
03:47:56,429 --> 03:48:02,793
[SPEAKER_33]: We could certainly, I mean, I would recommend that we would include it on there because that's, we have that here.

2901
03:48:04,013 --> 03:48:10,617
[SPEAKER_33]: So what the next step would be to actually prepare an outreach plan for the residents.

2902
03:48:10,798 --> 03:48:20,303
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't give you an outreach plan until you give me permission to create one, but that's actually the step that we're asking permission for is to start that plan.

2903
03:48:21,364 --> 03:48:22,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And if this was voluntary,

2904
03:48:23,623 --> 03:48:24,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be on board 110%.

2905
03:48:27,667 --> 03:48:31,591
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not going to impose on anyone in this community who they're going to buy their electricity through.

2906
03:48:32,571 --> 03:48:33,252
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not my role.

2907
03:48:34,113 --> 03:48:35,574
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate you pushing for it.

2908
03:48:35,674 --> 03:48:40,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Same, you know, it's... All set?

2909
03:48:42,100 --> 03:48:43,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caffiello.

2910
03:48:43,642 --> 03:48:45,564
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the company you were going to use is Good Energy, correct?

2911
03:48:46,004 --> 03:48:46,184
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

2912
03:48:46,204 --> 03:48:47,786
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, have we vetted their company?

2913
03:48:48,232 --> 03:48:50,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Do they have the financing to back up their contracts?

2914
03:48:50,413 --> 03:48:54,375
[SPEAKER_33]: So they're a consulting firm, and so they would go out and do the solicitation.

2915
03:48:54,415 --> 03:49:02,959
[SPEAKER_19]: But you have to make sure, because I sought expert advice on this, and you have to make sure that you go to a company that has the money and the finances to back up the contracts.

2916
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:08,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Other companies have had problems in the past where they didn't have enough money to back up the contract.

2917
03:49:09,979 --> 03:49:11,100
[SPEAKER_33]: Of course you would.

2918
03:49:11,120 --> 03:49:19,545
[SPEAKER_33]: They were been thoroughly vetted, not actually just by myself, but by a committee of my peers through the Regional Metropolitan Area Planning Council.

2919
03:49:19,925 --> 03:49:32,614
[SPEAKER_33]: So by more than just, I mean, I am just one person in the city, but they actually brought together a committee of my peers from other communities as well, who also reviewed the materials that Good Energy submitted to MAPC.

2920
03:49:32,974 --> 03:49:36,056
[SPEAKER_33]: So it was actually a broader vetting process than we could do on our own.

2921
03:49:39,430 --> 03:49:39,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2922
03:49:41,331 --> 03:49:42,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

2923
03:49:42,772 --> 03:49:59,479
[SPEAKER_14]: My quick question was, I know that we brought it up, we talked about some of our buildings already are using, and I don't know if we asked for or we got any information back that showed savings with the municipal buildings that already have this implemented.

2924
03:50:00,060 --> 03:50:00,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have that?

2925
03:50:02,499 --> 03:50:05,941
[SPEAKER_33]: I haven't actually run those numbers, but we certainly could.

2926
03:50:06,681 --> 03:50:21,591
[SPEAKER_33]: I know that since we have entered into contract for our electricity, the last two, three years, our rate has been lower than the national grid rate has been.

2927
03:50:22,032 --> 03:50:28,556
[SPEAKER_33]: So I know there's been savings every year, but I haven't actually run the numbers to say what the totals are.

2928
03:50:28,576 --> 03:50:29,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, like I said,

2929
03:50:31,722 --> 03:50:40,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all for the opportunity because I did it myself and we found a company and we're saving money.

2930
03:50:41,066 --> 03:50:49,410
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, that's still my only question is, you know, the process for everybody getting the word out.

2931
03:50:49,430 --> 03:50:50,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a fine line.

2932
03:50:50,591 --> 03:50:54,813
[SPEAKER_33]: So you may know that some companies are good and respectable and some are not.

2933
03:50:55,333 --> 03:50:59,815
[SPEAKER_33]: And there are people going around knocking on the doors of our very vulnerable residents

2934
03:51:00,543 --> 03:51:06,590
[SPEAKER_33]: and switching them without their desire to some more disreputable companies.

2935
03:51:07,230 --> 03:51:19,624
[SPEAKER_33]: And there are also people who are not aware of this at all, and they are the ones who need this the most, who don't have the time to pay attention, to look into it, to do their own research, and they're the ones who would most benefit from this.

2936
03:51:20,311 --> 03:51:26,676
[SPEAKER_33]: And those are the people who we could help by doing this, because they'll say, oh, if the city did it for me, I can trust it.

2937
03:51:27,096 --> 03:51:28,777
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, not everybody trusts the city.

2938
03:51:29,178 --> 03:51:32,240
[SPEAKER_33]: But there are a lot of people who actually do.

2939
03:51:32,400 --> 03:51:36,703
[SPEAKER_33]: When the city seal is on something, they say, well, then it must be worthwhile.

2940
03:51:36,823 --> 03:51:38,624
[SPEAKER_33]: Somebody else has done the research for me.

2941
03:51:38,945 --> 03:51:40,306
[SPEAKER_33]: There are a lot of people like that.

2942
03:51:40,666 --> 03:51:47,691
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is actually going to help those people on fixed income, the elderly, the people who don't speak English as a primary language.

2943
03:51:48,072 --> 03:51:53,296
[SPEAKER_33]: Those are the people who couldn't do that research that you're able to do on your own.

2944
03:51:53,656 --> 03:51:57,039
[SPEAKER_33]: And so this will benefit that population the most.

2945
03:51:58,300 --> 03:51:58,700
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2946
03:51:59,201 --> 03:51:59,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor?

2947
03:52:00,442 --> 03:52:02,443
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a motion on the floor for approval.

2948
03:52:02,924 --> 03:52:04,705
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2949
03:52:07,487 --> 03:52:08,428
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caviello?

2950
03:52:08,568 --> 03:52:08,788
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2951
03:52:09,749 --> 03:52:10,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falcone?

2952
03:52:10,310 --> 03:52:10,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2953
03:52:11,571 --> 03:52:12,151
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Layton?

2954
03:52:13,412 --> 03:52:13,472
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2955
03:52:13,492 --> 03:52:14,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice-President Levin-Kern?

2956
03:52:17,218 --> 03:52:17,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Marks?

2957
03:52:18,078 --> 03:52:18,299
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2958
03:52:19,119 --> 03:52:19,839
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

2959
03:52:19,859 --> 03:52:19,919
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2960
03:52:21,880 --> 03:52:22,681
[SPEAKER_25]: President De La Rosa?

2961
03:52:23,341 --> 03:52:23,541
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2962
03:52:24,041 --> 03:52:30,544
[SPEAKER_24]: With the vote of one in the affirmative, six in the negative, the matter fails.

2963
03:52:31,265 --> 03:52:31,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2964
03:52:34,546 --> 03:52:39,148
[SPEAKER_24]: On motion of Councilor Knight to take 16-546 off the table.

2965
03:52:40,109 --> 03:52:44,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Revised Chapter 66 Ordinance Non-Union Officers and Employees

2966
03:52:44,870 --> 03:52:51,474
[SPEAKER_24]: This was for the assistant city solicitors pay increase which required an ordinance adjustment.

2967
03:52:52,375 --> 03:52:57,539
[SPEAKER_24]: It was voted affirmatively before the council on June 14th.

2968
03:52:58,039 --> 03:53:07,785
[SPEAKER_24]: It was advertised for a second reading June 30th and now on July 19th is eligible for a final reading.

2969
03:53:07,865 --> 03:53:08,386
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Knight.

2970
03:53:08,806 --> 03:53:10,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2971
03:53:10,187 --> 03:53:12,989
[SPEAKER_22]: This item was an item that came up during our budget deliberations.

2972
03:53:13,129 --> 03:53:14,490
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a wage equality issue.

2973
03:53:15,110 --> 03:53:26,337
[SPEAKER_22]: We took a look at what the assistant city solicitor was making and compared that to other communities and recognized that she was making a significantly less amount of money in an effort to bring parity to the position.

2974
03:53:26,837 --> 03:53:30,960
[SPEAKER_22]: The mayor had presented an ordinance change reclassifying the position.

2975
03:53:31,000 --> 03:53:32,681
[SPEAKER_22]: The council supported it at its first reading.

2976
03:53:32,721 --> 03:53:36,443
[SPEAKER_22]: It was duly advertised in the Medford transcript and today it's eligible for its third reading.

2977
03:53:36,463 --> 03:53:38,024
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd move for approval, Mr. President.

2978
03:53:38,325 --> 03:53:40,406
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

2979
03:53:42,415 --> 03:53:48,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Longo-Kern is abstaining for reasons that she disclosed to us at a previous meeting.

2980
03:53:48,881 --> 03:53:50,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2981
03:53:53,525 --> 03:53:54,346
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caviello?

2982
03:53:54,866 --> 03:53:55,146
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2983
03:53:55,887 --> 03:53:56,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco?

2984
03:53:56,788 --> 03:53:57,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2985
03:53:57,669 --> 03:53:58,229
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Night?

2986
03:53:58,369 --> 03:53:58,870
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2987
03:53:59,450 --> 03:54:00,391
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Lara Kern?

2988
03:54:00,571 --> 03:54:00,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2989
03:54:03,113 --> 03:54:03,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Mox?

2990
03:54:04,174 --> 03:54:04,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2991
03:54:05,035 --> 03:54:05,876
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Schapelle?

2992
03:54:05,936 --> 03:54:06,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2993
03:54:06,857 --> 03:54:07,697
[SPEAKER_25]: President De La Russo?

2994
03:54:09,258 --> 03:54:12,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, with a vote of six in the affirmative, one abstention.

2995
03:54:24,432 --> 03:54:25,713
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no reconsideration.

2996
03:54:25,773 --> 03:54:26,693
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't called the vote.

2997
03:54:27,814 --> 03:54:31,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Your vote, Madam Vice President, is abstention or present.

2998
03:54:35,205 --> 03:54:39,268
[SPEAKER_24]: with the vote of six in the affirmative, one present or abstaining.

2999
03:54:39,828 --> 03:54:43,091
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes and is ordained.

3000
03:54:44,612 --> 03:54:50,956
[SPEAKER_24]: While we're under suspension, we have one more item here, 16-606 offered by Councilor Caviello.

3001
03:54:51,437 --> 03:54:57,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss and vote on moving the bus stop on Main Street to Riverside Avenue.

3002
03:54:57,861 --> 03:54:59,823
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caviello, which bus stop is that?

3003
03:55:00,443 --> 03:55:04,386
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the bus stop in front of one of our favorite restaurant there.

3004
03:55:05,020 --> 03:55:06,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, we, we, we, we've discussed it.

3005
03:55:06,640 --> 03:55:07,501
[SPEAKER_19]: We've gone on and on.

3006
03:55:07,981 --> 03:55:12,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, it's time to make a vote, move the bus stop and let the, uh, T's come down.

3007
03:55:12,202 --> 03:55:18,263
[SPEAKER_24]: They haven't given us a decision on the motion of the council of Caffiello to move the bus stop to Riverside Avenue.

3008
03:55:18,283 --> 03:55:18,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just vote.

3009
03:55:19,263 --> 03:55:26,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, chair recognizes the authority to vote and move the bus stop as, as, as the chairperson.

3010
03:55:26,985 --> 03:55:34,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I, I feel the frustration, but we're waiting on the study back from the T that

3011
03:55:34,780 --> 03:55:42,502
[SPEAKER_14]: affected a bunch of people that have contacted us to see where that would fall.

3012
03:55:42,602 --> 03:55:44,662
[SPEAKER_14]: So believe me, I feel the frustration.

3013
03:55:44,682 --> 03:56:01,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I've talked to the restaurant owner this evening and I just want to make sure that what we talked with my word with the people that have contacted me that this would be something that would be discussed with them and moving forward.

3014
03:56:01,627 --> 03:56:03,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know,

3015
03:56:05,775 --> 03:56:08,837
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't hear you, Counselor.

3016
03:56:09,117 --> 03:56:10,978
[SPEAKER_24]: The tea is dragging their feet, Mr. President.

3017
03:56:11,138 --> 03:56:13,239
[SPEAKER_24]: So the motion before us is for approval.

3018
03:56:13,679 --> 03:56:14,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Knight.

3019
03:56:15,260 --> 03:56:18,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, the matter has been discussed and deliberated at the subcommittee level.

3020
03:56:18,602 --> 03:56:21,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor Scott Pelley's put a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of effort into this.

3021
03:56:22,224 --> 03:56:30,668
[SPEAKER_22]: I respect his wishes and I think that if he has given his word to certain individuals and certain aspects of this matter would be vetted and looked at appropriately that we should allow that opportunity.

3022
03:56:31,303 --> 03:56:38,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, that coupled with the fact that the disability community has still expressed, uh, quite a bit of interest in maintaining this bus stop at this current position.

3023
03:56:38,909 --> 03:56:43,252
[SPEAKER_22]: And the council really hasn't had a meeting, a hearing or anything else with the individuals that would be affected thereof.

3024
03:56:43,693 --> 03:56:46,595
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that it's a little bit premature enough for us to take this vote.

3025
03:56:46,675 --> 03:56:48,136
[SPEAKER_22]: And as such, I'd be voting in the negative.

3026
03:56:48,516 --> 03:56:48,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3027
03:56:49,157 --> 03:56:52,780
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by council, Carvio chair recognizes council marks.

3028
03:56:53,220 --> 03:56:54,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3029
03:56:54,181 --> 03:56:59,225
[SPEAKER_17]: As someone that sits on the committee, I appreciate the work that council Scott Pelley has done on this.

3030
03:56:59,485 --> 03:57:00,506
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not an easy answer.

3031
03:57:00,526 --> 03:57:00,946
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds,

3032
03:57:01,388 --> 03:57:04,230
[SPEAKER_17]: easy to say move a bus stop, but it's not an easy answer.

3033
03:57:05,331 --> 03:57:10,514
[SPEAKER_17]: However, at what point do we have to take into consideration the business owner?

3034
03:57:11,294 --> 03:57:20,700
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have a business owner over there that's been dealt a lousy hand with the construction of the Craddock Bridge and also coupled with the bus stop.

3035
03:57:21,401 --> 03:57:23,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think he's asking for some relief.

3036
03:57:24,243 --> 03:57:28,105
[SPEAKER_17]: And at what point do we take into consideration the business owner in the community?

3037
03:57:28,565 --> 03:57:31,007
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's all that Councilor Caviello is looking at.

3038
03:57:31,275 --> 03:57:32,756
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know Councilor Scarpelli is too.

3039
03:57:33,096 --> 03:57:39,380
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all concerned, but waiting for a report back from the T, your study, I don't have any faith in that.

3040
03:57:39,920 --> 03:57:40,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't.

3041
03:57:43,703 --> 03:57:46,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Do they give you any idea when it may happen?

3042
03:57:46,064 --> 03:57:54,850
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I... I'll be honest, I'm a little disappointed that I found out about this tonight from my fellow council members.

3043
03:57:55,350 --> 03:57:58,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make that statement, but I will tell you that

3044
03:57:59,132 --> 03:58:04,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the person personally, and I understand the trials and tribulations he's gone through.

3045
03:58:04,476 --> 03:58:07,479
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't just the T stepping on and kicking him around.

3046
03:58:07,819 --> 03:58:08,560
[SPEAKER_14]: This is everybody.

3047
03:58:09,040 --> 03:58:13,363
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm put in a pretty bad position and pretty disappointed in that.

3048
03:58:13,423 --> 03:58:21,550
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will tell you, I cannot vote for it because I also gave other people my word that I would vet through this process now as a newer counselor.

3049
03:58:21,940 --> 03:58:25,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And understanding what the T's done, not happy with it.

3050
03:58:25,562 --> 03:58:31,384
[SPEAKER_14]: But not only the T, but our public utilities, very disappointed.

3051
03:58:31,424 --> 03:58:40,008
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will tell you, I cannot vote for it because of the fact that I have to stand by my word that I've talked to people that had concerns about moving this.

3052
03:58:40,588 --> 03:58:48,251
[SPEAKER_14]: And until that process is complete, again, I will contact a state representative because it seems

3053
03:58:49,146 --> 03:58:52,909
[SPEAKER_14]: it moves quicker when a state representative said Donato's involved.

3054
03:58:52,949 --> 03:58:54,630
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe that can help us move.

3055
03:58:54,690 --> 03:59:00,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I spoke to the state representative said it's, well, she told me that it's on, it's on us.

3056
03:59:00,375 --> 03:59:03,077
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, let's say if you want to, we'll wait till the next meeting again.

3057
03:59:03,217 --> 03:59:04,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we keep waiting, waiting, waiting.

3058
03:59:05,779 --> 03:59:06,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

3059
03:59:06,399 --> 03:59:07,620
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a motion on the floor.

3060
03:59:07,801 --> 03:59:08,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll, I'll reset my motion.

3061
03:59:08,741 --> 03:59:12,044
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, you, I'll reset my motion.

3062
03:59:13,265 --> 03:59:15,607
[SPEAKER_24]: And so is there a subsequent motion?

3063
03:59:16,267 --> 03:59:17,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam vice president.

3064
03:59:19,254 --> 03:59:28,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I see everybody's frustrations that a number of the businesses are calling all of us, and we're also getting it from Diane McLeod, who's our disability director.

3065
03:59:28,582 --> 03:59:30,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we give it one more month until our next meeting?

3066
03:59:31,145 --> 03:59:45,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to get answers from the Disability Commission, see if we can set up a public hearing process during our next meeting, and we'll also try to get in contact with the T and Representative Donato and try to work it out, and then once and for all take a vote on it.

3067
03:59:46,573 --> 03:59:49,474
[SPEAKER_05]: because people are frustrated on many levels in many areas.

3068
03:59:58,978 --> 03:59:59,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3069
04:00:00,938 --> 04:00:04,120
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Knight.

3070
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:12,883
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we can also take the opportunity to reach out to Mr. Fielding who's been assigned and I'm sure that you've had

3071
04:00:13,878 --> 04:00:19,422
[SPEAKER_22]: multiple conversations with him as well, and I'm sure that the response that they've been giving is, well, move it to wherever you want, just tell us where you want to put it.

3072
04:00:19,723 --> 04:00:23,305
[SPEAKER_22]: But that doesn't necessarily guarantee that the bus is going to stop where you put the new stop either.

3073
04:00:23,766 --> 04:00:25,047
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that there are a little bit more.

3074
04:00:25,227 --> 04:00:29,090
[SPEAKER_24]: And we can't move a bus stop if it involves changing the route of a bus.

3075
04:00:29,610 --> 04:00:31,091
[SPEAKER_24]: That is outside of our purview.

3076
04:00:31,672 --> 04:00:33,233
[SPEAKER_24]: So there are some other moving parts.

3077
04:00:33,273 --> 04:00:42,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would ask that the city solicitor, because people have been throwing around the word loosely again, that the city solicitor explain to this body

3078
04:00:43,275 --> 04:00:51,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, while he's here at this late hour, what the ramifications of calling something a public hearing is?

3079
04:00:51,797 --> 04:01:01,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I think everybody knows what a public hearing is, a hearing on an issue.

3080
04:01:02,340 --> 04:01:07,921
[SPEAKER_15]: It's statutory or it's under a regulation or an ordinance which requires advertisement.

3081
04:01:08,641 --> 04:01:12,142
[SPEAKER_15]: And then people come and they say yay or nay their positions, whatever they are.

3082
04:01:12,928 --> 04:01:16,090
[SPEAKER_15]: public hearings always take place in the context of a public meeting.

3083
04:01:16,751 --> 04:01:23,296
[SPEAKER_15]: They're at a public meeting, but yet they're a public hearing, but you can have a meeting without a public hearing as you did tonight.

3084
04:01:23,576 --> 04:01:25,798
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no hearing tonight on any particular issue.

3085
04:01:26,118 --> 04:01:32,843
[SPEAKER_15]: It would seem like it because people would come up and be on both sides of the issue on the dog, dog ordinance, but that really wasn't a hearing.

3086
04:01:33,143 --> 04:01:37,847
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a meeting in which you receive both positive and negative input.

3087
04:01:38,567 --> 04:01:40,309
[SPEAKER_15]: A hearing is a specific animal.

3088
04:01:40,669 --> 04:01:41,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So for example,

3089
04:01:42,664 --> 04:01:50,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lungo Curran talked about notifying people within a certain area, which is a nice thing to do in addition to what you normally have to do.

3090
04:01:50,986 --> 04:01:55,867
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's required in the zoning issue under the statute.

3091
04:01:56,547 --> 04:01:58,507
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not required for a meeting.

3092
04:01:59,007 --> 04:02:05,269
[SPEAKER_15]: But you might have an issue now and then that you want to have direct contact with people, as you might with the dogs.

3093
04:02:05,749 --> 04:02:08,789
[SPEAKER_15]: So then you'd say, well, let's give notice to the people in this area.

3094
04:02:08,849 --> 04:02:10,570
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's still a meeting, not a hearing.

3095
04:02:11,920 --> 04:02:12,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Was I confusing enough?

3096
04:02:13,361 --> 04:02:14,062
[SPEAKER_24]: You were perfect.

3097
04:02:14,503 --> 04:02:14,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3098
04:02:15,564 --> 04:02:19,928
[SPEAKER_24]: So council, you've, uh, you've withdrawn your motion.

3099
04:02:20,849 --> 04:02:21,850
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion is withdrawn.

3100
04:02:22,931 --> 04:02:26,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the tabled records of the meeting of June 14th, 2016.

3101
04:02:26,554 --> 04:02:27,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, madam vice president.

3102
04:02:27,735 --> 04:02:27,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Um,

3103
04:02:35,584 --> 04:02:47,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We requested, I'm not sure if anything was sent to Mr. Gliona with regards to coming before the council tonight and discussing his communications with the state delegation and Massport.

3104
04:02:49,119 --> 04:02:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously not here tonight, but could we request that he come to the next meeting to discuss?

3105
04:02:56,662 --> 04:02:58,443
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

3106
04:02:58,463 --> 04:03:05,807
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my understanding, I spoke with Mr. Glowner earlier last week, and it was my understanding he was gonna be on vacation, I believe, a family vacation this week, if I'm not mistaken.

3107
04:03:06,087 --> 04:03:09,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, perfect, yeah, it's July, that's understandable, and that's fine.

3108
04:03:09,729 --> 04:03:14,092
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just respectfully request that he come to the next city council meeting.

3109
04:03:14,432 --> 04:03:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all heard tonight, every five minutes, a plane was going over City Hall.

3110
04:03:18,014 --> 04:03:20,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I receive complaints on this repeatedly every day.

3111
04:03:21,095 --> 04:03:21,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting worse.

3112
04:03:22,532 --> 04:03:28,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, like we said last meeting, make sure you're sending in your complaints and getting those letters back.

3113
04:03:29,255 --> 04:03:29,575
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3114
04:03:30,035 --> 04:03:33,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor, the clerk has spoken to Mr. Galeano.

3115
04:03:34,236 --> 04:03:39,318
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Mr. Galeano could not make it for this particular meeting.

3116
04:03:39,498 --> 04:03:51,963
[SPEAKER_25]: Obviously, he said he would be happy to come if notified to the next meeting, but he suggested possibly to wait afterwards because he does have

3117
04:03:52,397 --> 04:03:55,940
[SPEAKER_25]: the meeting with Massport in first week of September.

3118
04:03:56,901 --> 04:03:57,461
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I mean?

3119
04:03:57,521 --> 04:04:03,826
[SPEAKER_25]: So to come after this, you know, that meeting to give, you know, give some better answers or whatever, you know, so.

3120
04:04:03,926 --> 04:04:14,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We could make a resolution then to request that Mr. Galeona, attorney Galeona come to the first meeting in September after his meeting with Massport.

3121
04:04:14,134 --> 04:04:14,634
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

3122
04:04:15,455 --> 04:04:21,580
[SPEAKER_24]: The first convenient meeting for him, uh, the first committee convenient city council meeting for him.

3123
04:04:22,451 --> 04:04:23,092

3124
04:04:26,353 --> 04:04:27,174
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3125
04:04:28,234 --> 04:04:29,095
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3126
04:04:29,515 --> 04:04:30,435
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion carries.

3127
04:04:30,515 --> 04:04:35,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Tabled records of the meeting of June 14, 2016, will pass to Councillor Marks.

3128
04:04:37,019 --> 04:04:43,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior to that, Mr. President, I'd like to, on paper, 604.

3129
04:04:52,785 --> 04:05:17,519
[SPEAKER_17]: the, uh, revised ordinance, the city method entitled, uh, mobile food truck ordinance, which draw my motion, uh, section 22 motion, uh, to allow for the, uh, part of the paper, which allows for mobile food trucks on a temporary basis to be used at five different locations, which was part of the main ordinance.

3130
04:05:18,360 --> 04:05:20,521
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, this was a subsection of the ordinance.

3131
04:05:20,541 --> 04:05:20,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

3132
04:05:21,098 --> 04:05:28,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I would ask that we remove section 22, Mr. President, respectfully.

3133
04:05:37,802 --> 04:05:42,946
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, as the author of the motion, I think I have the authority to... I think he can withdraw because we didn't take a vote.

3134
04:05:42,966 --> 04:05:43,667
[SPEAKER_22]: He can withdraw 22.

3135
04:05:43,847 --> 04:05:45,048
[SPEAKER_22]: He can withdraw 22 because we didn't take a vote.

3136
04:05:45,088 --> 04:05:49,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, we're hereby withdrawing section 22 on the aforementioned paper before us.

3137
04:05:49,851 --> 04:05:49,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Paper 604.

3138
04:05:50,031 --> 04:05:49,971
604.

3139
04:05:50,051 --> 04:05:51,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion 22 has been withdrawn.

3140
04:05:55,562 --> 04:05:56,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of clarification, Mr. President, I have a question.

3141
04:05:56,883 --> 04:05:58,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

3142
04:05:58,664 --> 04:06:18,596
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's my understanding by Councilor Mox withdrawing a section 22 motion that he is now moving to adopt the pilot provisions that are included in that resolution to expand to those five or six events that were going to be taking place this summer to allow for the mobile food trucks to service those events while we go back and do our homework.

3143
04:06:18,956 --> 04:06:21,037
[SPEAKER_17]: That was my oversight, yes, absolutely.

3144
04:06:21,348 --> 04:06:26,710
[SPEAKER_22]: I support that wholeheartedly, Mr. President, and I thank the councilor for his efforts in rescinding his vote, his motion.

3145
04:06:27,231 --> 04:06:38,475
[SPEAKER_15]: On behalf of the administration, we also think that that's a very good idea, which will support these very important municipal celebrations.

3146
04:06:38,855 --> 04:06:41,617
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3147
04:06:41,717 --> 04:06:42,517
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3148
04:06:42,757 --> 04:06:42,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

3149
04:06:42,957 --> 04:06:43,597
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3150
04:06:44,118 --> 04:06:44,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Carries.

3151
04:06:45,760 --> 04:06:49,844
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's going to the licensing committee, but it's been adopted.

3152
04:06:50,024 --> 04:06:51,406
[SPEAKER_24]: But we remain on the table, right?

3153
04:06:51,486 --> 04:06:53,808
[SPEAKER_24]: It's allowing for the- Yeah, we didn't send it to the licensing.

3154
04:06:53,828 --> 04:06:54,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Send it to a committee.

3155
04:06:56,070 --> 04:06:57,672
[SPEAKER_17]: You sent it to licensing, right?

3156
04:06:57,692 --> 04:07:02,417
[SPEAKER_17]: That's originally what I wanted to do, but I don't think we formally said send it to the licensing committee.

3157
04:07:02,437 --> 04:07:05,059
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because I section 22 it.

3158
04:07:05,460 --> 04:07:07,021
[SPEAKER_24]: But we're allowing for

3159
04:07:08,012 --> 04:07:21,782
[SPEAKER_24]: the exercise of this section to, um, temporary, temporary allotment for hoops and hope Mr. Griffith celebration harvest as it is presented to us.

3160
04:07:26,485 --> 04:07:27,926
[SPEAKER_22]: So the ordinance is not adopted.

3161
04:07:27,946 --> 04:07:32,930
[SPEAKER_22]: The pilot program is extended beyond the farmer's market to those other entities that were outlined in the cover letter by the mayor.

3162
04:07:33,145 --> 04:07:33,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

3163
04:07:33,345 --> 04:07:38,027
[SPEAKER_17]: If you read her cover letter, she actually asked us to almost send it to subcommittee and pretty much approved.

3164
04:07:38,147 --> 04:07:38,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

3165
04:07:38,487 --> 04:07:40,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to prove that.

3166
04:07:40,068 --> 04:07:53,832
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's, that's, so what we're doing is we voted while at the same time allowing, um, a, uh, broader use of it.

3167
04:07:55,113 --> 04:07:55,173
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh,

3168
04:07:55,549 --> 04:08:04,014
[SPEAKER_24]: beyond the farmer's market to the five or six, seven allowed events.

3169
04:08:07,456 --> 04:08:10,798
[SPEAKER_24]: And that was voted on affirmatively by this body.

3170
04:08:15,795 --> 04:08:18,078
[SPEAKER_24]: records of June 14th, Council Marks.

3171
04:08:18,118 --> 04:08:19,780
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you find them?

3172
04:08:20,842 --> 04:08:23,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve records of June 14th.

3173
04:08:24,206 --> 04:08:25,007
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3174
04:08:25,027 --> 04:08:25,788
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3175
04:08:26,509 --> 04:08:29,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Records of the meeting of June 28th will pass to Councilor Knight.

3176
04:08:29,834 --> 04:08:32,958
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I find those records to be in order after review and I move for approval.

3177
04:08:33,759 --> 04:08:35,481
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

3178
04:08:35,521 --> 04:08:36,222
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

3179
04:08:36,242 --> 04:08:36,863
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

3180
04:08:37,343 --> 04:08:38,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion carries.

3181
04:08:38,265 --> 04:08:39,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Meeting to adjourn.
