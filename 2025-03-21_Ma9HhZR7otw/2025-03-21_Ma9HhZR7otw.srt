1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,552
[SPEAKER_00]: First is the National Merit Semifinalist, Ian Adams.

2
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:25,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next commended student is Serena Doe.

3
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Sophia Mackay, McKay, McKay.

4
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Walker.

5
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,633
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a few people that aren't able to be with us this evening, and I'll just read their names.

6
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:20,434
[SPEAKER_00]: James Kostick.

7
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:29,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

8
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:36,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.

9
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: to all of our students.

10
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:59,155
[SPEAKER_02]: The next item on the agenda under suspension is one of a motion to look for the initial approval to move forward to apply for a grant to build a dog park in the city of Medford.

11
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:03,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the course of the last two years, there's been a lot of attention.

12
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,681
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been an advisory committee that's been established.

13
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:13,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been a search throughout the city to look at the appropriate locations.

14
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That field of locations was narrowed down to four.

15
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:26,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They were studied by Andrew Leonard of Leonard associates to make a recommendation as to which would be the best in our community.

16
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:38,007
[SPEAKER_02]: The spot that they have chosen is one at the site down by the river in back of the Andrew and

17
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:39,273
[SPEAKER_02]: school.

18
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:49,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Presently, if anybody walks there during the day, you will see that there are a number of dogs that are down there, some leashed and some unleashed.

19
00:02:51,136 --> 00:03:05,300
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be a facility that would actually be enclosed, and through the hard work of the members of the committee, they identified a source that we could apply to for funding from anywhere from $250,000 to $400,000 to build this.

20
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:13,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We put out a press release.

21
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it on the website, newspapers.

22
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:22,494
[SPEAKER_02]: We let everybody know the site that we were looking at.

23
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:28,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took comments online from anybody who cared to comment on the site.

24
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And overwhelmingly, people liked the site.

25
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:35,917
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was a positive thing to do here in the community.

26
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I'm going to call upon Mr. Leonard to just take us through the park.

27
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:44,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have an idea of what we're looking at.

28
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:50,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have been confused as to whether or not it's right behind the playground at the McGlynn school.

29
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not the case.

30
00:03:52,638 --> 00:04:05,662
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a site that was initially looked at, but as you go closer to the river behind a barrier of trees, there is a, an even more suitable location that has been chosen as the number one

31
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:12,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd ask Mr. Leonard if he would come forward and take us through.

32
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:19,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, Mr. Mayor, members of the board.

33
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:23,746
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my pleasure to be here tonight to describe the project that we are looking at.

34
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:31,531
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to begin, we need to get the, can we get these?

35
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:36,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's the ones just below that, Jim.

36
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,851
[SPEAKER_18]: The next one.

37
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:39,972
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

38
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Make it be just a second here.

39
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:25,500
[SPEAKER_18]: This always happens.

40
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:59,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so to give you an orientation of where the site is that we're proposing, we have here the Hormel Stadium, the McGlynn School, the playground for the McGlynn School, the windmill turbine, river is located all along this area, existing parking lot that's behind the school, community gardens,

41
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:07,786
[SPEAKER_18]: ball fields that are associated with the middle school and the large open space that is adjacent to the wind turbine is right in this area.

42
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:24,896
[SPEAKER_18]: The area that we're looking at for the potential dog park is on the other side of the heavy band of trees that is in this area here adjacent to or behind the parking lot and between the parking lot and the river.

43
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,057
[SPEAKER_18]: That area

44
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:34,138
[SPEAKER_18]: is shown here in a more detailed view.

45
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:40,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the existing parking lot, the community gardens, the large open spaces behind the school and the playground.

46
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,573
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the band of existing trees, it's located in the area.

47
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:54,870
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of open space in and around those trees between the existing path, the paved paths, that can be redeveloped.

48
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:03,960
[SPEAKER_18]: There's about six feet of grade drop across this area, so we would have to do some grading because the dog park needs to be, excuse me, the dog park needs to be relatively flat.

49
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,464
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's reasonably accommodated.

50
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:16,309
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a few trees we would need to remove, some that aren't very healthy and a few that we would need to remove just to give ourselves the area that we would need.

51
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,834
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a few regulatory issues that have to be addressed in addition to getting approval to look at this site.

52
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:27,237
[SPEAKER_18]: The entire site is within the riverfront zone as defined by the state.

53
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:35,309
[SPEAKER_18]: regulations, there's also a good portion of it within the buffer zone, the 100 foot buffer zone, so that would need to be addressed.

54
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:47,274
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had some initial conversations with staff and members of the Conservation Commission and it appears that this project would be viewed favorably by them.

55
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:55,817
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a number of elements that make this a desirable site in addition to just topography and location, vegetation and such.

56
00:07:56,497 --> 00:08:05,547
[SPEAKER_18]: There is water and electric power available at the community garden and at the ball field, so it's just a matter of extending utilities out into the site.

57
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:14,657
[SPEAKER_18]: There is existing drainage that was installed as part of the original park construction, so we already have drainage in place that can be repurposed for what we need in this area.

58
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:21,483
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is a good site, a fairly easy site to develop physically from a utility standpoint.

59
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:27,147
[SPEAKER_18]: It appears that the administrative and regulatory hurdles can be overcome.

60
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,369
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a good site from all those standpoints.

61
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Functionally, we have, let me just go back to the existing, to the,

62
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:38,453
[SPEAKER_18]: to the overall.

63
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:46,076
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have existing parking associated with the Hormel Stadium and the pathway that goes over.

64
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:49,577
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's parking available at many times.

65
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:57,519
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when the school is not in session, the parking lot adjacent to the community gardens and the ball fields would be available as well.

66
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,922
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as accessibility goes, we have accessibility at the, excuse me,

67
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:12,080
[SPEAKER_18]: We have accessible parking already in existence in this area here.

68
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:18,564
[SPEAKER_18]: The path system was designed to be accessible and it currently meets the criteria of ADA.

69
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,985
[SPEAKER_18]: There might be a couple of minor tweaks we would have to do.

70
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:24,667
[SPEAKER_18]: So from that standpoint, this is also an excellent site.

71
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,088
[SPEAKER_18]: So what goes into a dog park?

72
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:35,272
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so

73
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:42,126
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have separate areas for large and small dogs, which has been identified as a priority.

74
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:46,008
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to have shade structure or trees for shade.

75
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,489
[SPEAKER_18]: We have plenty of existing trees.

76
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,572
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be able to incorporate some trees within the dog park itself.

77
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:54,334
[SPEAKER_18]: We will provide a shade structure, a gazebo of some sort as well.

78
00:09:55,075 --> 00:10:01,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything needs to be accessible as far as ADA and Mass Architectural Access Board is concerned.

79
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Because this is a year-round facility, and of course we have

80
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:10,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Darkness at night and the time a lot of people want to be exercising their dogs, we need to provide lighting.

81
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:19,052
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to have a water supply for dog fountains, for cleaning, and also for an irrigation system that is used to rinse the area.

82
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:22,055
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll describe that in a little more detail later.

83
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:31,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Drainage system obviously needs to meet city and state regulations, and all the wetlands, floodplain, and riverfront zone needs to be met as well.

84
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:46,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so the existing site, this is the parking lot at the end of the school looking down toward our site.

85
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:52,244
[SPEAKER_18]: This is where the handicap parking is located and the pathway that goes down toward the site.

86
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:56,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Here you see again the pathway heading down toward the site, relatively flat, 5% grade or less.

87
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,027
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the two sites we're looking at.

88
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,608
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the large dog area.

89
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:13,712
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see that there's existing trees, both deciduous and evergreen, and a large, you know, sloping but relatively flat-ish grassed area that can be redeveloped.

90
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:25,237
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the small dog area down here at the bottom is, on the bottom right, is similar to the large dog area, just smaller again, and can also be developed.

91
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:30,932
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the plan that we've come up with for the park.

92
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:42,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Access, again, would be from the parking lot down the path, and you would come into the park, into the dog park at this location, where there would be a gated entrance.

93
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:52,372
[SPEAKER_18]: These are double gates, or sometimes they're called airlock gates, where you would open the gate, you'd come in, take your dog off the leash, then open the second gate to come into the dog park itself.

94
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:59,423
[SPEAKER_18]: overall area about a third of an acre, so about 150 by 80 feet or so.

95
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:05,389
[SPEAKER_18]: The primary surface of the dog park that we're considering at this time is called rice stone.

96
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,293
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a somewhat coarse material with grains about the size of rice.

97
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,877
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been successfully used in parks in Arlington, Cambridge,

98
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Peters Park in South Boston.

99
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:21,311
[SPEAKER_18]: It is the favored surface of the funding agency, the Standard Foundation, that we will be approaching for funding.

100
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:34,037
[SPEAKER_18]: It allows for urine to percolate through the irrigation system, can rinse the surface, and everything percolates down in and diffuses into the soil.

101
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:35,798
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a very safe and sanitary method.

102
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:57,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that surface is not a ADA compatible surface, particularly, you have to provide a surface path throughout the area that provides access to all the exits and any of the elements within the area, within the dog park, such as gazebo, canine agility, play structures, and the general facility within.

103
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:00,959
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a pathway system within the enclosed area.

104
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Entire thing, as I said, is fenced by five foot,

105
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:10,672
[SPEAKER_18]: five foot high chain link fence, black vinyl chain link fence that would enclose the entire area.

106
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:16,543
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, we would retain some existing trees within the area and provide a new gazebo structure.

107
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:28,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Then the small dog area, about a third the size of the major area, be located in the smaller open space, completely separate with its own airlock entry and a duplication of facilities.

108
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:35,647
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, you have agility elements, pathway, benches, shades from the surrounding trees.

109
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:46,250
[SPEAKER_18]: So an area where people can safely exercise and be with their smaller dogs and not have to worry about inappropriate interactions with large dogs.

110
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,872
[SPEAKER_18]: We would provide some new trees and plantings as part of this, as part of the project as well.

111
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:04,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a view looking into the large dog area from the main entrance.

112
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,259
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see the gazebo over on the side.

113
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,700
[SPEAKER_18]: In this area here, the shade structure.

114
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,242
[SPEAKER_18]: We often provide boulders for dogs to run around and jump on and jump off of.

115
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:25,429
[SPEAKER_18]: There was an existing tree that we would enclose with a tree well, which provides seating and shade, and then some additional agility structures, such as a step ramp.

116
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, we would have lighting along the area, new trees, benches, all along the pathway system.

117
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:45,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Small dog area is very similar, just essentially a smaller version of the big dog area, and has many of the same facilities and ideas.

118
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:51,854
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is just some visual elements to give you a sense of what we're talking about here.

119
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:59,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I've recently, within the last five years, developed two projects, one in Arlington and one in Somerville that you may be familiar with, New Washington Street.

120
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:03,889
[SPEAKER_18]: and the Arlington facility at Thorndike Park near Alewife Station.

121
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:09,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these pictures are from them, some are also pictures of other dog parks around the country.

122
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:13,056
[SPEAKER_18]: So this shows a typical gazebo with benches.

123
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,559
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the one within the Somerville facility at New Washington Street.

124
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,043
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the gated airlock entries that we're talking about.

125
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:25,066
[SPEAKER_18]: They're big enough to have a bench within them so you can sit down and have plenty of room to

126
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,697
[SPEAKER_18]: take your dog's leash off and put it on.

127
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:40,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the black vinyl chain link fencing is a very cost effective and secure method of enclosing the area and also relatively blends into the landscape because it allows for looking visual, looking through.

128
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:42,687
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the Arlington facility.

129
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:46,270
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the rice stone surface.

130
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,673
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fine to walk on, although again, not AD accessible.

131
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:52,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Dogs don't have any problem running on it.

132
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:57,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's a granular surface, it needs to be enclosed with an edging.

133
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,520
[SPEAKER_18]: We use recycled plastic materials.

134
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,783
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in each park, we provide a dog wash, dog watering area with fountain and drainage.

135
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:14,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually something like this can have a people fountain and a dog fountain, as well as providing a spigot for maintenance.

136
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:28,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Typically, various benches, lighting, dog valet with plastic bags in a place to dispose of feces, trash receptacles.

137
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:32,700
[SPEAKER_18]: And then canine agility elements.

138
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,361
[SPEAKER_18]: These are some of the ones we developed in Somerville.

139
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:45,048
[SPEAKER_18]: At that point there weren't a lot of things on the market yet that were park grade, but these were some ones that we developed using standard pipe.

140
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:53,917
[SPEAKER_18]: We had, we used curbing, reused curbing to make a ziggurat or climbing structure.

141
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:58,959
[SPEAKER_18]: On the right you can see a, now it's available, a commercial structure that's available.

142
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Rocks put in place and, you know, just anything you put out there, dogs will have fun playing on.

143
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:09,284
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's all about providing stuff that's fun for dogs and their owners.

144
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:17,407
[SPEAKER_18]: So if this goes ahead, this is what we're looking at for a general timeline.

145
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:18,328
[SPEAKER_18]: And this of course is,

146
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,373
[SPEAKER_18]: dependent on lots of different variables that are coming up.

147
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:34,644
[SPEAKER_18]: But we are in the October, November thing now where we are developing our schematic design and seeking approval, general approval from appropriate city authorities to go forward with our funding application.

148
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:44,489
[SPEAKER_18]: The Stanton Foundation, which is the organization that we'll be approaching for this funding, has got a new round of funding becoming available at the end of October.

149
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:51,672
[SPEAKER_18]: We would like to get our grant in as soon as possible to get onto their schedule for the next round of funding.

150
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:53,908
[SPEAKER_18]: projects that they may fund.

151
00:17:55,108 --> 00:18:04,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Provided we get favorable results from them, we would be proceeding in January and February with design development, further interaction with the

152
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:16,339
[SPEAKER_18]: city boards and groups that would be involved with approving the project with the eye of getting this project out to bid in spring of 2016 for construction next year.

153
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,783
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is what we would like to do if we, you know, if things proceed favorably at this point.

154
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:31,607
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the end of my presentation and I'll turn it back over to Mayor McLennan.

155
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:32,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you get the lights?

156
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

157
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:51,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the presentation.

158
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really done very well.

159
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a question around a couple of things.

160
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:01,887
[SPEAKER_04]: What would the percentage of the funding be, do you know, when you say that you would be putting the application in?

161
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:07,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Would they provide all of the funding for us?

162
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:10,808
[SPEAKER_18]: They typically- Mr. Lennon, could you get a little closer to the mic?

163
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:11,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

164
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:23,211
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that they typically, the Stanton Foundation typically looks for the entity that is applying for the grants to provide 10 to 15% of the project.

165
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,711
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of it is funded by Stanton.

166
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already have the 10 to 15%.

167
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:33,148
[SPEAKER_02]: which dates back to the Fast Lane 14 project here in the city.

168
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:39,294
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the lay down areas when they built all the bridges was the stadium at the parking lot at Horn Mountain.

169
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,537
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of mitigation, we received $60,000 for that.

170
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:50,625
[SPEAKER_02]: That was set aside for a dog park, so it's being used for the initial design and schematics and things.

171
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:58,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, that part I knew, that's why I was hoping that if we get the funding, they would cover for the rest of it and we wouldn't have any problem getting that.

172
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,574
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is the maintenance on that.

173
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:08,135
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your average cost on maintenance on something if we go ahead and do this?

174
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:13,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Typically, the maintenance is provided through whatever agency maintains the city's parks at the present time.

175
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:18,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of the Stanton Foundation grant includes a

176
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:27,059
[SPEAKER_18]: some money for both minor capital improvements and maintenance going forward for, I believe, a three year period.

177
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,165
[SPEAKER_18]: In Arlington, they provided $20,000 a year, I believe, for those first three years.

178
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:38,630
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if that's part of their current program, but that's what they did.

179
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:58,102
[SPEAKER_18]: What we did in Arlington is they actually hired a retired person who lived in the neighborhood who provided 10 to 12 hours a week of time during the summer season to actually do cleaning and policing of the park, as well as what was provided by the Parks Department.

180
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:11,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and do you know if within the three years, the $20,000, let's say, in that particular situation would have to be used up, the $20,000 would have to be used up in each and every year, or is it something that you could roll over a little bit?

181
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,086
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the answer to that question.

182
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:15,247
[SPEAKER_18]: We could find out what we've approached.

183
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:24,253
[SPEAKER_18]: They have been going through some changes in their structure of their funding, so we still need to pin down some details like that, but we certainly can get an answer to that question.

184
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

185
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:32,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the rules and regulations, would it be just like the regular rules of every park that we have?

186
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:50,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we just put up the signs and everybody abides by, you know, the children to make sure that our children aren't going into the park if they're not being supervised and make sure that if we have people walking to the dog park, because there is a lot of children in those areas, that they'll be leashed.

187
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know we do have situations where sometimes, unfortunately,

188
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,521
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't abide by the rules.

189
00:21:55,561 --> 00:22:02,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that's something that could be regulated a little bit more, if there's someone that we could have to regulate that a little bit more.

190
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:07,803
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a two-pronged thing.

191
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:17,973
[SPEAKER_18]: One is the fiscal design of signage and making sure it's visible, making sure that it's logical set up in terms of that.

192
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:25,381
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's also in terms of the community and the community groups that are involved with the parks themselves.

193
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:32,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually the rules for the park are posted clearly in the entrances, oftentimes in the parking area as well.

194
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:35,975
[SPEAKER_18]: But of course, you need to get the word out.

195
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:40,399
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what we found there is that the community groups that are behind the

196
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,282
[SPEAKER_18]: the dog park efforts.

197
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:48,304
[SPEAKER_18]: You have PAWS from Medford here as your group in Arlington.

198
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:51,066
[SPEAKER_18]: We have ADOG and there's a Somerville Dog Committee as well.

199
00:22:51,446 --> 00:23:01,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Each of those committees is involved with their members and most, you know, the greater percentage of dog owners in each community are members of these, can become members of these things.

200
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:05,034
[SPEAKER_18]: And they, through their newsletters and communications, really get the word out and

201
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:11,898
[SPEAKER_18]: provide some self-policing in terms of getting people to cooperate with that, that sort of thing.

202
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:17,502
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a double-primed effort, good design and good communications.

203
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks good.

204
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much and thank you everyone for your work.

205
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:20,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really wacky.

206
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:21,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Mayor.

207
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:23,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

208
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:26,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm thrilled to have this in front of us this evening.

209
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:29,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a beautiful big dog who's going to enjoy this.

210
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,972
[SPEAKER_14]: We've both been at both your other parks that you've designed.

211
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:36,561
[SPEAKER_14]: I find that the Somerville one is a little narrow.

212
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:38,844
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a function of the site.

213
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:40,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, and I understand that.

214
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Ellington one is newer.

215
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:50,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell that it was done after the Somerville one because the features for the dogs are a little upgraded.

216
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:54,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the Arlington Park was about two years after the Somerville one.

217
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:59,841
[SPEAKER_18]: The Somerville one was actually a community development block grant park and some Somerville money.

218
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Arlington was a Stanton Foundation.

219
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:08,087
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why Stanton, Arlington was a little bit different because we were working with the Stanton Foundation.

220
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:13,937
[SPEAKER_18]: requirements and their desired elements in there.

221
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:19,080
[SPEAKER_18]: But the Somerville one was a, yes, it is a very narrow park.

222
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,783
[SPEAKER_18]: If you haven't been there, it's only 40 to 60 feet wide and about 240 feet long.

223
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:29,126
[SPEAKER_18]: But that was a function of this tiny little piece of land that was repurposed.

224
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:31,427
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a great brownfields project because there was

225
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:34,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

226
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:35,529
[SPEAKER_18]: I digress.

227
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:45,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So my other point is that we're here tonight just out of a courtesy, really, so that way you can show us where you were thinking of putting it.

228
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:48,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason you're here is because it is so close to the schools.

229
00:24:49,034 --> 00:25:00,199
[SPEAKER_14]: But seeing the demonstration and how far they are away, I'm sure most people in the community that want this for their dogs are going to be very, very careful and understand that the schools are close by.

230
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,220
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have no problem with it.

231
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

232
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:11,423
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have to say, my dog doesn't like the stones as much as she likes the other elements, so just a little feedback.

233
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,224
[SPEAKER_14]: The texture is an issue, maybe, yes.

234
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:17,766
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not 100% that that would be the material.

235
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:19,726
[SPEAKER_18]: We use that as their preferred material.

236
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:22,187
[SPEAKER_18]: They do consider other ones, depending on the communities involved.

237
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:23,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just a little dog feedback.

238
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:28,992
[SPEAKER_14]: When he first gets in, it takes him quite a while to get used to the pebbles.

239
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:33,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I also was hoping to move this for approval with Mr. Skerry.

240
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:38,101
[SPEAKER_01]: On a motion to approve by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. DiBenedetto, Mr. Schapelli.

241
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of questions that have happened in the past.

242
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:50,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they're rectified, but being so close to playgrounds and structures, I know I work for Recreation Somerville and we have a few ball fields adjacent to a few dog parks.

243
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:58,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know some of the questions that happened in the past just to ease residents' minds, sometimes the smell of the urine from the dogs.

244
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,326
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a big issue.

245
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:12,157
[SPEAKER_18]: The irrigation system deals with that in a major way.

246
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:21,205
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's set up to run once a day, early in the morning, real early in the morning, 4 or 5 o'clock or something like that, and rinse the area completely.

247
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,288
[SPEAKER_18]: And especially with the rice stone surface,

248
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:37,936
[SPEAKER_18]: It completely dilutes and rinses that down into, even in the hot summer that we've had, there has been no issue with odor from either of the various parts I've been associated with that have this irrigation system to rinse.

249
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,397
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not been an issue.

250
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:45,782
[SPEAKER_18]: In terms of proximity to playgrounds, the Somerville one is isolated.

251
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:48,324
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not near any playground or park facility.

252
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:57,511
[SPEAKER_18]: But the Arlington one is right smack in the middle of one of the most highly used recreation areas in Arlington in terms of soccer, lacrosse.

253
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:05,777
[SPEAKER_18]: and all things that use grass, play fields, with no major issues that I've ever been aware of.

254
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:16,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Peters Park in Boston is immediately adjacent to a playground in a highly dense area, and that has a portion that's a dog park.

255
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:26,893
[SPEAKER_18]: The whole idea of these dog parks is to provide a safe area where dogs can be off leash and not be in a dangerous situation with people and children.

256
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:40,160
[SPEAKER_18]: And I feel that, especially in this location, where we're a good distance from the school, and shielded visually from it as well, I think that it offers an excellent location.

257
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:45,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the question in one of the other locations in Somerville is that you stoned us.

258
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the irrigation, was it?

259
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Washington Street.

260
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:52,788
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no irrigation system in the other one.

261
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:54,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and that's why that was an issue.

262
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,509
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why that's an issue.

263
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:56,570
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I just want to check.

264
00:27:57,291 --> 00:28:08,195
[SPEAKER_01]: The questions with the watershed and the flood lines or the water lines with the lake, that doesn't seem to be a big problem, something we'll push through.

265
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:13,397
[SPEAKER_18]: The dog park is approximately elevation 10, the average elevation 10 to 11.

266
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:20,200
[SPEAKER_18]: The national flood zone for zone A is five feet, so it's five feet above that, but not in the floodplain.

267
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,721
[SPEAKER_18]: We will have to meet all the regulations for

268
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:27,182
[SPEAKER_18]: conservation and riverfront zone.

269
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:42,105
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't meet that, I've done this before, both the Arlington Project, the two I'm working on in Dartmouth, the Greenfield Mass, are all within conservation zones and we've successfully obtained approval from the Conservation Commission.

270
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:50,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of the drainage system, it's actually an improvement over just the grass here in terms of the overall drainage.

271
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,447
[SPEAKER_18]: So it doesn't cause any additional floodwaters

272
00:28:55,395 --> 00:29:03,860
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we've had preliminary meetings with the conservation commission and DEP.

273
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,742
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dog person.

274
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:12,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Gabby loves to run and I don't, so it's really nice to finally have an area.

275
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,649
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't realize how big Carr Park is until you're chasing your dog around for 25 minutes.

276
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thank you very much.

277
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:20,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Mayor, thank you, Mr. Mayor.

278
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:21,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your presentation.

279
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:23,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think this is a great idea.

280
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I support it a hundred percent.

281
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm a dog lover and have a dog myself, so this is going to be great.

282
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be great.

283
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:30,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to try this out.

284
00:29:31,023 --> 00:29:32,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we should have a couple of quick questions.

285
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:34,566
[SPEAKER_06]: The irrigation system, is that automatic?

286
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that like go at a time?

287
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

288
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:41,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as the, you had mentioned, I try to make sure I didn't miss it.

289
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:43,773
[SPEAKER_06]: You had mentioned you're going to be removing trees.

290
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:53,045
[SPEAKER_18]: We would be removing, I think, plants, as I, we did have a new survey done, so this is an accurate survey based on existing trees that are there now.

291
00:29:53,525 --> 00:30:05,108
[SPEAKER_18]: We would be removing four white pines, a hackberry that are alive, and then a red maple that's another tree that's dying.

292
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:08,649
[SPEAKER_18]: And a couple of them we can probably transplant.

293
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:09,770
[SPEAKER_18]: They're small enough to transplant.

294
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,392
[SPEAKER_18]: They've done some recent new plantings in the area.

295
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:17,254
[SPEAKER_18]: And a couple of those, there's a willow we can probably move easily enough.

296
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,435
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we would be planting 1, 2, 3, 4.

297
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:25,378
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got 8 or 10 trees, new trees being planted.

298
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:28,840
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be at least replacing the ones that are being transplanted?

299
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

300
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,101
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I just want to make sure on that.

301
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:31,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

302
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:33,863
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be on the plus side by 3 or 4 to 1.

303
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:35,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

304
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's perfect.

305
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:36,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

306
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:44,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as the, uh, the construction piece goes, it says, uh, bidding and construction is, um, in the spring and summer.

307
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:47,498
[SPEAKER_06]: How long will it take to construct like as far as once you start?

308
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:53,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it's fairly straightforward, but it's still a three to four month project.

309
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:56,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Susie probably during the summer when

310
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:57,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids are not in school.

311
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:58,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that we were trying to do it.

312
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:04,012
[SPEAKER_18]: If everything lined up, that would be our best possible schedule to do it as much as possible in the summer.

313
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:04,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

314
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:05,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

315
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:05,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

316
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:07,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck on the motion.

317
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:08,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Skerry.

318
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:10,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Second by Mr. Benedetto.

319
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,396
[SPEAKER_02]: All those famous say aye.

320
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:12,156
[SPEAKER_02]: All the ayes have it.

321
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion is approved.

322
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Len.

323
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:15,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

324
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:15,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

325
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:16,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

326
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Next item is a report on not can protocol for public schools.

327
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:22,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Superintendent,

328
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:45,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, there are a number of issues associated with opiate use that we have been addressing in our schools and in our community and throughout the state.

329
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:55,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another issue that needs to have you involved so that you can give us some guidance as to the direction of the schools.

330
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:59,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight with us, we have our supervisor of health, Tony Vento.

331
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:13,685
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our supervisor of health education, Rachel Perry, and Penny Funioli, who is working on the city side in substance abuse as well, prevention.

332
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:21,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Narcan is a medication that reverses overdoses from heroin or other opiates.

333
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,613
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, our police department has been trained in the use of Narcan.

334
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:29,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Armstrong Ambulance personnel

335
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:32,455
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to administer this medication.

336
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:35,678
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally would call them if we went to an ambulance.

337
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:41,882
[SPEAKER_00]: The incidence of opiates or heroin used by students in our schools is very small.

338
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:50,188
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the possibility always exists that a student, a staff member, or a visitor to our schools could experience an overdose.

339
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:58,555
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the period from 2000 to 2015, there were zero deaths in Medford from opiates for individuals below the age of 20.

340
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:03,219
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest numbers occurred in the 20s, 30s, and 40s.

341
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:16,263
[SPEAKER_00]: 88% were males, while an immediate call to 911 is the approved Department of Public Health protocol, is a medical emergency that must receive a rapid response.

342
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:20,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And Narcan, in most instances, reverses the overdose.

343
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, should we train our nursing staff so that we can respond rapidly while we wait for 911 services to arrive?

344
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:29,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the discussion tonight.

345
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:38,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call up our supervisor, Tony, to talk to you a little bit about it and to answer any questions you might have.

346
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,821
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give you information on Narcan.

347
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:48,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to inform you about opiate use, about the possibilities of having our nursing staff prepared to administer it.

348
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:58,085
[SPEAKER_00]: If we elect to do so, it will take some time to put it in place, but tonight we're looking to see if you want us to move ahead with this type of training.

349
00:33:58,585 --> 00:33:59,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll turn it over to Tony.

350
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

351
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:07,613
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought that this was a good time to start the discussion about Narcan administration in our schools.

352
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:13,576
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're all familiar with all the media and the exposure that we're listening to.

353
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:16,997
[SPEAKER_16]: So we thought this was a good time to start providing some information.

354
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:26,921
[SPEAKER_16]: I did put together a packet for you, and I'm not going to go through every slide within it, but just thought I would mention a few key points about it.

355
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:37,892
[SPEAKER_16]: The packet was put together from a number of presentations and conferences that I attended and others attended on the issue of opioid abuse.

356
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:44,277
[SPEAKER_16]: So the key points, the adolescent brain isn't fully developed until about the age 24.

357
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:51,743
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that substance abuse is damaging to the developing brain and some of these changes appear to be irreversible.

358
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,407
[SPEAKER_16]: The incomplete or immature brain development is demonstrated by

359
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,576
[SPEAKER_16]: teenagers in many different behaviors.

360
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:04,799
[SPEAKER_16]: And they usually are risky, impulsive behaviors.

361
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,283
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's no consideration or little consideration of consequences by students of this age.

362
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:17,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Alcohol use by younger teens does predispose their brain to addiction.

363
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:27,933
[SPEAKER_16]: So we know that the younger a student starts drinking and drinking regularly, there is a predisposition to addiction.

364
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,843
[SPEAKER_16]: and addictive behaviors.

365
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:35,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Some key points about opioids and opioids.

366
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:50,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Opioids are present in the compounds found in opium, and opioids are manufactured as semi-synthetic substances such as heroin or synthetic substances such as methadone.

367
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,822
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that the opioid sales, deaths, and substance abuse treatment

368
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Admissions have increased epidemically since 1999.

369
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:03,944
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many risk factors.

370
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:09,208
[SPEAKER_16]: They're identified in your packet to misuse, addiction, and overdose.

371
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:18,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Abuse usually starts with a prescription for a pain reliever given in the case of surgery or injury.

372
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:27,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Oftentimes the prescription will run out or is not renewed and then the person starts looking for obtaining it in other

373
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,796
[SPEAKER_16]: ways, most often from a friend or a relative.

374
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:43,620
[SPEAKER_16]: For those with addiction problems, this will eventually lead to a heroin use because heroin is very cheap compared to the prescription drugs.

375
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:52,683
[SPEAKER_16]: So as Superintendent Belson mentioned, Narcan or Naloxone is an opioid antagonist.

376
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:53,543
[SPEAKER_16]: It binds to

377
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:59,396
[SPEAKER_16]: key receptors in your brain to reverse the effects of the opioids.

378
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:03,318
[SPEAKER_16]: And thus it saves life by reversing respiratory depression.

379
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:12,482
[SPEAKER_16]: It's administered by a nasal spray and to those who are suspected of being in an overdose situation.

380
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:20,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And 911 is always activated prior to the administration of the spray and rescue breathing is also initiated.

381
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:25,452
[SPEAKER_16]: It does save lives and it can be a first step towards recovery for many people.

382
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:35,715
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now we're investigating the feasibility, we're collecting information, we're monitoring the situation amongst our students.

383
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:46,918
[SPEAKER_16]: We are aware from the communities that care survey that the prime drugs of choice in the community for our students are alcohol and marijuana.

384
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:59,016
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know our instance of opioid abuse is low in the student population, but we do recognize that this can be a life-saving medication.

385
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:10,565
[SPEAKER_16]: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the district attorney's offices are encouraging school nurses to be trained to administer.

386
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:18,671
[SPEAKER_16]: and there are many resources for training and free training for school nurses in the area.

387
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,133
[SPEAKER_16]: We estimated startup costs to be about $1,500.

388
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:28,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Mayor, any questions?

389
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:32,139
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, I'd like to say a few words.

390
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we all know that we're dealing with an epidemic.

391
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:43,116
[SPEAKER_02]: as it relates to this issue, and that is known throughout not only this community in the Commonwealth, but throughout this nation.

392
00:38:43,957 --> 00:39:04,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And many people who suffer from substance use disorder suffer sometimes not because of their own doing, but because of injuries that they have received during high school athletics, because of a bad choice that may have been made at one time, and end up in a battle for their life.

393
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to be there to do everything that we can to try and support, and to educate, and to prevent, and to intervene, and to support in this whole terrible crisis.

394
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've seen too many of our younger population, not only in this community, but in so many surrounding communities who have been taken for one reason or another, related to a substance use disorder.

395
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Now can we know,

396
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:56,523
[SPEAKER_02]: save their lives and give us an opportunity with all of the good work that's being done by the Attorney General's Office, by the Governor's Office, in starting to try and put in new regulations so that people take a stronger look at how they can help and that we take stronger action to help.

397
00:39:57,444 --> 00:40:05,390
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time, people who had this use disorder were referred to as the junkie down the street.

398
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:08,447
[SPEAKER_02]: or somebody who is a troubled person.

399
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:10,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So we stay away from that family.

400
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we found out in this community is that people are better educated about what's happening around this issue and packed this auditorium one night to talk about friends that they had lost, what the resources that are needed, how there has to be changes with the insurances and the coverages, how they have to be more beds to support and to help

401
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:39,704
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the people who suffer from substance use disorder.

402
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for the medical personnel, the nurses at the school, I just want to go on record.

403
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:53,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they should administer E-Carry Narcan because for many.

404
00:40:53,511 --> 00:41:03,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a life saving drug and it's a way for us to help them and try and save them and give them the support to carry on.

405
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

406
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:09,103
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree wholeheartedly.

407
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:12,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, this is something that has touched my family directly.

408
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:14,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost my brother 14 years ago.

409
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:24,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and he was a heroin addict for a very long time before he was, um, he sustained very good life the last four years of his life on methadone.

410
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:33,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, we were glad to have him back because you lose, you lose, you lose that family member to the disease.

411
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:33,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And then,

412
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:37,379
[SPEAKER_14]: My family was lucky enough to have him back until he passed away.

413
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:44,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So I am very glad that as a school system, that we are being proactive.

414
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:51,728
[SPEAKER_14]: And that could save lives of not only our children, anyone in our school system, anyone we see.

415
00:41:53,088 --> 00:42:01,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not wait for something to happen to someone's child, to someone's brother, to someone's daughter, to someone's sister, to someone's wife, to someone's husband.

416
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:08,347
[SPEAKER_14]: best people on the front line trained and let them carry Narcan.

417
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I am trained and I carry Narcan.

418
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:16,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I pulled it out of my bag just to show people in case anybody wanted to see what it looked like this evening.

419
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:28,498
[SPEAKER_14]: The point that you didn't say that really stuck with me when I read through every bit of your literature, Tony, was addiction starts for 67% of people between the ages of 12 and 17.

420
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:37,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Addiction starts from junior high to high school.

421
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:39,846
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when this starts.

422
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can get them then, we won't lose them.

423
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,028
[SPEAKER_14]: We won't lose our MEDFED children.

424
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:52,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I will not attend wakes from friends and family that I know for children again, like we were last year.

425
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:54,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to ever do that again.

426
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:57,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you to the superintendent.

427
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you to you.

428
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:01,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see this implemented immediately, and I

429
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:11,653
[SPEAKER_14]: would like to, um, propose that we work, we move this forward this evening and, um, approve this on the motion of this is the better debt.

[SPEAKER_04]: group of people that were all together the last time from around the city and more people come and join us to see where we are what we can do and where we could where we could go and again the feedback has always been it's just wonderful to hear when we're going forward because we do want to have and we want to help everyone who is around

528
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:29,875

529
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:40,537

00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Report of committees, none.

568
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:37,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Community participation, none.

569
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Report, the update report on the substance abuse- Mr. Mann.

570
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And education program, Mr- May I move for suspension of the rules?

571
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,701
[SPEAKER_06]: We're under suspension.

572
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:50,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of resolutions if I may.

573
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:50,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

574
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:51,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Falco.

575
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:53,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

576
00:45:53,593 --> 00:46:07,782
[SPEAKER_06]: First one is, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee extends its congratulations to Mayor McGlynn and his team for outstanding dedication ceremony in the memory of Crystal Campbell, Martin Richard, Lindsay Liu, and Officer Sean Collier.

577
00:46:08,422 --> 00:46:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: The event at the East Garden will be a significant memorial in celebration of the lives, the courage of the survivors, the heroism of the first responders and the law enforcement officers, the skill of our medical teams, and the commitment of all our affected communities to peace and justice.

578
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:27,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for the event yesterday and for the dedication of the Peace Garden.

579
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very successful.

580
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:28,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

581
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of volunteers did a great job in putting together a great ceremony.

582
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,389
[SPEAKER_02]: On that motion, all in favor say aye.

583
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:33,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mayor.

586
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Resolutions adopted.

587
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:36,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Falco.

588
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of additional resolutions.

589
00:46:39,474 --> 00:46:45,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee congratulate Mayor McGlynn and Sheila McGlynn on the birth of their granddaughter, Nora Cushing Brady.

590
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Nora is the daughter of Kathleen and Bill Brady.

591
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:49,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

592
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:50,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

593
00:46:50,395 --> 00:46:52,596
[SPEAKER_02]: On that motion, we're all very excited.

594
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Nora was Sheila's great-grandmother from Ireland.

595
00:46:56,857 --> 00:47:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cushing, middle name, is where Nora's grandparents, great-grandparents, and great-great-grandparents, along with all of their aunts and great-aunts grew up on Cushing Street in Medford.

596
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:12,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

597
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where Cushing comes from.

598
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

599
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:16,224
[SPEAKER_02]: On that motion, all those in favor say aye.

600
00:47:16,244 --> 00:47:16,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

601
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:16,865
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed, no.

602
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:17,485
[SPEAKER_02]: The ayes have it.

603
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mayor, no more for me.

604
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:31,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, here is all that the Medford school committee extended its congratulations to Bob and Paula Vanderclude on the occasion of the 35th wedding anniversary.

605
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:35,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Best wishes and congratulations on that motion.

606
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:37,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this.

607
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:38,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

608
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:40,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion is approved.

609
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:43,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Mayor.

610
00:47:50,481 --> 00:48:03,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to congratulate our colleague, Robert Eminskieri, on his retirement, 33 years of commitment to the state of Massachusetts.

611
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,085
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your job title?

612
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:08,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Bureau of Special Investigations, Senior Investigator.

613
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:10,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Bureau of Investigations?

614
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:11,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Special Investigations.

615
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:13,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a Senior Investigator.

616
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:21,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that a lot of people are in jail now because of this.

617
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his choice.

618
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:27,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for a fact, I was on Beacon Hill when he started.

619
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:31,043
[SPEAKER_02]: He has recovered a lot of money for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

620
00:48:31,063 --> 00:48:34,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all congratulate you, Bob, on 33 great years.

621
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:35,485
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the favors say aye.

622
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,485
[SPEAKER_02]: All the ayes have it.

623
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,626
[SPEAKER_02]: The resolution is adopted.

624
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:41,867
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of them.

625
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:42,667
[SPEAKER_00]: What about substance abuse?

626
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Under, excuse me one second, under communications there's none, negotiations there are none.

627
00:48:50,597 --> 00:49:08,625
[SPEAKER_02]: On the back, resolution submitted by the Medford School Committee that is expressed with sincere condolences to the family of Aldo Scarpelli, Mr. Scarpelli was the father, a school committee member, George Scarpelli, and the Medford public school teacher, Lisa Seary.

628
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:14,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And be it resolved the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Sally Zampel,

629
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:23,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Mrs. Zampel was a secretary to the superintendent for over 20 years, and also the mother of retired athletic director Ron Zampel.

630
00:49:24,782 --> 00:49:30,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And on behalf of all the members of the community, we extend our condolences to both families.

631
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you knew Aldo, Aldo was just a great guy.

632
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a lot of energy, very friendly, very welcoming, and he was a great part of the history of this city.

633
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,202
[SPEAKER_02]: during the time that he moved here from Italy.

634
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:54,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sally Ziempell, I think everybody knew Sally, a very pleasant lady, who did a good job.

635
00:49:54,107 --> 00:50:02,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy working for any superintendent, with the daily pressures and everything that goes on up there.

636
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:05,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, a great family.

637
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:09,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is so nice to see that the children

638
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:15,515
[SPEAKER_02]: also have given back so much to the community, and that starts from the parents.

639
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:18,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd ask that we all rise for a moment of silence.

640
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:35,010
[SPEAKER_02]: On those motions, I'll close on those, yeah?

641
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:36,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the I7 resolutions, we're done.

642
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:39,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Schiappelli.

643
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:47,422
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, publicly, I just want to, representing my family, I just want to publicly thank this community.

644
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:50,644
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know why Medford's a great place to live.

645
00:50:51,404 --> 00:51:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the toughest time in my life, my family's life, my colleagues and friends and leaders of this community really stepped up.

646
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:06,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And where my mother's going through such a hard time and how hard my father fought.

647
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:11,074
[SPEAKER_01]: and the way that everybody surrounded her and the rest of our family.

648
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:12,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't thank everybody enough.

649
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:18,617
[SPEAKER_01]: For my colleagues, missing a lot of meetings last few weeks, and the superintendent keeping me apprised of what's going on.

650
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:25,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And with your leadership and your support, Mr. Mayor, I think that this is what makes Method great.

651
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:34,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's the toughest thing that I've had to deal with in my life, losing my best friend and my father, but having everybody around and just giving

652
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:41,057
[SPEAKER_01]: just a word or a hug or just this card.

653
00:51:41,437 --> 00:51:42,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant so much to us.

654
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:45,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, publicly, I just want to thank everybody.

655
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:50,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And words can't describe what you've done for us.

656
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

657
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And best to your mom, because she's a doll, and everybody loves your mom.

658
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:57,502
[SPEAKER_02]: She does.

659
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:57,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

660
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:19,799
Did you steal my agenda?

661
00:52:19,879 --> 00:52:22,901
I guess we're done.

662
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:28,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Update report on substance abuse prevention and education programs, Mr. Superintendent.

663
00:52:28,383 --> 00:52:37,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mayor, members of the committee, the next report is a more comprehensive look at our substance abuse prevention and education programs.

664
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:39,108
[SPEAKER_00]: With us tonight, we have.

665
00:52:39,898 --> 00:52:42,739
[SPEAKER_00]: from the city's offices and the regional office.

666
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:55,942
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tony Bento, our supervisor of health services, Rachel Perry, our supervisor of health education, Jeff Lappin, our director of clinical services, and other members of our overall staff who contribute to this area.

667
00:52:55,982 --> 00:53:07,785
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Metro Public Schools, working together with community and regional partners, we offer significant substance abuse prevention and education services to students and their families.

668
00:53:08,883 --> 00:53:17,929
[SPEAKER_00]: The update report is offered to provide you with the latest information on the various programs and services that are in place and are emergent in our community.

669
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:28,856
[SPEAKER_00]: This report is intended to inform you regarding what we know about the behaviors and incidents of students in our community and schools, and what we're doing to prevent and respond to substance abuse.

670
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:35,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to call up our individuals and have them give you some detailed information.

671
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:42,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have attached information that will allow you to follow along as they reference it in their presentation.

672
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:49,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll call up Penny and Rachel, Jeff, Tony to begin the process.

673
00:53:50,572 --> 00:53:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to recognize Rich Raymond is here from Armstrong Ambulance too, who's been very involved with many of the health issues here in our community.

674
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:04,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to introduce Penny as the new director of the program that we have established in the community.

675
00:54:06,665 --> 00:54:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: A special office that will work on prevention, intervention, and support from beginning to end.

676
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:24,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, when the job was advertised, there were about 30 odd people who applied for the job.

677
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to tell you.

678
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:36,020
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the last ten that we looked at in an interview had tremendous experience and insight.

679
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:43,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we had more money, that office would have three or four people in it right now, because everybody had a specialty that they dealt in.

680
00:54:44,442 --> 00:54:46,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the picture of the whole problem.

681
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:54,944
[SPEAKER_02]: But Penny has a lot of background in the area, has done a lot of research, and we wish her well in what is a very tough assignment.

682
00:54:56,673 --> 00:55:06,761
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recognize our physician out there, Dr. Kristen Goodell, who advises our health staff and does a good job keeping us informed of pediatric practice in the community.

683
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have provided a few different resources to kind of keep you to look over while we're talking.

684
00:55:19,991 --> 00:55:24,775
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of an overall picture of opioid use in the community, I, too,

685
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:28,907
[SPEAKER_05]: data collection here specifically in Medford.

686
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The state has their own set of data that they take time to match and do all kinds of different epidemiological ways to make it what it is.

687
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:48,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Their numbers don't necessarily match our numbers because I'm just going through our cold records and finding what I see is

688
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:53,131
[SPEAKER_05]: a pending death record that then shows a toxicology report.

689
00:55:53,471 --> 00:56:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a number of pending records that are still out there, but what I know definitively is I know the substance that was in that person's system at the time of the toxicology report, and that's what these records are based on for the death record section of this report.

690
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:17,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that between 2010 and 2015, and that's only reporting a portion of 2015, that we had 48 overdoses in a matter of those six years.

691
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:22,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And the predominantly 2012 and 2014 were our highest number of cases, with 13 in each year.

692
00:56:34,939 --> 00:56:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that number going up specifically in 2014, we believe because of an increase of fentanyl in the product.

693
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:43,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Fentanyl is

694
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes 100 to 80% times more powerful than normal heroin.

695
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:53,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we are seeing these numbers increase over time.

696
00:56:53,926 --> 00:57:05,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that come, you know, if I go back in another couple months and I look at those records, there will be more numbers for 2014 and there will be obviously numbers for 2015 that will increase.

697
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:10,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a slower process to find out this information.

698
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting this data does take time.

699
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:14,333
[SPEAKER_05]: The state themselves takes a long time to turn the data around.

700
00:57:14,373 --> 00:57:20,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the commissioner of DPH is really interested in turning these numbers around much faster.

701
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's hopeful.

702
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:29,437
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I did find though here with our death records is that the age of death seems to be about

703
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:36,061
[SPEAKER_05]: the most numbers of people are between 30 and 40 years old, in their 30s to 40s.

704
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really 30 to 50 years old, right, that span of 20 years.

705
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:44,026
[SPEAKER_05]: We see these high numbers, 13 in their 30s, 17 in their 40s.

706
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:57,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we think about that, we're thinking maybe these people were longer term drug users, their bodies have broken down, but then again too, like I said, the product has changed, so that's another thing to be considerate of.

707
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:07,956
[SPEAKER_05]: When I did further analysis, you find that 88% were males, 13% were females, and 100% were white, Caucasian.

708
00:58:08,857 --> 00:58:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did even further analysis.

709
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,281
[SPEAKER_05]: On the death record, it states what their jobs were.

710
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:25,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went through, and in a broad category of tradespersons, anything from an electrician to a carpenter, I found that in Medford specifically, 44% were tradespersons.

711
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So thinking about that, that's a tool that I'll think about when we're talking about outreach and where we can target some of our efforts, maybe reaching out to local unions to find out what kind of EPA program they have, what kind of ways that we can work with them.

712
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:48,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm working on that both here locally and then on our regional grant that we have with our six communities that we've been working with.

713
00:58:49,106 --> 00:59:10,160
[SPEAKER_05]: When I looked at police records, and police records have been, they have made a huge effort in the last year to take more detailed records of overdoses and to pull the medical, because when it comes in, the call might say it's a medical person down, but it might not say specifically overdose.

714
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've done a good job.

715
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:20,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Officer Benoit and I have been working together to pull those different records together and try and triangulate, you know, who in fact was an opioid-related death.

716
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:22,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, overdose.

717
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:24,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are non-fatal and there are some fatal.

718
00:59:24,704 --> 00:59:27,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have 40 non-fatal overdoses in 2014.

719
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:27,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, in 2015.

720
00:59:27,745 --> 00:59:29,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's January until September 30th this year.

721
00:59:38,478 --> 00:59:51,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Six of those, six were deaths, four were already passed away prior to the officers arriving at the scene, so there would have not been any life-saving measures that they could have done.

722
00:59:51,432 --> 00:59:57,699
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 of those in particular cases, it was stated clearly that Narcan was used, and there were a number of cases where it was uncontrolled.

723
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:04,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't stated by the officer in the report, so I had to be very careful with how I report that.

724
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:08,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I found here that I find very interesting is I have different demographic numbers.

725
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:12,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more females in Medford that are overdosing, but not dying.

726
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:16,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, there is a large female population that needs to be addressed.

727
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:19,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have

728
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:24,853
[SPEAKER_05]: a much younger population in 2015 that are overdosing.

729
01:00:25,313 --> 01:00:30,141
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have here at the bottom left hand corner you can see 20 to 25 year olds, there were 10, 26 to 30 year olds, there were 12.

730
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:43,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, that says that there's either a shift from the death records that I can look at, which are archived data, versus what's really happening right now on the ground.

731
01:00:44,049 --> 01:00:45,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have a younger population using.

732
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, this new program that I was using, it cut off, but there was one 18-year-old.

733
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:52,815
[SPEAKER_05]: That 18-year-old was from Somerville, though.

734
01:00:53,156 --> 01:00:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that that matters, but there was only one 18-year-old in this number.

735
01:00:56,618 --> 01:01:06,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I found that in looking at it by month, May, for some reason, had an enormous amount of overdose calls come in.

736
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were 12 in May alone.

737
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can see on this chart, they're numbered for you so you can see how many there were.

738
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:17,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to be taking up from August and September.

739
01:01:17,203 --> 01:01:18,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going up as well.

740
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:21,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So there could be a number of reasons.

741
01:01:21,604 --> 01:01:24,765
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a batch out on the street that's really dangerous.

742
01:01:27,045 --> 01:01:28,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be other reasons.

743
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:42,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're looking at that, and as we continue to further analyze, as I get more and more meshed into this position and I work more closely with the police and with Armstrong Ambulance, we'll be able to start looking at locations in the city that might be at high risk and so on and so forth.

744
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:45,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's as far as the overdose stuff.

745
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I can stop there and answer any questions before I move on to the community care survey.

746
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one question, Mr. Mayor.

747
01:01:55,122 --> 01:01:58,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that when we had that summit with everyone, I thought that was very informative.

748
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,289
[SPEAKER_01]: But have things changed?

749
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:05,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we talked about the average age was much older at the time.

750
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:09,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I said, the death records is what I had at that time to definitively speak to.

751
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:22,445
[SPEAKER_05]: But over the course of the last year, Chief Sacco and a number of the administrative staff have been really working with the officers on the street to make sure that they're reporting thoroughly.

752
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:27,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And the increase in that reporting is showing more information about the demographics that we're seeing.

753
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,891
[SPEAKER_05]: on the non-fatal side.

754
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're talking about people that are overdosing and dying, we're talking that there is an older population.

755
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:42,157
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're talking about people who are not passing away but are overdosing, I'm seeing a younger population.

756
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:48,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can move on to the next piece, and there's a packet for you.

757
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:49,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a community care

758
01:02:49,732 --> 01:03:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to remind everyone that our community care survey, we ensure validity by eliminating any exaggerated surveys, any exaggeration in drug use and or antisocial behavior.

759
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:11,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We eliminate surveys where the person reports fictitious use of a specific drug.

760
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to tell you what that drug is.

761
01:03:14,012 --> 01:03:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a secret on the survey.

762
01:03:16,533 --> 01:03:21,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also eliminate anything that's logically inconsistent patterns of drug use.

763
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:27,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So they say they've never drank a drink in their lifetime, but they've drank six in the last 30 days.

764
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to eliminate that survey, right?

765
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:34,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use a professional statistician to do this work.

766
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:37,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that we just pop into a survey monkey.

767
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:53,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're looking at this report, I always provide the risk and protective factors, and I'd love to go over that some other time, but I think tonight I just want to just say out loud that really our protective factors are steady and strong, the same as they were two years ago in 2013.

768
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:58,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we've definitely seen something that I'm still significantly proud of.

769
01:04:00,725 --> 01:04:10,609
[SPEAKER_05]: low parental monitoring, and we're seeing it continue to rise so that parental monitoring is increasing, and that's a really, it's excellent, and we're seeing that in our numbers, I believe.

770
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:17,252
[SPEAKER_05]: If we move on to the next page, you'll see that this is just a lifetime versus 30-day use.

771
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:20,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Lifetime is ever having had a sip of alcohol, ever trying marijuana.

772
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:27,257
[SPEAKER_05]: 30-day use is having had a sip of alcohol or tried marijuana within the last 30 days.

773
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:31,719
[SPEAKER_05]: That is current use, that is a better indicator of what our issues are.

774
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Experimentation versus, you know, frequent use is what we're talking about.

775
01:04:37,463 --> 01:04:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And our numbers are, they're very low for the middle school.

776
01:04:41,346 --> 01:04:44,127
[SPEAKER_05]: The high school, the numbers are there what they are.

777
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:51,112
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would continue on to the next page though, and by the way, I think these numbers are lower, 100% across the board.

778
01:04:53,207 --> 01:04:56,628
[SPEAKER_05]: lower from 2013, much lower from 2011.

779
01:04:56,928 --> 01:04:58,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a chart that will go over that.

780
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I am concerned about is, on the following page, it's by grade.

781
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:16,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our 12th graders, we're seeing higher lifetime use in alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine than what's the US norm.

782
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:19,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we need to keep an eye out on.

783
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the same regard,

784
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:27,512
[SPEAKER_05]: For our 30-day use, we're seeing higher numbers than the U.S.

785
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:27,812
[SPEAKER_05]: norm.

786
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:39,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So while our overall numbers are lower, we do have high numbers in our senior, and then for marijuana, junior and seniors are using, were using marijuana at a higher rate than the U.S.

787
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:41,027
[SPEAKER_05]: norm for 12th grade.

788
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:48,440
[SPEAKER_05]: What is really nice to see, though, is that across the board, the middle school numbers are lower.

789
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle school numbers are lower for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, and our 9th and 10th graders have really low use.

790
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So those numbers of the 9th and 10th graders are keeping our numbers much lower.

791
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:01,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a great thing.

792
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:11,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that the prevention that we're doing, that the middle school is working on, and that they're coming into the high school with lower uses or rates of use.

793
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're excited about that.

794
01:06:12,978 --> 01:06:15,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you were to go to the next page, I've given you just a scheme of

795
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:20,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire lifetime of this survey has been taken since 2005.

796
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:26,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see for the middle school, the numbers have drastically dropped across the board.

797
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:28,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very excited about that.

798
01:06:28,745 --> 01:06:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the high school, everything has also declined year after year.

799
01:06:34,148 --> 01:06:35,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to say that in

800
01:06:37,346 --> 01:06:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Regards to the high school and opioid use, Eileen DeBattista was a great mentor to me when I first started working here.

801
01:06:48,068 --> 01:07:02,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that she impressed upon me is that when in 2000 to 2003, when there was a major Oxycontin epidemic here in Medford, it was a task force came together and started to address these issues.

802
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:04,572
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked on policy, that policy is still

803
01:07:05,092 --> 01:07:08,776
[SPEAKER_05]: the policy that's in the state DOE drug and alcohol policy.

804
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:09,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It still sits there.

805
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:18,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they worked on building the capacity to write for the Drug-Free Communities Grant, which we've exhausted for our 10 years.

806
01:07:18,746 --> 01:07:25,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're seeing those numbers go down because of that original first step of organizing and getting there.

807
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:37,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the further, as we continue to maintain this work and monitor it and really do what's new and innovative, we're going to continue to do great professional work in this city.

808
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:40,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I really have to say about the current numbers.

809
01:07:40,565 --> 01:07:42,326
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any questions.

810
01:07:44,067 --> 01:07:44,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Cugno.

811
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:46,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

812
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:50,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for the wonderful and hard work that you've all put in.

813
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at, I guess the,

814
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:59,580
[SPEAKER_04]: agenda of what's going on through the grades.

815
01:08:00,421 --> 01:08:07,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, this is where what comes from here and goes into the classes.

816
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:09,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the important part for me.

817
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:12,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do the grants do that go into the classroom?

818
01:08:12,409 --> 01:08:15,171
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get what you're doing into the classrooms?

819
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:19,734
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get what you're doing into homes?

820
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:24,918
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get everything that you're so enthusiastic and excited and had work?

821
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,819
[SPEAKER_04]: has put into this, how do we get it out there?

822
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,039
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we educate our students?

823
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we educate our parents?

824
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:31,780
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get it out there?

825
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And these pamphlets and these booklets, they're wonderful.

826
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also know that as a parent, we get them at home, and they are very educational, but we're so busy.

827
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So hands-on is what we need.

828
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:51,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And these agendas that I'm looking through are really important, and that's what we need to get out there.

829
01:08:51,825 --> 01:08:53,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's important that

830
01:08:53,878 --> 01:08:57,820
[SPEAKER_04]: all this work that you've all done is recognized.

831
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, for me, is the really important part of this puzzle.

832
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:06,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could go over this, I would really appreciate it.

833
01:09:08,766 --> 01:09:09,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

834
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:12,088
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to speak a little bit about the Michigan model.

835
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked about this back in the spring.

836
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:19,692
[SPEAKER_13]: The Michigan model is a skills-based health curriculum that we're looking to use from kindergarten through 12th grade.

837
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:23,275
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in the third year of using the Michigan model at the high school.

838
01:09:23,555 --> 01:09:26,417
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also using it this year with vocational and the Curtis Tops.

839
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're using it across those three as well.

840
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:34,360
[SPEAKER_13]: In the middle schools, we piloted the Michigan model last year.

841
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,521
[SPEAKER_13]: So this year is really the first full year that we've been using it.

842
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:45,484
[SPEAKER_13]: And we did a lot of work over the summer breaking down the Michigan model, looking at the lessons which you should have in your packet for sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.

843
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:49,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And those lessons are taught by guidance as well as PE staff.

844
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

845
01:09:51,607 --> 01:10:00,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we'll continue to do is look at the Community Care Survey for the high school and for the middle schools, continue to look at that curriculum and see, do we need to add things?

846
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need to delete things?

847
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Because things are changing, so we'll be doing that as well.

848
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:14,634
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'd also like to do is to make sure that we have all that information on our website so that parents can go on and see, all right, this is what my child is doing in health class.

849
01:10:14,654 --> 01:10:15,835
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the things that they are learning.

850
01:10:16,985 --> 01:10:25,791
[SPEAKER_13]: For elementary schools, we have just purchased the Michigan model, and we are piloting that at the kindergarten in the McGlynn Elementary School.

851
01:10:26,251 --> 01:10:40,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I am in the process of putting a team together to pilot the Michigan model from first to fifth grade across the elementaries, and we're planning to roll that out this year with the hopes of really being able to start the Michigan model full force in the elementaries next year.

852
01:10:40,897 --> 01:10:43,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you've piloted at the McGlynn?

853
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:46,620
[SPEAKER_13]: We're piloting at the kindergarten in the McGlynn right now.

854
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

855
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're putting a team together to pilot across all elementaries from 1st to 5th grade.

856
01:10:52,923 --> 01:11:00,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so basically everyone will end up having it from 1st through 5th, except for... Well, from kindergarten through 5th.

857
01:11:00,206 --> 01:11:03,408
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go through all the elementaries, but right now it's just at the McGlynn.

858
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:04,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

859
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:06,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know when... Is it going to be this year?

860
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, this year.

861
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:21,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a lot of work, and I totally understand that, but it's not going to be successful if we don't get it into the classrooms, and it's not going to be successful if our parents don't know about it.

862
01:11:21,438 --> 01:11:27,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the flip side of this is, what do you want the parents to do on the flip side of this?

863
01:11:27,623 --> 01:11:35,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're going to be teaching it in the classrooms, you're going to make it more aware to the students, but what is it as parents who want to put feedback into this?

864
01:11:35,888 --> 01:11:37,249
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you expecting us to do?

865
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:49,257
[SPEAKER_13]: For the middle school curriculum, there is a form that goes home that explains to parents what's being taught so parents are aware of what's going on in the health classroom.

866
01:11:51,670 --> 01:12:04,919
[SPEAKER_17]: The kindergarten also has the letter that went home, and they're working on maybe a parents back to school night to discuss some of the options and kind of get a better understanding of how that model will help support the students and their health.

867
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:05,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

868
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:17,147
[SPEAKER_13]: We were also approached by Michael Skorka of the GSA, and we're looking to put together parent forums this year as well to have parents come in and ask questions.

869
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,148
[SPEAKER_13]: That way we can share this information with them as well.

870
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful, and I guess I'm really looking to what is, technically I know it's not under our preview, but how do we connect what we're doing from K through 12, and then from 12, when our students leave?

871
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:45,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's when we've seen our numbers all of a sudden get high.

872
01:12:47,157 --> 01:12:52,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen the consequences of what's been happening with that.

873
01:12:52,178 --> 01:13:04,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we need to think about, again, going back to, when we're thinking about our 18 to 22-year-old population, right, a number of those individuals go away to college.

874
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're sort of out of our reach.

875
01:13:08,012 --> 01:13:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a number, however, that go to community college that go right into the workplace.

876
01:13:13,536 --> 01:13:18,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So addressing the tradesperson angle of it, we might be able to reach them that way.

877
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And then addressing, looking at community, reaching out to community colleges, finding out what they're doing and how we can communicate that back and forth.

878
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:31,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not try to duplicate what they're doing, but sort of work with them.

879
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:32,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that will be key.

880
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just general education across the community.

881
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:39,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're going to be working,

882
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:45,332
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Medford police are carrying Narcan, they started carrying it on Friday if you didn't know.

883
01:13:45,632 --> 01:13:46,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very excited about that.

884
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also wrote a grant with the fire and the police department on getting more money to do direct education about overdoses.

885
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're hoping is that we'll have more information out to the community and it won't necessarily prevent, at this point this is going to be about saving lives.

886
01:14:05,405 --> 01:14:20,114
[SPEAKER_05]: we at least get our framework for how that works, and then we can sort of, and one of those angles would be working with businesses, places for cash, where they have people delivering food, waitresses, sorry, servers, because men can do that.

887
01:14:20,454 --> 01:14:28,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That we would be wanting to address it too, because those folks are the ones who have that sort of income to be able to come and get away with doing more of the substances.

888
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to start working towards that directly.

889
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:33,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we have,

890
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:41,404
[SPEAKER_05]: with my change and not being directed by a grant, I think I have the flexibility to be able to start doing some of that stuff a little bit better.

891
01:14:41,424 --> 01:14:43,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

892
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:46,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Mrs. DiBenedetto.

893
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:52,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so you know, there are community groups that are very active and are running a lot of events throughout the community.

894
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:58,991
[SPEAKER_14]: The Method Against Addiction is a great one, and they've been educating the community, having kickball tournaments.

895
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:01,772
[SPEAKER_14]: They had the memorial service last year.

896
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:04,634
[SPEAKER_14]: really active and present.

897
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,398
[SPEAKER_14]: They called me about an issue in a school.

898
01:15:07,858 --> 01:15:15,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Their outreach has reached out to many families in need as well as families that didn't realize we had a problem in Brighton.

899
01:15:15,585 --> 01:15:20,046
[SPEAKER_14]: by their publicity from their group is also educating people.

900
01:15:20,567 --> 01:15:29,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, and I'm very well aware that that's one particular group that's out there, and there are a few other groups that are out there, and that's why it's important that everybody work together.

901
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to be realistic.

902
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:35,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there is a certain point where it's not like we need to wash our hands.

903
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that I want to make sure that

904
01:15:37,612 --> 01:15:38,793
[SPEAKER_04]: the information is out there.

905
01:15:38,853 --> 01:15:47,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot hold everyone's hand forever, but I just want to make sure that we have the information here and it is available.

906
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:49,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

907
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

908
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Falco.

909
01:15:52,821 --> 01:16:02,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to how it relates to the schools for this point, I had a question about some of the curriculum, and I just wanted to be very clear, okay?

910
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:06,690
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we teaching students that have a family member or a friend

911
01:16:07,256 --> 01:16:13,060
[SPEAKER_14]: that is using drugs or alcohol, how do they get help?

912
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:29,730
[SPEAKER_14]: How do they get comfortable enough to tell somebody that they need help dealing with it or their friend or their parent or whoever else, sibling in the household, whoever, they're living in this situation?

913
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:37,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I know at the high school and at the middle schools we do have lessons that talk about different supports in the schools and in the community.

914
01:16:37,762 --> 01:16:42,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have adjustment Councilors and other Councilors I think that Jeff can speak to a little bit better.

915
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:49,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of times situations come up and come to the Councilors and then the Councilors can refer the students or work with the students to help.

916
01:16:52,484 --> 01:17:00,979
[SPEAKER_17]: a support group that they can be involved with, but there's a lot of support that the Councilors will follow up with and kind of either talk to the parent or the sibling and kind of build up that support.

917
01:17:01,912 --> 01:17:09,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we just really need to emphasize that even if they don't have a problem, if someone they know is, that they should really speak out and get them help.

918
01:17:10,177 --> 01:17:12,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And that has to be communicated over and over and over again.

919
01:17:12,999 --> 01:17:13,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

920
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:20,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think part of the curriculum, each lesson talks about that on that specific things in the way the lesson is laid out.

921
01:17:20,443 --> 01:17:21,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So there'll be that opportunity.

922
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:27,027
[SPEAKER_17]: And also the teachers, if they notice something, they'll refer the name to one of the Councilors who can follow up with that student.

923
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:35,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the other part of your data that I found extremely significant is more about the mental health of some of our students.

924
01:17:35,635 --> 01:17:45,003
[SPEAKER_14]: And it says here on page seven of seven in the packet, it says on the second one down, it says, at times I think I am no good at all.

925
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:50,467
[SPEAKER_14]: 58% of high school females, that was alarming.

926
01:17:50,888 --> 01:17:53,290
[SPEAKER_14]: More than half of high school females.

927
01:17:54,314 --> 01:17:59,426
[SPEAKER_14]: said yes to that, and then felt depressed or sad on most days.

928
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:01,310
[SPEAKER_14]: 57% of high school females.

929
01:18:01,891 --> 01:18:04,156
[SPEAKER_14]: This to me is really sad.

930
01:18:04,915 --> 01:18:11,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to point out that these two charts, I put this chart in here because I do agree with you.

931
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:14,065
[SPEAKER_05]: My colleague and I, we looked at this data and we were alarmed.

932
01:18:14,446 --> 01:18:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We did write a grant for mental health for our state.

933
01:18:16,668 --> 01:18:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we did not get that grant.

934
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,011
[SPEAKER_05]: We were very devastated.

935
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, this is 2013.

936
01:18:21,193 --> 01:18:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: The next chart is 2015.

937
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:26,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So the numbers are improving, but it's not good.

938
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:29,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still almost 50% of our girls feeling that way.

939
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:45,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were shocked to see once we started to tease that out, to think about the fact that, you know, and when you look at this data for overdoses, you're looking at substance use rates, maybe there's a merit to having groups for girls.

940
01:18:46,323 --> 01:18:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: groups just for boys.

941
01:18:47,184 --> 01:19:02,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, something to think about, that sometimes separating them by gender might be actually more helpful because they're more able to talk freely about... Or targeting these groups, because we're seeing an alarming amount of children feeling depressed and feeling like they're not good.

942
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,193
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was extremely alarming to me.

943
01:19:05,233 --> 01:19:11,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And as someone in education, and as a committee, I think we should really provide services for

944
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:13,592
[SPEAKER_14]: somehow come up with ways.

945
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:23,116
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have in our own way by funding more Councilors and more people to address these issues in the school system this year.

946
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:25,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we made this a priority here.

947
01:19:25,877 --> 01:19:35,141
[SPEAKER_14]: All of my colleagues, the superintendent have really come through with, you know, giving more support to our students, but this is identifying who needs that support.

948
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want that to happen.

949
01:19:37,222 --> 01:19:37,562
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think,

950
01:19:38,062 --> 01:19:42,884
[SPEAKER_17]: In the middle school, with the added support, we added this year another halftime Councilor at the McGlynn Middle School.

951
01:19:43,524 --> 01:19:52,327
[SPEAKER_17]: There are now more support groups that are being able to run, if they're lunch bunches or social skills groups or ways of kind of addressing the interaction between some of the girls.

952
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:54,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's one thing we can do.

953
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:57,588
[SPEAKER_17]: We can also look at the high school and see ways to build that.

954
01:19:57,608 --> 01:19:58,329
[SPEAKER_14]: This is alarming.

955
01:19:59,049 --> 01:19:59,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, definitely.

956
01:20:03,854 --> 01:20:18,683
[SPEAKER_14]: something immediate, because if half of our girls are feeling this way, this is an emergency situation in my mind, that we need team building or whatever we need, we need to do it, and we need to do it quickly.

957
01:20:19,163 --> 01:20:21,744
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not in our middle school, this is saying our high school students.

958
01:20:22,205 --> 01:20:29,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and so at the middle school we have that, but at the high school there's a referral process that the assistant principals and teachers are all involved with,

959
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:36,252
[SPEAKER_17]: And so far this year, including the incoming freshmen, there have been 52 referrals for counseling and support.

960
01:20:37,073 --> 01:20:39,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's definitely ways that we look at it and build it.

961
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that up from last year?

962
01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:43,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe.

963
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:46,521
[SPEAKER_17]: We're trying to, I was teasing out the data with the Councilors.

964
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:53,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the incoming class brought more in as freshmen because there's much more awareness of it now.

965
01:20:54,519 --> 01:21:08,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Another suggestion I have is when I was on the PTO up for Method High School, they brought in a lot of speakers in a lot of extracurricular that really were like the yellow dress and about dating violence and about different things.

966
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:13,747
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they knew that this was the issue, maybe they could help in that manner.

967
01:21:13,847 --> 01:21:17,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I know if you contact Dan Rapucci, I'm sure she'd be willing to

968
01:21:17,508 --> 01:21:21,469
[SPEAKER_14]: like even change up what they do if they saw this data.

969
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:31,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe presenting this to the PTO, especially at our high school, that's another way, like my colleague Ann Marie was saying, how we getting this to the parents.

970
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:40,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe there's a PTO night that this is presented, that we actually go where the parents are, even if it's 10 parents in that room and they can spread the word.

971
01:21:40,974 --> 01:21:45,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I really think that she is right in that regard, that we have to get it to

972
01:21:46,413 --> 01:21:47,994
[SPEAKER_14]: to the students and to the parents.

973
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:59,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know that in Redding, they do send home a flyer in a general mailing, I think, to the community about substance abuse and mental health with some references out.

974
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:04,524
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's something we can look at as a team here to decide if that would also be a way to benefit the community.

975
01:22:04,905 --> 01:22:08,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe it could be the middle school and high school PTOs together.

976
01:22:08,747 --> 01:22:13,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe you could have someone from a couple of the groups, like the parents group that Cheryl DellaFano

977
01:22:14,157 --> 01:22:27,507
[SPEAKER_14]: and have someone from Method Against Addiction and just have like a forum on it because if 58% of our girls are feeling like they're not valued or not important, that's huge.

978
01:22:28,287 --> 01:22:29,308
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot of girls.

979
01:22:30,089 --> 01:22:43,178
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing we did do last year when we had our professional development on social emotional learning, we spent a lot of time educating teachers on how to recognize signs of anxiety and depression in their students.

980
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:54,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of that was part of the suicide awareness prevention training we did, but then we also ran workshops that focused on the different developmental ages, elementary, middle, and high school.

981
01:22:55,242 --> 01:23:04,129
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're getting more of this information out to people that are dealing with students, and they also know the referral process.

982
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:06,607
[SPEAKER_16]: for support for the students.

983
01:23:06,887 --> 01:23:09,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's a training our parents could partake in.

984
01:23:09,429 --> 01:23:24,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I know it's hard to get families to come in, but just some of that training and offering that, I'm sure if parents knew about it and they felt even an inkling that they could benefit their child at home, I'm sure they would come and learn as much as they could.

985
01:23:24,861 --> 01:23:26,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want that outreach piece.

986
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:30,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're all working really, really hard with the school system.

987
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:32,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I want it to extend into the parents.

988
01:23:34,186 --> 01:23:38,169
[SPEAKER_14]: My colleague is so right with that and I'd be happy to help in any way I can.

989
01:23:38,669 --> 01:23:47,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let me know and I will blast it everywhere and help you in any way possible as I know my colleagues would be willing to do.

990
01:23:47,395 --> 01:23:51,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time and your motion to approve.

991
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:58,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, just to work off of that, my, uh, my point is, is more personal in the sense that,

992
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, a few of the overdoses were former soccer players.

993
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:14,344
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a way, this report's wonderful and it's informative, but it's cumbersome.

994
01:24:14,564 --> 01:24:17,405
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't what I've learned as a parent.

995
01:24:18,045 --> 01:24:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Most parents are going to look at things that are going to hit you with bullets and see what's important.

996
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:27,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like this, these numbers are great, but the average parent isn't going to read it.

997
01:24:30,103 --> 01:24:41,811
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe if there's a way that we can just get, you know, just an informative booklet or a trifle, just to get the word out for, you know, maybe doing professional development with your coaches.

998
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:47,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a teacher and a coach for 15 years at the high school and the middle elementary school.

999
01:24:48,356 --> 01:24:53,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there were signs that I could have noticed and I didn't.

1000
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of guilt there.

1001
01:24:56,702 --> 01:24:56,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And

1002
01:24:57,407 --> 01:25:13,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and being so, being a very important part of these kids' lives, maybe focusing on the front lines, not only with the PTGs, but I've been a little league coach and a youth soccer coach and a basketball coach and being involved with kids.

1003
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:17,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many hours I've spent with six, seven kids in a car.

1004
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:26,033
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's something maybe that in a conversation as we're driving and talking about prevention, you know, I'm a dad first and foremost.

1005
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:38,279
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm very involved with my children, and we talk about drug use, and we talk about everything from taking aspirin to smoking marijuana and heroin, because they knew these kids.

1006
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to belittle what's done, because I think it's important.

1007
01:25:43,623 --> 01:25:47,005
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a substance that gets us the grants and gets us the money that's needed to move forward.

1008
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:56,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's something we could dummy down in a sense, just so the average person can just have points that they can talk about, or maybe they hear something

1009
01:25:56,815 --> 01:26:09,319
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where as mandated reporters, something that serious, but just something that, you know, well, let me talk to mom and dad and let me give them this brochure and who they can talk, contact in the community that says, Hey, why don't we talk here?

1010
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call Melby, right?

1011
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call, let's call, uh, Rachel at the high school.

1012
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's get the word out.

1013
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:23,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, maybe it's, maybe I'm looking at it pretty naively in the sense that, but looking at something that we get out,

1014
01:26:24,307 --> 01:26:24,967
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, think about it.

1015
01:26:25,187 --> 01:26:41,912
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 500 little league players, and we have, you know, 1,100 youth soccer players, and we have 400 lacrosse players, and I can go on and on and on, but looking at that youth program and talking to the presidents of those leagues and bringing them together and saying, hey, would this help?

1016
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:50,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of a conversation when you talk with your coach is saying, we don't want you to be, you know, you're not going to be, you know, a therapist, but just get the word out.

1017
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:54,015
[SPEAKER_01]: because the more in the front line I think is going to be most important.

1018
01:26:54,596 --> 01:27:00,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad that you said that because we have developed a curriculum for coaches through our Mississippi Valley Public Health Coalition.

1019
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of our major initiatives for that grant for our six communities regionally.

1020
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:06,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We were the only

1021
01:27:08,887 --> 01:27:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: cluster in the state that identified athletes as a high risk population that we were going to be targeting.

1022
01:27:14,932 --> 01:27:17,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, as you know, the governor is pointing this out.

1023
01:27:17,994 --> 01:27:21,197
[SPEAKER_05]: They took our information and they gave it to the MIAA.

1024
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very proud to hear that.

1025
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:25,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The only catch is we haven't started that training.

1026
01:27:25,294 --> 01:27:32,679
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked with Rachel and a few folks to do some piling to make sure that what we're saying lines up with what coaches are thinking in ways that they think.

1027
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:42,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have an infographic that I can send home to every single family if that shows the progression of injury all the way down to heroin.

1028
01:27:42,146 --> 01:27:42,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have that.

1029
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:42,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show that.

1030
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:43,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring it to you.

1031
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:44,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my office right here.

1032
01:27:45,749 --> 01:27:48,591
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is our major goal is to reach out to Little Leagues.

1033
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:50,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a database of Little Leagues for six towns.

1034
01:27:51,833 --> 01:28:01,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have to meet with all the athletic directors to get them set that up to do that, because we feel that the coaches are an important, important role model for these kids.

1035
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're not just notified about

1036
01:28:05,091 --> 01:28:11,214
[SPEAKER_05]: injury and prescription of drugs, but also alcohol, marijuana, how do you talk about all this stuff like you're saying?

1037
01:28:11,254 --> 01:28:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And so thank you so much for saying that.

1038
01:28:13,296 --> 01:28:15,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't include it here, but I do have those resources.

1039
01:28:15,717 --> 01:28:20,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to share and hear your feedback about the curriculum because we want to improve it and we want it to really be good.

1040
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the story with that.

1041
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:25,682
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have it, it's just sort of

1042
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:32,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I did train 40 hockey coaches in Stoneham last fall, and I felt like it was pretty good training.

1043
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sort of asked right away, can you do it, and I put it together, and then we refined it since then.

1044
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,872
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stereotypes.

1045
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:46,117
[SPEAKER_01]: In the neighboring community where I work in now, the biggest stereotype was overdoses with hockey players.

1046
01:28:46,657 --> 01:28:50,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that my son's not playing hockey because he's going to overdose.

1047
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And wrong in so many ways.

1048
01:28:53,867 --> 01:29:13,991
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so great that we're thinking that, being proactive, and like, again, as a former coach and working, a former coach in Medford and still a former coach in the neighborhood community, I'd love to be, you know, give any assistance possible because, like I said, on a personal level, there's a lot of guilt in the sense that we, did I miss something?

1049
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:18,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people like Rachel and I understand where that comes from.

1050
01:29:18,472 --> 01:29:19,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you.

1051
01:29:20,213 --> 01:29:20,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent Belz.

1052
01:29:22,147 --> 01:29:30,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, you can see there's a lot of information here as you're referencing, and obviously we respect what you're saying about getting it out so that people can handle it.

1053
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:34,816
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very protracted conversation.

1054
01:29:34,856 --> 01:29:38,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to give you sort of an introduction, a little bit more of what's going on.

1055
01:29:38,859 --> 01:29:49,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to ask Tony to talk a little bit about MassBURT, because that's the latest thing coming out of the governor's office and Senator Flanagan's office, which I think is going to be part of the new

1056
01:29:50,759 --> 01:29:52,480
[SPEAKER_00]: new bill coming out of the legislature.

1057
01:29:52,520 --> 01:30:01,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell you a little because that sort of speaks to what George is raising with regard to getting to people and really dealing with individuals rather than talking in the atmosphere right now.

1058
01:30:01,645 --> 01:30:05,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it probably is a, it's a good thing to interject right now.

1059
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:13,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I also included in your packet some information on what's referred to as SBIRT, which means stands for screening,

1060
01:30:13,835 --> 01:30:17,037
[SPEAKER_16]: brief intervention and referral to treatment.

1061
01:30:17,697 --> 01:30:20,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is a screening process that can be done.

1062
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,480
[SPEAKER_16]: It's evidence-based.

1063
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,241
[SPEAKER_16]: It was developed at Children's Hospital.

1064
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:29,064
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a six-question screening tool called CRAFT.

1065
01:30:29,665 --> 01:30:33,047
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's used to identify high-risk individuals.

1066
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:40,211
[SPEAKER_16]: It can easily be incorporated into the mandated screening programs that the school nurses are already doing.

1067
01:30:42,523 --> 01:30:44,724
[SPEAKER_16]: It takes a few minutes to administer.

1068
01:30:44,744 --> 01:30:56,329
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a trained school nurse will go through the six questions with the students and identify who is high risk.

1069
01:30:56,429 --> 01:31:05,013
[SPEAKER_16]: And then from there, it becomes a referral for counseling, either within the school or outside of the school.

1070
01:31:06,683 --> 01:31:09,644
[SPEAKER_16]: It's presently being used in several school districts.

1071
01:31:10,884 --> 01:31:18,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Gloucester, Natick, North Andover, Wilmington, Hudson are some of them that have started using it.

1072
01:31:18,845 --> 01:31:22,086
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Department of Public Health does provide training free of cost.

1073
01:31:22,486 --> 01:31:32,907
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've initiated contact with those trainers so that we can get that training started at some point in the next few months.

1074
01:31:34,008 --> 01:31:36,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Another initiative that we've reached out to is

1075
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,713
[SPEAKER_16]: with the Institute for Health and Recovery.

1076
01:31:38,954 --> 01:31:52,564
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, there is a substance abuse Councilor that has been now made available to spend a day a week in different area high schools.

1077
01:31:53,264 --> 01:32:01,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're presently in place in Melrose, Malden, Redding, and I think they're looking to get into Stoneham.

1078
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've reached out to this organization, and we're

1079
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:15,812
[SPEAKER_16]: looking to have somebody come in and speak to our group of administrators to see how can we best integrate a person with that type of counseling experience into our high school.

1080
01:32:16,553 --> 01:32:26,020
[SPEAKER_16]: How can we identify students we need to refer to them and the SBIRT screening may be a very good lead in for those types of referrals.

1081
01:32:27,201 --> 01:32:32,646
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the two newer things that we're looking at to get started during this school year.

1082
01:32:35,412 --> 01:32:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. Cuno had a question first.

1083
01:32:37,253 --> 01:32:41,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, it kind of dragged my memory.

1084
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:47,239
[SPEAKER_04]: As Mr. Scottelli was speaking about it, now I'll really end up letting you know how old I am.

1085
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:52,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Involved with four boys in sports for over 24 years.

1086
01:32:55,675 --> 01:33:04,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We did, I remember like in youth soccer, we had these little pamphlets that were given out for different things during different situations.

1087
01:33:04,919 --> 01:33:22,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember like just at registration time or whatever, just little pamphlets, little things like with little bullet points in it that, as Mr. Scarpelli said and as I had said before, all this hard work that everyone is doing is wonderful, but unfortunately, like everyone's life, it's just very hard sometimes and unless it's

1088
01:33:23,343 --> 01:33:29,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, unfortunately, in your own backyard, you really can't take the time or you don't take the time to really look at every single thing.

1089
01:33:29,885 --> 01:33:51,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you could pick up, you know, you're registering your child or whatever, and you pick up a little pamphlet, and you're like waiting in between kids picking up or whatever, and you're looking at all these things, and you look at the, you know, bullet points, you know, just like stereo, people have stereotypes in their mind of what a child who commits suicide is.

1090
01:33:52,635 --> 01:34:00,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the state already has a lot of things that are what the stereotype isn't, and to educate people in that manner.

1091
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So just little things like that is, I guess, what we're asking for.

1092
01:34:04,063 --> 01:34:07,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of those brochures are available through the Massachusetts Clearinghouse.

1093
01:34:07,545 --> 01:34:08,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I used to get them.

1094
01:34:08,986 --> 01:34:16,051
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of the nurses have them in the offices, but we can look for other avenues to distribute those types of brochures.

1095
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:18,417
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Dee Benedetto.

1096
01:34:19,097 --> 01:34:19,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a question.

1097
01:34:20,098 --> 01:34:25,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this sixth question that we go through similar to the one that the police are using?

1098
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:26,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1099
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:29,464
[SPEAKER_14]: To identify students that, I mean, okay.

1100
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:30,645
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exactly the same one.

1101
01:34:33,887 --> 01:34:43,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there were some rules and regulations that, you know, when they're identified that they really didn't have a choice but to go for further help.

1102
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:48,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going there with our students at all?

1103
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:55,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Our diversion program for the police department, they will be psyched.

1104
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I have four individuals who are now enrolled in this program.

1105
01:34:58,327 --> 01:34:59,868
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll run our class on October 31st.

1106
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:09,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be cited, and they have the option to pay their citation and forego the education or waive the citation and follow through with the program.

1107
01:35:10,124 --> 01:35:22,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the class itself and then the taking that craft tool is the requirement, and if we feel that they've screened high, we will meet with their family and let them know that we want them to get help, but we can't force them to get the help.

1108
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:24,612
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I understand that.

1109
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:27,734
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the option of paying the citation or go into the classroom.

1110
01:35:28,347 --> 01:35:35,169
[SPEAKER_14]: So at our high school or in our schools, when we're identifying someone, are we offering them the class?

1111
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:38,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1112
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:41,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is this- At this time, no.

1113
01:35:41,711 --> 01:35:42,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1114
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:47,853
[SPEAKER_16]: The typical process is any high risk students that are identified are referred on for

1115
01:35:49,283 --> 01:35:55,226
[SPEAKER_16]: to a school adjustment Councilor or on to further medical care or counseling care.

1116
01:35:55,426 --> 01:35:56,947
[SPEAKER_16]: And parents are being notified?

1117
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:58,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, parents would be notified.

1118
01:35:59,188 --> 01:36:08,894
[SPEAKER_16]: And parents also would be notified of the screening that will be taking place and they would have an opt-out opportunity, should they choose.

1119
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:15,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so someone who places high, can we look at that program?

1120
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:22,496
[SPEAKER_14]: to see if we could get that to work for our identified students within the school system?

1121
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:23,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1122
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:28,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So the specific curriculum, it deals with the behavior that got them to the class.

1123
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:31,961
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be more like, were you caught drinking in the woods?

1124
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:32,622
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you doing?

1125
01:36:32,642 --> 01:36:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does a lot of stepping through that.

1126
01:36:35,263 --> 01:36:37,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I think I've talked to Tony about this too.

1127
01:36:38,745 --> 01:36:47,312
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a specific incident that we want to, so that, there might be that that course is the right thing or it might be that they need to just be triaged directly to get help.

1128
01:36:48,213 --> 01:36:48,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And that.

1129
01:36:48,974 --> 01:36:50,175
[SPEAKER_05]: All individually based.

1130
01:36:50,355 --> 01:36:50,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1131
01:36:50,515 --> 01:36:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But there, anyone can sign their kid up to come if they feel like they caught them in their bedroom doing something they were worried about.

1132
01:36:58,301 --> 01:36:59,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Please give us a call at City Hall.

1133
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:08,503
[SPEAKER_05]: 393-2449, and we can enroll them October 31st as our first class, but we'll keep a regular schedule.

1134
01:37:08,623 --> 01:37:14,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So people are welcome to, but however, if somebody has a distinctive substance use disorder, this class is not appropriate.

1135
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:20,047
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an early intervention for someone who's experimenting or first starting use.

1136
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:26,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I thought that the linkage, that's my understanding of it, the linking, linkage, I just want that link,

1137
01:37:27,616 --> 01:37:35,025
[SPEAKER_14]: to parents and to school administrators to know that it's there, to like utilize that tool that's already in place.

1138
01:37:35,585 --> 01:37:40,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're sending home a notification to every family about the ASAP program.

1139
01:37:40,631 --> 01:37:44,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going out in the mail very shortly, but also

1140
01:37:44,936 --> 01:37:58,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked that if this person becomes an institutional person in the school where they come and meet with kids every week, then we could probably link together that that's the same council for the whole city and that we'll work with the same project on that.

1141
01:37:58,502 --> 01:37:58,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1142
01:37:58,862 --> 01:37:59,502
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I want.

1143
01:37:59,563 --> 01:38:06,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want that collaboration so that way they'll be utilizing it through the schools as well as the community-based programs.

1144
01:38:07,586 --> 01:38:07,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1145
01:38:08,647 --> 01:38:11,828
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Mrs. DiBenedetto, seconded by Mr. Scarpelli that the

1146
01:38:12,264 --> 01:38:13,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Report be accepted and placed on file.

1147
01:38:13,765 --> 01:38:14,566
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1148
01:38:14,586 --> 01:38:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1149
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

1150
01:38:17,207 --> 01:38:17,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1151
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:27,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Next item is the recommendation to accept gift from Media Technologies Corporation to the Gator Trade Alliance of $1,500.

1152
01:38:28,515 --> 01:38:30,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept by Mr. Scarpelli.

1153
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second.

1154
01:38:31,897 --> 01:38:33,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Mrs. Cugno.

1155
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:34,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Secretary, would you please call the roll?

1156
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Mrs. Cugno?

1157
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:36,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1158
01:38:36,621 --> 01:38:37,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto?

1159
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:37,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1160
01:38:37,742 --> 01:38:38,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Falco?

1161
01:38:38,582 --> 01:38:38,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1162
01:38:39,102 --> 01:38:39,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scarpelli?

1163
01:38:40,023 --> 01:38:40,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1164
01:38:40,303 --> 01:38:41,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Skerry, yes.

1165
01:38:42,395 --> 01:38:43,715
[SPEAKER_08]: 5 in the affirmative, 2 absent.

1166
01:38:44,575 --> 01:38:46,256
[SPEAKER_06]: 5 in the affirmative, 2 absent.

1167
01:38:46,616 --> 01:38:47,916
[SPEAKER_06]: The gift is accepted.

1168
01:38:49,136 --> 01:38:52,357
[SPEAKER_06]: The next item is a report on college fair and financial aid night.

1169
01:38:52,777 --> 01:38:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

1170
01:38:54,537 --> 01:38:59,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, the guidance department's hosting two specific nights.

1171
01:38:59,758 --> 01:39:00,998
[SPEAKER_00]: One is annual college fair.

1172
01:39:01,038 --> 01:39:04,319
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is the financial aid night.

1173
01:39:05,179 --> 01:39:09,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the dates kind of correspond to things that conflict with you.

1174
01:39:11,457 --> 01:39:19,062
[SPEAKER_00]: The 21st is your debate, and the 4th, for those at the conference, will be at the conference.

1175
01:39:19,642 --> 01:39:22,844
[SPEAKER_00]: But both items are excellent events.

1176
01:39:23,445 --> 01:39:24,586
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be well attended.

1177
01:39:26,487 --> 01:39:30,650
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a listing of the colleges that are coming on the back.

1178
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:38,815
[SPEAKER_00]: It also should be noted that the Special Education Department on the evening of the 21st will be hosting a program

1179
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:44,200
[SPEAKER_00]: to help parents with students with disabilities to make the transition from high school to college.

1180
01:39:45,141 --> 01:39:48,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think these are all terrific programs.

1181
01:39:48,624 --> 01:39:51,646
[SPEAKER_00]: The guidance department sponsors them every year along with the SPED department.

1182
01:39:52,326 --> 01:39:54,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very valuable additions to our program.

1183
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:56,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's informational for you right now.

1184
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:02,434
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions, we'll be happy to try to provide additional information going forward.

1185
01:40:04,712 --> 01:40:04,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1186
01:40:04,872 --> 01:40:10,016
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion on the motion, Mr. Scarpelli, seconded by Mr. Skerry that the report be accepted and placed on file.

1187
01:40:10,536 --> 01:40:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor of this opposed, the report is accepted and placed on file.

1188
01:40:15,139 --> 01:40:18,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Next item is follow up report on common core.

1189
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:20,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Superintendent, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

1190
01:40:20,984 --> 01:40:32,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and our last meeting, we talked a little bit about the common core and we were going to hold a committee of the whole, but your schedules are pretty tight and there's so many things going on that we thought we could accomplish it at this meeting here.

1191
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:40,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Beverly is so good at this stuff that, you know, she'll cut right through it and make sure that you understand it.

1192
01:40:40,338 --> 01:40:43,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you know it, you'll be on a national tour explaining it to other people.

1193
01:40:44,019 --> 01:40:44,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

1194
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,201
[SPEAKER_11]: You're setting me up for failure here.

1195
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:47,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1196
01:40:47,461 --> 01:40:49,542
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't think so.

1197
01:40:50,023 --> 01:40:50,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1198
01:40:50,623 --> 01:40:58,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you received materials dealing with the common core state standards at our last meeting.

1199
01:40:59,385 --> 01:41:11,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, the materials that you received included the history of the content and learning standards and the adoption of the Common Core, as well as insight into the development and purpose of the Common Core.

1200
01:41:12,532 --> 01:41:27,560
[SPEAKER_11]: The Common Core, although in existence for several years and adopted by the Massachusetts Board of Education as the basis for the English Language Arts and Mathematics Frameworks in 2010, it's currently receiving much scrutiny and criticism.

1201
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:35,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Several states have legislation pending calling for the revoking or revocation of the adoption of the Common Core.

1202
01:41:36,614 --> 01:41:52,939
[SPEAKER_11]: The intent of this report, this follow-up report, is to provide you with additional information about the Common Core as well as our analysis of what we feel are the strengths of the document over previous Massachusetts standards for English and mathematics.

1203
01:41:54,623 --> 01:42:03,251
[SPEAKER_11]: The very first frameworks, which again came out of the Education Reform Act of 1993, were written by educators for all content areas.

1204
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:10,097
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not just math and English, it was social studies, fine arts, foreign language, health, the Zed.

1205
01:42:10,977 --> 01:42:15,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, as they were rolled out, they were adopted by the Board of Education.

1206
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:17,663
[SPEAKER_11]: This all happened in the mid to late 90s.

1207
01:42:19,495 --> 01:42:26,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Once written and adopted by the Board of Education, all frameworks were supposed to be revisited and revised on a five-year basis.

1208
01:42:27,096 --> 01:42:31,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And we find that over time, only the English and Mathematics have had those revisions.

1209
01:42:32,137 --> 01:42:42,999
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go back and you look at the frameworks which are posted on DESE's website, you will see that the latest versions of ones like the Health and Phys Ed are 1999.

1210
01:42:43,459 --> 01:42:47,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this is very troublesome given the fact that so many health issues

1211
01:42:48,048 --> 01:42:51,810
[SPEAKER_11]: have arisen that aren't even documented in that framework.

1212
01:42:52,471 --> 01:42:58,114
[SPEAKER_11]: The English and mathematics received a lot of attention because of the testing that was involved.

1213
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:03,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the MCAS test was supposed to be a test for all content areas.

1214
01:43:03,657 --> 01:43:05,458
[SPEAKER_11]: They were supposed to test foreign language.

1215
01:43:05,838 --> 01:43:08,540
[SPEAKER_11]: They were supposed to test, and they did for a while, social studies.

1216
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they disbanded that.

1217
01:43:10,881 --> 01:43:11,942
[SPEAKER_11]: They were supposed to test finance.

1218
01:43:11,982 --> 01:43:13,142
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be for everything.

1219
01:43:13,542 --> 01:43:16,084
[SPEAKER_11]: But the only tests that emerged really were

1220
01:43:17,111 --> 01:43:18,392
[SPEAKER_11]: the ones for English and math.

1221
01:43:18,932 --> 01:43:21,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And for a short term, we had social studies.

1222
01:43:21,673 --> 01:43:24,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, of course, we have the science added back in.

1223
01:43:25,515 --> 01:43:36,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Prior to the publication of the Common Core, teams of educators in Massachusetts were already at work in 2009 revising the English and math frameworks.

1224
01:43:37,642 --> 01:43:42,905
[SPEAKER_11]: The work of these teams, and I was on the English team in 2009, our work was stopped.

1225
01:43:42,965 --> 01:43:45,206
[SPEAKER_11]: All of a sudden, they said, OK, we're going to stop what we're doing.

1226
01:43:45,782 --> 01:43:54,509
[SPEAKER_11]: because the Common Core was coming on the horizon, and we knew the state was going to take a look at that before adopting any new frameworks.

1227
01:43:55,610 --> 01:44:05,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So what happened is the teamwork stopped, and again, the Common Core was out there, and it was thoroughly reviewed.

1228
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:12,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I think many people feel today that the Common Core was adopted very quickly without public input, but that's not the case.

1229
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:15,366
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go back, you'll see that it was,

1230
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:21,613
[SPEAKER_11]: vetted by many different constituencies, business groups, educators, higher ed.

1231
01:44:22,313 --> 01:44:24,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was out for public comment for a fair amount of time.

1232
01:44:25,354 --> 01:44:28,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So people in the public had a chance to see it and to comment.

1233
01:44:30,977 --> 01:44:42,882
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that probably pushed the adoption of the Common Core, not just in Massachusetts, but in all states, was the race to the top funding, the race to the top grant money.

1234
01:44:43,497 --> 01:44:48,900
[SPEAKER_11]: In order to be able to apply for the Raise to the Top grant money, a state had to adopt the Common Core.

1235
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:49,660
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1236
01:44:49,981 --> 01:45:01,987
[SPEAKER_11]: But the one thing that I really want to emphasize is that our frameworks, our frameworks for English and mathematics, are called the Massachusetts English Language Arts Frameworks and the Massachusetts Mathematics Frameworks.

1237
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:06,610
[SPEAKER_11]: They're built off of the Common Core, but they're not just the Common Core.

1238
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:12,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what happened is once the Board of Education adopted the Common Core, and that was at their meeting

1239
01:45:13,211 --> 01:45:22,053
[SPEAKER_11]: July 21st, 2010, the superintendent was there at that meeting, I was there, Dr. Riccadeli was there, and we kind of watched everyone get up and speak.

1240
01:45:22,133 --> 01:45:36,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the only person who was vocal against it happened to be our current governor, Charlie Baker, who actually stood up there and spoke about the Common Core dumbing down Massachusetts standards, which I don't feel and many people don't feel is the case at all.

1241
01:45:37,557 --> 01:45:40,158
[SPEAKER_11]: But in any event, once the Common Core was adopted,

1242
01:45:40,697 --> 01:45:43,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the English committee and the math committee got back to work.

1243
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And we took the common core and we added to it.

1244
01:45:47,342 --> 01:45:55,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we have for our frameworks currently does contain the common core, but is not solely composed of the common core.

1245
01:45:55,608 --> 01:45:57,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Many things were added back in.

1246
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:03,394
[SPEAKER_11]: What people think happened is things were taken out in order to put things in.

1247
01:46:03,474 --> 01:46:04,455
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not the case.

1248
01:46:04,995 --> 01:46:08,498
[SPEAKER_11]: With the English frameworks, we still have a balance of fiction.

1249
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:13,372
[SPEAKER_11]: because one of the switches with the English frameworks was adding in informational text.

1250
01:46:13,813 --> 01:46:15,454
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean fiction was taken out.

1251
01:46:15,474 --> 01:46:20,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It simply means that informational text was added in as an additional type of reading.

1252
01:46:22,378 --> 01:46:38,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, one of the criticisms of the group of people that were against the Common Core, or maybe are against the Common Core, is that

1253
01:46:39,358 --> 01:46:43,600
[SPEAKER_11]: The Common Core Frameworks reduced the rigor of what we already had in place.

1254
01:46:44,581 --> 01:46:58,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were individuals who claimed that Massachusetts had the most rigorous standards in the nation, and the belief was the Common Core Standards, because they were written for all states, reduced the rigor of Massachusetts, what we had in place.

1255
01:46:59,589 --> 01:47:08,614
[SPEAKER_11]: As a result of Race to the Top money, we had two testing groups that were funded to develop tests based on the Common Core.

1256
01:47:09,227 --> 01:47:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And those two groups are PARC, which is the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Career, and Smarter Balance.

1257
01:47:17,951 --> 01:47:23,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And each state that adopted the Common Core was asked to sign on for one of these tests.

1258
01:47:23,394 --> 01:47:24,655
[SPEAKER_11]: And we signed on for PARC.

1259
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:28,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, where we are right now is we're making that big decision.

1260
01:47:28,637 --> 01:47:30,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to actually adopt PARC?

1261
01:47:30,878 --> 01:47:34,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to stay with MCAS, which will be modified in some fashion.

1262
01:47:36,193 --> 01:47:53,121
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel that, as we talk about this and talk with colleagues around the state, we feel that a lot of the current backlash against the Common Core is more about PARC, because PARC had its difficulties this year in its administration, and some people aren't quite happy with that.

1263
01:47:53,721 --> 01:48:00,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, people are speaking out against the Common Core, but it's really, I believe, the testing that's driving this backlash.

1264
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:05,607
[SPEAKER_11]: The RTT money, Raise to the Top money, no longer is an issue.

1265
01:48:06,152 --> 01:48:17,398
[SPEAKER_11]: So now states, because that money is no longer something that they have to think about obtaining, many states now are reevaluating their decision to adopt the Common Core State Standards.

1266
01:48:18,099 --> 01:48:21,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Many state legislatures have filed legislation to repeal it.

1267
01:48:22,601 --> 01:48:27,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And many states who signed on to the testing systems are now pulling away.

1268
01:48:28,244 --> 01:48:33,307
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, the number of states that signed on to PARCC was originally 24, and now there are only 12 left.

1269
01:48:37,329 --> 01:48:51,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So our administration, our Director of Curriculum, Instruction, Humanities, and Mathematics, as well as teams of teachers representing all grade levels, have been working with our new framework since they came out in 2011.

1270
01:48:51,099 --> 01:49:01,126
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of time and money invested, and as you know, we have programs at the elementary level now in place, journeys, and envisioned to support the new curriculum.

1271
01:49:02,282 --> 01:49:07,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've done a thorough comparison of the previous, I've been doing frameworks since they started.

1272
01:49:07,684 --> 01:49:11,425
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really have to say that there are benefits to the Common Core Standards.

1273
01:49:12,565 --> 01:49:21,288
[SPEAKER_11]: In general, if you think about it for the entire nation, it's going to improve the rigor in those states that didn't have rigor, without dumbing down our rigor.

1274
01:49:22,508 --> 01:49:31,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And the states where we have a lot of mobility and the kids moving from state to state now are going to have an easier time picking up curriculum in their new state.

1275
01:49:32,168 --> 01:49:38,812
[SPEAKER_11]: They were coming in from other states and other cities and towns and being exposed to very, very different curricula.

1276
01:49:40,734 --> 01:49:45,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, those are a couple of the positive reasons for keeping with the Common Core.

1277
01:49:46,938 --> 01:49:59,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Other things are because the Common Core state standards are internationally benchmarked, our standards will be comparable to standards in other countries, and many believe will help to improve our ranking

1278
01:50:00,211 --> 01:50:02,112
[SPEAKER_11]: among international ratings.

1279
01:50:03,533 --> 01:50:14,239
[SPEAKER_11]: The common core state standards focus on increasing critical thinking and problem-solving skills of our students, and we feel that these are the skills of the current and future workplace.

1280
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:22,063
[SPEAKER_11]: They also emphasize skills such as listening and speaking, which again are very important skills for our students today.

1281
01:50:22,123 --> 01:50:26,205
[SPEAKER_11]: They're lifelong skills and they're things that we think are very important.

1282
01:50:27,207 --> 01:50:29,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Additional benefits for each of the frameworks.

1283
01:50:29,649 --> 01:50:33,411
[SPEAKER_11]: The ELA, informational text as well as fiction.

1284
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:38,254
[SPEAKER_11]: The previous English language arts framework only dealt with novels, fiction.

1285
01:50:39,335 --> 01:50:42,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we know that we have informational text.

1286
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:48,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Now informational text is really important for kids to be able to deal with because they're reading very complex textbooks.

1287
01:50:48,962 --> 01:50:56,927
[SPEAKER_11]: The kids who are going on to career training, vocational education, if you ever look at those manuals, they're very difficult reading levels, so it's important that

1288
01:50:57,413 --> 01:51:06,117
[SPEAKER_11]: kids learn not just to read novels, we're not throwing that away because that's important, but they also need to increase their knowledge of informational text readings.

1289
01:51:07,378 --> 01:51:23,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Another positive I see with the English is for years and years, we've been talking about reading in the content area, how every teacher, whether they're a teacher of science or social studies or mathematics, should be teaching reading skills to students because reading is a component of all those subject areas.

1290
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:30,360
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about it, we promoted it for many years, now it's actually part of the English frameworks.

1291
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:35,802
[SPEAKER_11]: In the English language arts frameworks, there are literary standards for all the content areas.

1292
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:46,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we work with departments, and I know Dr. Riccadeli last year, working on the curriculum, made sure the science department had the literary standards that were embedded in the frameworks for them.

1293
01:51:47,046 --> 01:51:51,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not just about the science teachers now following the science standards,

1294
01:51:51,697 --> 01:51:56,358
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to follow the literacy standards and the English framework that are specific for science.

1295
01:51:56,438 --> 01:51:59,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And that cuts across all curriculum areas.

1296
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:06,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel writing, the type of writing that's being asked of students is an improvement.

1297
01:52:07,602 --> 01:52:14,003
[SPEAKER_11]: They're less just explaining what they think about things, and they're linking writing more with tying it to evidence.

1298
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:19,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're reading passages, and they're being able to write by pulling information from passages.

1299
01:52:20,202 --> 01:52:28,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still important for kids to be able to write about, you know, what their favorite day was all summer, but there needs to be another piece to that.

1300
01:52:28,304 --> 01:52:32,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And we feel that the close reading writing is a definite improvement.

1301
01:52:33,046 --> 01:52:47,650
[SPEAKER_11]: With regard to the mathematics, one of the criticisms of the previous math frameworks is that teachers felt that they were not in those frameworks, it wasn't very specific as to what you should be doing by the end of the school year with your student.

1302
01:52:48,245 --> 01:52:59,109
[SPEAKER_11]: The math framework's kind of just spiraled all through the grades, and the teachers want that specificity in terms of what should my child master by the end of grade three in mathematics.

1303
01:52:59,669 --> 01:53:02,910
[SPEAKER_11]: That's in the new document, and I think that's been a big improvement.

1304
01:53:04,871 --> 01:53:14,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Standards for mathematical practice are now part of the content standards, so students, again, are really processing the math, they're learning to think about the math.

1305
01:53:14,414 --> 01:53:16,415
[SPEAKER_11]: The math is more difficult, and I think if

1306
01:53:17,078 --> 01:53:28,305
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I could think of any one criticism about the math is perhaps it's just a little bit too ambitious for some of our students, but we're hoping to get them where they need to be.

1307
01:53:29,166 --> 01:53:34,069
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, that the rigor of the math at each grade level has increased.

1308
01:53:34,749 --> 01:53:37,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Algebra one is a very different algebra one.

1309
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:39,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more like algebra two and so on.

1310
01:53:39,772 --> 01:53:46,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, having our fourth year of math requirement that we put into place a few years ago, I think will help our kids to get where they need to be.

1311
01:53:47,449 --> 01:53:50,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, we are committed to supporting them to make it.

1312
01:53:50,772 --> 01:53:53,134
[SPEAKER_11]: But the math is very rigorous.

1313
01:53:54,455 --> 01:54:01,941
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have put a lot of work, effort, and money the past five years, putting our new district curricular in place.

1314
01:54:02,822 --> 01:54:13,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And while there is still controversy about the Common Core, I think much of the controversy is rooted in misinformation and lack of knowledge about what's actually in those documents.

1315
01:54:14,531 --> 01:54:16,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's more a criticism of this new test.

1316
01:54:16,988 --> 01:54:20,270
[SPEAKER_11]: which again has been, you know, had its difficulties.

1317
01:54:21,091 --> 01:54:34,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we continue to tweak our curriculum as the needs of our students are identified and made change, we feel that the Common Core State Standards are a positive direction to preparing our students for both college and career.

1318
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:41,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And I attached just a question and answer summary from U.S.

1319
01:54:41,905 --> 01:54:43,866
[SPEAKER_11]: News for you to look at.

1320
01:54:43,906 --> 01:54:46,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, put your reading glasses on for this, the way it prints out.

1321
01:54:47,304 --> 01:54:48,545
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll take any questions.

1322
01:54:48,605 --> 01:54:56,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we have a pretty experienced group that's worked with this stuff for a long time and can see the comparison.

1323
01:54:57,809 --> 01:55:01,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been with the frameworks movement since I was on the first committees in 1995.

1324
01:55:01,331 --> 01:55:04,812
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've seen full circle where we're coming from.

1325
01:55:04,852 --> 01:55:09,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say that what I'm seeing is an improvement with this.

1326
01:55:09,234 --> 01:55:14,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think people, basically they're calling our frameworks by the wrong name.

1327
01:55:15,203 --> 01:55:16,663
[SPEAKER_11]: frameworks in Massachusetts of the Common Core.

1328
01:55:16,683 --> 01:55:17,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're not.

1329
01:55:17,624 --> 01:55:20,244
[SPEAKER_11]: They're based on the Common Core, but there's an awful lot added back in.

1330
01:55:20,744 --> 01:55:29,827
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that was added back in right away is the pre-K standards, because many states don't have pre-K education, so they were absent from the Common Core.

1331
01:55:29,847 --> 01:55:30,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're right back in.

1332
01:55:31,227 --> 01:55:35,388
[SPEAKER_11]: We've added a lot more literature back in, a lot more references back in.

1333
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:44,891
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, if you really want to spend a significant time, you can take the Common Core as that sole document is and compare it.

1334
01:55:45,315 --> 01:55:55,163
[SPEAKER_11]: with our English Language Arts and Mathematics Frameworks from Massachusetts, and you can see the expansion of the common core that we now have as the basis of our framework.

1335
01:55:55,203 --> 01:56:01,368
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll take any questions before I go on the national tour that the superintendent is sending me on, I guess.

1336
01:56:01,768 --> 01:56:02,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the committee?

1337
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:04,411
No.

1338
01:56:04,631 --> 01:56:05,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a comment.

1339
01:56:05,331 --> 01:56:06,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. D. Benetene.

1340
01:56:06,933 --> 01:56:09,775
[SPEAKER_14]: At almost every meeting that we talk about,

1341
01:56:10,593 --> 01:56:18,535
[SPEAKER_14]: We have groups of teachers that look at the frameworks and break them down into ways that they're interesting and learning experiences for our students.

1342
01:56:18,575 --> 01:56:27,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that Dr. Riccardelli and yourself and Dr. Chiesa do that constantly throughout the district.

1343
01:56:27,418 --> 01:56:38,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think people get that understanding piece, that we take those ideas and we break them down and we bring them into the classroom so children can learn from it.

1344
01:56:38,457 --> 01:56:40,758
[SPEAKER_14]: And those are the expectations for each grade level.

1345
01:56:41,258 --> 01:56:49,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really simple that that's the expectation for every third grade student throughout the Commonwealth, and that they all should reach that thing.

1346
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:54,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not as big or difficult as all the words sound like it is.

1347
01:56:54,662 --> 01:57:03,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just making sure that all the students at a certain age or grade meet certain requirements before they move on to the next grade.

1348
01:57:03,664 --> 01:57:05,845
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we do a great job of that in MedFit.

1349
01:57:06,465 --> 01:57:09,306
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know it's because a lot of the work that you're doing.

1350
01:57:09,326 --> 01:57:12,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Riccadeli has put a lot of work in with her team of curriculum directors.

1351
01:57:12,227 --> 01:57:16,228
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know she wants to speak to all the different things that have happened.

1352
01:57:16,268 --> 01:57:22,469
[SPEAKER_11]: But one of the things you look at, if you take one of the standards, you'll say, wow, there's a lot of stuff in here.

1353
01:57:22,829 --> 01:57:25,030
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the first things we do is unpack the standards.

1354
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:30,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So we take that one humongous standard, and we break it down into manageable parts.

1355
01:57:30,852 --> 01:57:32,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Teachers have developed lesson plans.

1356
01:57:32,632 --> 01:57:35,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dr. Riccadeli, do you want to come up and speak to some of your work?

1357
01:57:36,282 --> 01:57:40,505
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why, you know, I think it's important to stay this course.

1358
01:57:41,045 --> 01:57:51,473
[SPEAKER_11]: The Common Core, our frameworks, I think, are very solid and our teachers are very invested in what they've done because it's not just Dr. Riccadeli and Mrs. Joy and Dr. Chiesa.

1359
01:57:51,813 --> 01:57:58,238
[SPEAKER_11]: It's teams of teachers that have been doing lesson plans and unpacking the standards and making them manageable as

1360
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:00,794
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, we want to do for all of our students.

1361
01:58:00,854 --> 01:58:03,218
[SPEAKER_11]: So Bernadette, if you want to speak to some of your work.

1362
01:58:04,139 --> 01:58:04,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1363
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And the work continues, as Beverly mentioned.

1364
01:58:07,485 --> 01:58:10,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's continuously evolving.

1365
01:58:13,578 --> 01:58:18,339
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's a pretty cumbersome process to go through and to unpack those standards and come up with lessons.

1366
01:58:19,419 --> 01:58:23,840
[SPEAKER_12]: It continues, and we hope to continue this in the, with the new science frameworks that come out.

1367
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:40,744
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could just add something about some of the criticism for the Common Core is rooted in political philosophy, and it has to do with the thought that the Common Core is, they're federal, they're federal curriculum frameworks.

1368
01:58:41,124 --> 01:58:43,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you know, they're not.

1369
01:58:44,425 --> 01:58:50,708
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing federal about them was the race to the top money that kind of stimulated their growth and our accepting of them.

1370
01:58:51,328 --> 01:58:56,370
[SPEAKER_12]: But education policy still is directed on the state level, not on the federal level.

1371
01:58:56,770 --> 01:59:08,175
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you look at the criticism of the Common Core, that's where I see at least much of that criticism emanating from, is that political philosophy bent towards no federal intervention.

1372
01:59:08,895 --> 01:59:09,995
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to add that.

1373
01:59:12,013 --> 01:59:16,797
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Mrs. D. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Scarapelli, that the report be accepted and placed on file.

1374
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:17,598
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1375
01:59:17,618 --> 01:59:17,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1376
01:59:18,078 --> 01:59:18,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1377
01:59:18,759 --> 01:59:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

1378
01:59:20,781 --> 01:59:22,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your very thorough report.

1379
01:59:23,563 --> 01:59:27,166
[SPEAKER_06]: The next item is the report on professional day, November 3rd, 2015.

1380
01:59:28,207 --> 01:59:30,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent.

1381
01:59:30,309 --> 01:59:37,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chairperson, members of the committee, we have a professional day coming up on November 4th, November 3rd rather.

1382
01:59:40,586 --> 01:59:43,427
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be nervous.

1383
01:59:43,447 --> 01:59:44,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an extra day, Roy.

1384
01:59:44,467 --> 01:59:47,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know.

1385
01:59:47,248 --> 01:59:47,648
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a day.

1386
01:59:47,688 --> 01:59:50,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

1387
01:59:50,309 --> 01:59:51,989
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a professional day coming up.

1388
01:59:52,809 --> 01:59:56,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernadette's going to give you a very extensive report.

1389
01:59:57,571 --> 02:00:08,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Diane, Beverly, Kathy, all the department heads have contributed to trying to develop this, working with the teachers to come up with things that are meaningful to the individuals there.

1390
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:15,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bernadette's going to go through it for you, and I think there's a lot of value to what's going to happen on that day.

1391
02:00:16,743 --> 02:00:17,724
[SPEAKER_12]: So good evening.

1392
02:00:17,944 --> 02:00:19,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So this has been a joint effort.

1393
02:00:19,385 --> 02:00:22,446
[SPEAKER_12]: It certainly has not been me planning this by myself.

1394
02:00:23,127 --> 02:00:33,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Just this morning, Captain Medaglio, Diane Caldwell, Beverly, and I were meeting just to finalize our program for November 3rd.

1395
02:00:34,234 --> 02:00:43,226
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first of two professional development days for the 2015-16 school year for educators will take place on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2015.

1396
02:00:43,926 --> 02:00:48,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Classes will not be in session and therefore students will not report to school on this day.

1397
02:00:49,605 --> 02:00:59,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford High School will be the site for the majority of the day's activities, which include district initiative topics in educator evaluation, technology, and student information systems.

1398
02:01:00,572 --> 02:01:07,416
[SPEAKER_12]: The McGlynn Middle School will host a smaller group of educators for the safety care behavioral safety training program.

1399
02:01:09,534 --> 02:01:14,277
[SPEAKER_12]: So pre-K-12 educators will be divided into four different grade level groups.

1400
02:01:14,737 --> 02:01:16,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Pre-K-2, grades 3-5, grades 6-8, and grades 9-12.

1401
02:01:16,218 --> 02:01:18,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And they will rotate among the following four workshops in 75 minute intervals.

1402
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:32,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Educator Evaluation Workshop will be led by myself and Paul DeLeva.

1403
02:01:33,544 --> 02:01:34,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We will lead it.

1404
02:01:34,685 --> 02:01:47,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Members of the Joint Labor Management Committee, which is comprised of other administrators and teachers from the MTA, will guide teachers in the examination of artifacts as they are used in the evaluation process.

1405
02:01:48,734 --> 02:01:54,558
[SPEAKER_12]: The goal of this workshop is to enhance educators' understanding of the expectations for evidence.

1406
02:01:56,170 --> 02:02:06,813
[SPEAKER_12]: The presenters will guide teachers in the process of contextualizing that evidence, in other words, providing meaning to each piece of evidence and why it's important, why it represents their work as professionals.

1407
02:02:07,933 --> 02:02:14,375
[SPEAKER_12]: And to contextualize that evidence for their SMART goals for each one of the standards involved in the evaluation process.

1408
02:02:15,175 --> 02:02:20,557
[SPEAKER_12]: The facilitators will also provide a review of the various educator plans and the process overall.

1409
02:02:21,057 --> 02:02:34,890
[SPEAKER_12]: So this new, it's not new anymore, but this educator evaluation system that we are involved with is fairly cumbersome and there's a lot to learn.

1410
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:39,414
[SPEAKER_12]: We've done several professional development workshops, but we're finding that more is needed.

1411
02:02:39,775 --> 02:02:44,539
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we are embarking on this workshop, this topic on November 3rd.

1412
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Another training is TeachPoint training.

1413
02:02:49,704 --> 02:02:59,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin Andrews, the principal of the Brooks Elementary School, and Curtis Tudin, who is our data manager and system administrator for TeachPoint, will lead in this workshop.

1414
02:03:00,015 --> 02:03:04,881
[SPEAKER_12]: They will also be assisted by some members of the Joint Labor Management Committee.

1415
02:03:05,581 --> 02:03:18,372
[SPEAKER_12]: They are going to further instruct educators on how to upload evidence to the site and how to tag it, which is a wonderful feature to link each piece of evidence to a specific standard indicator.

1416
02:03:19,072 --> 02:03:27,820
[SPEAKER_12]: They will teach them to tag that information so that each article corresponds with a rubric, standard indicator, and element.

1417
02:03:29,204 --> 02:03:40,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin and Curtis will also review other features of the TeachPoint system, such as editing forms, generating reports, and accessing help features available on the system site.

1418
02:03:41,033 --> 02:03:47,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Curtis Tudin and I did much of the training during the month of September on TeachPoint.

1419
02:03:47,597 --> 02:03:53,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin Andrews and Suzanne Galussi also did some of the training as they were engaged in a pilot last year.

1420
02:03:54,562 --> 02:03:56,484
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the initial round of training.

1421
02:03:57,564 --> 02:03:59,326
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our second round of training.

1422
02:03:59,346 --> 02:04:05,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Curtis and I have been fielding a lot of phone calls, a lot of questions from people over the course of the past month.

1423
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:13,816
[SPEAKER_12]: We think we're in a good place with TeachPoint, but it is going to take time until everyone feels 100% comfortable working with this system.

1424
02:04:15,917 --> 02:04:25,241
[SPEAKER_12]: A third workshop on that day at Medford High School will be on School Brains, our new student information system.

1425
02:04:25,781 --> 02:04:34,044
[SPEAKER_12]: So the goal of this workshop is to provide educators an introduction to the newly adopted student and data management system known as School Brains, as you know.

1426
02:04:34,704 --> 02:04:43,808
[SPEAKER_12]: The various features of the system include its student information system, gradebook, nursing and health applications, standardized test assessment and analysis ability,

1427
02:04:44,268 --> 02:04:46,110
[SPEAKER_12]: and curriculum mapping system.

1428
02:04:47,051 --> 02:04:49,253
[SPEAKER_12]: All will be highlighted at this overview training.

1429
02:04:49,633 --> 02:04:58,081
[SPEAKER_12]: So like TeachPoint, there are going to need to be a series of trainings with school brains, this being the first for the general teacher population.

1430
02:04:59,108 --> 02:05:01,909
[SPEAKER_12]: A fourth workshop is technology related.

1431
02:05:01,969 --> 02:05:05,111
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be on Apple TV iPad training.

1432
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:10,293
[SPEAKER_12]: It will focus on how to effectively integrate technology into the classroom.

1433
02:05:10,893 --> 02:05:23,259
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be led by Allison Goldsberry and a group of educators she has recruited from within the district to facilitate in these workshops that will be broken down into smaller groups.

1434
02:05:23,399 --> 02:05:27,881
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we have eight workshops that will be occurring during this segment.

1435
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:32,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1436
02:05:32,831 --> 02:05:35,252
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be several workshops for teachers to choose from.

1437
02:05:35,352 --> 02:05:44,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Topics include the following, the basics, flipping the classroom, science activities, formative assessments, media creation to demonstrate knowledge, and presentation.

1438
02:05:44,917 --> 02:05:52,340
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, those are the different workshops that Allison is organizing within that larger context of Apple TV slash iPad training.

1439
02:05:53,837 --> 02:06:04,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Over at the McGlynn Middle School, we will be hosting a day-long behavioral management program for 80 educators, including paraprofessionals, teachers, and all assistant principals.

1440
02:06:06,766 --> 02:06:08,747
[SPEAKER_12]: The following is a description of the program.

1441
02:06:08,767 --> 02:06:11,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So the name of the program, this is taken right from their website.

1442
02:06:11,969 --> 02:06:13,070
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a trademark program.

1443
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:16,072
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Safety Care Behavioral Safety Training Program.

1444
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:30,909
[SPEAKER_12]: The safety care, this program provides the skills and competencies necessary to effectively prevent, minimize, and manage behavioral challenges with dignity, safety, and the possibility of change.

1445
02:06:31,349 --> 02:06:37,272
[SPEAKER_12]: So the key to this program is that it's instrumental in preventing negative behaviors.

1446
02:06:38,293 --> 02:06:44,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Using the newest and most effective technologies from applied behavior analysis,

1447
02:06:44,827 --> 02:06:47,369
[SPEAKER_12]: and positive behavior interventions and support.

1448
02:06:47,849 --> 02:06:57,736
[SPEAKER_12]: This program is supposed to provide our staff with strategies not only for preventing and managing behavioral challenges but also to effectively teach replacement behaviors.

1449
02:07:00,458 --> 02:07:04,821
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the district administrators will also participate in the professional development day.

1450
02:07:05,222 --> 02:07:12,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Some will be participants in the safety care behavioral training program and others will facilitate the various workshops.

1451
02:07:13,943 --> 02:07:18,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I've identified some of the key people who will lead those workshops.

1452
02:07:18,607 --> 02:07:22,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, other administrators will be participants in different ways.

1453
02:07:22,851 --> 02:07:29,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Additional workshops for paraprofessionals and curriculum support and effective communication strategies will be offered also on November 3rd.

1454
02:07:30,738 --> 02:07:37,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Speech pathologists and occupational therapists will attend the advanced augmentative communication training.

1455
02:07:38,219 --> 02:07:45,426
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important to us to get feedback from educators, so all professional development offerings include an opportunity for educator feedback.

1456
02:07:46,227 --> 02:07:54,174
[SPEAKER_12]: This feedback is important to the district as it is used to adjust future offerings to ensure that the district's offerings meet the needs of our staff.

1457
02:07:55,055 --> 02:07:59,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Attached to the report, you have a, it's a draft of a program.

1458
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:01,057
[SPEAKER_12]: We are still in the process of putting this together.

1459
02:08:01,077 --> 02:08:04,118
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be filled in with, with more information.

1460
02:08:04,798 --> 02:08:07,759
[SPEAKER_12]: But we, this is what we will be handing out to people.

1461
02:08:07,839 --> 02:08:13,080
[SPEAKER_12]: We want them to see this as a program that we, we put a lot of thought in putting this together.

1462
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:22,603
[SPEAKER_12]: That especially when it comes to teacher evaluation and teach point, the two workshops are going to be well coordinated and, and they will complement each other.

1463
02:08:23,799 --> 02:08:27,061
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.

1464
02:08:27,782 --> 02:08:30,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. DiBenedetto, do you have a question?

1465
02:08:30,403 --> 02:08:33,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a comment, two questions.

1466
02:08:33,725 --> 02:08:52,537
[SPEAKER_14]: One, with school points overview, could you just remember that the importance that the committee feels that using this technology to use it as an outreach to parents about grades and about any type of homework and assignments is really going to be expected of them?

1467
02:08:53,374 --> 02:08:53,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1468
02:08:54,014 --> 02:08:59,878
[SPEAKER_14]: We just, I just really think that that's an important piece to keep in mind from day one in moving forward.

1469
02:09:00,278 --> 02:09:03,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And my second is not directly to you, it's to the superintendent.

1470
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:18,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is great that we have professional development day for our teaching staff, but do we have anything for our administrative staff, like overviews on upgraded technologies that they might be using, like, like the admin assistance,

1471
02:09:18,968 --> 02:09:34,772
[SPEAKER_14]: the secretaries at our schools, those type of people, they deserve the thought process that we give to our other staff and that there are ways and classes and things that they can use this time as well.

1472
02:09:34,812 --> 02:09:46,195
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we're not thinking about it for this day, I think we should think about that for future and make them feel valued and important and that their job moves and changes as well as the teaching staff's job

1473
02:09:46,888 --> 02:09:49,289
[SPEAKER_14]: does and the expectations of the system as well.

1474
02:09:49,549 --> 02:09:52,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you'll note, the paraprofessionals are part of the professional day.

1475
02:09:53,050 --> 02:10:01,072
[SPEAKER_00]: The secretaries have been going through some different programs with Pat Vuey on different things they're going to do and different programs they're using.

1476
02:10:02,893 --> 02:10:09,575
[SPEAKER_00]: The custodians, we're talking about some techniques to help them do their job a little bit better.

1477
02:10:09,595 --> 02:10:12,016
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some of that moving at this point in time.

1478
02:10:14,043 --> 02:10:24,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're, you know, we're cognizant of the fact that support staff plays a very valuable role, and they need upgrades and updates on a regular basis, and especially the use of materials.

1479
02:10:24,807 --> 02:10:29,729
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a custodian, you know, what materials are appropriate to use, what materials are inappropriate to use.

1480
02:10:29,749 --> 02:10:36,472
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the wrong material on a surface, you might get it clean, but you might also damage the surface.

1481
02:10:37,227 --> 02:10:38,410
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to deal with toxicity.

1482
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:39,852
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to deal with all kinds of things.

1483
02:10:39,892 --> 02:10:48,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of this stuff in motion, and we do it not always as formally as this day, because this is a full day, but we certainly do it.

1484
02:10:49,184 --> 02:10:57,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well I'm hoping moving forward when we have professional development that it's school wide and not just for our faculty and in that manner.

1485
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:02,214
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just something to think about, even a plan for, possibly for next year.

1486
02:11:02,494 --> 02:11:07,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure there are Windows updates or different programs.

1487
02:11:07,778 --> 02:11:12,141
[SPEAKER_14]: When we transfer over to the new program,

1488
02:11:12,849 --> 02:11:21,573
[SPEAKER_14]: The school brains, the training, maybe that needs to be introduced to all the administrative staff and all the people that that is going to be changed over.

1489
02:11:21,673 --> 02:11:26,935
[SPEAKER_14]: So if someone calls about their child's attendance, they're going to have to know how to use that program.

1490
02:11:26,955 --> 02:11:31,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we need to initiate that type of training now before we just switch it over.

1491
02:11:31,957 --> 02:11:35,859
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just want to think about the whole picture and not just the teachers.

1492
02:11:36,259 --> 02:11:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1493
02:11:36,799 --> 02:11:40,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we're a whole wide system and everybody that works here is of value.

1494
02:11:40,921 --> 02:11:42,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Except the paper place on Bob's gym.

1495
02:11:43,568 --> 02:11:45,972
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to the educated feedback, what is that?

1496
02:11:45,992 --> 02:11:46,353
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

1497
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:59,652
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that opportunity given to the educators to feedback?

1498
02:11:59,692 --> 02:12:00,913
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of each workshop.

1499
02:12:00,933 --> 02:12:01,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1500
02:12:01,754 --> 02:12:07,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So in this case, what we usually do is at the end of the day, each workshop is 75 minutes.

1501
02:12:07,818 --> 02:12:10,240
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it usually takes people a few minutes.

1502
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:13,102
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to take too much time away from each workshop.

1503
02:12:13,202 --> 02:12:15,123
[SPEAKER_12]: So the plan is to have it at the end of the day.

1504
02:12:15,683 --> 02:12:17,885
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, by the next day we'll have

1505
02:12:18,596 --> 02:12:20,478
[SPEAKER_12]: have information on this.

1506
02:12:22,199 --> 02:12:24,521
[SPEAKER_12]: We did it with the new teacher training program.

1507
02:12:24,601 --> 02:12:28,725
[SPEAKER_12]: We got the information right away, and I found it very useful, especially for myself.

1508
02:12:28,785 --> 02:12:41,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I ran the educator evaluation workshop, so just taking some of that feedback from the new teachers and incorporating it, although it's not the workshop, into what I'm going to do for November 3rd, for me, I think it's going to be very useful.

1509
02:12:44,942 --> 02:12:46,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's good.

1510
02:12:46,684 --> 02:13:00,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my question is with regard to something like Apple iPad training, so something like that, do you follow up at some point during the year, maybe like four or five months later with the educators and say, you know, how are you using this in the classroom?

1511
02:13:00,335 --> 02:13:02,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you using this in the classroom?

1512
02:13:02,137 --> 02:13:08,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to get some feedback as far as, I mean, they're there every day, so just to kind of see how they're using it in their classroom.

1513
02:13:08,022 --> 02:13:09,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we follow up then to see

1514
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:11,311
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer is yes.

1515
02:13:11,531 --> 02:13:15,013
[SPEAKER_12]: And the person who has been doing that is Alison Goldsberry.

1516
02:13:15,233 --> 02:13:19,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And she does, she has a pretty significant collection of data on what she's done so far.

1517
02:13:19,876 --> 02:13:19,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1518
02:13:20,036 --> 02:13:29,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we certainly can get that and, and we will get that and reflect upon that beyond what we do for this November 3rd PD day.

1519
02:13:29,761 --> 02:13:30,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

1520
02:13:30,202 --> 02:13:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1521
02:13:30,662 --> 02:13:31,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the committee?

1522
02:13:32,863 --> 02:13:32,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1523
02:13:32,983 --> 02:13:33,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1524
02:13:33,223 --> 02:13:37,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And the motion of Mr. Skerry seconded by Mrs. D Benedetto that the paper be accepted and placed on file.

1525
02:13:37,666 --> 02:13:38,546
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1526
02:13:38,806 --> 02:13:38,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1527
02:13:39,007 --> 02:13:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1528
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:41,401
[SPEAKER_06]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

1529
02:13:41,541 --> 02:13:42,322

1533
02:13:54,433 --> 02:14:00,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in good shape, but I'll let her go over some of the details, and if you have any questions, I'm sure we'll answer them for you.

1534
02:14:01,191 --> 02:14:01,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1535
02:14:01,811 --> 02:14:08,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Before I get started, I'd like to announce that we are having PD Day for the Administrative Assistant Staff Secretaries, and it's a half a day that day.

1536

[SPEAKER_15]: And our title is Work Smarter, Not Harder.

1537
02:14:12,677 --> 02:14:13,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I love it.

1538
02:14:13,398 --> 02:14:13,598
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

[SPEAKER_15]: The numbers and totals will fluctuate as families are added or changed programming.

1552
02:15:29,596 --> 02:15:32,937
[SPEAKER_15]: The second online payment program offered is MCC.

1553
02:15:33,757 --> 02:15:38,798
[SPEAKER_15]: MCC is a fee-based online payment program providing for payments to the after-school program

1560
02:16:20,733 --> 02:16:28,120
[SPEAKER_15]: The district is working toward a cashless payment system, which will improve collection rates and meet dual control audit expectations.

1561
02:16:28,921 --> 02:16:34,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Revenue generated by the above programs is part of the MPS budget plan, of which we are on target for.

02:17:38,424 --> 02:17:40,705

1575
02:17:41,165 --> 02:17:47,808
[SPEAKER_15]: We have augmented iPads, Androids, and computers to ensure that all planned labs and new personnel are adequately equipped.

1576
02:17:48,488 --> 02:17:56,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Training sessions and mentors are forming to complement the implementation of the new student information management systems, SIMS, which is school brains.

1577
02:17:57,733 --> 02:18:02,295

1580
02:18:10,354 --> 02:18:16,918
[SPEAKER_15]: 10% require evaluation to determine need, location, and potential replacement with the items currently in the quote process.

1581
02:18:17,978 --> 02:18:18,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Telephones.

1582
02:18:18,999 --> 02:18:24,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Training is in place for the Andrews, and the building will port over October 19th from Verizon.

1583
02:18:25,262 --> 02:18:31,285
[SPEAKER_15]: The Columbus is scheduled for installation October 23 and 24 and port over from Verizon on October 29th.

1584
02:18:32,165 --> 02:18:34,487

1585
02:18:35,882 --> 02:18:38,243
[SPEAKER_15]: We're porting from Verizon on November 5th.

1586
02:18:38,764 --> 02:18:45,807
[SPEAKER_15]: When I say porting, that is the actual physical movement of our lines, which then stops our payment process at Verizon.

1587
02:18:46,348 --> 02:18:51,130
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have to keep the minimum fax lines and alarm lines still on Verizon.

1588
02:18:52,731 --> 02:18:57,534
[SPEAKER_15]: The final building to convert is the high school, and we are on target for our December timeline.

1589
02:18:58,074 --> 02:19:05,098
[SPEAKER_15]: The telephone transition success can be attributed to our vendor, DSCI Comtel, and their representative, Michael Loria.

1590
02:19:05,639 --> 02:19:07,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And MPS is Allen Arena.

1591
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:24,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Allen has been integral to the VoIP telephone implementation process by working with our vendor, our backup internet provider, and the buildings provide a system with backup internet should our main provider, Verizon, provided through Meramec Education doing business as addition networks fail for any reason.

1592
02:19:25,908 --> 02:19:26,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Transportation.

1593
02:19:27,389 --> 02:19:30,691
[SPEAKER_15]: MPS utilizes 18 buses running 2 a.m.

1594
02:19:30,731 --> 02:19:31,751
[SPEAKER_15]: routes and 2 p.m.

1595
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:32,832

[SPEAKER_15]: Clement's, Minuteman, and MPS routes that pick up at 229 stops.

1600
02:19:42,315 --> 02:19:44,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Routes have been reviewed for use in crowding.

1601
02:19:45,056 --> 02:19:52,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, no stops have been removed, but some have been adjusted for safety concerns, timing, or to minimize crowding.

1602
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,561
[SPEAKER_15]: The website has the current routes posted.

1603
02:19:56,292 --> 02:20:05,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Routes are running on time, and we are ready for winter with the exception of the Brooks Route Number 8, which runs in an area where the greatest amount of road construction is ongoing.

1604
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:07,441
[SPEAKER_15]: When the roads are open, we are on time.

1605
02:20:07,741 --> 02:20:09,382
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, we are still seeing delays.

1606
02:20:10,623 --> 02:20:11,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Utilities.

1607
02:20:11,724 --> 02:20:14,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Heating season has begun, and heat is on in the buildings.

1608
02:20:15,327 --> 02:20:20,151
[SPEAKER_15]: National Grid is currently our national gas supplier and distributor, and we are not contracted.

1609
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:28,865
[SPEAKER_15]: The city of Medford relies on a consultant to monitor the market, and when they priced our loads specifically, the rates all came back above 60 cents a therm.

1610
02:20:29,625 --> 02:20:38,751
[SPEAKER_15]: National grid's rate is .5334 per therm, which is lower than anything the UMG consultant can secure for us.

1611
02:20:39,511 --> 02:20:44,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, helps us oversee our energy procurement.

1612
02:20:45,915 --> 02:20:49,938
[SPEAKER_15]: NPS will continue to monitor with the city and act should pricing begin to edge up.

1613
02:20:50,635 --> 02:20:53,417
[SPEAKER_15]: National Grid electric supplies and delivers our electricity.

1614
02:20:53,997 --> 02:20:56,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sorry, but the Great Eastern is no longer true.

1615
02:20:57,059 --> 02:20:59,140
[SPEAKER_15]: We are still all the way with National Grid.

1616
02:20:59,601 --> 02:21:03,743
[SPEAKER_15]: And our contract rate is 0.16 kilowatts through November 2016.

1617
02:21:05,004 --> 02:21:06,405
[SPEAKER_15]: We are contracted for that.

1618
02:21:07,386 --> 02:21:13,510
[SPEAKER_15]: In closing, the first quarter of the school year is busy with grant closeouts and preparation to complete the state's end of year report.

1619
02:21:14,370 --> 02:21:16,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Fiscal FY16 is progressing as expected.

1620
02:21:17,433 --> 02:21:20,654
[SPEAKER_15]: And MPS will move forward with continued monitoring of the budget.

1621
02:21:21,655 --> 02:21:22,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Questions?

1622
02:21:22,555 --> 02:21:23,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1623
02:21:23,515 --> 02:21:24,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thank you, Pat.

1624
02:21:24,736 --> 02:21:25,636
[SPEAKER_14]: This is excellent.

1625
02:21:26,036 --> 02:21:27,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a few questions.

1626
02:21:27,257 --> 02:21:39,141
[SPEAKER_14]: On the summer school program, you said that the fees that we are accepted with $39,980, which offsets the cost of our teachers.

1627
02:21:39,501 --> 02:21:42,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know if we run that program in the red or in the black?

1628
02:21:45,056 --> 02:21:50,240
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent's philosophy is that we try to provide education for all children who need it in the summertime.

1629
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And our demographic during that time period does usually need some assistance.

1630
02:21:55,803 --> 02:21:58,946
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the community schools program does offset that cost.

1631
02:21:59,686 --> 02:21:59,786
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1632
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:06,921
[SPEAKER_14]: That brings me to my other question, and it's not to you, it's to the superintendent.

1633
02:22:07,361 --> 02:22:22,844
[SPEAKER_14]: We asked a few weeks ago if we could see the community school's budget, and that would be included of what we used last year and what we projected, like the other budget that we had seen, and also where we are so far this year, an update on that.

1634
02:22:24,085 --> 02:22:30,886
[SPEAKER_14]: We also requested the budget for the fields in school rentals, like what income is coming in,

1635
02:22:31,379 --> 02:22:40,423
[SPEAKER_14]: what upgrades we've made to those facilities, what we're charging at each school, and at each location, and at each field.

1636
02:22:41,404 --> 02:22:45,486
[SPEAKER_14]: All of that information was requested, and I'm asking for that again.

1637
02:22:45,946 --> 02:22:55,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So going back to you, Pat, is you said that the technology, the cameras, 10% required, and we're in the bidding process right now.

1638
02:22:55,671 --> 02:22:57,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have an idea of when that will be completed?

1639
02:22:59,393 --> 02:23:02,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, right now I do know that Allen arena is searching out vendors.

1640
02:23:03,576 --> 02:23:11,440
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be really nice to stay with the current security cameras that we have because then we can, some of these really don't need replacing.

1641
02:23:11,921 --> 02:23:12,781
[SPEAKER_15]: They need upgrades.

1642
02:23:12,861 --> 02:23:14,863
[SPEAKER_15]: They need maybe new shields that are fogged.

1643
02:23:15,343 --> 02:23:15,443
Right.

1644
02:23:15,863 --> 02:23:22,827
[SPEAKER_15]: And um, so it's taking a little bit more time to research them out, but um, it is, it's definitely on our gold list for the immediate future.

1645
02:23:23,168 --> 02:23:23,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

1646
02:23:23,888 --> 02:23:24,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1647
02:23:24,809 --> 02:23:25,809
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my only question.

1648
02:23:26,089 --> 02:23:26,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry.

1649
02:23:28,115 --> 02:23:34,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we report on our unemployment payments paid out status?

1650
02:23:35,417 --> 02:23:36,397
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we running?

1651
02:23:37,697 --> 02:23:40,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Above or below what we appropriate?

1652
02:23:40,578 --> 02:23:44,599
[SPEAKER_15]: The figures are in your budget pages right here, but I will have to look at where we were a year ago.

1653
02:23:44,619 --> 02:23:45,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1654
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:52,581
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, a question regarding the crossing guard on the Fellsway.

1655
02:23:53,997 --> 02:23:58,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any resolution to that, or has the DCR responded?

1656
02:23:59,059 --> 02:24:09,363
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of like a ping pong game, and I have sent it back over the net, and I provided her with the number of children that get on along the Fellsway at different stops.

1657
02:24:09,423 --> 02:24:13,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the question is, we no longer have children at what used to be the St.

1658
02:24:13,805 --> 02:24:14,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Francis stop.

1659
02:24:15,606 --> 02:24:21,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason for that is that we have moved the children up and down the Fellsway to keep them closer to their homes.

1660
02:24:22,332 --> 02:24:24,933
[SPEAKER_15]: so that they're not crossing that thoroughfare by themselves.

1661
02:24:25,274 --> 02:24:26,274
[SPEAKER_15]: They can at least be in view.

1662
02:24:27,115 --> 02:24:33,638
[SPEAKER_15]: So it took her a little while to understand that we weren't using the old stop, but what we had done was better for our families.

1663
02:24:34,139 --> 02:24:41,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they could provide us back with the crossing guard, we would like to put that crossing guard at the point where it can be most used.

1664
02:24:41,503 --> 02:24:41,543
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1665
02:24:42,923 --> 02:24:46,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible, just because it'd be nice to get this resolved.

1666
02:24:47,666 --> 02:24:49,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're working hard on this.

1667
02:24:49,933 --> 02:24:57,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've talked about it going back and forth, but maybe if we get Representative Donato involved to see if maybe he could talk.

1668
02:24:57,136 --> 02:25:00,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had talked to him, but I'll follow up.

1669
02:25:00,598 --> 02:25:02,039
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, perfect.

1670
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:03,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1671
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:04,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1672
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:09,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have one more question, not directed towards you, but towards the superintendent.

1673
02:25:10,243 --> 02:25:13,284
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we were going to go over the old instruments at some point.

1674
02:25:13,324 --> 02:25:15,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't we have a comment on the old instruments?

1675
02:25:15,425 --> 02:25:16,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Musical instruments.

1676
02:25:16,266 --> 02:25:18,427
[SPEAKER_07]: The antiques that we had at one point

1677
02:25:19,558 --> 02:25:24,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought that again, you know, it's, uh, it really depends.

1678
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:28,462
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep talking to people, we get different opinions as to the value, whether we get enough for them.

1679
02:25:29,382 --> 02:25:32,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some people feel we should preserve them.

1680
02:25:32,344 --> 02:25:35,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we can give you another update on, on, on what we think the value is.

1681
02:25:35,945 --> 02:25:39,847
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we go to auction or we go to sell, we may not get that value.

1682
02:25:40,567 --> 02:25:47,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, but there, there is a piece of history there that needs to be utilized and they could be played.

1683
02:25:47,933 --> 02:25:49,514
[SPEAKER_14]: by people that could appreciate them.

1684
02:25:49,534 --> 02:25:56,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure that the instruments we're talking about are playable by the level of student that we have.

1685
02:25:56,821 --> 02:25:57,662
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be one that's not.

1686
02:25:57,682 --> 02:26:00,444
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't mean for our students, like in the world.

1687
02:26:00,464 --> 02:26:01,805
[SPEAKER_14]: They should be out there.

1688
02:26:01,825 --> 02:26:04,188
[SPEAKER_14]: They shouldn't be in a room collecting dust.

1689
02:26:04,408 --> 02:26:07,811
[SPEAKER_00]: That remains a question, because we've had professionals look at it.

1690
02:26:08,511 --> 02:26:14,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And some say they would need some substantial work for them to be usable by an experienced professional.

1691
02:26:14,812 --> 02:26:26,064
[SPEAKER_14]: But there might be people that generally want that and to put that work into it and to have that in their collection, rather than in our room, collecting dust that we're not utilizing.

1692
02:26:26,504 --> 02:26:30,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to see them sitting there and not being cared for well.

1693
02:26:31,269 --> 02:26:33,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I really believe that

1694
02:26:34,028 --> 02:26:41,033
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not the right place for them to be, and that they should be appreciated by people who would really value their thing.

1695
02:26:41,053 --> 02:26:43,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wealth could come back to the community.

1696
02:26:43,075 --> 02:26:46,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we give you another report on that, and you tell us what you want to do as a group, OK?

1697
02:26:46,738 --> 02:26:47,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be great.

1698
02:26:47,458 --> 02:26:47,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1699
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:50,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Cunha.

1700
02:26:50,281 --> 02:26:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a point of clarification.

1701
02:26:51,702 --> 02:27:01,369
[SPEAKER_04]: When Mr. Benedetto had asked about the program being in the black, are you talking about the summer fund program, or are you talking about the summer school program?

1702
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer school.

1703
02:27:03,808 --> 02:27:05,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to make sure it was clear.

1704
02:27:05,769 --> 02:27:06,529
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

1705
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:09,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one more thing, Mr. Superintendent, about the instruments.

1706
02:27:09,451 --> 02:27:15,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to have an inventory and a list of all the, like I think you had that, but could you present that to us again?

1707
02:27:16,014 --> 02:27:18,616
[SPEAKER_14]: A list of all the instruments that are there.

1708
02:27:19,996 --> 02:27:27,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you put it together in the past, if you could find that, or re-inventory, make sure everything's still there and nothing's missing.

1709
02:27:29,051 --> 02:27:33,452
[SPEAKER_14]: We know what we have, so that way we can- The instruments that are, you mean the- Antique.

1710
02:27:33,732 --> 02:27:34,052
[SPEAKER_00]: The antique.

1711
02:27:34,072 --> 02:27:35,753
[SPEAKER_00]: The antique instruments or all instruments?

1712
02:27:36,213 --> 02:27:38,013
[SPEAKER_14]: The antique instruments at this point.

1713
02:27:38,573 --> 02:27:38,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1714
02:27:41,394 --> 02:27:43,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, I appreciate it.

1715
02:27:43,275 --> 02:27:44,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Those three reports.

1716
02:27:45,055 --> 02:27:46,335
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, one more question.

1717
02:27:46,355 --> 02:27:56,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any, as you, we're now, as we progress through the school year, any concerns, anything that you're worrying about with regard to the budget?

1718
02:27:57,579 --> 02:27:58,080
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no.

1719
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,481
[SPEAKER_15]: We're, we're progressing this plant.

1720
02:27:59,721 --> 02:28:00,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, good.

1721
02:28:00,382 --> 02:28:01,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Good to hear.

1722
02:28:01,142 --> 02:28:01,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1723
02:28:01,563 --> 02:28:03,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to pick up that question in January.

1724
02:28:06,247 --> 02:28:14,754
[SPEAKER_06]: The question that needs to be on the motion to Mr. Scarpelli, seconded by Mrs. Cugno that the report be accepted and placed on file.

1725
02:28:15,195 --> 02:28:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

1726
02:28:16,155 --> 02:28:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed.

1727
02:28:17,056 --> 02:28:18,838
[SPEAKER_06]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

1728
02:28:19,178 --> 02:28:19,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1729
02:28:26,190 --> 02:28:27,831
[SPEAKER_06]: negotiations and legal matters.

1730
02:28:27,851 --> 02:28:27,931
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

1731
02:28:28,572 --> 02:28:38,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, under old business resolution submitted by Hispanic group on October 5th, 2015 motion to accept it.

1732
02:28:38,739 --> 02:28:39,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1733
02:28:39,779 --> 02:28:43,202
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Mrs. Cugno to accept the resolution.

1734
02:28:43,842 --> 02:28:47,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, is there some second, second, seconded by Mr. Scarpelli.

1735
02:28:49,146 --> 02:28:50,327
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

1736
02:28:50,987 --> 02:28:51,728
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed.

1737
02:28:51,908 --> 02:28:52,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1738
02:28:52,648 --> 02:28:53,729
[SPEAKER_06]: The resolution is accepted.

1739
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:02,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Superintendent.

1740
02:29:02,953 --> 02:29:06,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave you two off gender items, actually three.

1741
02:29:06,614 --> 02:29:12,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to tell you what they are so that you can go over them and stay up because obviously they're in the public discourse.

1742
02:29:13,155 --> 02:29:21,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they're not immediate to you right now, they are immediate in terms of what's going on at the state house and what you need to know.

1743
02:29:21,478 --> 02:29:25,919
[SPEAKER_00]: The first item is the testimony at the joint legislative hearing on charter schools.

1744
02:29:26,427 --> 02:29:27,787
[SPEAKER_08]: You did a great job, by the way, Mr. Speaker.

1745
02:29:27,847 --> 02:29:28,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1746
02:29:28,668 --> 02:29:29,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1747
02:29:29,828 --> 02:29:33,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given you the testimony of the state auditor, which I thought was very compelling.

1748
02:29:34,529 --> 02:29:37,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've given you the testimony that I provided at this time.

1749
02:29:38,551 --> 02:29:50,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that we pay attention to this, because there are bills being filed that would increase the amount of charter schools available in the Commonwealth and could affect our community or any other community around us.

1750
02:29:50,574 --> 02:29:52,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they affect communities around us, youngsters could go.

1751
02:29:54,628 --> 02:30:09,301
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an indictment in any way, shape, or form of charter schools per se, but it's rather a statement that says, if you've only got so much money, you're already telling the public that the state budget is running behind by about $145 million.

1752
02:30:09,781 --> 02:30:13,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen Lepore has indicated that she's going to try to make up that money in the next few months.

1753
02:30:14,925 --> 02:30:18,208
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start expanding things, you start spreading it out even more.

1754
02:30:18,689 --> 02:30:22,472
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you spread it out even more, you're already $54 million behind.

1755
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:27,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our community, it costs us, and it will cost other communities as well.

1756
02:30:28,654 --> 02:30:34,498
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of charter schools is something to be debated, whether they're the right way to go and not the right way to go in ed reform.

1757
02:30:34,998 --> 02:30:39,601
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the case can be made that there are other interventions which would be more productive.

1758
02:30:40,162 --> 02:30:42,103
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the discourse will happen.

1759
02:30:42,123 --> 02:30:49,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, today, I read from the Statehouse News Service that the Senate will be caucusing on October 28.

1760
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:59,186
[SPEAKER_00]: as to whether they will take up a charter school bill this year, or whether they will just simply rely on a petition or the legal lawsuits that are going through on the outside.

1761
02:30:59,847 --> 02:31:05,832
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Senate demurs and says they're not going to take it up, that means the legislature will not take it up.

1762
02:31:06,532 --> 02:31:10,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the House may pass it, but if the Senate doesn't pass it, it's not going anywhere.

1763
02:31:11,917 --> 02:31:15,320
[SPEAKER_00]: If they decide to take up a bill, we don't know which bill they'll take up.

1764
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:18,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be very interesting as well, so we'll have to follow that.

1765
02:31:19,796 --> 02:31:21,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this is very fertile right now.

1766
02:31:22,537 --> 02:31:23,997
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of discussion is going on.

1767
02:31:24,357 --> 02:31:27,678
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important that you stay informed and you understand the debate.

1768
02:31:27,698 --> 02:31:29,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you read these two papers, I think you have a pretty good idea.

1769
02:31:30,679 --> 02:31:31,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing.

1770
02:31:32,299 --> 02:31:34,359
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is I gave you a handout tonight.

1771
02:31:34,379 --> 02:31:46,882
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an article in the Boston Business Journal that kind of tried to rank our MCAS scores, one community against the other.

1772
02:31:47,583 --> 02:31:49,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite frankly,

1773
02:31:50,232 --> 02:32:00,080
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flawed mechanism because it's using different metrics and putting them together and saying the total equals a rating.

1774
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:10,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not an acceptable way to understand what's going on, especially since we know, if you just simply look at socioeconomics, how schools will come out.

1775
02:32:10,508 --> 02:32:15,011
[SPEAKER_00]: You can predict which schools will be on top, which schools will be in the middle, and which schools will be towards the bottom.

1776
02:32:15,532 --> 02:32:17,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lawrence and Chelsea never catch up.

1777
02:32:18,294 --> 02:32:19,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And Weston and Wayland.

1778
02:32:20,175 --> 02:32:23,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard, places like that, are always on top.

1779
02:32:23,917 --> 02:32:29,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's really a faux reality to this kind of thing.

1780
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:37,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did want to give you something that would show you how we stack up against some of the area communities, to give you a little bit of comparison, as you were asking that the other day.

1781
02:32:38,164 --> 02:32:48,770
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at English language arts, our 92, this is 10th grade, the only thing that can be compared, puts us ahead of almost all the other urbans that we would compare to.

1782
02:32:49,757 --> 02:32:50,438
[SPEAKER_00]: demographically.

1783
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:58,846
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to compare myself to a community that doesn't have the demographics, doesn't have the ELL populations, doesn't have the SPED population, I'm kidding myself.

1784
02:32:59,807 --> 02:33:04,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't expect that we're going to get that kind of result.

1785
02:33:04,771 --> 02:33:10,517
[SPEAKER_00]: In mathematics, with the exception of Cambridge, we leave that back as well.

1786
02:33:11,498 --> 02:33:14,621
[SPEAKER_00]: In science, there's a dip there, but in science,

1787
02:33:15,711 --> 02:33:19,452
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is that who takes the science test, 9th grade, 10th grade, or 11th grade?

1788
02:33:19,472 --> 02:33:20,472
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three different tests.

1789
02:33:21,512 --> 02:33:23,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Our kids are taking it in the 9th grade.

1790
02:33:23,953 --> 02:33:26,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them have to take a different one in the 10th grade.

1791
02:33:26,853 --> 02:33:30,054
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, they've done well.

1792
02:33:30,674 --> 02:33:35,495
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the competency determination is at 220, not at 240.

1793
02:33:36,075 --> 02:33:41,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take 220 rather than 240, we virtually have almost everyone passing.

1794
02:33:42,437 --> 02:33:44,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So they meet the competency determination

1795
02:33:44,668 --> 02:33:55,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously have stuff to do, to work on, but I think you should know this so that if it comes up in discussion, you have information that you can share and feel confident that these are accurate numbers.

1796
02:33:57,354 --> 02:34:05,538
[SPEAKER_00]: On the second page, there's been some discussion recently in public discourse about the cleanliness of our buildings and the like.

1797
02:34:06,498 --> 02:34:08,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our buildings are pretty good overall.

1798
02:34:09,039 --> 02:34:10,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Our high school is 45 years old.

1799
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:13,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are some places that can use some improvement.

1800
02:34:13,744 --> 02:34:18,866
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, with our cleaning service, the custodians, and the work that's going in, a lot of improvements have been made.

1801
02:34:19,867 --> 02:34:22,588
[SPEAKER_00]: The sidewalks, which were criticized, have been repaired.

1802
02:34:23,189 --> 02:34:27,211
[SPEAKER_00]: The steps on the west courtyard are being finished off in the next two weeks.

1803
02:34:28,431 --> 02:34:31,192
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a little bit more to get the right bid in to do that.

1804
02:34:31,993 --> 02:34:34,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been any number of different projects.

1805
02:34:34,534 --> 02:34:40,037
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the things that have been done, you've got to ask yourself, this is quite significant.

1806
02:34:40,917 --> 02:34:42,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you think of all the facilities that have been

1807
02:34:43,770 --> 02:34:44,911
[SPEAKER_00]: upgraded and improved.

1808
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:47,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can be fairly proud that you've done a lot.

1809
02:34:48,212 --> 02:34:50,592
[SPEAKER_00]: You've supported a lot with capital planning.

1810
02:34:51,093 --> 02:34:59,055
[SPEAKER_00]: The vocational school has an incredible amount of increases in maintenance and in new facilities and the like.

1811
02:35:00,116 --> 02:35:03,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that if you look at that, you can be fairly good about that.

1812
02:35:04,037 --> 02:35:04,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there more to do?

1813
02:35:04,837 --> 02:35:06,018
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always more to do.

1814
02:35:06,478 --> 02:35:07,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenance is never perfect.

1815
02:35:07,938 --> 02:35:10,439
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk through any street in the Commonwealth and find it.

1816
02:35:10,933 --> 02:35:11,974
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter took its toll.

1817
02:35:12,434 --> 02:35:15,776
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk through any public building and find that there's things to be done.

1818
02:35:16,476 --> 02:35:28,943
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up over there in City Hall, right above you, behind Anne Marie, there is a crack in the decorative part of the ceiling, which almost killed me one night, sitting here at a city council meeting.

1819
02:35:28,963 --> 02:35:35,906
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news for me is I'm still alive, and the bad news for other people, I'll just leave them.

1820
02:35:36,387 --> 02:35:39,008
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that there's always something more to do.

1821
02:35:40,018 --> 02:35:43,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think you don't have to take a backseat on that.

1822
02:35:43,119 --> 02:35:47,760
[SPEAKER_00]: You have provided substantial funding, and the substantial work has been done.

1823
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:53,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that, you know, as we go forward, there'll be more and more capital planning.

1824
02:35:53,361 --> 02:35:54,441
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be talking about that.

1825
02:35:54,921 --> 02:35:57,742
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you have to take a backseat when it comes to capital planning.

1826
02:35:57,782 --> 02:36:07,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some upgrades and reports to help you in your discussions as you go into the next few weeks as people maybe ask those questions, and it gives you a little bit more ammunition.

1827
02:36:08,302 --> 02:36:08,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1828
02:36:08,702 --> 02:36:09,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1829
02:36:09,063 --> 02:36:09,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1830
02:36:09,623 --> 02:36:10,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn.

1831
02:36:10,563 --> 02:36:13,665
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Mr. Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Ms.

1832
02:36:13,785 --> 02:36:14,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Cugno.

1833
02:36:14,105 --> 02:36:14,926
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1834
02:36:14,946 --> 02:36:15,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1835
02:36:15,526 --> 02:36:15,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1836
02:36:16,406 --> 02:36:16,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting adjourned.
