1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:01,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it gig economy.

2
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,988
[SPEAKER_28]: Why is Connor having trouble focusing in school?

3
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:40,573
Excuse me?

4
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,620
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yes.

5
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:46,800
Yes.

6
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:52,947
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, sure.

7
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:53,448
[SPEAKER_42]: Be my guest.

8
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,674
[SPEAKER_42]: The Medford School Committee regular meeting of October 16 will now come to order.

9
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,736
[SPEAKER_42]: The secretary will call the roll.

10
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:13,464
[SPEAKER_42]: present, six present, one absent, all please rise and salute our flag.

11
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:26,755
[SPEAKER_42]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

12
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:33,521
[SPEAKER_42]: Also, if the minutes could reflect that Sebastian Trindale, our Meckler High School representative, is present this evening.

13
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:34,402
[SPEAKER_42]: Welcome.

14
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:43,715
[SPEAKER_42]: The first item of business, approval of the minutes of October 2nd, 2017 on the motion for approval by Mr. Skerry and Mr. Benedetto.

15
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,297
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry.

16
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:51,678
[SPEAKER_32]: That's okay.

17
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,419
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so there's a few things that I noticed on the minutes.

18
00:11:59,001 --> 00:11:59,881
[SPEAKER_32]: On the second page,

19
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:17,448
[SPEAKER_32]: I had made a motion last week to have internal rankings and notifications made on the transcript, and that if they couldn't be made, then we needed to have an emergency meeting.

20
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:22,891
[SPEAKER_32]: So I was just wondering if the superintendent, we didn't call the meeting.

21
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:25,932
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, the minutes stand on their own.

22
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:31,055
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so it should have said by last week, by the end of last week, in the minutes.

23
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:35,669
[SPEAKER_32]: The emergency meeting was supposed to happen by the end of last week.

24
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,310
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's the first change.

25
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,411
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Superintendent.

26
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:45,297
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Superintendent.

27
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,599
[SPEAKER_13]: At that meeting, you made a motion.

28
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Since that time, grievances were filed.

29
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,604
[SPEAKER_13]: The processes of legal matters were filed.

30
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:59,089
[SPEAKER_13]: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status.

31
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:14,833
[SPEAKER_32]: So in the next section, it says, Mrs. Kretz said that the robotics engineering team are presently traditional classes.

32
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:19,797
[SPEAKER_32]: And in 2019, it's scheduled to go on a cooperative plan.

33
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,041
[SPEAKER_32]: I think she made a motion to have that happen.

34
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:29,625
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just wanted, I can ask you later about an update on it, but I,

35
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:32,979
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to comment on that.

36
00:13:45,259 --> 00:14:11,351
[SPEAKER_41]: the robotics engineering program and so if they go to the schedule which is three periods per day the the company who's actually doing the co-op with the students would be willing to accept the students in the afternoon and they could work maybe a 12 to 5 schedule so it would still be a cooperative program but it would have a different schedule so that the students could continue on with their like with the calculus and

37
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:17,595
[SPEAKER_41]: and the foreign language, which is something that like some of the students that are juniors and seniors haven't taken.

38
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:21,377
[SPEAKER_41]: So I think, you know, that would be satisfactory.

39
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:31,404
[SPEAKER_41]: You know, when I was speaking to, you know, to my son who's out on co-op, you know, because it's a lot to juggle getting all the classes in and then going to the co-op.

40
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:36,207
[SPEAKER_41]: But it's definitely something, you know, if superintendent wants to have a meeting,

41
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:44,571
[SPEAKER_41]: and we can talk about all the programs and just making sure that the programs who should be on co-ops are on co-ops on the A week and the B week.

42
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:53,816
[SPEAKER_41]: We did get a report in this package with who is going out on co-op, so I think that'll come up later in the program.

43
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,738
[SPEAKER_41]: I just wanted to share that point of information.

44
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,322
[SPEAKER_32]: My other two are exactly about the minutes themselves.

45
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:17,796
[SPEAKER_32]: On the next thing, community participation, there also was a motion made to have the teachers, the administration, and the school committee meet to update the action plan to make sure all voices were on that action plan.

46
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,438
[SPEAKER_32]: That note, that motion isn't in the notes.

47
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,621
[SPEAKER_32]: and that motion was made at our last meeting.

48
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:28,505
[SPEAKER_32]: And we can discuss it after, but as far as just the minutes, that's what you want, right?

49
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:32,909
[SPEAKER_32]: This- The motion for the amendment to be added to the minutes from last week prior to their approval.

50
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,152
[SPEAKER_32]: And then there's one more issue.

51
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,116
[SPEAKER_32]: It says on the motion of Mrs. Cuneo, second by Mrs. Stone, that the meeting was adjourned.

52
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,237
[SPEAKER_32]: Mrs. Cuneo wasn't there.

53
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,158
[SPEAKER_32]: comment on anything, that's fine.

54
00:15:53,398 --> 00:16:00,060
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion for approval of the minutes as amended, all those in, motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

55
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,740
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

56
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:01,720
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

57
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,380
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

58
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,121
[SPEAKER_42]: The minutes passed.

59
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,941
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

60
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:06,622
[SPEAKER_42]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

61
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:17,680
[SPEAKER_32]: I just had a quick question on page 9 of 13.

62
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:27,169
[SPEAKER_32]: It says MMH Clearinghouse, and it's over $10,000, and it says youth opiate prevention.

63
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:32,993
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just had never seen that on our bills before, and I was just wondering what that was.

64
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,174
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, and what types of things does that cover?

65
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:40,215
[SPEAKER_32]: Curriculum, for students.

66
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,016
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, it's the curriculum?

67
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:41,256
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

68
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:45,539
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's taught through the, not you, the superintendent.

69
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,043
[SPEAKER_32]: What age group is getting the curriculum?

70
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:50,964
[SPEAKER_32]: The opioid grant.

71
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:51,984
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the opioid grant.

72
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.

73
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,367
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, and that's great.

74
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,008
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

75
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,809
[SPEAKER_42]: The motion passes.

76
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,673
[SPEAKER_42]: Approval of payrolls.

77
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,637
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

78
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:18,078
[SPEAKER_42]: Kretz.

79
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,679
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

80
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,480
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

81
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,301
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

82
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,142
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

83
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,364
[SPEAKER_42]: Report of secretary.

84
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:43,259
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much, Mr. Scarrion, for working on this.

85
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,382
[SPEAKER_42]: Community participation, Joseph Viglione, Open Meeting Law.

86
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:50,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

87
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:55,169
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

88
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, school committee, for hearing me.

89
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:03,475
[SPEAKER_20]: On September 19th, 2017, the Attorney General's Office found that the

90
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Chapter 74 board of the school had violated the open meeting law.

91
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:12,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Now this is a very serious offense, even though some people fluffed it off at the city council meeting.

92
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:24,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Very serious offense, especially in the light of the 650,000 or so dollars that were allocated from the old TV3 to the new station.

93
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,480
[SPEAKER_20]: So what are we gonna do about it?

94
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,762
[SPEAKER_20]: You have a board for a year and a half,

95
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,149
[SPEAKER_20]: The school committee, I don't believe, knew about it.

96
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,051
[SPEAKER_20]: The city council certainly didn't know about it.

97
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:51,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Flies under the radar, but it was so significant because Bob Penter and other citizens and myself were attending all of Mayor McGlynn's tribunals, which were talking about the new access station.

98
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:57,808
[SPEAKER_20]: And all of a sudden, the high school is talking about the access station, but the public doesn't know.

99
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:07,130
[SPEAKER_20]: If the MCC monies are here, and the educational monies are here, and the governmental monies are there, and the general fund, it's all convoluted.

100
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,791
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been on this project for 15 years.

101
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:11,432
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not that dumb.

102
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:12,813
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't figure it out.

103
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,133
[SPEAKER_20]: The public can't.

104
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:26,720
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that this serious, serious offense of not letting us know about this Chapter 74 board, which had people that weren't even from Medford, Revere and outside of Medford, all very, very,

105
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:28,625
[SPEAKER_20]: Smoky.

106
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,726
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I propose something.

107
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:38,789
[SPEAKER_20]: I propose, especially after the media day yesterday at the public access station, which seems so very educational-oriented.

108
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Politicians, neighbors of mine are saying, I didn't hear about it, Joe.

109
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Anthony D'Antonio, a significant member of the Medford community.

110
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Joe, I didn't know about it.

111
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,272
[SPEAKER_20]: I spoke about it at the city council.

112
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,593
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no outreach.

113
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:59,058
[SPEAKER_20]: I propose, because of this egregious offense, this failure, I mean, we have very smart people here.

114
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:00,179
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor's a very smart woman.

115
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Superintendent Belson's a very smart man.

116
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:07,123
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't feign ignorance that, oh, we didn't know about the open meeting laws.

117
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:10,806
[SPEAKER_20]: My God, you people have to take tests for the open meeting law.

118
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:19,472
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel, sadly, that my opinion is it was intentional to keep me out, specifically, because I've been fighting for public access for

119
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:29,873
[SPEAKER_20]: in this city for 15 years, but many might know that I fought the good fight in Woburn for a good five years, and I'm a member in Stoneham, and Woburn airs my show.

120
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:37,235
[SPEAKER_20]: It was my strength that made that right up there, and we all know that it was my fight that shut down TV3.

121
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:47,157
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it would have been prudent for this city to let me, Bob Penter, and D'Antonio, and other individuals know, and the city council, and the school committee.

122
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,542
[SPEAKER_20]: So especially yesterday, I feel very uncomfortable having it at the high school when a state rep acted in an inappropriate manner.

123
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,282
[SPEAKER_42]: And the mayor laughed.

124
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,943
[SPEAKER_20]: I am staying within the area.

125
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:03,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you laughed at the sexual joke.

126
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:03,944
[SPEAKER_20]: You laughed.

127
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,264
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're shutting me off.

128
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:05,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Censorship.

129
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:10,405
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, you can leave this meeting if you cannot be a responsible adult.

130
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:14,006
[SPEAKER_20]: You laughed at a sexual outrage and you don't want to talk to me.

131
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:19,746
Thank you.

132
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:20,947
No.

133
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:26,275
[SPEAKER_42]: Through the chair.

134
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:32,264
[SPEAKER_42]: Ask a question through the chair.

135
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:35,966
[SPEAKER_42]: There is no recommendation.

136
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:38,428
[SPEAKER_42]: It went to, we've already taken care of it.

137
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:40,830
[SPEAKER_42]: It was a Chapter 74 advisory board.

138
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,531
[SPEAKER_42]: They don't deliberate.

139
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:44,653
[SPEAKER_42]: They don't make decisions for the school system.

140
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:46,395
[SPEAKER_42]: All the meetings will be posted.

141
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:47,276
[SPEAKER_42]: It's been taken care of.

142
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:48,116
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

143
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:49,838
[SPEAKER_42]: Next item.

144
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:51,219
[SPEAKER_42]: Next item.

145
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,601
[SPEAKER_42]: Report of superintendent.

146
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:56,864
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on Nellie Mae Education Foundation grant.

147
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:57,925
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Superintendent.

148
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:17,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educating Foundation Grant.

149
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:24,442
[SPEAKER_13]: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O'Toole Award.

150
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,044
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very significant award.

151
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,325
[SPEAKER_13]: It's done a lot of very good things for us.

152
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:30,166
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do even more.

153
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.

154
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:37,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

155
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:48,207
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm very excited to be here tonight to announce that one of our school counselors, Tim Klein, has won the Lawrence O'Toole Educator Leadership Award and grant for

156
00:22:54,863 --> 00:23:03,106
[SPEAKER_21]: This award is given to an educator who advocates for student-centered approaches to learning, not only in their classroom but within their practice.

157
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:11,088
[SPEAKER_21]: This award is sponsored by the Nellie Mae Foundation and this year was given to 12 recipients across New England.

158
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:19,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Tim has won this award as a result of his innovative pilot program, Empower, which was started last year at the high school.

159
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,719
[SPEAKER_21]: The Lawrence O'Toole Award is also accompanied with a $15,000 grant.

160
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:33,503
[SPEAKER_21]: And this grant will be used to bring innovative digital technology to the Empower Program, which will help us grow this program over the next three years.

161
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:43,907
[SPEAKER_21]: I have Tim here, and I would like to ask him to give you a brief summary of the program and to answer any questions that you may have of the work that he's been doing.

162
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:46,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Mr. Klein.

163
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:47,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

164
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:47,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for having me.

165
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:53,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm really excited to be here and to win this award on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

166
00:23:53,272 --> 00:24:02,299
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's from Empower, which it started from the research partnership that Dr. Perella started with Harvard University and Boston College.

167
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,701
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's based in this emerging field in youth development called youth purpose.

168
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:17,786
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's how do we ensure that all of our high school students are actively pursuing a long-term goal that's personally meaningful and also is beneficial to the world outside the self.

169
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:26,211
[SPEAKER_17]: So honestly, when I'm sitting up here, we want all of our students to be looking like Sebastian up here, who's obviously actively pursuing something that's meaningful to him.

170
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:40,600
[SPEAKER_17]: So Empower is really about asking students not just to consider what college they want to go to or what major or what career, but really to understand why they want to pursue those things, how it aligns with their core values, how it's going to allow them to build their strength and skills.

171
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,981
[SPEAKER_17]: So to understand the intrinsic motivators.

172
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:47,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm really excited for this award because we've piloted this with seniors in the

173
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,725
[SPEAKER_17]: high school, and the vocational school.

174
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,025
[SPEAKER_17]: We did it last year with 25 students.

175
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,446
[SPEAKER_17]: We've tripled the number this year.

176
00:24:53,526 --> 00:25:01,168
[SPEAKER_17]: But this award is going to allow us to really bring in really innovative digital technology and curriculum that we can bring.

177
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:11,131
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's going to allow us to bring in an application that not only me and our Empower students can use, but the entirety of the public school district can use as well when we get it out there.

178
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:13,612
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm really excited to bring this to Medford Public Schools.

179
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:14,914
[SPEAKER_43]: Nice job.

180
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:15,355
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

181
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:15,875
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuno.

182
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:16,695
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

183
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,957
[SPEAKER_43]: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.

184
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:21,938
[SPEAKER_43]: This is absolutely wonderful.

185
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:29,562
[SPEAKER_43]: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.

186
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:30,483
[SPEAKER_43]: Westmark, nope.

187
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,666
[SPEAKER_43]: I've known her before she was married.

188
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:40,368
[SPEAKER_43]: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.

189
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:47,512
[SPEAKER_43]: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.

190
00:25:48,132 --> 00:26:03,969
[SPEAKER_43]: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields that they're in.

191
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,899
[SPEAKER_43]: my concentration went away, but different types of businesses.

192
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:30,761
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.

193
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:42,143
[SPEAKER_43]: So if you have like people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field or, you know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another

194
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:50,672
[SPEAKER_43]: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.

195
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:52,638
[SPEAKER_43]: But if it's something down the road.

196
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:19,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean I think it's a fantastic idea it's amazing I mean I tried working with Sebastian not to keep bringing you up but we tried doing the same thing with Sebastian and I'm all for it and it's greed it's you want internships that's providing value for our students what I've been

197
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:24,055
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a struggle for me is around scheduling flexibility.

198
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:27,658
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just having students having a flexible enough schedule.

199
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:31,561
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe they could leave during the school day or getting credit for those internships.

200
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,843
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it's a fantastic, fantastic idea.

201
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:43,551
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you know people from the Chamber of Commerce, let's definitely set up a meeting where we can start connecting with students who might be interested with businesses that would be a good fit.

202
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:46,934
[SPEAKER_43]: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during

203
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:04,084
[SPEAKER_43]: But again, something to really get your teeth into what you want to do.

204
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:08,909
[SPEAKER_43]: I just don't want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.

205
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:13,574
[SPEAKER_43]: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for.

206
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:19,360
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue, or if it's something

207
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,927
[SPEAKER_21]: students to come to Mr. Klein, because he is our school and community partnerships counselor, so he makes those connections.

208
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:36,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Come to Mr. Klein, maybe tell them what they're looking for, and he can help make that connection.

209
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:39,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also encourage community members to reach out to us as well.

210
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,117
[SPEAKER_21]: Perfect.

211
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:41,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

212
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:41,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

213
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:42,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Tringale.

214
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:42,940
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

215
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:50,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, directly from a high schooler's perspective, working with the guidance counselors, especially applying to colleges this year.

216
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:59,474
[SPEAKER_09]: My personal guidance counselor has tons of students, and they're working with students from all over the school all the time.

217
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:05,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's great that Mr. Klein is here to be that extra hand.

218
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:12,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked with him almost immediately as soon as he came to high school to try to get some internships.

219
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:17,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm a really busy guy, and so are tons of my classmates.

220
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:22,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I never followed through with that internship.

221
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:32,694
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that what is already being done, I guess, is he's doing a great job with that.

222
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:35,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

223
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:40,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think from that conversation, you got into journalism and then you started the school newspaper, essentially, right?

224
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:43,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, essentially, it was that conversation.

225
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:56,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And to give a back story, I was thinking about business and Mr. Klein talked me through it and I realized I didn't really want to do business and thought more about journalism, another field I was passionate about.

226
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:07,310
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think I would have had that conversation with my guidance counselor, because I think she was just really wrapped up in getting kids applied to colleges and all of those things.

227
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's great.

228
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:12,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's great that you won this grant to expand your program.

229
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

230
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:14,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

231
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,500
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll just make one more pitch.

232
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:27,331
[SPEAKER_17]: It wouldn't have happened without Miss Jensen here, just allowing me, no, to do like a really innovative work that hadn't been happening before, not only in Medford, but it hasn't been really been happening anywhere.

233
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,693
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to make a plug for our guidance team as well.

234
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:36,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Like what you heard Sebastian said, it's, they feel very, very at capacity and it feels like they have a very high caseload and it's like,

235
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:48,243
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can build up more guidance counselor capacity to have these meaningful conversations about what do they want their lives to look like, what type of impact they want to have, it can have a very profound impact on our students.

236
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:52,324
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just think the role of the counselors is as important as ever now.

237
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:53,664
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm glad to be one at Medford.

238
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:54,305
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

239
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:59,446
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe you could add a little bit from that breakfast last year when you had the Chamber of Commerce in and vocational.

240
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:00,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

241
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,186
[SPEAKER_42]: Sawyer, I believe, was the one leading the charge over on the vocational side.

242
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,607
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe just elaborate a little bit more about your outreach.

243
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:15,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so we had the Chamber of Commerce come in, and they came out for a breakfast, and the vocational students catered an amazing breakfast.

244
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:24,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And I did do a presentation about the need for our students and their desire to get out into the city of Medford to get hands-on experience.

245
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:28,430
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did some research on what the school resources we had now.

246
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,632
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have over 100 clubs at the school.

247
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:35,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And about 85% of our students are actively involved in the school.

248
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:40,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did a survey of students saying, well, what would you like to get more involved with?

249
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,607
[SPEAKER_17]: And the majority of students who said they wanted to do more, it was around meaningful employment.

250
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,410
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you look at research now about what

251
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:59,314
[SPEAKER_17]: When you look at what employers are looking for from recent college graduates, they're really emphasizing meaningful employment and job experience.

252
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:07,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're getting to a place in the world where it's not so much what college you go to or what grades you have, but it's really more about what meaningful experience in the field do you have.

253
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:19,500
[SPEAKER_17]: So as much as we can get students out into the field to actually give them experience, they can understand what they do want to do, what they don't want to do, and make really meaningful connections in the city of Medford that's going to help them

254
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,483
[SPEAKER_17]: help this city and get, and help our, a lot of our jobs are having a hard time finding meaningful employment.

255
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:30,246
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's really a mutually beneficial relationship for both.

256
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,407
[SPEAKER_17]: But yes.

257
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:32,168
[SPEAKER_41]: Very good.

258
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:32,668
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

259
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:32,968
[SPEAKER_41]: Kratz.

260
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,430
[SPEAKER_41]: I just wanted to say congratulations.

261
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,450
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you very much.

262
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,272
[SPEAKER_41]: And I noticed that it said that

263
00:32:39,692 --> 00:33:01,914
[SPEAKER_41]: you know the students have increased GPAs and post-secondary plans and you know I just wanted to bring attention to that and an increased graduation rate that's that's fantastic and it sounds like you're going in the right direction and and you're involving like both the vocational students and high school students it just sounds terrific so how do the students

264
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:06,699
[SPEAKER_41]: get in touch with you, should they email you, or do they go through their guidance counselor?

265
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,061
[SPEAKER_41]: Which students?

266
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:18,692
[SPEAKER_41]: If students were interested and kind of spending some time with you to find out what their interests are, should they go through their guidance counselor, and then they're put in touch with you, or?

267
00:33:18,712 --> 00:33:19,833
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I mean, I have.

268
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:25,571
[SPEAKER_17]: This is probably not going to work out for me, but I have an open door policy, and I always have, so it's like they can come find me.

269
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:30,295
[SPEAKER_17]: So through Empower, I'll just say, it's being evaluated by Boston College right now.

270
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:32,776
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, it's a randomized trial.

271
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:38,860
[SPEAKER_17]: So every single high school senior was automatically, randomly selected into the program.

272
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,663
[SPEAKER_17]: So we actually have an intervention, which is Empower, and then we have a control group as well.

273
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:47,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're doing pre and post surveys for both of them to see what the actual impact of Empower is.

274
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:49,834
[SPEAKER_17]: But just send them my way.

275
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:51,296
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm third floor guidance.

276
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,661
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just like I have students coming in and out all of the time.

277
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:58,326
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can send them or go to their guidance counselor who's doing a lot of the same work that I am.

278
00:33:58,907 --> 00:33:59,907
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, thank you very much.

279
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:00,607
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

280
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:01,928
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

281
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:03,308
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

282
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:21,513
[SPEAKER_32]: It just really speaks to the approach of how we handle students in MedFit, the whole child, because it's not just about getting them through and getting them either off to college or military or to a job, but to really seek what they are looking for in their needs and trying to meet those needs.

283
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:38,160
[SPEAKER_32]: So I really think that having job experience, even if it's not paid position, it gives you so many life skills that a lot of our young people are lacking in that employers and colleges are looking for.

284
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:46,224
[SPEAKER_32]: They're looking for students that are prepared, that are on time, that show up when they're supposed to, or call if they're sick.

285
00:34:48,104 --> 00:35:04,450
[SPEAKER_32]: can answer the phone in a professional manner, and all of those skills that you might not get in a day at school, but need to move forward and need to present yourself, not only yourself, your family, but also your community in Meffitt High.

286
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,712
[SPEAKER_32]: So when you move on, people are like, oh, look at that kid from Meffitt High.

287
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:11,213
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's a skill that all children need.

288
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:17,537
[SPEAKER_32]: not only financial skills, but just professionalism and all of those type of things.

289
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:20,979
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think it's great that we have this position now at Meffitt High.

290
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:30,305
[SPEAKER_32]: I know we struggled for a few years with amount of guidance people per student ratio, and we've increased them in the last six years.

291
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:40,772
[SPEAKER_32]: I know the superintendent's commitment to that department has been great, and I'm glad that we're taking a whole child approach at Meffitt High, as well as, you know,

292
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:51,824
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm very proud of the work you've done, that it's been acknowledged, and I'm very happy to bring in any dollars you want to bring that benefit our students.

293
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,547
[SPEAKER_32]: And thank you, and you deserve it.

294
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,812
[SPEAKER_32]: all the recognition that comes along with this.

295
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:16,476
[SPEAKER_32]: So maybe a note in someone's employee file will be warranted at this time, Mr. Superintendent, that the committee is impressed and appreciates the hard work of both Mrs. Jenkins, did I say it right?

296
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:17,316
[SPEAKER_32]: It's usually Ms.

297
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:18,096
[SPEAKER_32]: Westmark to me.

298
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:19,856
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

299
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:22,797
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much, Mr. Klein and Ms.

300
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:24,017
[SPEAKER_42]: Jensen for your hard work.

301
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:34,497
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I'll put that out there.

302
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:35,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Is anyone needing employ?

303
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:38,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone out here is looking to partner with us.

304
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:39,522
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm all ears.

305
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:42,064
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much for all of your support.

306
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:42,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

307
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:42,585
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

308
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:45,988
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive in place on file offered by Ms.

309
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:47,669
[SPEAKER_42]: Cuneo, seconded by Ms.

310
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,430
[SPEAKER_42]: Mastoon?

311
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,751
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

312
00:36:50,352 --> 00:36:50,452
Aye.

313
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:51,353
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

314
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:52,073
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

315
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:53,615
[SPEAKER_42]: Report.

316
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:54,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

317
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:56,898
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on online Be Good Academy.

318
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

319
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:17,488
[SPEAKER_22]: On Thursday, September 28th, four eighth grade students from the Andrews Middle School and their teacher, Mr. Chris Tremonti, attended a day-long program on social media for social good.

320
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:30,293
[SPEAKER_22]: Rick Rendon, founder of Empower Peace, asked me if we could gather a group of students together from Medford to participate in launching an innovative use of social media.

321
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,655
[SPEAKER_22]: So the following students attended WGBH,

322
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:41,738
[SPEAKER_22]: at this conference, Sophia Zimanski, Andre Perez, Luke Gatti, and Sarah Biannimi.

323
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:46,400
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition, Mr. Twonte and myself were available for this conference.

324
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:56,444
[SPEAKER_22]: The students listened to John Rendon, President and Executive Officer of the Rendon Group, discuss strategic communications in the 21st century.

325
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:02,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Macon Phillips Skyped from Spain to talk about social media for the social good.

326
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,553
[SPEAKER_22]: There were other interactive panelists and discussions.

327
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:12,939
[SPEAKER_22]: The highlight for many of us was listening to Andrew Frady's Brother of Pete Frady's.

328
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:24,150
[SPEAKER_22]: The discussion about how the Ice Bucket Challenge came about and how social media from people all over the world participated and spread the word.

329
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Frady said his brother continues his fight in finding a cure for ALS.

330
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:34,710
[SPEAKER_22]: The students told me what they learned from the conference.

331
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Statements like, what you put online is there forever, even if it's not, even if you take it down.

332
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:43,192
[SPEAKER_22]: So be careful with what you say.

333
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:47,793
[SPEAKER_22]: It can hurt you for years later, especially when you're looking for a job.

334
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,834
[SPEAKER_22]: And don't always focus on the negative in social media.

335
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:58,212
[SPEAKER_22]: The students are here with us this evening to tell you about what they learned for social media for social good.

336
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,155
[SPEAKER_22]: They have an action plan.

337
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:08,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Their issues will focus on communicating with their peers about online fake accounts, bullying, and protecting privacy.

338
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:18,069
[SPEAKER_22]: They will be working with sixth grade students, and I've provided with you in your packet the program for the day and a copy of the agenda and the action plan.

339
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:27,736
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mr. Paul DeLeva, the principal of the school, who helped me put together this group of students and is also here with us this evening.

340
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:34,982
[SPEAKER_22]: So at this time, I would like to ask Sarah Bien-Aimé and Andre to come up and discuss what they have learned

341
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,850
[SPEAKER_22]: and I'd like to thank Chris Tremonti as well.

342
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,972
[SPEAKER_22]: So Sarah, why don't you come up and Andre as well.

343
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:45,955
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello.

344
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:47,796
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, how was your day today?

345
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:48,396
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

346
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,458
[SPEAKER_31]: Was your day great today?

347
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:51,568
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it good?

348
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:53,009
[SPEAKER_31]: We're good.

349
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,952
[SPEAKER_31]: So the online for goods group had been an eye opener for us.

350
00:39:58,592 --> 00:40:06,377
[SPEAKER_31]: And it taught my peers and I that it taught my peers and I the uses of the internet and how it affects us in our future.

351
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:12,415
[SPEAKER_31]: not only did it provide background information, but it also provided fun activities to grab the youth's attention.

352
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:25,931
[SPEAKER_31]: And one major thing that really, one major thing that I loved about this group was that you see, you saw several schools, like in the Massachusetts, in the state of Massachusetts, come together and try to

353
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:30,175
[SPEAKER_31]: make a difference, not only in reality, but in online use.

354
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:44,408
[SPEAKER_31]: And we learned how the ice bucket began, and how it represented ALS, and how the FedEx, the FedEx sign, if you look at it, there's like an arrow which means delivered, that can symbolize the deliverance.

355
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:49,393
[SPEAKER_31]: And yeah, but it was a really great experience for us, personally.

356
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:55,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

357
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:59,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Andre Perez from Andrews Middle School, and I'm in the eighth grade.

358
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:05,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wrote a short paper on my experience at Online for Good.

359
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:10,733
[SPEAKER_10]: The time I had at Online for Good was very fun and a great learning experience.

360
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:16,994
[SPEAKER_10]: The day started off with being picked up early in the morning and heading to the WGBH building in Boston.

361
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:22,916
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend Luke and I met up with the two other students who were joining us on the trip, Sarah and Sophia.

362
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:28,297
[SPEAKER_10]: The four of us picked a table to sit at and we talked for a little bit and then got right into the lecture.

363
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:33,381
[SPEAKER_10]: The lecture was very good, and we learned a lot about online safety and the power of the Internet.

364
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:36,905
[SPEAKER_10]: One example that was given was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

365
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:57,094
[SPEAKER_10]: After the activity was over, Mr. Tramonti and the group decided that we were going to try to pursue an activity where the four students in the group go into a sixth grade room during RTI class and talk to them about what to do and what not to do on the internet and how to stay safe.

366
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:02,700
[SPEAKER_10]: We as a group would like very much to have this activity run through the Andrews Middle School system.

367
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:10,487
[SPEAKER_31]: Excellent.

368
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:12,449
[SPEAKER_31]: Nice job.

369
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,251
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

370
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:17,553
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually have a question for the students.

371
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:24,580
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, thank you for going and representing Method so well, and thank you for presenting this evening in such a professional manner.

372
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,164
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm very impressed by both your presentations and glad you're Method students.

373
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:40,050
[SPEAKER_32]: My question to you is, since you've gone there, what different things have you done on your social media since you've gone there?

374
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:45,612
[SPEAKER_32]: How have you taken what you learned and it changed your everyday life?

375
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:52,756
[SPEAKER_31]: To be careful on what you post on the internet and not to entertain in things that are not appropriate.

376
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:59,506
[SPEAKER_32]: And you've changed how you speak and what you post?

377
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:18,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Things on the other side of social media, like as she said, the FedEx sign, you look at it carefully and you can see an arrow between the E and the X. Ever since that, I've looked at other things more carefully to see if they have any other symbols inside of them.

378
00:43:20,286 --> 00:43:20,806
[SPEAKER_32]: That's great.

379
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:27,389
[SPEAKER_32]: And even your contract with your friends and your schoolmates, has it changed how you speak and what you might say?

380
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:31,571
[SPEAKER_32]: Does it make you rethink before you hit post?

381
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:32,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

382
00:43:32,632 --> 00:43:33,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It helped a lot.

383
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:42,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes you can say stuff that aren't nice, and it gives you a chance to reassure what you're going to say before you send it.

384
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:48,373
[SPEAKER_31]: So I have a request since this is seem to have touched you both not only would the Andrews kids

385
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:09,159
[SPEAKER_32]: benefit from your presentation, the McGlen Middle School would as well.

386
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:18,961
[SPEAKER_32]: And since they don't have representatives going, I'm going to request that you maybe get a chance to present to the sixth graders at the McGlen as well.

387
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:20,601
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm going to ask Ms.

388
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:27,183
[SPEAKER_32]: Caldwell and your principal if they could make that happen, because I want to squirt you over and do that presentation well.

389
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:31,484
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would really love to see students from both schools attend next year.

390
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:34,545
[SPEAKER_32]: So that we have representatives talking about this.

391
00:44:34,825 --> 00:44:37,267
[SPEAKER_32]: Because this is what we hear is a big problem.

392
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:42,750
[SPEAKER_32]: Bullying, cyber bullying, cyber issues.

393
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:47,213
[SPEAKER_32]: They happen at night, but then they come into the school every day.

394
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:52,636
[SPEAKER_32]: And the school's in a very tricky situation on how to handle things that happen outside of school.

395
00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:56,538
[SPEAKER_32]: And we have to set policies and procedures.

396
00:44:56,978 --> 00:45:00,440
[SPEAKER_32]: which we're still working at because things change so quickly.

397
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:10,446
[SPEAKER_32]: So if we have students like you, strong professional students talking to other students, they might hear you.

398
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:18,111
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I think that your work that you've done and what you've learned is very valuable and I'd love you to share it to the other building as well.

399
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:24,274
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my first motion on the floor to make sure that these children get the chance to do that.

400
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:25,235
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'll need a second.

401
00:45:26,663 --> 00:45:27,063
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

402
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:35,151
[SPEAKER_32]: And then to make sure that both schools have the opportunity to attend this next year, and we do more of that collaboratively.

403
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:43,899
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my next motion, is to make sure both schools get a chance to partake in this next year.

404
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:44,239
[SPEAKER_32]: So.

405
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,441
[SPEAKER_43]: Very good.

406
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:47,382
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

407
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:48,108
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

408
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:48,409
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuneo?

409
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:50,270
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

410
00:45:50,591 --> 00:46:01,302
[SPEAKER_43]: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't 100% sure before we started the meeting, and I sat down with you really quick.

411
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:10,051
[SPEAKER_43]: But I would have asked you a thousand questions, because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do was, it was the anti-bullying.

412
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:16,062
[SPEAKER_43]: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children, and not only our students, but for everybody.

413
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:20,768
[SPEAKER_43]: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.

414
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:28,397
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.

415
00:46:28,857 --> 00:46:30,138
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I get it all the time.

416
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:32,140
[SPEAKER_43]: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.

417
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:40,888
[SPEAKER_43]: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes and then they disappear.

418
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:45,071
[SPEAKER_43]: Have you now had a different way of thinking about that?

419
00:46:46,333 --> 00:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like as an example for Snapchat, things that you think are only there for like up to 3 to 10 seconds, people can take screenshots or save them and they can never go away.

420
00:47:05,677 --> 00:47:10,261
[SPEAKER_43]: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.

421
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:17,367
[SPEAKER_43]: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.

422
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,789
[SPEAKER_43]: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.

423
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:27,315
[SPEAKER_43]: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.

424
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:43,574
[SPEAKER_43]: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, you know, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into

425
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:51,365
[SPEAKER_43]: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.

426
00:47:51,986 --> 00:48:00,637
[SPEAKER_43]: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.

427
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:05,760
[SPEAKER_43]: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.

428
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,480
[SPEAKER_43]: You really have.

429
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,442
[SPEAKER_43]: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.

430
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:14,463
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you for representing us.

431
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:19,985
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.

432
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,025
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

433
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:22,886
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

434
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:29,788
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motions, that this information be shared with the McGlynn Middle School as well, and that the McGlynn participate at the next forum.

435
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:32,072
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

436
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:32,392
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

437
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:33,554
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

438
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:34,495
[SPEAKER_42]: The motion passes.

439
00:48:35,015 --> 00:48:37,718
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much for contributing this evening.

440
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:38,659
[SPEAKER_42]: Wonderful job.

441
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,460
[SPEAKER_42]: Great.

442
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:42,784
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on Global Scholars Program.

443
00:48:42,824 --> 00:48:43,404
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Securitas.

444
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:47,251
[SPEAKER_13]: of the committee, this report is in two parts.

445
00:48:48,111 --> 00:48:50,513
[SPEAKER_13]: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.

446
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:56,477
[SPEAKER_13]: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.

447
00:48:57,538 --> 00:49:03,502
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.

448
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:08,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.

449
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:09,407
[SPEAKER_13]: We were the first to do it.

450
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.

451
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:18,427
[SPEAKER_13]: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.

452
00:49:18,948 --> 00:49:24,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.

453
00:49:25,654 --> 00:49:34,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Kieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.

454
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,044
[SPEAKER_13]: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.

455
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:46,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.

456
00:49:48,634 --> 00:49:49,115
[SPEAKER_39]: Good evening.

457
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:58,180
[SPEAKER_39]: I've been here a number of times to talk about the Global Scholars Program, and each time I am excited because, again, it is a wonderful program.

458
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,182
[SPEAKER_39]: So just following up on the last presentation, we were talking about social media.

459
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,784
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a program that has its own portal.

460
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:07,766
[SPEAKER_39]: It has the Haiku portal system.

461
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:14,650
[SPEAKER_39]: So all of the communication that occurs between our seventh grade students in the program and students around the world

462
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:24,067
[SPEAKER_39]: is protected and the students know ahead of time the teachers can go in and they can look at all of the dialogue that occurs among the students.

463
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,852
[SPEAKER_39]: So I just want you to know that it is a highly protected system.

464
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:31,868
[SPEAKER_39]: So as the superintendent mentioned, it includes Medford.

465
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,449
[SPEAKER_39]: So we're considered Medford-Boston.

466
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,830
[SPEAKER_39]: We now have other schools in the area participating.

467
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:43,172
[SPEAKER_39]: There are some Boston public schools, Everett, one school in Chelsea now.

468
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:45,933
[SPEAKER_39]: There are a couple of schools in New York.

469
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:49,015
[SPEAKER_39]: Jacksonville, Florida.

470
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:57,402
[SPEAKER_39]: So we were the first school here in the United States to participate in this program.

471
00:50:58,262 --> 00:51:04,928
[SPEAKER_39]: So not only is it worldwide, but it really not only has it grown worldwide, but it has grown here in the United States as well.

472
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:11,752
[SPEAKER_39]: So as far as the curriculum is concerned this year, the focus is on food and feeding our cities.

473
00:51:12,432 --> 00:51:14,273
[SPEAKER_39]: So this is the yearly curriculum.

474
00:51:14,353 --> 00:51:20,257
[SPEAKER_39]: So it began October 1st, or thereabouts October 1st, and it will end at the end of May.

475
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:22,218
[SPEAKER_39]: There are five units.

476
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:28,722
[SPEAKER_39]: So classes, again, all seventh grade students at both the McGlynn and the Andrews.

477
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:37,469
[SPEAKER_39]: have participated in Unit 1, which is the introduction to the program, including introduction to the eClassroom.

478
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,711
[SPEAKER_39]: And again, the responsibilities that come along with that.

479
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,456
[SPEAKER_39]: Unit 2, which we'll be getting shortly, has to do with nourishing ourselves and our cities.

480
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:53,941
[SPEAKER_39]: So students explore the basic principles of nutrition and investigate the health impact of processed foods and sugar.

481
00:51:54,742 --> 00:52:01,086
[SPEAKER_39]: They'll learn how to deal with such issues such as obesity and access to healthy food.

482
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:09,951
[SPEAKER_39]: Moving on to Unit 3, which probably will be towards the beginning of the new calendar year, growing the food we need.

483
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:15,434
[SPEAKER_39]: Students will learn of the global system that produces our fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, and seafood.

484
00:52:15,914 --> 00:52:20,137
[SPEAKER_39]: They will consider how climate impacts our ability to grow food.

485
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:27,963
[SPEAKER_39]: Along the way, they'll be doing a lot of writing, a lot of critical thinking, again, a lot of communicating with their partners around the world.

486
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:37,511
[SPEAKER_39]: As they move on to Unit 4, probably around late February, early March, they will be studying delivering food to the world.

487
00:52:37,712 --> 00:52:38,893
[SPEAKER_39]: That is that unit theme.

488
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:54,869
[SPEAKER_39]: Students will learn how food gets from the farm to their plates through a network of global food supply chains, which I think is a great lesson because many of us don't appreciate how difficult it is for our food to be transported to us.

489
00:52:56,568 --> 00:53:08,355
[SPEAKER_39]: And lastly, as is true with all of the curriculum projects in this program, there is an action plan or an action project called Community in Action.

490
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:17,421
[SPEAKER_39]: And students will reflect on what they have learned about nutrition and food security and they will design a project that addresses one of these topics.

491
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,923
[SPEAKER_39]: So again, in a nutshell, that is the curriculum.

492
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:26,584
[SPEAKER_39]: I certainly do have more information if anyone is interested, but in the interest of time, that's a snapshot.

493
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:32,146
[SPEAKER_39]: This program has a lot of professional development embedded into it.

494
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:40,648
[SPEAKER_39]: So the teachers who are involved at least once a month are involved with online professional development through a webinar.

495
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:44,856
[SPEAKER_39]: most of the reviews have been very positive.

496
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:56,792
[SPEAKER_39]: So not only are they getting professional development in pedagogy, but they're also getting professional development in content, which we know our teachers want and need for their relicensure.

497
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:03,714
[SPEAKER_39]: There is a symposium that is occurring in just a few days, really.

498
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:06,756
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe it begins on October 22nd.

499
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:13,258
[SPEAKER_39]: So select district personnel were invited to participate in this project in Paris.

500
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:15,079
[SPEAKER_39]: So this is really exciting.

501
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:23,883
[SPEAKER_39]: So the title of the symposium is Students and the Global Edge, Evaluating the Global Digital Educational Experience.

502
00:54:24,603 --> 00:54:34,669
[SPEAKER_39]: So we're really excited, Superintendent Belson and one of our 7th grade teachers, Frank Zizzo, who is at the Andrews, will be participating in this symposium.

503
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:48,157
[SPEAKER_39]: Frank Zizzo has been instrumental in bringing the Skype aspect to these interactions with these other schools around the world, and he has been a model, so he was invited to participate in the program.

504
00:54:49,568 --> 00:54:58,115
[SPEAKER_39]: So at this point, I think Superintendent Belson wanted to add something to this, to the symposium part of this presentation.

505
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the program's a terrific program.

506
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:13,622
[SPEAKER_13]: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.

507
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,464
[SPEAKER_13]: This is cutting edge activity.

508
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:21,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.

509
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.

510
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:25,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.

511
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:34,716
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.

512
00:55:35,056 --> 00:55:38,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.

513
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:50,325
[SPEAKER_13]: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.

514
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority.

515
00:55:54,183 --> 00:56:09,812
[SPEAKER_13]: You're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.

516
00:56:10,372 --> 00:56:20,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in

517
00:56:21,492 --> 00:56:28,974
[SPEAKER_13]: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.

518
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:30,475
[SPEAKER_43]: Very good.

519
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:30,575
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

520
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:39,597
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also, the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.

521
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,838
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think it's really very important.

522
00:56:43,518 --> 00:56:45,019
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to go through them really quickly.

523
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:58,989
[SPEAKER_43]: But to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate opportunity for all.

524
00:56:59,569 --> 00:57:06,154
[SPEAKER_43]: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Brazil,

525
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:15,861
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sorry, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.

526
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:22,347
[SPEAKER_43]: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.

527
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:28,292
[SPEAKER_43]: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these, I mean, it's incredible.

528
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:32,935
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think it's very important that we have representation.

529
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:37,544
[SPEAKER_43]: Do I have to make a motion?

530
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:38,305
[SPEAKER_43]: Motion for approval.

531
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,306
[SPEAKER_43]: So motion to approve that the superintendent goes.

532
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:42,088
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a second on the floor?

533
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:43,349
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

534
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:44,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Ms.

535
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:44,390
[SPEAKER_42]: Kretz.

536
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:45,531
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Benedetto.

537
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:57,543
[SPEAKER_32]: So I was just wondering, are we the only Massachusetts school attending this conference?

538
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:02,655
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.

539
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:07,076
[SPEAKER_13]: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbitt.

540
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:15,219
[SPEAKER_32]: And is it typical for a superintendent to go as well as a teacher?

541
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,179
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

542
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:17,160
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just checking.

543
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,820
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just asking.

544
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, absolutely.

545
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:26,063
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.

546
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,080
[SPEAKER_32]: I think my colleague has a question.

547
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:30,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Ms.

548
00:58:30,142 --> 00:58:30,463
[SPEAKER_32]: Quinn?

549
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:30,763
[SPEAKER_32]: Ms.

550
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,666
[SPEAKER_32]: Stone?

551
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:33,487
[SPEAKER_46]: Ms.

552
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:36,693
[SPEAKER_46]: Friccidelli, so Mr. Zizzo is the point person for the Andrews.

553
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:39,938
[SPEAKER_46]: Is there a point person at the McLennan were they invited as well?

554
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:41,939
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

555
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:45,921
[SPEAKER_39]: There were, to my knowledge, three people invited.

556
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:47,361
[SPEAKER_39]: I was invited.

557
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:48,722
[SPEAKER_39]: I declined the invitation.

558
00:58:50,382 --> 00:58:53,543
[SPEAKER_39]: They did not select four schools.

559
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:57,565
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Zizzo was selected because of his contribution.

560
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:06,895
[SPEAKER_39]: Outside of his regular duties, he introduced the entire program to how Skype could be used in it.

561
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:10,699
[SPEAKER_39]: So that's how he differentiated himself from the rest.

562
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:12,481
[SPEAKER_39]: The other teachers are fantastic.

563
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,562
[SPEAKER_39]: They do a great job.

564
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:19,525
[SPEAKER_39]: the other teacher, there's several teachers involved, at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

565
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:24,507
[SPEAKER_39]: But again, what set him apart was his contribution with the Skype.

566
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:28,029
[SPEAKER_46]: So there's four seventh grade global scholars, right?

567
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:29,989
[SPEAKER_46]: Two at each middle school, A and B side?

568
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:30,750
[SPEAKER_46]: That's correct.

569
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:36,412
[SPEAKER_46]: So should that be something we should think about, that to let a McGlynn

570
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:42,839
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

571
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:51,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.

572
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:59,748
[SPEAKER_13]: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.

573
00:59:59,788 --> 01:00:03,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, we're the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.

574
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:07,384
[SPEAKER_13]: They were looking at us for ideas.

575
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:12,325
[SPEAKER_13]: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.

576
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:18,627
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.

577
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:34,750
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.

578
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:36,732
[SPEAKER_13]: and create some outcomes that are there.

579
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:38,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a selection of the program.

580
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:41,274
[SPEAKER_46]: And I mean, I think Mr. Zizzo's great.

581
01:00:41,515 --> 01:00:43,336
[SPEAKER_46]: Teagan has him this year for seventh grade.

582
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:49,799
[SPEAKER_46]: So then is Mr. Zizzo, does he come back and teach the rest of the three seventh grade teachers about the Skyping tool?

583
01:00:50,320 --> 01:01:02,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.

584
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:07,919
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.

585
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:09,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.

586
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:19,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you might imagine, with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.

587
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:29,976
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we bring back some ideas, and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.

588
01:01:29,996 --> 01:01:31,478
[SPEAKER_43]: Can I just follow up?

589
01:01:33,553 --> 01:01:37,094
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.

590
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:45,116
[SPEAKER_43]: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.

591
01:01:45,236 --> 01:01:51,118
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,

592
01:01:51,918 --> 01:02:06,410
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.

593
01:02:07,651 --> 01:02:09,412
[SPEAKER_43]: As you said, it's only been four years.

594
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:18,440
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.

595
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:33,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Participated in a teleconference Earlier in the year and his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more let's say complete setting

596
01:02:36,813 --> 01:02:45,983
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?

597
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:46,684
[SPEAKER_43]: How has that worked?

598
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:49,427
[SPEAKER_39]: So it's not easy, it's a very good question.

599
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:51,790
[SPEAKER_39]: There are some cities around the world we are

600
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:55,744
[SPEAKER_39]: who we are not able to Skype with because of the time difference.

601
01:02:56,104 --> 01:03:03,709
[SPEAKER_39]: So we have heard stories of schools around the country actually coming back at 6 o'clock at night so that they can Skype with our students.

602
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:11,434
[SPEAKER_39]: So it's kind of taken off on a whole new life of its own in other countries, and they get excited to do it.

603
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:11,974
[SPEAKER_39]: OK.

604
01:03:11,994 --> 01:03:16,197
[SPEAKER_39]: Have our students done that too, just go back to school to accommodate the time frame?

605
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:17,517
[SPEAKER_39]: Not to my knowledge.

606
01:03:17,537 --> 01:03:17,577
[SPEAKER_39]: No.

607
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:17,838
[SPEAKER_39]: OK.

608
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:19,479
[SPEAKER_39]: Not to my knowledge.

609
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:20,559
[SPEAKER_39]: Can I just want to?

610
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:28,695
[SPEAKER_39]: just so everyone hears, the selection of Mr. Zizzo was done by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

611
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:34,960
[SPEAKER_39]: It had nothing to do with Medford Public Schools, and I think that is important to make very clear.

612
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:38,724
[SPEAKER_39]: They selected him, they selected Superintendent Belson.

613
01:03:38,884 --> 01:03:39,665
[SPEAKER_39]: That's what I figured.

614
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,286
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, thank you.

615
01:03:41,346 --> 01:03:48,473
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.

616
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:55,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.

617
01:03:57,064 --> 01:04:04,832
[SPEAKER_13]: It was interesting, I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to students in Athens in Greek last year.

618
01:04:05,372 --> 01:04:15,302
[SPEAKER_13]: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.

619
01:04:15,362 --> 01:04:21,047
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will

620
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:27,292
[SPEAKER_13]: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.

621
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:30,103
[SPEAKER_32]: Very good, Mr. Benedetto, follow up you.

622
01:04:31,043 --> 01:04:35,585
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm very glad that you're going, Mr. Superintendent, for a few reasons.

623
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:43,428
[SPEAKER_32]: Number one, I've seen you represent us very well in very official capacities, and I know you'll represent us well.

624
01:04:43,848 --> 01:04:53,152
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that you will take every opportunity to talk to Mr. Bloomberg and bring him and his money back to Medford where he started and where his money belongs.

625
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,893
[SPEAKER_32]: And so make sure you

626
01:04:58,064 --> 01:05:09,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to tell you one quick story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,

627
01:05:10,361 --> 01:05:18,844
[SPEAKER_13]: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.

628
01:05:19,404 --> 01:05:23,505
[SPEAKER_13]: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.

629
01:05:24,005 --> 01:05:25,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And it turned out that he got a D in French.

630
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:29,847
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?

631
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:31,647
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

632
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:33,548
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Tringali.

633
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:40,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was wondering in what ways are students allowed to communicate with each other like student to student?

634
01:05:41,593 --> 01:05:43,774
[SPEAKER_39]: So they text each other.

635
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,054
[SPEAKER_39]: So they have a common lesson.

636
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,795
[SPEAKER_39]: So all of the lessons are formed well in advance.

637
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:52,336
[SPEAKER_39]: It's, again, on that Haiku portal.

638
01:05:52,796 --> 01:05:56,637
[SPEAKER_39]: So they have prompts, they have questions about a lesson.

639
01:05:56,657 --> 01:05:58,598
[SPEAKER_39]: So in this case, it will be a lesson about food.

640
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:10,413
[SPEAKER_39]: So they're responding, so students are asked to critique, in a pleasant way, to critique the writing of the fellow students on the other side of the world.

641
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:14,820
[SPEAKER_39]: And a lot of times there's a conversation that develops about

642
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:22,041
[SPEAKER_39]: I can imagine conversations about, this is what we eat here, and we have farms here.

643
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:35,344
[SPEAKER_39]: So it starts off as a very defined conversation, but oftentimes, it evolves into, what would a 10 to 13-year-old want to talk about with regard to the content area?

644
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:41,965
[SPEAKER_39]: So again, it's defined, and it's prescriptive, but there's a little wiggle room for the kids to express their personality.

645
01:06:42,245 --> 01:06:43,788
[SPEAKER_39]: All in a protected environment.

646
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,749
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

647
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:13,529
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

648
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,050
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

649
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,871
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

650
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:22,720
[SPEAKER_42]: Next up, recommendation to accept the Buddy Bench donation.

651
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,545
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.

652
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:33,551
[SPEAKER_22]: So as you know, we have buddy benches in all of our elementary schools, and we're very proud of that.

653
01:07:34,212 --> 01:07:38,836
[SPEAKER_22]: But Mr. Mark Tonello is donating a buddy bench to the Brooks Elementary School.

654
01:07:38,876 --> 01:07:43,740
[SPEAKER_22]: This will be an indoor buddy bench, in memory of his uncle, Victor Lepore.

655
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:48,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Lepore taught English and reading for 30 years in Medford.

656
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:54,146
[SPEAKER_22]: In his early years, he taught at the Dean's School and then at the Hobbs Junior High School.

657
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:59,028
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm very proud to say that school committee member Robert Emmett Skerry, Jr.

658
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:05,309
[SPEAKER_22]: constructed this bench for the Tonello DiPaolo family, so thank you very much, Mr. Skerry.

659
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:13,852
[SPEAKER_22]: There will be a dedication taking place on Friday, October 20th at the Brooks Elementary School at 4 o'clock, and you're all invited.

660
01:08:17,858 --> 01:08:18,018
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

661
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:24,883
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuneo, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?

662
01:08:25,223 --> 01:08:25,964
[SPEAKER_43]: And Mr. Skerry?

663
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:28,585
[SPEAKER_43]: We're saying thank you to him.

664
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,747
[SPEAKER_43]: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.

665
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,369
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

666
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:33,429
[SPEAKER_42]: Ms.

667
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:34,009
[SPEAKER_42]: Cuneo?

668
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:34,610
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion.

669
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:36,651
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

670
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,292
[SPEAKER_42]: Roll call vote, please.

671
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:42,315
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

672
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:03,543
[SPEAKER_22]: So I have to say this is one of my favorite times of the year.

673
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:16,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Although it happens at the end of the school year in June, I am so very proud and we should all be very happy that we have Kiwanians in our community that give back to our schools on a regular basis.

674
01:09:17,244 --> 01:09:24,769
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'd once again like to thank the Kiwanis Club of Medford for their generous donation of books to our first and third grade children.

675
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:29,752
[SPEAKER_22]: The Kiwanis Club has always gone above and beyond for the children of Medford.

676
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:37,618
[SPEAKER_22]: So in June, members of the Kiwanis Club visited each of our schools and gave each child a bag filled with books for summer reading.

677
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:41,140
[SPEAKER_22]: So I know I've said this before, but you have to see the students.

678
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:45,643
[SPEAKER_22]: They get their books and we say, now don't open your books till you get back to the classroom.

679
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:54,268
[SPEAKER_22]: The words even out of our mouths, the kids have opened the books, they're looking at the, and they're trading already, which is very, very exciting.

680
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:57,970
[SPEAKER_22]: So once again, I have some Kewaneean members here.

681
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:08,036
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to call, if they can all come to the podium, Kelly Catalo, Andrea Bates-McGrath, Rick Herviello, and Chuck Veneziano.

682
01:10:08,056 --> 01:10:11,098
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have to be there to watch this happen.

683
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:13,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Chuck does this song and dance with the kids.

684
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:14,640
[SPEAKER_22]: He's so entertaining.

685
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:20,576
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you don't mind, if I could read some of these letters, because they are priceless.

686
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:26,324
[SPEAKER_22]: So our teachers obviously have the kids write letters to thank the Kiwanis.

687
01:10:26,344 --> 01:10:27,545
[SPEAKER_22]: These happen to come from Ms.

688
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:28,787
[SPEAKER_22]: McKay's room.

689
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:30,589
[SPEAKER_22]: She always gets these out right away.

690
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Dear Kiwanis, we love you.

691
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:35,773
[SPEAKER_22]: We love that you spend your free time with us.

692
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,514
[SPEAKER_22]: I will be sad that I won't get to see you anymore.

693
01:10:38,554 --> 01:10:39,875
[SPEAKER_22]: She must be a third grader.

694
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:44,058
[SPEAKER_22]: But we'll always cherish you in my heart and in the books.

695
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:46,139
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, I wrote a book myself.

696
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:49,941
[SPEAKER_22]: It's called Zoe in the Class School Bus Adventures.

697
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:55,645
[SPEAKER_22]: And just after that inspirational speech, I finally know what book to write.

698
01:10:55,905 --> 01:10:56,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

699
01:10:56,825 --> 01:10:57,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Love, Regina.

700
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:01,929
[SPEAKER_22]: A second letter of only read three.

701
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:02,990
[SPEAKER_22]: There could be a lot here.

702
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Dear Kiwanis members, thanks so much for the books.

703
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:09,613
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for spending your free time with us.

704
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:12,274
[SPEAKER_22]: When we get in the classroom, we get to trade.

705
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:16,576
[SPEAKER_22]: I got rid of Skateboard Party, apparently didn't like that one.

706
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:19,357
[SPEAKER_22]: Where did you get those awesome books?

707
01:11:19,517 --> 01:11:23,039
[SPEAKER_22]: You're the best book givers in the whole universe.

708
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:24,940
[SPEAKER_22]: This was from Sarah.

709
01:11:26,068 --> 01:11:28,931
[SPEAKER_22]: And the last one is one of my very favorites.

710
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:30,032
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you see it.

711
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:31,173
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all in caps.

712
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:37,017
[SPEAKER_22]: Dear Kiwanis members, I'm very grateful for the books you gave me and my friends.

713
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:41,160
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are very, caps, bold, helpful.

714
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:43,562
[SPEAKER_22]: You are also very inspiring.

715
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:46,685
[SPEAKER_22]: You show people to have hope when they're down.

716
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:50,488
[SPEAKER_22]: You help people with moving soft drinks and bills.

717
01:11:50,988 --> 01:11:55,212
[SPEAKER_22]: You're a caring group of people who want to make the world a better place.

718
01:11:55,992 --> 01:12:00,156
[SPEAKER_22]: If you keep doing what you're doing, the Kiwanis might go worldwide.

719
01:12:02,346 --> 01:12:04,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Should we tell her you're already worldwide?

720
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:09,230
[SPEAKER_22]: You help people know that they're safe when they're around you.

721
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:13,453
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford is a better place to live in it with you guys here.

722
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:15,214
[SPEAKER_22]: Sincerely, Jayden.

723
01:12:15,334 --> 01:12:15,754
[SPEAKER_22]: P.S.

724
01:12:16,494 --> 01:12:20,497
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to ask my mom if she can post a video picture of me reading one of your books.

725
01:12:22,378 --> 01:12:30,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So on behalf of Medford Public Schools, grades one and three, all of our teachers and staff and families, thank you so much.

726
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:43,207
[SPEAKER_40]: It is actually our honor and privilege to contribute to the children of Medford, because that's what Kiwanis is all about.

727
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:48,655
[SPEAKER_40]: It's all about serving the children of the world, and our job is to serve the children of Medford.

728
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:52,351
[SPEAKER_40]: And it's not just the literacy program that we hold dear to our heart.

729
01:12:52,712 --> 01:12:54,312
[SPEAKER_40]: It's our scholarship program.

730
01:12:54,892 --> 01:13:02,115
[SPEAKER_40]: It's our contributing to the graduation ceremony at Curtis Tufts, providing a scholarship to a Curtis Tufts student.

731
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:06,557
[SPEAKER_40]: It's giving to Medford High School athletics, Medford High School band.

732
01:13:07,017 --> 01:13:12,800
[SPEAKER_40]: This year we picked up the culinary arts program and provided new aprons and jackets to them.

733
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:19,522
[SPEAKER_40]: And more than half of our fundraising budget goes to the children of Medford.

734
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_40]: And we are committed.

735
01:13:21,923 --> 01:13:22,203
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

736
01:13:23,763 --> 01:13:33,266
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'm glad that my fellow Colonians, our current president, Chucky Veneziano, Rich Carvello, as all of you know, is our past president.

737
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:37,847
[SPEAKER_40]: Kelly Catalo will be the president next year, and my presidency just ended.

738
01:13:38,368 --> 01:13:39,148
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you very much.

739
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:46,173
[SPEAKER_58]: Good evening, Madam President.

740
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:54,923
[SPEAKER_58]: Tonight, we have the honor of welcoming a man who was a student from Italy from 1983.

741
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:59,268
[SPEAKER_58]: And he stayed with a colonial family, John Sotrano's family.

742
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,992
[SPEAKER_58]: And Sotrano's and DeFracchi's

743
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:11,623
[SPEAKER_58]: stayed friendly for all these years to the kids or anything and tonight he was our guest at the Kiwanis and he is the mayor of St.

744
01:14:11,703 --> 01:14:14,988
[SPEAKER_58]: Ambrose in Italy.

745
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:16,570
[SPEAKER_58]: We were proud to have him there tonight.

746
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,335
[SPEAKER_58]: The family just keeps growing.

747
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:21,356
[SPEAKER_42]: What a nice story.

748
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:27,722
[SPEAKER_42]: I got to witness firsthand the event at the Roberts, and it is an event, I've got to tell you.

749
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:38,772
[SPEAKER_42]: I was quite surprised, but the kids were so elated to see you all come in and just to hear the stories and Kelly's enthusiasm, and it was a fabulous afternoon, so thank you for letting me share with you.

750
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:43,497
[SPEAKER_27]: And thank you to the City of Medford for helping us put on Jail Day 5K and shutting down the streets so we could do that.

751
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:51,073
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

752
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:56,018
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion that this report be placed on file, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

753
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:56,758
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

754
01:14:57,499 --> 01:14:58,120
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

755
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:58,780
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

756
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:04,866
[SPEAKER_42]: Can we send a thank you letter to the Quantians as well?

757
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:09,450
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on Professional Development Day, November 7th, 2017.

758
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:09,910
[SPEAKER_42]: Ms.

759
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:10,451
[SPEAKER_42]: Caldwell.

760
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:19,631
[SPEAKER_22]: So as most of you know, our professional development day is coming up on November 7th.

761
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:22,332
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be our first of two days.

762
01:15:23,113 --> 01:15:26,935
[SPEAKER_22]: The elementary staff will be meeting at the McGlynn Elementary School.

763
01:15:27,475 --> 01:15:30,777
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course, we've asked them to park at Hormel because it's voting day.

764
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,137
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't want that to interfere.

765
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:38,585
[SPEAKER_22]: And they will be participating in grade level workshops on response to intervention.

766
01:15:39,446 --> 01:15:47,616
[SPEAKER_22]: You may remember this was one of the district initiatives that you wanted to see us do and our teachers want to be trained in.

767
01:15:49,698 --> 01:16:01,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Teachers 21 is a consulting firm from Newton, Mass., who will work with our staff to build a shared understanding of RTI fundamentals and help us consider our next steps.

768
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:09,250
[SPEAKER_22]: Staff will understand the structures, processes, and instructional practices needed for successful implementation of RTI.

769
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:19,233
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition, staff will work collaboratively, self-assess current capacities, and plan for the next step for implementation of RTI.

770
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:26,376
[SPEAKER_22]: The middle schools will participate in Study Island as a universal screening behavioral intervention tool.

771
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:34,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Teachers will learn to utilize Study Island questions and develop a fall-winter screener exam for grades 6, 7, and 8.

772
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:39,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Administrators and teachers will review behavioral interventions

773
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,551
[SPEAKER_22]: and develop their own pyramid to determine what is considered Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3.

774
01:16:46,312 --> 01:16:50,419
[SPEAKER_22]: The Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School will meet at Medford High School.

775
01:16:51,404 --> 01:17:08,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford High Vocational School and the Curtis Tufts staff will participate in workshops regarding specific building-based data collection in focus group discussions and identify topics from their ongoing partnerships with Harvard University and Boston College.

776
01:17:09,594 --> 01:17:23,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Paraprofessionals in Medford will collaborate with each other on online curriculum in three research-based modules, Independence, Positive Behavior Supports, and Effective Communication.

777
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:30,988
[SPEAKER_22]: The Fine Arts Department will focus on teaching pathways through the music curriculum, as well as concepts in art education.

778
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:37,293
[SPEAKER_22]: Nurses, physical education, and health education staff will participate in safety care training.

779
01:17:38,113 --> 01:17:41,394
[SPEAKER_22]: There are many other groups of specialists involved.

780
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:47,577
[SPEAKER_22]: There are guidance people and psychologists that we're just getting information on them.

781
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:49,418
[SPEAKER_22]: I just couldn't put them all down at one time.

782
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:56,541
[SPEAKER_22]: So after Professional Development Day, we will provide you with a report letting you know how we made out on that day.

783
01:17:57,361 --> 01:17:57,901
[SPEAKER_32]: Very good.

784
01:17:58,741 --> 01:17:59,502
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

785
01:17:59,522 --> 01:18:00,622
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

786
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:01,543
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for the report.

787
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:05,993
[SPEAKER_32]: I just had a question about the RTI fundamentals.

788
01:18:06,093 --> 01:18:12,579
[SPEAKER_32]: I know we were considering adding additional help last year at budget time, so I just want to make sure.

789
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:18,064
[SPEAKER_32]: At that time, we identified additional staff members that may be helping with the RTI.

790
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:20,826
[SPEAKER_32]: Will they be helping with this training?

791
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,127
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that we, you know,

792
01:18:22,808 --> 01:18:37,832
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know exactly what staff members at the top of my head we identified as helping out with RTI, but I just want to make sure that if we are providing any training and insight to make that program better that all staff members are invited, not just the regular teachers.

793
01:18:37,872 --> 01:18:39,653
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's not just the classroom teachers.

794
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:41,575
[SPEAKER_22]: We have title one.

795
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:43,137
[SPEAKER_22]: We have literacy specialists.

796
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:45,340
[SPEAKER_22]: We have special education teachers.

797
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:46,821
[SPEAKER_22]: We have our EL staff.

798
01:18:48,243 --> 01:18:52,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of our elementary staff will be participating in this RTI.

799
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:59,517
[SPEAKER_22]: So it will be grade level, so it will be K1 teachers with one consultant, two, three, and then four or five.

800
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:11,234
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're all learning this together, so that when they have their RTI block, that everyone jumps in and helps the students to progress.

801
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:16,653
[SPEAKER_32]: And it says here, help us consider our next steps.

802
01:19:16,774 --> 01:19:21,257
[SPEAKER_32]: Would you provide us with a report of what, you know, those steps are?

803
01:19:21,477 --> 01:19:26,281
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we want to keep track of this this year in case it becomes a budget issue for next year.

804
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:27,162
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

805
01:19:27,322 --> 01:19:27,643
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

806
01:19:27,803 --> 01:19:28,183
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

807
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:31,846
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'll put that on my request of reports.

808
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:37,929
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're beginning the pilot in January with first grades and with fourth grades.

809
01:19:38,629 --> 01:19:45,272
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll probably know by the end of May how that's working out and then how we can roll that out to K-5.

810
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:54,775
[SPEAKER_32]: I just really want to make sure, because teachers spoke about how important RTI is in making those changes.

811
01:19:54,855 --> 01:20:04,579
[SPEAKER_32]: So before budget times and if we're going to allocate additional funding, I want some data and updates throughout this year.

812
01:20:04,619 --> 01:20:05,079
[SPEAKER_32]: So maybe-.

813
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:10,022
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe in January, we can have an update of how it's going and what it's looking like.

814
01:20:10,062 --> 01:20:21,872
[SPEAKER_32]: So by March, when the superintendent's thinking where I'm allocating funds for next year, if we do see any concerns, he can keep it on his radar, because I'm keeping it on mine, Mr. Bellson.

815
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:28,838
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would think that by the end of January or February, because we're just beginning January, we need about four to six weeks to get it started.

816
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:31,040
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll put by February 1st on my paperwork.

817
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,883
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion that reports do be listed for RTI next steps.

818
01:20:35,203 --> 01:20:35,423
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

819
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:36,444
[SPEAKER_42]: Added to our agenda.

820
01:20:37,025 --> 01:20:37,886
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

821
01:20:38,246 --> 01:20:38,346
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

822
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,327
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

823
01:20:39,587 --> 01:20:40,088
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

824
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:53,175
[SPEAKER_32]: Mayor Burke, there was a request that you had made for a report at our last meeting that I didn't notice on our... There's one on there that you can run off to.

825
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:53,375
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

826
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:54,636
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

827
01:20:54,837 --> 01:20:58,680
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just didn't know if this was an appropriate time to make a comment for that.

828
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:58,860
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure.

829
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,421
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that okay?

830
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:03,505
[SPEAKER_32]: You had asked for a breakdown of the male-female concussion report.

831
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:10,044
[SPEAKER_32]: at our last meeting, and I didn't see that report on the list of requested reports, so.

832
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:13,246
[SPEAKER_42]: Male, female concussion reports by sport.

833
01:21:13,986 --> 01:21:23,331
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, and also just to keep in mind that we asked that non-athletic concussions be followed if we're notified at that same meeting.

834
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:30,194
[SPEAKER_32]: So just as a reminder that that data is important for all students, not just our athletic students.

835
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:33,104
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

836
01:21:33,344 --> 01:21:36,205
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion of this report to be placed on file, all those in favor?

837
01:21:36,866 --> 01:21:37,546
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

838
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:38,106
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

839
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,166
[SPEAKER_42]: The report is on file.

840
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:43,708
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on elementary science program school year 17-18.

841
01:21:43,728 --> 01:21:43,928
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Seary.

842
01:21:47,074 --> 01:22:02,316
[SPEAKER_22]: So this evening, Rocco Sieri, Director of Science, will update you on the efforts to realign the science and technology engineering curriculum, as well as the variety of science programs that are being piloted in our elementary schools.

843
01:22:02,997 --> 01:22:18,623
[SPEAKER_22]: The following topics will be discussed, information on science programs, professional development and materials, surveying staff, administrators, and parents on said programs, professional development for current school year, and additional resources.

844
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:24,345
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just want to take a moment to thank Mr. Cieri for his very hard work in science.

845
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:38,037
[SPEAKER_22]: He spent a lot of time working with not just our elementary staff, but parents who wanted to be a part of looking at what we might pilot next year.

846
01:22:38,497 --> 01:22:39,658
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you, Mr. Sierra.

847
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:56,624
[SPEAKER_51]: Good evening, everyone.

848
01:22:57,464 --> 01:22:58,985
[SPEAKER_51]: Thanks for having me here tonight.

849
01:22:59,005 --> 01:23:05,070
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm pretty excited to be speaking about K-5 science rather than high school science, middle school science.

850
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:09,953
[SPEAKER_51]: We're finally here looking at K-5 science programs.

851
01:23:11,034 --> 01:23:16,798
[SPEAKER_51]: The report you have in front of you sort of highlights a little bit of what we've accomplished since last year.

852
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:34,666
[SPEAKER_51]: Starting in April 6th through the end of May, we invited vendors in with their most current science programs and had teachers review them, look at the materials that they provided, a whole series of things, let them do presentations.

853
01:23:35,146 --> 01:23:37,087
[SPEAKER_51]: Parents were there, administrators were there.

854
01:23:38,127 --> 01:24:04,981
[SPEAKER_51]: Myself and 24 teachers from all there were representatives from every elementary school at every level so it was a very Sort of cohesive group that showed up on a regular basis after school You know some chocolate and snacks were provided as often as I could put them in place, but they were always there and it was a really Very productive group

855
01:24:06,144 --> 01:24:30,972
[SPEAKER_51]: So we looked at five programs, Know Adam, Inspire Science from McGraw-Hill, Elevate Science from Pearson, Carolina Science presented a program called Smithsonian Science in the Classroom, and Delta Education, which is also a part of school specialty, these are all companies, showed us FOSS Next Generation.

856
01:24:32,464 --> 01:24:46,929
[SPEAKER_51]: The teachers filled in at the end of each presentation a survey, and then they filled in a survey at the end where they provided sort of like, now that you've seen all the programs, which ones would you, you know, want to pilot.

857
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:49,730
[SPEAKER_51]: And three sort of emerged out of those.

858
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:54,952
[SPEAKER_51]: The top by far was the McGraw-Hill Inspire Science Program.

859
01:24:56,113 --> 01:24:58,253
[SPEAKER_51]: The second two were essentially tied.

860
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:05,799
[SPEAKER_51]: the Pearson Elevate Science Program, and the Delta Education FOSS Next Generation Program.

861
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:15,304
[SPEAKER_51]: And I inquired further with those three companies about what was possible for the pilot, what they would provide for us as you had requested last year.

862
01:25:16,005 --> 01:25:29,312
[SPEAKER_51]: McGraw-Hill agreed to pilot with full access to the curriculum online, gave hard copies of the teacher guides for two teachers per grade level, all the student consumable workbooks that we need for all the students,

863
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:33,917
[SPEAKER_51]: And the small group hands-on group activity kits.

864
01:25:34,618 --> 01:25:38,183
[SPEAKER_51]: So per teacher, it's about $1,600 worth of materials.

865
01:25:38,503 --> 01:25:46,233
[SPEAKER_51]: They provided the training, which is ongoing, and we have 48 teachers this year going through that particular program.

866
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:54,822
[SPEAKER_51]: A second company I pursued a bit was Pearson, asking them what they could do.

867
01:25:55,843 --> 01:26:05,633
[SPEAKER_51]: They would allow us to pilot with full access to the curriculum online and hard copies of teacher guides, but their pilot was to start in January of this upcoming year.

868
01:26:06,674 --> 01:26:10,942
[SPEAKER_51]: They also weren't going to provide hands-on kits because they would never be available in time.

869
01:26:11,022 --> 01:26:17,133
[SPEAKER_51]: Their program is brand new, and the teachers had limited access to see what the table of contents of those programs were.

870
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:33,484
[SPEAKER_51]: So with all of that kind of information, we're kind of waiting to see what Pearson provides, and they said they were interested in providing at least a bid if in the future there was something to do, something to look at.

871
01:26:33,885 --> 01:26:41,566
[SPEAKER_51]: We could also look forward and say, okay, well, maybe we'll pilot in a future year with that particular program.

872
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:48,296
[SPEAKER_51]: just allowed us to pilot one unit.

873
01:26:48,756 --> 01:26:51,360
[SPEAKER_51]: It would include the materials, the professional development.

874
01:26:52,742 --> 01:26:58,691
[SPEAKER_51]: One unit for them is about 12 weeks worth of instruction, 12 to 14 weeks of instruction, so it's a fairly large

875
01:26:59,812 --> 01:27:10,517
[SPEAKER_51]: SWATH, and they only give you about three units per year, so we're piloting about a third of their curriculum for the next 12 to 14 weeks.

876
01:27:10,997 --> 01:27:21,321
[SPEAKER_51]: That training will start at the end of this month, will continue into the next month, and we have eight teachers piloting that from K to four, and they will be trained as well.

877
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:31,884
[SPEAKER_51]: It sounds like a much smaller pilot, but we can still sort of give them some superdelegates as they provide us information about what FOSS is like and how the implementation goes.

878
01:27:32,004 --> 01:27:40,887
[SPEAKER_51]: So I'm not sort of concerned about the number difference as much as I am the quality of the information that we get back from them as we make decisions moving forward.

879
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:44,668
[SPEAKER_51]: So those are the pilots that are ongoing at this time.

880
01:27:46,148 --> 01:27:53,350
[SPEAKER_51]: I want to make sure I have like a bullet list and making sure that I touch everything rather than give you a summary, just read through.

881
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:02,112
[SPEAKER_51]: Okay, so I mentioned McGraw-Hill, Foss.

882
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:12,013
[SPEAKER_51]: We should be prepared to consider adoption at the end of this year, looking at the two programs.

883
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:29,648
[SPEAKER_51]: We'll bring back that information to the school committee to make a decision about which direction to go and whether or not there's enough information for us as educators to make a good, solid decision.

884
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:37,364
[SPEAKER_51]: As I said, we've got another opportunity that was provided.

885
01:28:37,424 --> 01:28:38,666
[SPEAKER_51]: It's at the end of the report.

886
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:52,475
[SPEAKER_51]: I still see a bit of a need to help elementary educators understand the engineering design process and engineering thinking.

887
01:28:52,875 --> 01:29:00,158
[SPEAKER_51]: This is part of the curriculum frameworks, but it's not something that most elementary educators are trained in.

888
01:29:00,778 --> 01:29:06,080
[SPEAKER_51]: Generally, a trained engineer will work in engineering and not go to K to 5 education.

889
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:10,022
[SPEAKER_51]: So there is some support for us.

890
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:21,374
[SPEAKER_51]: in being able to train teachers using the Engineering is Elementary program, which is produced by the Museum of Science in Boston.

891
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:24,737
[SPEAKER_51]: It's a phenomenal, well-research-based program.

892
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:31,545
[SPEAKER_51]: Whether or not we choose to purchase that program for our teachers is something outside of the

893
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:40,216
[SPEAKER_51]: the discussion, it's really about what the training would give to the teachers in terms of how to understand engineering design.

894
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:49,703
[SPEAKER_51]: So that's available to us for March 12th, and we plan to offer that as one of the PD's opportunities.

895
01:29:52,784 --> 01:29:53,565
[SPEAKER_51]: cost us anything, so.

896
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:55,045
[SPEAKER_51]: There you go.

897
01:29:55,726 --> 01:29:56,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Skerry.

898
01:29:56,927 --> 01:30:09,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Through you to Mr. Skerry, would it be possible to supply us with some of the samples that you've been given so that we can see what we could possibly look at down the road as far as instrumenting a new program?

899
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:10,995
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely.

900
01:30:12,919 --> 01:30:13,239
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

901
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:14,120
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

902
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:14,540
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuneo.

903
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,901
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Chesteri.

904
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:20,463
[SPEAKER_43]: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?

905
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:23,964
[SPEAKER_43]: Have any of the teachers been involved in any of this?

906
01:30:25,285 --> 01:30:29,247
[SPEAKER_51]: So as I said, there are 48 teachers currently piloting.

907
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:33,949
[SPEAKER_51]: They've received all the kits, the teacher materials, teacher guides.

908
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:37,991
[SPEAKER_51]: They were initially trained at the end of September.

909
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:41,493
[SPEAKER_51]: So they've gone through one training that sort of gives them an overview of the program.

910
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:45,695
[SPEAKER_51]: We're training again in October at the end of the month.

911
01:30:47,856 --> 01:30:49,336
[SPEAKER_51]: The feedback's been really positive.

912
01:30:50,157 --> 01:30:51,778
[SPEAKER_51]: It's very aligned to the curriculum.

913
01:30:53,899 --> 01:31:10,367
[SPEAKER_51]: And teachers were really, when they expressed through last year's pilot that they wanted a full year or sort of uninterrupted time of using a program, I honored that and didn't

914
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:14,751
[SPEAKER_51]: try to find one that was a half measure along that.

915
01:31:15,452 --> 01:31:16,813
[SPEAKER_51]: Also, the

916
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:27,116
[SPEAKER_51]: They requested that, especially at the K-2 level, that the materials were sort of hands-on.

917
01:31:27,136 --> 01:31:35,901
[SPEAKER_51]: The initial sort of program explanation is a lot of the workbook-based or the teacher guides.

918
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:44,706
[SPEAKER_51]: And so they were concerned that it wasn't a hands-on program, at least for McGraw-Hill.

919
01:31:45,686 --> 01:31:48,389
[SPEAKER_51]: I thought they've shown something very different.

920
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:51,332
[SPEAKER_51]: Every grade level has hands-on kits.

921
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:53,975
[SPEAKER_51]: The workbook is supposed to be like a notebook.

922
01:31:54,035 --> 01:31:59,341
[SPEAKER_51]: It is scaffolded, but it's really sort of like a science notebook that students use and write in.

923
01:31:59,502 --> 01:32:01,944
[SPEAKER_51]: So it's a pretty interesting program.

924
01:32:06,619 --> 01:32:08,981
[SPEAKER_43]: even across the board?

925
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:19,189
[SPEAKER_51]: It's two per grade level, per school, so it's essentially half the faculty across the board.

926
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,812
[SPEAKER_51]: And most of the kids, believe it or not.

927
01:32:22,712 --> 01:32:30,479
[SPEAKER_51]: Yeah, because some schools have three teachers or have one teaching science, so it captures all of the kids in some grade levels.

928
01:32:36,303 --> 01:32:37,665
[SPEAKER_51]: Yeah, the kids really like it.

929
01:32:39,147 --> 01:32:42,011
[SPEAKER_51]: Some of them are saying that it's finally science time.

930
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:44,053
[SPEAKER_51]: They're getting excited, they're moving ahead.

931
01:32:45,175 --> 01:32:48,940
[SPEAKER_51]: We're getting requests for other materials and things like that, so it's a bit positive.

932
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,983
[SPEAKER_43]: Any feedback from parents?

933
01:32:51,804 --> 01:32:52,104
[SPEAKER_51]: Not yet.

934
01:32:52,765 --> 01:32:53,746
[SPEAKER_51]: Looking forward to it, though.

935
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:56,563
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm curious, so Ms.

936
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:56,964
[SPEAKER_46]: Nostal.

937
01:32:56,984 --> 01:32:58,004
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

938
01:32:58,124 --> 01:32:58,984
[SPEAKER_46]: Thanks, Mrs. Seary.

939
01:32:59,284 --> 01:33:03,105
[SPEAKER_46]: For the FOSS one with the eight teachers at the Brooks, that hasn't started yet?

940
01:33:03,326 --> 01:33:04,266
[SPEAKER_51]: That has not started.

941
01:33:04,846 --> 01:33:09,187
[SPEAKER_51]: We want to train first, provide kits, and then the teachers can start.

942
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:09,727
[SPEAKER_46]: OK.

943
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:19,150
[SPEAKER_46]: And then the other that just caught my attention, because I know it's been a while that we've been waiting to pilot, the Inspire Science Program was adopted this year by Stoneham Public Schools of the K through 5.

944
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:21,231
[SPEAKER_46]: So they didn't pilot programs.

945
01:33:21,271 --> 01:33:24,252
[SPEAKER_46]: They just went with it and started this past September.

946
01:33:25,513 --> 01:33:25,913
[SPEAKER_51]: They did.

947
01:33:27,714 --> 01:33:27,974
[SPEAKER_51]: So.

948
01:33:29,374 --> 01:33:30,474
[SPEAKER_46]: And are they having any regrets?

949
01:33:30,494 --> 01:33:31,695
[SPEAKER_46]: Do you have a contact there?

950
01:33:31,715 --> 01:33:33,175
[SPEAKER_51]: I don't know, but I can find out.

951
01:33:33,515 --> 01:33:33,875
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

952
01:33:34,116 --> 01:33:34,356
[SPEAKER_46]: Right.

953
01:33:34,896 --> 01:33:38,357
[SPEAKER_46]: They kind of threw the dice and bought a whole curriculum for a whole school system.

954
01:33:38,657 --> 01:33:38,977
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

955
01:33:40,617 --> 01:33:41,058
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

956
01:33:41,078 --> 01:33:45,119
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on file?

957
01:33:45,139 --> 01:33:45,919
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Ms.

958
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:46,459
[SPEAKER_42]: Cuno.

959
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:47,199
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

960
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:47,839
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

961
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:48,660
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

962
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,580
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

963
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,441
[SPEAKER_42]: Report on vocational technical advisory committee schedule.

964
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:07,424
[SPEAKER_13]: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.

965
01:34:07,444 --> 01:34:12,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.

966
01:34:13,426 --> 01:34:15,427
[SPEAKER_13]: They've existed over the years.

967
01:34:16,226 --> 01:34:24,609
[SPEAKER_13]: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.

968
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:34,193
[SPEAKER_13]: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the very shop instructors.

969
01:34:35,094 --> 01:34:45,058
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.

970
01:34:46,112 --> 01:34:50,094
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.

971
01:34:52,495 --> 01:35:02,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.

972
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:12,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.

973
01:35:14,388 --> 01:35:23,246
[SPEAKER_13]: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.

974
01:35:23,266 --> 01:35:23,446
Okay.

975
01:35:25,528 --> 01:35:29,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.

976
01:35:29,971 --> 01:35:32,153
[SPEAKER_13]: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.

977
01:35:33,133 --> 01:35:40,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.

978
01:35:40,559 --> 01:35:42,700
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.

979
01:35:43,661 --> 01:35:47,123
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.

980
01:35:47,644 --> 01:35:52,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various

981
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:56,723
[SPEAKER_13]: advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.

982
01:35:56,763 --> 01:35:59,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.

983
01:36:00,764 --> 01:36:07,786
[SPEAKER_13]: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.

984
01:36:08,386 --> 01:36:15,088
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.

985
01:36:18,068 --> 01:36:31,093
[SPEAKER_13]: You can be sure that our current administration of the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.

986
01:36:31,682 --> 01:36:35,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.

987
01:36:35,243 --> 01:36:44,167
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas, some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.

988
01:36:44,727 --> 01:36:59,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and

989
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:01,422
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

990
01:37:01,442 --> 01:37:01,823
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuno.

991
01:37:02,524 --> 01:37:05,228
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm looking at the co-op employers.

992
01:37:05,909 --> 01:37:11,218
[SPEAKER_43]: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?

993
01:37:11,278 --> 01:37:12,220
[SPEAKER_13]: We have students right now.

994
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:16,293
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually have students in their businesses right now.

995
01:37:16,633 --> 01:37:21,157
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?

996
01:37:21,237 --> 01:37:23,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.

997
01:37:24,019 --> 01:37:24,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

998
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly business activities, mostly with the laborers.

999
01:37:29,484 --> 01:37:31,226
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?

1000
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:32,086
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sorry?

1001
01:37:32,266 --> 01:37:33,588
[SPEAKER_43]: Business, tech, and marketing?

1002
01:37:33,968 --> 01:37:38,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.

1003
01:37:39,065 --> 01:37:40,925
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?

1004
01:37:41,586 --> 01:37:42,466
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, and the media?

1005
01:37:43,366 --> 01:37:46,127
[SPEAKER_43]: Media tech, I'm assuming will be utilizing our media?

1006
01:37:46,847 --> 01:37:48,467
[SPEAKER_43]: No, not necessarily.

1007
01:37:48,487 --> 01:37:49,547
[SPEAKER_13]: They could be outside.

1008
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:51,668
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be expansions of this.

1009
01:37:51,688 --> 01:37:53,448
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very early in the year for this.

1010
01:37:54,148 --> 01:37:54,788
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, thank you.

1011
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,869

[SPEAKER_41]: Kretz.

1013
01:37:57,489 --> 01:38:04,690
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, when we do get the next report, could we get a breakdown of how many students are in the co-op at each program?

1014
01:38:04,991 --> 01:38:06,811
[SPEAKER_41]: I was just curious about that also, thank you.

1015
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:10,564
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

1016

[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a motion from the floor to move negotiations and other legal matters to the end of the agenda?

1024
01:38:22,668 --> 01:38:23,288
[SPEAKER_42]: Moved by Ms.

01:38:41,211 --> 01:38:44,512
[SPEAKER_32]: Actually, it was it was before you started talking about this issue.

1034
01:38:44,612 --> 01:38:50,234
[SPEAKER_32]: I just realized that there was another report on the reports requested list missing.

1035
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:55,095
[SPEAKER_32]: But I'll I'll wait until after the superintendent talks about the.

1036
01:38:55,155 --> 01:39:02,897
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we tabled this so that people could have an opportunity to look it over to determine whether or not they could attend this conference.

1037
01:39:03,617 --> 01:39:08,318
[SPEAKER_42]: Are there any members that would like to be nominated as a delegate or an alternate?

1038

[SPEAKER_25]: Delegate or an alternate?

1039
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:29,676
[SPEAKER_43]: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.

1040
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:43,599
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.

1041
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:45,440
[SPEAKER_43]: There are vendors there.

1042
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,100
[SPEAKER_43]: There are opportunities on workshops.

1043
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:52,566
[SPEAKER_43]: There's really opportunities of getting to know what our positions as school committee members are.

1044
01:39:54,328 --> 01:40:02,879
[SPEAKER_43]: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations.

1045
01:40:03,519 --> 01:40:05,640
[SPEAKER_43]: or it's a particular city that tries to do that.

1046
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,041
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a lot more involved than that.

1047
01:40:08,121 --> 01:40:12,923
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state for our positions here.

1048
01:40:12,943 --> 01:40:24,429
[SPEAKER_43]: The Roberts Rules of Order, there's a lot of other things that if you have the opportunity to go, I really strongly suggest that you go and learn the policies and procedures.

1049
01:40:25,909 --> 01:40:27,190
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not saying we don't know them.

1050
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,251
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.

1051
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:34,723
[SPEAKER_42]: So, is there a motion just to receive this paper and place it on file?

[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Benedetto?

1078
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:29,547
[SPEAKER_32]: I had requested an update of the number of students taking the bus from North Meffitt to the high school and back in the evening.

1079
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:38,993
[SPEAKER_32]: I did send an email to the headmaster of our high school, and he said that they have been monitoring it.

1080
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:49,585
[SPEAKER_32]: think that some days there's less than, there's a few open seats on the bus leaving from the high school going back, but there's some days that overcrowding is happening.

1081
01:42:50,245 --> 01:42:52,686
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like some more significant data.

1082
01:42:52,746 --> 01:42:55,468
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to make sure that all our students have a ride home.

1083
01:42:55,568 --> 01:42:59,770
[SPEAKER_32]: I know there's over a hundred students taking the bus on any given day.

1084
01:43:01,031 --> 01:43:04,473
[SPEAKER_32]: So I want data and I'm requesting that for the next

1085
01:43:05,073 --> 01:43:08,555
[SPEAKER_32]: For the next meeting, I can read the email that I received.

1086
01:43:08,895 --> 01:43:09,195
[SPEAKER_32]: That's OK.

1087
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:10,575
[SPEAKER_32]: We can add it to the reports list.

1088
01:43:10,635 --> 01:43:12,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.

1089
01:43:13,016 --> 01:43:15,117
[SPEAKER_13]: We can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.

1090
01:43:15,137 --> 01:43:15,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

1091
01:43:15,638 --> 01:43:25,342
[SPEAKER_30]: Just for a brief overview, we have been monitoring the activity for the bus from the high school.

1092
01:43:25,842 --> 01:43:32,925
[SPEAKER_30]: And there has generally been between 40 and 45 students that are routinely taking the bus, so we have not seen

1093
01:43:33,429 --> 01:43:39,034
[SPEAKER_30]: the overcrowding since we have been monitoring that on a pretty much daily basis.

1094
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:45,700
[SPEAKER_30]: So there has been representation out there at the bus and making sure that the overcrowding is not taking place.

1095
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:49,203
[SPEAKER_30]: And we have adjusted for some of that on other routes as well.

1096
01:43:53,522 --> 01:44:07,907
[SPEAKER_32]: I would and I just because it's different from what I had gotten from an email and also I would like to know how many passes are given out for that bus because I heard that they have IDs to get on and off that bus at this point.

1097
01:44:08,748 --> 01:44:11,869
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's a new implementation that we have done to

1098
01:44:12,636 --> 01:44:20,402
[SPEAKER_30]: monitor the usage of the bus and ensure that there are not overcrowding for the students that are actually intended to ride that bus.

1099
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:25,066
[SPEAKER_30]: So the bus passes are being monitored as well.

1100
01:44:25,446 --> 01:44:29,629
[SPEAKER_30]: So I will confirm the count with the headmaster.

1101
01:44:29,649 --> 01:44:29,690
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

1102
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:41,599
[SPEAKER_32]: Because the email that I have in front of me, it says we currently have 104 eligible students that live in North Medford Heights area that have rode the bus at some point over the past three weeks.

1103
01:44:42,288 --> 01:44:47,433
[SPEAKER_32]: eligible and that they issued bus passage to eligible students.

1104
01:44:48,193 --> 01:44:54,739
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, so I, there are days that are a couple of open seats and other days we are over capacity by a few students.

1105
01:44:54,779 --> 01:45:02,806
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just want to make sure nobody's over capacity driving and riding in any of our bosses, especially the high school kids.

1106
01:45:02,846 --> 01:45:04,167
[SPEAKER_32]: Their backpacks are huge.

1107
01:45:04,608 --> 01:45:05,529
[SPEAKER_32]: The kids are bigger.

1108
01:45:05,969 --> 01:45:07,050
[SPEAKER_32]: There's only two to a seat.

1109
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,051
[SPEAKER_32]: realistically not three.

1110
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:14,756
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I would just like some data or like on Mondays, this is what happens.

1111
01:45:14,836 --> 01:45:16,357
[SPEAKER_32]: And on Fridays, this is what happens.

1112
01:45:16,417 --> 01:45:17,798
[SPEAKER_32]: And Wednesdays it goes crazy.

1113
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:19,299
[SPEAKER_32]: And if it rains, it's impossible.

1114
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:24,103
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to know so that way we are transporting our students, you know, safely.

1115
01:45:24,143 --> 01:45:25,945
[SPEAKER_32]: And, and, and that's all that matters.

1116
01:45:26,025 --> 01:45:29,507
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would like a report of that in that, in that way.

1117
01:45:29,988 --> 01:45:33,270
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's on the reports do list.

1118
01:45:33,831 --> 01:45:36,373
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would like that soon because we are, you know,

1119
01:45:37,106 --> 01:45:42,830
[SPEAKER_32]: halfway through October, and we need to make sure all our children are transported safely.

1120
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:44,411
[SPEAKER_32]: I would hate to have something happen.

1121
01:45:44,551 --> 01:45:53,737
[SPEAKER_30]: If I may, just as a follow-up, we do work very closely with the bus company to ensure that safety is the number one issue for all of our buses.

1122
01:45:53,837 --> 01:46:03,404
[SPEAKER_30]: So that has been a priority, especially with the high school, given the size of the seats and the reduced counts that are available.

1123
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:06,786
[SPEAKER_30]: Again, the eligible count does not mean that they're all riding.

1124
01:46:06,866 --> 01:46:11,248
[SPEAKER_30]: So we have many MBTA bus passes that we issue as well.

1125
01:46:11,648 --> 01:46:16,811
[SPEAKER_30]: So on a given day, there's not 100 students that are trying to get onto the yellow bus.

1126
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:20,793
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, that's why I'd like the numbers if you can provide them.

1127
01:46:20,853 --> 01:46:21,633
[SPEAKER_32]: I appreciate it.

1128
01:46:22,174 --> 01:46:22,554
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1129
01:46:22,874 --> 01:46:23,294
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

1130
01:46:23,354 --> 01:46:23,795
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1131
01:46:23,815 --> 01:46:26,056
[SPEAKER_42]: This motion for suspension of the rules.

1132
01:46:26,236 --> 01:46:26,996
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

1133
01:46:27,016 --> 01:46:28,117
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

1134
01:46:48,663 --> 01:46:51,045
[SPEAKER_46]: Good evening.

1135
01:46:51,345 --> 01:47:01,691
[SPEAKER_46]: We had a late resignation just before the start of the school year.

1136
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:20,927
[SPEAKER_44]: and we have been actively looking for a replacement.

1137
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:24,909
[SPEAKER_44]: We've been interviewing individuals to replace that position.

1138
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:33,956
[SPEAKER_44]: In the meantime, we do have two other BCBAs and two other behavioral specialists in the school district, and the responsibilities have been evenly divided.

1139
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:42,521
[SPEAKER_44]: So all IEP services and all evaluations are on target and all being done in compliance with regulations.

1140
01:47:43,502 --> 01:47:51,123
[SPEAKER_44]: There haven't been, to the best of my knowledge, there are no students who have gone without any service that is to be provided by a BCBA.

1141
01:47:51,143 --> 01:48:08,006
[SPEAKER_44]: I do realize that school teams oftentimes depend on people when a disruption occurs in the moment, but we are well staffed with school psychologists, school adjustment counselors, and other support staff who are equipped to be able to manage those situations.

1142
01:48:08,427 --> 01:48:10,827
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'm unclear of the roles of everyone, but

1143
01:48:11,518 --> 01:48:16,203
[SPEAKER_46]: In the McGlynn, they said the adjustment counselor is doing some of what a behaviorist would do.

1144
01:48:16,303 --> 01:48:19,266
[SPEAKER_46]: So is the adjustment counselor the same schooling as a behaviorist?

1145
01:48:19,887 --> 01:48:22,590
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, so a BCBA is an analyst.

1146
01:48:23,211 --> 01:48:27,936
[SPEAKER_44]: So their role is not necessarily to do the direct hands-on work with the student.

1147
01:48:28,356 --> 01:48:31,720
[SPEAKER_44]: It's to respond to situations.

1148
01:48:32,614 --> 01:48:43,161
[SPEAKER_44]: after they've gone through a school adjustment counselor, school psychologist, and other members of the team to analyze the situation, to look at it from a behavioral perspective, and to design intervention plans.

1149
01:48:43,561 --> 01:48:53,908
[SPEAKER_44]: The intervention plans then get carried out by, say, a school psychologist or a school adjustment counselor, maybe teachers, paraprofessionals, other members of the school team.

1150
01:48:56,470 --> 01:49:01,653
[SPEAKER_44]: the school adjustment counselor should be the person who's on the ground working with students directly.

1151
01:49:02,113 --> 01:49:05,474
[SPEAKER_46]: And is there a shortage of behaviorists in our area?

1152
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:15,159
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, I think there's, um, there's a growing, there's a growing, um, presence of BCBAs in the school setting.

1153
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:20,942
[SPEAKER_44]: So in past years, I mean, as you know, here in Medford, I mean, we didn't have,

1154
01:49:21,352 --> 01:49:23,534
[SPEAKER_44]: three BCBAs until two years ago.

1155
01:49:24,074 --> 01:49:35,623
[SPEAKER_44]: So we added a BCBA two years ago, we added the second BCBA maybe four years ago, and prior to that we had one, and if you went back ten years ago, we didn't have any.

1156
01:49:36,203 --> 01:49:46,952
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's, BCBAs are very, they look at things from an analytical perspective, they break down a behavior to identify the cause, and recommend interventions to

1157
01:49:47,752 --> 01:49:49,093
[SPEAKER_44]: mitigate that need.

1158
01:49:49,533 --> 01:49:58,699
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's just that schools are seeing, with an increase of individuals with social behavioral presentation, they're seeing a greater need.

1159
01:49:58,739 --> 01:50:03,283
[SPEAKER_44]: So, yes, schools are hiring BCPAs, so that creates a shortage.

1160
01:50:03,703 --> 01:50:08,226
[SPEAKER_44]: But we are doing what we can to hire qualified staff to replace that position.

1161
01:50:08,426 --> 01:50:12,629
[SPEAKER_46]: Is our salary comparable to areas around us for our behaviorists?

1162
01:50:13,637 --> 01:50:15,658
[SPEAKER_46]: And have you had any leads, or is it some?

1163
01:50:15,738 --> 01:50:23,362
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, we've been interviewing, and it's just we haven't identified a person who could fit our needs, what we're looking for in a BCBA.

1164
01:50:24,575 --> 01:50:30,980
[SPEAKER_46]: And in the meantime, you're confident that kids are all getting their services met, that we don't need a subcontractor for behaviors?

1165
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:37,846
[SPEAKER_44]: Nobody has reported that there are any students with IEP services to me that have not been provided for.

1166
01:50:38,486 --> 01:50:50,696
[SPEAKER_44]: And the evaluation load, like I said, has been redistributed, and all of the evals, we've been monitoring the evaluations, and they have been coming back on time, within the required timeline.

1167
01:50:50,996 --> 01:50:53,478
[SPEAKER_46]: So the three that we have, one's full-time at the Roberts,

1168
01:50:54,014 --> 01:50:56,436
[SPEAKER_46]: One shared between the Andrews and the Columbus?

1169
01:50:56,556 --> 01:50:57,958
[SPEAKER_46]: They're all district-wide staff.

1170
01:50:58,378 --> 01:51:00,540
[SPEAKER_44]: So we place staff when we need those staff.

1171
01:51:01,261 --> 01:51:07,006
[SPEAKER_44]: So right now we have a large need for BCBA services at the Roberts.

1172
01:51:07,506 --> 01:51:12,531
[SPEAKER_44]: So Mr. Corman's home base is at the Roberts.

1173
01:51:13,031 --> 01:51:16,715
[SPEAKER_44]: But he can provide services to other students around the district as needed.

1174
01:51:17,272 --> 01:51:27,074
[SPEAKER_44]: And then we have another individual who has their office over at the Columbus, because that's a high-needs building, but also provides BCBA services across the district.

1175
01:51:27,754 --> 01:51:39,017
[SPEAKER_44]: And then the individual who had left primarily had an office over at the McGlynn, so that's why they're feeling the loss, because if your office is in a building, you're easier to

1176
01:51:40,212 --> 01:51:45,396
[SPEAKER_44]: obtain contact with and come to somebody's aid in an immediate way.

1177
01:51:45,717 --> 01:51:47,378
[SPEAKER_44]: And then where's the third one's office?

1178
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:50,180
[SPEAKER_46]: We have Island Buckley's up at the high school.

1179
01:51:51,568 --> 01:51:56,852
[SPEAKER_46]: So then has the one that's housed at the Columbus or the one that's housed at the Roberts gone to the McGlynn?

1180
01:51:57,772 --> 01:51:59,433
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, I don't know specifically.

1181
01:52:00,054 --> 01:52:09,941
[SPEAKER_44]: What we did was we sat down and said, these are the evaluations that need to be conducted, and these are the students with direct services oversight, and those children are covered.

1182
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:18,465
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, so what I'm, just so we're all on the same page, what I'm hearing is that the one at the Roberts is at the Roberts, doesn't go anywhere else.

1183
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:21,228
[SPEAKER_46]: The one at the Andrews and the Columbus only goes to the Andrews and the Columbus.

1184
01:52:21,728 --> 01:52:22,729
[SPEAKER_46]: There must be one at the high school.

1185
01:52:22,749 --> 01:52:24,411
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't know anything about that one.

1186
01:52:24,851 --> 01:52:33,599
[SPEAKER_46]: So that the McGlynn doesn't have a behaviorist, that the person, the kid's IEPs, what they're asking, the adjustment counselor is doing what typically the behaviorist would be doing.

1187
01:52:34,019 --> 01:52:35,761
[SPEAKER_46]: If the behaviorist was, I was still building.

1188
01:52:36,241 --> 01:52:36,722
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so.

1189
01:52:37,465 --> 01:52:50,694
[SPEAKER_44]: In the world of BCBAs, students who typically have a BCBA service on their IEP are typically children with autism who have ABA discrete trial programming or oversight from the BCBA.

1190
01:52:51,455 --> 01:52:57,459
[SPEAKER_44]: So the populations of students who have those needs are primarily located in those buildings that you just mentioned.

1191
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:03,223
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, there are some students from different disability categories in buildings such as

1192
01:53:03,883 --> 01:53:11,728
[SPEAKER_44]: the McGlynn Elementary School, but they don't have the level of direct service that you would see on some other students' plans.

1193
01:53:11,828 --> 01:53:14,870
[SPEAKER_44]: So, I mean, I don't want to get into comparing all the children.

1194
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:16,711
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't either, but I just want to make sure.

1195
01:53:16,731 --> 01:53:22,074
[SPEAKER_44]: But I can assure you that we've looked into this, and I think I explained this to you in an email.

1196
01:53:22,354 --> 01:53:23,735
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, I have it.

1197
01:53:24,075 --> 01:53:25,196
[SPEAKER_46]: But I don't know how we can help.

1198
01:53:25,276 --> 01:53:32,460
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, it's been a few months since the person left, and I'm just wondering what can we do to attract people here better.

1199
01:53:34,342 --> 01:53:34,722
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't know.

1200
01:53:35,283 --> 01:53:38,726
[SPEAKER_44]: We put laced ads on School Spring.

1201
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:45,813
[SPEAKER_44]: We have ads on the website, and ads have gone out to the other venues that we typically put ads out to.

1202
01:53:46,253 --> 01:53:47,334
[SPEAKER_44]: We've had some bites.

1203
01:53:47,715 --> 01:53:55,883
[SPEAKER_44]: This is just a very unfortunate time of year to require a key staff person where you don't have hundreds of people applying for these jobs.

1204
01:53:56,503 --> 01:53:57,724
[SPEAKER_44]: We've had maybe six.

1205
01:53:58,845 --> 01:54:03,728
[SPEAKER_44]: We thought we had somebody who didn't work out, and we have another interview tomorrow with somebody.

1206
01:54:03,748 --> 01:54:07,790
[SPEAKER_44]: Another individual, we called him for an interview, and they just got snagged by Malden.

1207
01:54:08,211 --> 01:54:12,493
[SPEAKER_44]: So we're not the only community who's out there looking for these professionals.

1208
01:54:15,914 --> 01:54:16,054
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

1209
01:54:16,114 --> 01:54:33,764
[SPEAKER_43]: Cuneo, just for clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?

1210
01:54:33,984 --> 01:54:39,066
[SPEAKER_44]: No, they absolutely can go to the other schools as the need arises, and that's what they've been doing.

1211
01:54:39,246 --> 01:54:41,827
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so that's the clarification I needed to have.

1212
01:54:42,767 --> 01:54:44,267
[SPEAKER_43]: So we are down at the McGlynn.

1213
01:54:44,808 --> 01:54:48,949
[SPEAKER_43]: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?

1214
01:54:49,409 --> 01:54:51,250
[SPEAKER_43]: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.

1215
01:54:52,452 --> 01:55:03,317
[SPEAKER_44]: OK, so the person who was assigned to the McGlynn was assigned to the McGlynn Elementary, McGlynn Middle, some students at the high school, out of district, some out of district students, the Brooks.

1216
01:55:03,838 --> 01:55:08,720
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's all of the, it depends on what their area of expertise are.

1217
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:14,002
[SPEAKER_44]: Because some BCBAs are ABA discrete trial specialists.

1218
01:55:14,563 --> 01:55:18,805
[SPEAKER_44]: Other people might have their strength in the area of social emotional dysregulation.

1219
01:55:19,585 --> 01:55:23,207
[SPEAKER_44]: So we try to match up people with what they do best.

1220
01:55:23,988 --> 01:55:33,974
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, so then, but the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.

1221
01:55:33,994 --> 01:55:44,580
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, right now that's where there is a hole, but if the person who we hire ultimately has a different skill set, we might need to do some moving around so that we make sure that people are aware.

1222
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,440
[SPEAKER_44]: where they need to be to support the students.

1223
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:51,941
[SPEAKER_44]: Because that's the most important thing for us is supporting the students.

1224
01:55:52,441 --> 01:56:06,365
[SPEAKER_43]: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the counselors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.

1225
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:16,447
[SPEAKER_44]: If there is an evaluation, if that need arises, of course, we've covered what we need to do to cover to make sure that IEPs and our evaluation timelines have been completed.

1226
01:56:18,368 --> 01:56:19,910
[SPEAKER_44]: within regulations.

1227
01:56:22,251 --> 01:56:22,552
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1228
01:56:22,732 --> 01:56:23,092
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

1229
01:56:23,112 --> 01:56:23,472
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1230
01:56:23,653 --> 01:56:23,933
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1231
01:56:24,693 --> 01:56:25,614
[SPEAKER_42]: And we have one item.

1232
01:56:26,455 --> 01:56:26,635
[SPEAKER_42]: Ms.

1233
01:56:26,695 --> 01:56:32,840
[SPEAKER_42]: Nelson would like to explain something about our upcoming committee of the whole meeting regarding the new MCAS.

1234
01:56:38,024 --> 01:56:38,545
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening.

1235
01:56:38,565 --> 01:56:42,128
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, this is MCAS season again.

1236
01:56:42,148 --> 01:56:44,990
[SPEAKER_27]: And once again, we have a very,

1237
01:56:46,016 --> 01:56:49,218
[SPEAKER_27]: short time frame to get things ready for everyone.

1238
01:56:49,239 --> 01:56:54,522
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, this morning the results were made known to the administrators.

1239
01:56:54,903 --> 01:57:01,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, they have been working very diligently all day trying to put the figures together.

1240
01:57:01,468 --> 01:57:10,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, the department of elementary and secondary education has provided us with information related to the release, the public release.

1241
01:57:11,255 --> 01:57:14,057
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, um, we have the results today.

1242
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:28,549
[SPEAKER_27]: The public release is scheduled for Wednesday, October 18th, and again, we are planning that individual student scores will be mailed home when they're sent to the superintendent's office around October 24th.

1243
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:32,652
[SPEAKER_27]: As all of you know, in the spring of 2017,

1244
01:57:34,765 --> 01:57:40,408
[SPEAKER_27]: All students in grades three through eight were administered the Next Generation MCAS.

1245
01:57:40,929 --> 01:57:47,032
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a new version of the 20-year-old MCAS, which is now known as the Legacy MCAS.

1246
01:57:47,392 --> 01:58:02,641
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're really working with two different assessments, one which is grades three through eight, which is the new generation, and then the high school is still, and the science exams, five, eight, and the high school science, are still with the older version of MCAS.

1247
01:58:04,493 --> 01:58:15,496
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, that legacy MCAS was administered in grade 10, students in English language arts and mathematics, and all students taking the science exams.

1248
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:28,679
[SPEAKER_27]: On Thursday, October 12th, DESE held a webinar containing information related to 2017 MCAS accountability ratings and student score reporting.

1249
01:58:29,559 --> 01:58:32,380
[SPEAKER_27]: We've attached the PowerPoint from that webinar

1250
01:58:33,018 --> 01:58:41,345
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, we plan to report specifics of our scores on Wednesday evening.

1251
01:58:41,425 --> 01:58:44,688
[SPEAKER_27]: We're planning a meeting at 6.30, is it?

1252
01:58:44,908 --> 01:58:45,748
[SPEAKER_27]: 6 o'clock or 6.30?

1253
01:58:46,129 --> 01:58:45,748
6.30.

1254
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,311
[SPEAKER_27]: 6.30.

1255
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:48,311
[SPEAKER_27]: Very brief meeting.

1256
01:58:48,331 --> 01:58:51,913
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there's another meeting at the high school that most of you want to attend.

1257
01:58:54,235 --> 01:58:59,700
[SPEAKER_27]: This particular webinar and the PowerPoint speaks to a few different issues.

1258
01:59:00,284 --> 01:59:01,705
[SPEAKER_27]: one of which is accountability.

1259
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:11,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, as you all know, in years past, schools get accountability ratings and the district gets a rating, which is only as good as its lowest schools rating.

1260
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:22,184
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the next generation MCAS was a new test, the state has decided that this year we will have a very different way of reporting accountability.

1261
01:59:23,005 --> 01:59:26,588
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's not based on student scores for grades three through eight.

1262
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,741
[SPEAKER_27]: it's going to be based upon participation rates.

1263
01:59:30,401 --> 01:59:40,183
[SPEAKER_27]: So as long as you have a participation rate of 90% or better, the school remains in a level two, which we currently were last year.

1264
01:59:40,703 --> 01:59:44,843
[SPEAKER_27]: So they're not going to come out and look at student scores to reassign accountability levels.

1265
01:59:45,484 --> 01:59:52,445
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, we will have that, um, information for you, um, on Wednesday when it's publicly released.

1266
01:59:53,883 --> 01:59:55,743
[SPEAKER_27]: This will serve as the new baseline.

1267
01:59:56,443 --> 02:00:02,605
[SPEAKER_27]: So next year, the DESE is projecting that we will go back to a different kind of accountability rating.

1268
02:00:02,645 --> 02:00:05,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, what that's going to be is not yet decided on.

1269
02:00:06,345 --> 02:00:08,406
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're still waiting for details on that.

1270
02:00:09,826 --> 02:00:20,488
[SPEAKER_27]: The second area that the webinar discussed, the PowerPoint discussed, is that the new MCAS exam, again,

1271
02:00:21,103 --> 02:00:23,404
[SPEAKER_27]: For many of our students, they took it on computer.

1272
02:00:23,604 --> 02:00:28,565
[SPEAKER_27]: Some students took it on paper and pencil still, which was allowable.

1273
02:00:29,885 --> 02:00:34,146
[SPEAKER_27]: And gradually, it's all going to go to a computer-based.

1274
02:00:34,606 --> 02:00:41,408
[SPEAKER_27]: So this year, in the spring, we're going to have more grades that will be required to be tested students on the computers.

1275
02:00:41,948 --> 02:00:49,050
[SPEAKER_27]: And by 2019, all the exams, except, I think, for the science high school, will be computerized.

1276
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:50,950
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're moving more and more towards that.

1277
02:00:51,464 --> 02:00:56,226
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're preparing with our equipment and all that to make students ready for that.

1278
02:00:58,427 --> 02:01:01,128
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so we had a lot of trial runs last year.

1279
02:01:01,148 --> 02:01:05,009
[SPEAKER_27]: It went pretty well, so we're hoping to have similar results this year.

1280
02:01:06,450 --> 02:01:14,753
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the major differences that I want to call your attention to is how the scores are reported under the new exam.

1281
02:01:15,294 --> 02:01:18,195
[SPEAKER_27]: So in the PowerPoint, if you,

1282
02:01:22,183 --> 02:01:39,867
[SPEAKER_27]: turn to the section on scoring, the categories are not going to be advanced, proficient, needs improvement, or failing warning.

1283
02:01:40,427 --> 02:01:48,889
[SPEAKER_27]: We have four new categories, and so as we're getting the reports in today, the data is organized into those categories.

1284
02:01:49,855 --> 02:01:55,359
[SPEAKER_27]: We have, to replace advanced, we have exceeding expectations.

1285
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,923
[SPEAKER_27]: Proficient is now being replaced with meeting expectations.

1286
02:02:02,444 --> 02:02:08,228
[SPEAKER_27]: Needs improvement is being replaced with partially meeting expectations.

1287
02:02:09,089 --> 02:02:13,392
[SPEAKER_27]: And warning is being replaced with not meeting expectations.

1288
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:17,995
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, we're dealing with very different proficiency or different

1289
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:22,393
[SPEAKER_27]: categories of rating, so we want to pay attention to that.

1290
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:38,304
[SPEAKER_27]: And the state makes a very important point when they state that the proficient—meeting expectations, the requirements for that, the rubric for that, are more rigorous than the rubric for proficient.

1291
02:02:38,965 --> 02:02:42,387
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, it's not quite equatable, you know, equally.

1292
02:02:42,427 --> 02:02:43,408
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't say that

1293
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:53,175
[SPEAKER_27]: Proficient and meeting expectations is exactly the same, because the expectations are going to be higher for meeting expectations than they were for proficient.

1294
02:02:53,796 --> 02:02:55,697
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're getting all of the data together.

1295
02:02:55,817 --> 02:03:07,145
[SPEAKER_27]: Tomorrow we're meeting with the directors and Dr. Riccadeli and Mrs. Caldwell and myself to put things in a format for you for Wednesday evening.

1296
02:03:07,871 --> 02:03:15,774
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything is embargoed until Wednesday, and so we'll have all of that for you, as well as a preliminary report on Wednesday evening.

1297
02:03:16,354 --> 02:03:21,716
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you have any questions on the PowerPoint, the information there, I'd be more than glad to answer those for you.

1298
02:03:22,556 --> 02:03:28,078
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, there are still questions that are unanswered, that we're waiting for some clarity from the state.

1299
02:03:28,558 --> 02:03:35,360
[SPEAKER_27]: The high school still remains with the same categories, advanced, proficient, needs improvement, and failing.

1300
02:03:35,982 --> 02:03:42,426
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're still working with the older version of MCAS at the English and mathematics and science levels at the high school.

1301
02:03:43,787 --> 02:03:44,487
[SPEAKER_27]: Any questions?

1302
02:03:44,507 --> 02:03:46,428
[SPEAKER_42]: Are there any questions?

1303
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,191
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to receive this paper and place it on file.

1304
02:03:51,471 --> 02:03:52,392
[SPEAKER_42]: You have a request?

1305
02:03:55,174 --> 02:04:02,058
[SPEAKER_43]: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.

1306
02:04:02,678 --> 02:04:02,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

1307
02:04:02,858 --> 02:04:11,728
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to mention too, and I'm going to ask principals tomorrow at the very last slide, they have actually some, um, information.

1308
02:04:11,788 --> 02:04:14,110
[SPEAKER_27]: Desi's posted information for parents.

1309
02:04:14,691 --> 02:04:21,378
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll ask principals to put that on their websites because that information is specifically for parents where

1310
02:04:21,858 --> 02:04:24,861
[SPEAKER_27]: this information in the PowerPoint might be more technical.

1311
02:04:25,101 --> 02:04:30,646
[SPEAKER_27]: We can do both, but I think the, um, the resources for parents would be the bet more useful.

1312
02:04:30,666 --> 02:04:31,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1313
02:04:31,126 --> 02:04:32,768
[SPEAKER_43]: As long as we can make sure we put something.

1314
02:04:32,808 --> 02:04:42,936
[SPEAKER_43]: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.

1315
02:04:43,357 --> 02:04:46,019
[SPEAKER_43]: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.

1316
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:46,439
[SPEAKER_43]: Right.

1317
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:46,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1318
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:49,262
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the student score reports will look different.

1319
02:04:49,622 --> 02:05:04,588
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things that I'm still questioning, and I don't have an answer for it, is that they are going to give student growth percentiles, even though they really aren't using the same instruments to measure the student growth, because we've had different exams over time.

1320
02:05:04,988 --> 02:05:07,589
[SPEAKER_27]: But they say they're still going to give a growth percentile.

1321
02:05:07,989 --> 02:05:13,551
[SPEAKER_27]: How they're going to equate that, when you have apples and oranges, once again, they do this to us all the time, so we're kind of used to it.

1322
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:16,751
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll take a look at that, but parents will have that data too.

1323
02:05:17,191 --> 02:05:24,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Although I wonder how valid it is when you are using two different instruments and you're trying to equate things between two different instruments.

1324
02:05:25,555 --> 02:05:25,895
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1325
02:05:26,095 --> 02:05:26,255
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

1326
02:05:26,295 --> 02:05:26,575
[SPEAKER_41]: Krutz.

1327
02:05:27,096 --> 02:05:27,216
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi.

1328
02:05:27,636 --> 02:05:28,056
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Ms.

1329
02:05:28,096 --> 02:05:28,456
[SPEAKER_41]: Nelson.

1330
02:05:28,856 --> 02:05:29,857
[SPEAKER_41]: I just have a question.

1331
02:05:29,917 --> 02:05:36,820
[SPEAKER_41]: So if we have good participation rates and we're above 90% and we have good graduation rates,

1332
02:05:37,474 --> 02:05:45,739
[SPEAKER_41]: And if our students are in partially meeting expectations, would that affect us and put us into a different level?

1333
02:05:46,179 --> 02:05:50,581
[SPEAKER_41]: Or is it going to be strictly by participation rates and graduation rates?

1334
02:05:50,641 --> 02:05:52,402
[SPEAKER_41]: I was a little, I just didn't really know.

1335
02:05:52,602 --> 02:05:53,803
[SPEAKER_27]: It is very different.

1336
02:05:54,263 --> 02:05:57,565
[SPEAKER_27]: I think they didn't know quite know what to do with the accountability this year.

1337
02:05:57,985 --> 02:06:02,368
[SPEAKER_27]: So they came up with something that, um, you know, in their way is a compromise.

1338
02:06:02,788 --> 02:06:06,870
[SPEAKER_27]: It's our understanding that grades three through eight, it's participation.

1339
02:06:07,375 --> 02:06:11,439
[SPEAKER_27]: You have to have 90% or higher participation to stay in level two.

1340
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:15,463
[SPEAKER_27]: Now my question, which again I can't get an answer to, is how can you get in level one?

1341
02:06:15,824 --> 02:06:17,105
[SPEAKER_27]: Because they really don't explain that.

1342
02:06:17,125 --> 02:06:20,428
[SPEAKER_27]: If they're not going to use student scores, because that's what we always relied on.

1343
02:06:20,929 --> 02:06:24,673
[SPEAKER_27]: So they're not really giving us a clear response to that right yet.

1344
02:06:25,457 --> 02:06:34,525
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, it's participation rate and graduation rate is our understanding as the sole criteria for the accountability levels.

1345
02:06:34,865 --> 02:06:51,940
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the data from the student scores this year will be used as the baseline data, and next year they're going to go back to some kind of a different system, which again, still haven't made all the guidelines for that, which will probably factor in student scores, since we'll have a year of baseline data on that.

1346
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:56,683
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my understanding, subject to change by them, not us.

1347
02:06:56,703 --> 02:06:59,345
[SPEAKER_42]: You have a pretty good idea right now of participation.

1348
02:07:00,245 --> 02:07:05,289
[SPEAKER_27]: We really, yes, we really feel very confident that participation rates have been met.

1349
02:07:05,929 --> 02:07:11,213
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things that's tricky with participation, it's not just the aggregate, it's each of the subgroups.

1350
02:07:11,674 --> 02:07:19,619
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have to be careful when you have a subgroup that's very, very small, that you need more students in that smaller subgroup to participate to get that 90%.

1351
02:07:20,717 --> 02:07:27,719
[SPEAKER_27]: If you have a subgroup with 10 students, nine out of the 10 have to participate, where if you have a hundred students, it's a lot less students.

1352
02:07:27,739 --> 02:07:32,620
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have to watch those numbers very carefully, but we're pretty confident that we've met it all around.

1353
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:34,180
[SPEAKER_42]: Very good.

1354
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,540
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1355
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,240
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there a follow up?

1356
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:36,240
[SPEAKER_42]: One more.

1357
02:07:36,421 --> 02:07:36,981
[SPEAKER_43]: Apologize.

1358
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:45,263
[SPEAKER_43]: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?

1359
02:07:45,323 --> 02:07:47,263
[SPEAKER_43]: Cause I went back and forth with this.

1360
02:07:47,868 --> 02:07:50,070
[SPEAKER_27]: 10th graders, nothing really changed.

1361
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:51,111
[SPEAKER_27]: It was the old exam.

1362
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:54,653
[SPEAKER_27]: It was the legacy MCAS, which is the older exam.

1363
02:07:55,314 --> 02:07:58,877
[SPEAKER_27]: They are still going to be rated on the old levels.

1364
02:07:59,397 --> 02:08:02,059
[SPEAKER_27]: Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning.

1365
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:07,884
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll see in the reports that we're providing for you that those categories are different for the high school testing.

1366
02:08:08,604 --> 02:08:10,626
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that hasn't changed.

1367
02:08:11,345 --> 02:08:12,666
[SPEAKER_27]: in terms of that exam.

1368
02:08:13,127 --> 02:08:17,030
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, the students are pretty much taking everything on paper at the high school level.

1369
02:08:17,691 --> 02:08:26,259
[SPEAKER_27]: We're waiting for some more direction with that and when they're going to actually transition to computers and when they're going to transition to the newer version of the test.

1370
02:08:26,739 --> 02:08:30,463
[SPEAKER_27]: All things that the DESE still hasn't, I guess, decided on.

1371
02:08:31,404 --> 02:08:35,027
[SPEAKER_43]: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually put,

1372
02:08:36,328 --> 02:08:48,351
[SPEAKER_43]: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the ninth grade and then all of a sudden the tenth grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?

1373
02:08:48,371 --> 02:08:51,931
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.

1374
02:08:52,392 --> 02:08:56,672
[SPEAKER_43]: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.

1375
02:08:56,692 --> 02:08:58,613
[SPEAKER_43]: I know how they change their things overnight.

1376
02:08:59,273 --> 02:09:10,176
[SPEAKER_43]: But, I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden...

1377
02:09:10,981 --> 02:09:17,065
[SPEAKER_43]: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.

1378
02:09:17,206 --> 02:09:22,670
[SPEAKER_43]: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.

1379
02:09:23,150 --> 02:09:25,592
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1380
02:09:25,652 --> 02:09:28,654
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we have to advocate for that, because that's really high stakes.

1381
02:09:29,074 --> 02:09:33,758
[SPEAKER_27]: That depends on your diploma, and that really is, you really shouldn't be doing that to students unfairly.

1382
02:09:34,038 --> 02:09:34,838
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, and it's not fair.

1383
02:09:34,878 --> 02:09:35,939
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not fair to those students.

1384
02:09:35,959 --> 02:09:38,461
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not fair to anybody, but those students especially.

1385
02:09:41,578 --> 02:09:44,140
[SPEAKER_42]: on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1386
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:44,960
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

1387
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:45,380
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

1388
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:46,301
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

1389
02:09:46,341 --> 02:09:47,041
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

1390
02:09:47,101 --> 02:09:48,562
[SPEAKER_42]: I just want to make a general announcement.

1391
02:09:49,763 --> 02:09:57,268
[SPEAKER_42]: At 5 o'clock on Thursday, we're having a birthday party for this building, as well as dedicating several unique spaces within it.

1392
02:09:57,368 --> 02:09:58,389
[SPEAKER_42]: So come on down.

1393
02:09:58,409 --> 02:09:59,329
[SPEAKER_42]: It should be a fun night.

1394
02:09:59,709 --> 02:10:01,791
[SPEAKER_42]: Birthday cake and food.

1395
02:10:01,971 --> 02:10:02,791
[SPEAKER_42]: So come on down.

1396
02:10:03,932 --> 02:10:05,633
[SPEAKER_42]: And there's a motion to adjourn this meeting.

1397
02:10:05,653 --> 02:10:06,173
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, no, no, no.

1398
02:10:06,193 --> 02:10:07,714
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going into executive session.

1399
02:10:09,352 --> 02:10:11,753
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to go into executive session, seconded by Ms.

1400
02:10:11,813 --> 02:10:12,334
[SPEAKER_42]: DiBenedetto.

1401
02:10:12,354 --> 02:10:13,874
[SPEAKER_42]: Roll call vote, please, Mrs. Skerry.

1402
02:10:14,675 --> 02:10:14,935
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1403
02:10:19,357 --> 02:10:19,617
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1404
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:20,558
[SPEAKER_42]: Six in the affirmative.

1405
02:10:21,238 --> 02:10:21,919
[SPEAKER_42]: None in the negative.

1406
02:10:21,999 --> 02:10:22,479
[SPEAKER_42]: One absent.

1407
02:10:22,599 --> 02:10:23,199
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

1408
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:24,960
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll now enter executive session.

1409
02:10:26,181 --> 02:10:27,962
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much for participating tonight.

1410
02:25:05,414 --> 02:25:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: down.

1411
02:25:06,176 --> 02:25:10,044
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she used to write about and that is what people are angry about.

1412
02:25:10,786 --> 02:25:14,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Matthew Schwareb, Head of News at the Times of Malta newspaper.

1413
02:25:15,795 --> 02:25:24,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Six months after reports emerged of gay men being detained illegally and tortured in Chechnya, a young man has spoken publicly about his ordeal for the first time.

1414
02:25:24,702 --> 02:25:28,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Maxim Lapunov is from Siberia and was working in Chechnya.

1415
02:25:28,566 --> 02:25:31,388
[SPEAKER_18]: He's described being held, beaten and threatened by police.

1416
02:25:32,149 --> 02:25:36,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr Lapunov reported it to the authorities, but activists say nothing has been done.

1417
02:25:36,953 --> 02:25:40,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Many other men who've had similar ordeals have since fled Chechnya for their own safety.

1418
02:25:41,276 --> 02:25:43,278
[SPEAKER_18]: And Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports.

1419
02:25:43,768 --> 02:25:48,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Maxim Lapunov says he was held in a cell soaked with blood for 12 days.

1420
02:25:48,752 --> 02:25:53,397
[SPEAKER_04]: There, he was beaten with sticks across his back, legs and ribs by police.

1421
02:25:53,937 --> 02:25:56,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And every day, he says they threaten to kill him.

1422
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason?

1423
02:25:57,861 --> 02:25:58,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's gay.

1424
02:25:59,562 --> 02:26:06,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Maxim Lapunov is one of dozens of men who say they were tortured in Chechnya in what's been described as an anti-gay witch hunt.

1425
02:26:06,973 --> 02:26:13,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But he is the first to detail such abuse publicly, and crucially, the first to report it formally to the authorities here.

1426
02:26:14,523 --> 02:26:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: When such allegations first surfaced in spring, Vladimir Putin referred to them as rumours, but he ordered law enforcement agencies to investigate.

1427
02:26:23,393 --> 02:26:29,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost a month after Maxim Lapunov came forward, his lawyer says nothing concrete has been done.

1428
02:26:30,001 --> 02:26:41,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Human rights activists argue that points to a lack of control over Chechnya, whose strongman leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has called the claims nonsense because he says there are no gays in the republic.

1429
02:26:42,109 --> 02:26:53,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Maxim Lapunov has received multiple threats for suggesting otherwise, but he says he is still haunted by nightmares about what happened to him and he wants those responsible to be punished.

1430
02:26:54,076 --> 02:26:55,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Sarah Rainsford reporting.

1431
02:26:56,122 --> 02:27:01,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, it's part of modern life, but how secure is the Wi-Fi connection at your home or office?

1432
02:27:01,426 --> 02:27:04,669
[SPEAKER_18]: You might have passwords and encryption and think, oh, I'm pretty safe.

1433
02:27:05,049 --> 02:27:09,352
[SPEAKER_18]: But new research has found that networks around the world are at risk of being hacked.

1434
02:27:09,733 --> 02:27:15,317
[SPEAKER_18]: A glitch known as crack affects an authentication system that's commonly used to secure wireless connections.

1435
02:27:15,797 --> 02:27:19,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's Professor Alan Woodward, a technology expert from the University of Surrey.

1436
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:24,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whenever you first connect to a Wi-Fi router, say, from your laptop,

1437
02:27:24,855 --> 02:27:33,565
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little conversation goes on, which is where basically you agree what the secret key is going to be to encrypt the data to scramble the data.

1438
02:27:34,185 --> 02:27:40,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the researchers have found is that there's a particular step in that conversation that you can take over.

1439
02:27:41,168 --> 02:27:43,849
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can thereby hijack the conversation.

1440
02:27:44,149 --> 02:27:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to do with repeating something that should never be repeated.

1441
02:27:47,550 --> 02:27:54,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And in encryption, when you repeat something, it's actually really very bad, because it weakens it terribly and allows you to easily break it.

1442
02:27:54,993 --> 02:28:00,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that seems to affect the vast majority Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi-enabled devices.

1443
02:28:00,374 --> 02:28:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem being, it's not a particular vendor

1444
02:28:02,795 --> 02:28:03,555
[SPEAKER_02]: that's done this wrong.

1445
02:28:03,595 --> 02:28:04,676
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all done the right thing.

1446
02:28:04,696 --> 02:28:05,856
[SPEAKER_02]: They've followed the standard.

1447
02:28:05,896 --> 02:28:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the standard itself, the so-called protocol, that appears to be flawed.

1448
02:28:10,158 --> 02:28:11,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around for 15, 16 years.

1449
02:28:12,018 --> 02:28:14,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So why we haven't all spotted it before, we don't know.

1450
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:15,339
[SPEAKER_02]: But these researchers did.

1451
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that we're all vulnerable to, all our routers.

1452
02:28:19,041 --> 02:28:20,321
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a very targeted attack.

1453
02:28:20,401 --> 02:28:22,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody would have to come after you specifically.

1454
02:28:22,662 --> 02:28:25,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a massive virus or something that we're all going to be subject to.

1455
02:28:25,943 --> 02:28:27,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's if somebody wanted to get at you, they could.

1456
02:28:29,322 --> 02:28:30,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Professor Alan Woodward.

1457
02:28:30,803 --> 02:28:32,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Fiona's here now with some other stories from our news desk.

1458
02:28:33,764 --> 02:28:42,629
[SPEAKER_45]: The German car maker Daimler has now said that a potential airbag safety issue in its Mercedes-Benz cars has affected more than a million vehicles worldwide.

1459
02:28:43,129 --> 02:28:47,292
[SPEAKER_45]: The company announced the recall of certain vehicles built over the last six years.

1460
02:28:47,792 --> 02:28:53,155
[SPEAKER_45]: After it discovered in rare circumstances the driver's airbag could be inadvertently deployed.

1461
02:28:54,411 --> 02:28:59,813
[SPEAKER_45]: South Africa's parliament is today beginning an inquiry into alleged corruption at the highest levels of government.

1462
02:29:00,293 --> 02:29:06,956
[SPEAKER_45]: Whistleblowers and prominent officials are expected to be called to give evidence into what's become known as state capture.

1463
02:29:07,396 --> 02:29:10,177
[SPEAKER_45]: Our correspondent Andrew Harding reports from Johannesburg.

1464
02:29:10,657 --> 02:29:21,826
[SPEAKER_55]: Ministers, tycoons, the President's son, and many other witnesses are likely to be summoned and, if they show up, grilled by MPs investigating claims of a giant corruption conspiracy.

1465
02:29:22,447 --> 02:29:31,494
[SPEAKER_55]: It's widely alleged that a powerful business family, the Guptas, have bought influence at the highest levels of government in order to win lucrative state contracts.

1466
02:29:31,954 --> 02:29:36,078
[SPEAKER_55]: The Guptas have denied such claims, as has their friend President Jacob Zuma.

1467
02:29:36,638 --> 02:29:43,852
[SPEAKER_55]: Some South Africans see a parliamentary inquiry as a poor substitute for police investigations, arrests and trials.

1468
02:29:45,295 --> 02:29:56,341
[SPEAKER_45]: And while the old adage says red sky at night shepherds delight, people in the UK and northern parts of France reported an unusual reddish sky and red-looking sun throughout Monday.

1469
02:29:56,741 --> 02:30:02,425
[SPEAKER_45]: The phenomenon was caused by remnants of Hurricane Ophelia dragging tropical air and dust from the Sahara.

1470
02:30:02,945 --> 02:30:06,647
[SPEAKER_45]: Debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain also contributed.

1471
02:30:07,889 --> 02:30:15,277
[SPEAKER_18]: People in North Korea once risked three years hard labor for gambling, but in an abrupt change in policy, they'll now be able to bet on local horse races.

1472
02:30:15,838 --> 02:30:23,166
[SPEAKER_18]: It's being seen as a way of generating some much-needed cash for the isolated country, which is facing economic sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs.

1473
02:30:23,447 --> 02:30:24,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Alice Porter has more.

1474
02:30:24,953 --> 02:30:38,706
[SPEAKER_08]: The North Korean leader's love of horses is well known, as Kim Jong-un is reported to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on horses, and he's repeatedly been filmed riding them in videos broadcast on the country's state-run news agency.

1475
02:30:43,252 --> 02:30:51,156
[SPEAKER_08]: In the communist North, horses, especially white ones, have traditionally been a propaganda symbol associated with the ruling Kim family.

1476
02:30:51,956 --> 02:31:00,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But this weekend, it was other North Koreans who were allowed to take to the saddle at the Mirim Horse Riding Club, one of Kim Jong-un's flagship leisure developments.

1477
02:31:01,181 --> 02:31:07,845
[SPEAKER_08]: He was shown watching the race with hundreds of spectators filming it on their phones as horses and riders stormed out of the starting gate.

1478
02:31:08,725 --> 02:31:20,210
[SPEAKER_08]: But while the race is a good way of showcasing the government's power, they're also a way of earning much-needed foreign currency as the wealthy inside North Korea have to pay in US dollars or Chinese yuan.

1479
02:31:21,291 --> 02:31:28,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Na Jung-won is head of the North Korea Industry Economy Research Institute in Seoul.

1480
02:31:28,076 --> 02:31:35,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Despite the sanctions against them, the number of rich people in North Korea has increased and the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening.

1481
02:31:36,802 --> 02:31:42,106
[SPEAKER_16]: They may have reached the level where the country is capable of running a gambling business on the back of local demand.

1482
02:31:43,897 --> 02:31:48,861
[SPEAKER_08]: This horse race follows proposals made last March for new casinos near the border of China.

1483
02:31:48,881 --> 02:31:57,988
[SPEAKER_08]: The United Nations' latest round of sanctions over Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme bans any further joint venture with North Korean companies.

1484
02:31:58,549 --> 02:32:01,271
[SPEAKER_08]: But it remains to be seen whether other countries will obey.

1485
02:32:04,075 --> 02:32:05,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?

1486
02:32:06,097 --> 02:32:09,480
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an image many of us have grown up with since nursery stories.

1487
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:13,203
[SPEAKER_18]: But new research casts doubt on that negative portrayal.

1488
02:32:13,603 --> 02:32:19,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Scientists in Vienna say they've found wolves are more tolerant and better at cooperating with each other than dogs are.

1489
02:32:19,848 --> 02:32:21,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Our science reporter Helen Briggs has been looking at the findings.

1490
02:32:22,510 --> 02:32:26,033
[SPEAKER_29]: They did this test which is called the rope pulling test.

1491
02:32:26,093 --> 02:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_29]: It's used quite widely in animal research.

1492
02:32:29,256 --> 02:32:31,618
[SPEAKER_29]: What the animals have to do is work as a pair

1493
02:32:32,138 --> 02:32:38,983
[SPEAKER_29]: And if they can pull the rope at the same time, they pull food treats towards them and they can eat it.

1494
02:32:39,163 --> 02:32:44,167
[SPEAKER_29]: So they tested wolves and they tested dogs and they found that wolves were pretty good at it.

1495
02:32:44,347 --> 02:32:52,093
[SPEAKER_29]: Pairs of wolves managed to get this food reward about one in four times, but dogs were pretty terrible.

1496
02:32:52,133 --> 02:32:55,756
[SPEAKER_29]: They only managed it about once or twice in 400 attempts.

1497
02:32:57,340 --> 02:33:04,402
[SPEAKER_29]: So it seems that our image of wolves as these aloof, uncooperative animals is wrong.

1498
02:33:04,482 --> 02:33:09,363
[SPEAKER_29]: They're actually very good at cooperating and much better than domesticated dogs.

1499
02:33:10,043 --> 02:33:15,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm sure the wolves will be delighted that their image is being upgraded, as it were.

1500
02:33:15,664 --> 02:33:20,245
[SPEAKER_18]: But what practical use is this finding in terms of what it could be used for?

1501
02:33:20,597 --> 02:33:29,681
[SPEAKER_29]: is another piece in the puzzle about this hotly debated area, really, about how wolves came to become dogs, if you like.

1502
02:33:29,761 --> 02:33:36,304
[SPEAKER_29]: Wolves are the only big carnivores that have actually turned into something that we would welcome in our homes.

1503
02:33:36,704 --> 02:33:43,226
[SPEAKER_29]: What they thought happened was that dogs over this time would become naturally much more cooperative.

1504
02:33:43,246 --> 02:33:45,147
[SPEAKER_29]: They're certainly more cooperative with people.

1505
02:33:45,447 --> 02:33:49,169
[SPEAKER_29]: The idea was that they'd become more cooperative with each other.

1506
02:33:49,548 --> 02:33:53,391
[SPEAKER_29]: but that from this research doesn't appear to have happened.

1507
02:33:53,871 --> 02:33:58,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Did they compare how well the wolves performed in comparison with other animals?

1508
02:33:58,954 --> 02:34:02,697
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, they've done this sort of work on a lot of different animals, actually.

1509
02:34:02,757 --> 02:34:06,199
[SPEAKER_29]: They've done it on elephants and hyenas and all sorts of animals.

1510
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:10,542
[SPEAKER_29]: It turns out that wolves are actually quite like chimpanzees.

1511
02:34:10,582 --> 02:34:11,583
[SPEAKER_29]: They did pretty well.

1512
02:34:11,663 --> 02:34:15,606
[SPEAKER_29]: They did as well as chimpanzees do in this cooperation test.

1513
02:34:16,593 --> 02:34:17,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now you know.

1514
02:34:17,213 --> 02:34:22,236
[SPEAKER_18]: A reminder, you've been listening to The Newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1515
02:34:22,256 --> 02:34:23,076
[SPEAKER_18]: This is Ben Bland.

1516
02:34:23,116 --> 02:34:25,818
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been broadcasting to you from London, wherever you are in the world.

1517
02:34:26,258 --> 02:34:26,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for listening.

1518
02:34:28,899 --> 02:34:30,680
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the BBC World Service.

1519
02:34:30,961 --> 02:34:33,422
[SPEAKER_33]: Now take a moment to listen to this.

1520
02:34:34,085 --> 02:34:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: What intrigues us?

1521
02:34:35,586 --> 02:34:41,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Dogs have a really unique, special ability to read and understand us.

1522
02:34:41,591 --> 02:34:43,092
[SPEAKER_06]: What alters our view?

1523
02:34:43,292 --> 02:34:45,814
[SPEAKER_43]: Every time we look around, we just say, it's a homeless people.

1524
02:34:45,974 --> 02:34:48,876
[SPEAKER_43]: But they have names, they have dreams and paths and everything.

1525
02:34:48,996 --> 02:34:50,778
[SPEAKER_24]: There are stories that make us wonder.

1526
02:34:51,058 --> 02:34:54,880
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about having an intimate, not just a sexual, relationship with the robot.

1527
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's hard because it's a one-way relationship.

1528
02:34:58,022 --> 02:34:59,583
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine can't love you back.

1529
02:34:59,863 --> 02:35:02,825
[SPEAKER_24]: And ones that defy all belief.

1530
02:35:02,845 --> 02:35:10,190
[SPEAKER_56]: I found members of different communities, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, stabbed, lying on the street.

1531
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:14,913
[SPEAKER_24]: The more we know about the world, the more we understand about ourselves.

1532
02:35:15,373 --> 02:35:18,418
[SPEAKER_50]: Many of us didn't really think bisexuality existed.

1533
02:35:30,915 --> 02:35:33,255
[SPEAKER_37]: Inhaling and exhaling, everyone does it.

1534
02:35:33,656 --> 02:35:35,116
[SPEAKER_37]: No breath means death.

1535
02:35:35,736 --> 02:35:40,377
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm Lucy Ash and on this week's Why Factor, why do people hold their breath?

1536
02:35:40,977 --> 02:35:46,598
[SPEAKER_37]: Free divers train themselves to swim underwater for ages with no equipment on a single gulp of air.

1537
02:35:47,138 --> 02:35:49,159
[SPEAKER_37]: Some say it's a good way to manage stress.

1538
02:35:49,619 --> 02:35:53,139
[SPEAKER_37]: But what happens when small children unconsciously hold their breath?

1539
02:35:53,639 --> 02:35:56,340
[SPEAKER_37]: That's on the BBC World Service after the news.

1540
02:35:59,128 --> 02:36:00,849
[SPEAKER_45]: BBC News with Fiona MacDonald.

1541
02:36:01,230 --> 02:36:09,737
[SPEAKER_45]: The US State Department has called for calm after Iraqi government forces seized the northern city of Kirkuk and nearby oilfields from Kurdish control.

1542
02:36:10,257 --> 02:36:21,666
[SPEAKER_45]: The State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said there was still much work to be done to defeat the Islamic State group and tensions between Iraqi and Kurdish forces distracted from what she called a vital mission.

1543
02:36:23,012 --> 02:36:33,639
[SPEAKER_45]: US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces say the former Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa is now under its control, with only a few dozen militants remaining near the national hospital and stadium.

1544
02:36:34,259 --> 02:36:42,465
[SPEAKER_45]: Fighting is reported to have stopped, and the SDF says its forces have retaken Naim Square, where IS once held public executions.

1545
02:36:43,752 --> 02:36:50,175
[SPEAKER_45]: More than a thousand people have taken part in a vigil in Malta for a journalist murdered on Monday by a powerful car bomb.

1546
02:36:50,655 --> 02:36:54,177
[SPEAKER_45]: Daphne Caruana Galizia was a leading investigative journalist.

1547
02:36:54,557 --> 02:36:57,759
[SPEAKER_45]: She highlighted alleged corruption by senior politicians.

1548
02:36:59,116 --> 02:37:06,561
[SPEAKER_45]: There have been protests in Barcelona over the Spanish High Court decision to remand in custody two pro-independence Catalan leaders.

1549
02:37:07,141 --> 02:37:20,710
[SPEAKER_45]: People banged pots and pans in the streets and honked car horns after Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cujart became the first senior Catalonian separatist figures to be jailed, pending an investigation for possible sedition.

1550
02:37:22,092 --> 02:37:25,795
[SPEAKER_45]: Wildfires in Portugal are now known to have killed at least 36 people.

1551
02:37:26,295 --> 02:37:34,842
[SPEAKER_45]: Thousands of firefighters are tackling outbreaks in central and northern areas, where more than 600 separate forest fires have been reported since Sunday.

1552
02:37:35,402 --> 02:37:38,865
[SPEAKER_45]: Fires have also been causing widespread damage in north-western Spain.

1553
02:37:39,986 --> 02:37:48,613
[SPEAKER_45]: And the Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier has entered into a partnership agreement with the European company Airbus to sell its C-series jet.

1554
02:37:49,013 --> 02:37:53,697
[SPEAKER_45]: Bombardier has been under pressure from a trade dispute with its American rival Boeing.

1555
02:37:55,458 --> 02:37:56,319
[SPEAKER_45]: BBC News.

1556
02:38:03,324 --> 02:38:03,965
[SPEAKER_50]: So I exhale.

1557
02:38:08,819 --> 02:38:11,481
[SPEAKER_50]: Almost a full exhale and then I inhale with my nose.

1558
02:38:22,588 --> 02:38:25,189
[SPEAKER_50]: Then I use the throat and the clavicular bones.

1559
02:38:27,411 --> 02:38:29,372
[SPEAKER_50]: And now I'm all full and then I pack with my tongue.

1560
02:38:47,121 --> 02:38:51,902
[SPEAKER_50]: Hi, I'm Stig Severinsen, and in 2012, I held my breath for 22 minutes.

1561
02:38:55,224 --> 02:38:55,704
[SPEAKER_37]: Breathing.

1562
02:38:56,804 --> 02:38:58,485
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a vital life force.

1563
02:39:00,045 --> 02:39:01,766
[SPEAKER_37]: We do it or we die.

1564
02:39:03,266 --> 02:39:04,867
[SPEAKER_37]: It's our most natural reflex.

1565
02:39:05,985 --> 02:39:07,907
[SPEAKER_37]: We take about 16 breaths a minute.

1566
02:39:08,387 --> 02:39:10,690
[SPEAKER_37]: That's around 23,000 a day.

1567
02:39:11,210 --> 02:39:13,753
[SPEAKER_37]: So why would anyone consciously restrict it?

1568
02:39:14,313 --> 02:39:17,276
[SPEAKER_37]: And what happens to our minds and bodies when we do?

1569
02:39:18,337 --> 02:39:20,179
[SPEAKER_37]: This is the BBC World Service.

1570
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:21,641
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm Lucy Ash.

1571
02:39:22,041 --> 02:39:26,666
[SPEAKER_37]: And on this edition of The Why Factor, why do people hold their breath?

1572
02:39:32,056 --> 02:39:37,500
[SPEAKER_37]: Stig Severinsen is tall and muscular, with a clean-shaven head and piercing blue eyes.

1573
02:39:38,161 --> 02:39:45,327
[SPEAKER_37]: A Danish marine biologist in his early 40s, he's been called the human dolphin and the man who doesn't breathe.

1574
02:39:50,657 --> 02:40:00,379
[SPEAKER_37]: Here, he's just sawed a hole in a frozen lake in Greenland before plunging into the icy depths, wearing nothing more than his skimpy swimming trunks.

1575
02:40:01,019 --> 02:40:08,581
[SPEAKER_37]: He holds the record for the longest free dive under ice, 72 meters or 236 feet.

1576
02:40:09,922 --> 02:40:12,442
[SPEAKER_37]: But how does he survive so long without air?

1577
02:40:13,022 --> 02:40:17,403
[SPEAKER_37]: Rule number one, don't think about time, he tells me, or the end result.

1578
02:40:17,883 --> 02:40:19,924
[SPEAKER_37]: Otherwise, your ego gets in the way.

1579
02:40:22,517 --> 02:40:25,882
[SPEAKER_50]: It's very important to understand that you have to change the frequency in the brain.

1580
02:40:27,384 --> 02:40:31,129
[SPEAKER_50]: You also learn to change into what I call your inner dolphin.

1581
02:40:31,149 --> 02:40:34,735
[SPEAKER_50]: You know, you tap into this mammalian dive response and it's a beautiful reflex.

1582
02:40:35,969 --> 02:40:37,870
[SPEAKER_37]: The mammalian diving reflex.

1583
02:40:38,471 --> 02:40:44,394
[SPEAKER_37]: That's when blood is diverted from the limbs to the vital organs, the heart, brain and lungs.

1584
02:40:45,235 --> 02:40:50,778
[SPEAKER_37]: In the world of mammals, it allows seals and other warm-blooded aquatic animals to conserve oxygen.

1585
02:40:51,719 --> 02:40:58,643
[SPEAKER_37]: For the first six months of life, humans do this too, which is why small babies find swimming so easy.

1586
02:40:59,463 --> 02:41:03,826
[SPEAKER_37]: When their heads are submerged in water, they naturally hold their breath.

1587
02:41:04,923 --> 02:41:14,636
[SPEAKER_50]: You change your brain frequency from beta, from everyday life thinking, boring, analytical, skeptical thinking, into beautiful alpha state of playfulness.

1588
02:41:14,796 --> 02:41:17,941
[SPEAKER_50]: And that's where everything's become soft and it becomes engaging.

1589
02:41:18,041 --> 02:41:20,925
[SPEAKER_50]: It becomes meaningful and time dissolves.

1590
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:23,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Toby Hillman.

1591
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:26,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a chest consultant at University College London Hospital.

1592
02:41:27,162 --> 02:41:34,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time you take a breath in, you're lowering the pressure inside your chest by using your inspiratory muscles, the main one being the diaphragm.

1593
02:41:34,865 --> 02:41:37,846
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that draws air in, which is oxygen rich.

1594
02:41:38,206 --> 02:41:44,368
[SPEAKER_14]: And then through processes at a cellular level, there's an exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

1595
02:41:44,768 --> 02:41:53,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as you breathe out, that carbon dioxide is taken away, and that's the exhaust gas from what we call aerobic respiration, which is the process by which our cells get their energy.

1596
02:41:54,765 --> 02:41:58,268
[SPEAKER_38]: Somebody told me that if you stretched your lungs out they could cover a tennis court.

1597
02:41:58,348 --> 02:41:58,929
[SPEAKER_38]: Is that right?

1598
02:41:59,069 --> 02:42:00,450
[SPEAKER_38]: Or is that just an urban myth?

1599
02:42:00,671 --> 02:42:01,812
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, that's very true.

1600
02:42:02,332 --> 02:42:11,020
[SPEAKER_14]: The area of the lungs is huge because the way that oxygen gets into the bloodstream is through diffusion and that has to happen over a very short distance.

1601
02:42:11,661 --> 02:42:17,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So the distance between the air that you breathe in and your blood vessels is around 1 250th of the width of a human hair.

1602
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:36,644
[SPEAKER_37]: Like Stig, as a child, I loved picking up bottle tops from the bottom of the local swimming pool, but I could never collect that many before popping back up for air.

1603
02:42:39,708 --> 02:42:42,573
[SPEAKER_37]: So can I train myself to hold my breath for longer?

1604
02:42:44,222 --> 02:42:52,045
[SPEAKER_37]: I've gone in search of my own inner dolphin in a small pool in London with Liv Phillips from the British Free Diving Association.

1605
02:42:52,745 --> 02:42:56,947
[SPEAKER_37]: She's the reigning UK free diving champion for the 10th time.

1606
02:42:56,967 --> 02:43:00,869
[SPEAKER_37]: Big breath.

1607
02:43:02,889 --> 02:43:07,992
[SPEAKER_48]: When you're at the top of your breath, hold, put your face in the water and relax.

1608
02:43:09,092 --> 02:43:11,493
[SPEAKER_48]: Get used to having the water all around your face.

1609
02:43:12,695 --> 02:43:13,556
[SPEAKER_48]: Relax your body.

1610
02:43:14,156 --> 02:43:14,376
[SPEAKER_48]: Good.

1611
02:43:14,516 --> 02:43:15,617
[SPEAKER_48]: Let your head fall.

1612
02:43:16,538 --> 02:43:18,139
[SPEAKER_37]: Liv has a soothing voice.

1613
02:43:18,859 --> 02:43:23,523
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm trying to stay calm and zen-like and be at one with the water.

1614
02:43:24,383 --> 02:43:26,085
[SPEAKER_48]: You can come up any time you like.

1615
02:43:27,305 --> 02:43:31,829
[SPEAKER_37]: I fight the urge to emerge, but I just can't take it much longer.

1616
02:43:31,849 --> 02:43:33,690
[SPEAKER_47]: There you go.

1617
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:34,590
[SPEAKER_47]: Feet underneath you.

1618
02:43:34,691 --> 02:43:35,031
[SPEAKER_47]: Good.

1619
02:43:35,831 --> 02:43:36,512
[SPEAKER_47]: Deep breath in.

1620
02:43:36,592 --> 02:43:38,173
[SPEAKER_47]: Big breath in before you speak.

1621
02:43:39,094 --> 02:43:40,094
[SPEAKER_47]: Good, good.

1622
02:43:40,435 --> 02:43:40,835
[SPEAKER_47]: And again.

1623
02:43:43,455 --> 02:43:46,537
[SPEAKER_47]: That's it, lots of colour.

1624
02:43:47,098 --> 02:43:54,665
[SPEAKER_37]: Once I got my breath back to normal, Liv confessed she'd forgotten to time me, so I realised I'd have to try that all over again.

1625
02:43:55,961 --> 02:43:59,003
[SPEAKER_37]: Some dive for fun, some out of necessity.

1626
02:43:59,503 --> 02:44:02,544
[SPEAKER_37]: Kim Ok-ja is from Jeju Island in South Korea.

1627
02:44:03,205 --> 02:44:07,647
[SPEAKER_37]: She's one of the traditional women divers, or haenyeo, meaning sea women.

1628
02:44:08,467 --> 02:44:13,970
[SPEAKER_37]: On a single breath, she dives to depths of up to 15 meters in search of seafood.

1629
02:44:21,116 --> 02:44:26,237
[SPEAKER_07]: When I started diving at 15, it was for stuff we could sell in the market.

1630
02:44:27,117 --> 02:44:30,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Octopus, sea snails, abalone.

1631
02:44:30,818 --> 02:44:33,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We even used spears to catch fish underwater.

1632
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:39,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the age of 17, I was good enough to make quite a bit of money.

1633
02:44:41,157 --> 02:44:50,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, when I was 33, my husband died, and I had the burden of raising our four children on my own.

1634
02:44:52,584 --> 02:45:00,248
[SPEAKER_37]: Free diving in Korea goes back to the 6th century, but for the past 300 years, it's mainly been done by women.

1635
02:45:00,929 --> 02:45:11,415
[SPEAKER_37]: Intrepid wives and mothers like Kim Ok-ja have long been their family's main breadwinners, harvesting the lucrative seabed while their menfolk farm the land above.

1636
02:45:13,403 --> 02:45:23,389
[SPEAKER_49]: Back then, when I had my first daughter, we were really not well off.

1637
02:45:24,370 --> 02:45:30,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just five days after giving birth, I volunteered to go out to sea.

1638
02:45:31,815 --> 02:45:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And I left my newborn baby with her grandfather.

1639
02:45:36,833 --> 02:45:43,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And I dived to the sea bottom to collect seaweed, the type that's worth quite a bit of money.

1640
02:45:45,017 --> 02:45:47,739
[SPEAKER_07]: But that dive took its toll on me.

1641
02:45:49,399 --> 02:45:50,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I was sick.

1642
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:54,122
[SPEAKER_07]: My body and face became really bloated.

1643
02:45:57,123 --> 02:46:03,387
[SPEAKER_50]: The first rule of any diving, whether it's freediving or scuba diving or swimming in general, never dive alone.

1644
02:46:04,587 --> 02:46:06,168
[SPEAKER_50]: I lost my best friend and it was a

1645
02:46:06,573 --> 02:46:08,474
[SPEAKER_50]: Horrible loss, obviously.

1646
02:46:09,215 --> 02:46:10,936
[SPEAKER_50]: He just made that one mistake one day.

1647
02:46:11,036 --> 02:46:13,497
[SPEAKER_50]: He went freediving alone and he never came back.

1648
02:46:16,178 --> 02:46:17,879
[SPEAKER_50]: A blackout is not a horrible experience.

1649
02:46:17,899 --> 02:46:19,260
[SPEAKER_50]: You don't know that you're blacking out.

1650
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:19,961
[SPEAKER_50]: That's the danger.

1651
02:46:20,081 --> 02:46:22,182
[SPEAKER_50]: It's like pulling the plug from a computer.

1652
02:46:24,603 --> 02:46:30,947
[SPEAKER_37]: In the past decade alone, at least 40 sea women from Jeju Island have died on the job.

1653
02:46:36,009 --> 02:46:44,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had to go to hospital myself, but there was a lady in my village who died a couple of months ago while out diving.

1654
02:46:46,094 --> 02:46:48,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes things can go wrong.

1655
02:46:48,976 --> 02:46:54,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe your tools get stuck, or you might get snagged on something.

1656
02:46:54,760 --> 02:47:00,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you miscalculate and stay under too long, it can be fatal.

1657
02:47:02,767 --> 02:47:06,608
[SPEAKER_37]: So far, we've been talking about people who consciously hold their breath.

1658
02:47:07,248 --> 02:47:11,749
[SPEAKER_37]: But some do it involuntarily, says lung specialist Toby Hillman.

1659
02:47:12,329 --> 02:47:17,570
[SPEAKER_14]: When people are asleep, the muscles of the neck and soft palate are actually a bit floppier, so they have less tone.

1660
02:47:18,190 --> 02:47:20,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can get obstructions to the airways.

1661
02:47:20,570 --> 02:47:25,951
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not necessarily breathing control, but it's more of a mechanical stoppage of air moving.

1662
02:47:26,171 --> 02:47:28,651
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something which is called obstructive sleep apnea.

1663
02:47:28,891 --> 02:47:32,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we see is that people have their sleep significantly disturbed.

1664
02:47:32,633 --> 02:47:37,339
[SPEAKER_14]: It can be really quite dramatic, sort of having 60, 70 breath holds per hour.

1665
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:41,145
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes those breath holds can be really very long, so 45, 60 seconds.

1666
02:47:49,390 --> 02:47:55,255
[SPEAKER_37]: If some adults stop breathing in their sleep, some young children stop breathing when they're fully awake.

1667
02:47:55,955 --> 02:48:02,421
[SPEAKER_37]: Usually these spells don't last long, but that doesn't make it any easier for parents like Samantha Vanderpal.

1668
02:48:04,162 --> 02:48:06,244
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter had been suffering with a virus.

1669
02:48:06,564 --> 02:48:11,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It was around about November time and she was around about 10 months old.

1670
02:48:13,930 --> 02:48:17,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I was getting into bed and I heard a noise on the video monitor

1671
02:48:18,597 --> 02:48:20,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It just didn't sound right to me.

1672
02:48:22,420 --> 02:48:30,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Something told me to go up to her bedroom, and as I did, she was gurgling and thrashing about, and she just didn't look like my daughter.

1673
02:48:30,406 --> 02:48:33,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like a completely different child in that cot.

1674
02:48:34,068 --> 02:48:37,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I scooped her up and ran down the stairs to my husband.

1675
02:48:37,751 --> 02:48:40,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she went limp and stopped breathing.

1676
02:48:41,554 --> 02:48:47,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Her eyes rolled back, and she just went from blue to ashen, and I just screamed at my husband,

1677
02:48:47,538 --> 02:48:49,840
[SPEAKER_05]: call an ambulance, she's died, she's died.

1678
02:48:52,422 --> 02:48:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Within about a minute, she had come round.

1679
02:48:56,344 --> 02:49:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a mess, my husband was a mess, and she went off to hospital for some tests, all of which came back absolutely fine, and for maybe two days, three days, she was absolutely fine, and then we encountered it again.

1680
02:49:09,707 --> 02:49:12,808
[SPEAKER_37]: Such fits can happen when a small child has a temperature.

1681
02:49:13,068 --> 02:49:15,829
[SPEAKER_37]: That often provokes these breath-holding spells.

1682
02:49:16,289 --> 02:49:18,789
[SPEAKER_37]: But Samantha's daughter has a number of triggers.

1683
02:49:19,469 --> 02:49:21,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it's down to emotional stress.

1684
02:49:21,490 --> 02:49:27,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So if she has a tantrum, sometimes she just won't take that breath and she'll go blue and boom, there goes one.

1685
02:49:27,911 --> 02:49:31,372
[SPEAKER_37]: So in total, Samantha, how many of these episodes have you had?

1686
02:49:32,032 --> 02:49:32,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Over 200.

1687
02:49:33,393 --> 02:49:33,733
[SPEAKER_38]: Really?

1688
02:49:34,213 --> 02:49:36,273
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having up to eight in a day.

1689
02:49:37,634 --> 02:49:38,254
[SPEAKER_38]: And what do you do?

1690
02:49:39,786 --> 02:49:56,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that goes against how it feels to be a mother, I have to leave her on the floor and monitor her breathing, lift her legs up, count, because if it goes beyond 10 seconds, then I have to call an ambulance if she hasn't taken a breath in that time, when all I want to do is cuddle her and soothe her.

1691
02:49:56,932 --> 02:49:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: But realistically, that is actually the worst thing I can do.

1692
02:49:59,233 --> 02:50:00,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It will prolong the episode.

1693
02:50:07,897 --> 02:50:11,099
[SPEAKER_38]: You must be in a terrible state of panic.

1694
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:11,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1695
02:50:12,460 --> 02:50:21,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I'm trying my hardest to keep calm because if my daughter wakes from a seizure and sees that I am distressed, it will put her into another one.

1696
02:50:22,408 --> 02:50:27,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a case of keeping everybody calm, which is especially difficult if it happens in public.

1697
02:50:27,992 --> 02:50:28,692
[SPEAKER_37]: And has that happened?

1698
02:50:28,912 --> 02:50:29,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1699
02:50:30,173 --> 02:50:35,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It was shortly after we saw the neurologist and my daughter had a seizure in a supermarket trolley.

1700
02:50:35,747 --> 02:50:42,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked if I could video episodes for the neurologist so they can see exactly what's occurring at that time.

1701
02:50:43,733 --> 02:50:47,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And the looks I got from other people who must have thought I was crazy.

1702
02:50:47,416 --> 02:50:53,680
[SPEAKER_05]: There is my daughter blue and limp in a trolley with me making no attempt to soothe her, but standing there videoing her.

1703
02:50:54,081 --> 02:51:01,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember after the seizure, scooping her up, going outside, sitting in my car and just sobbing because I felt like the worst mother in the world.

1704
02:51:03,668 --> 02:51:11,829
[SPEAKER_49]: Hanpun, dupun, bohing, geumjeon, jeongdeonim sulgaburo da deureoganda.

1705
02:51:13,297 --> 02:51:22,161
[SPEAKER_37]: The haenyeo divers of Jeju Island sing mournfully about how their men are drinking, while the women do the heavy lifting underwater.

1706
02:51:27,263 --> 02:51:32,605
[SPEAKER_37]: These real-life mermaids have a tough existence, and they seem to be a dying breed.

1707
02:51:33,245 --> 02:51:34,426
[SPEAKER_37]: In the 1960s, there were around 26,000 haenyeo.

1708
02:51:34,446 --> 02:51:35,086
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, fewer than 5,000 are left.

1709
02:51:40,488 --> 02:51:46,870
[SPEAKER_37]: Last year, UNESCO officially recognized the women as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

1710
02:51:47,771 --> 02:51:50,852
[SPEAKER_37]: Many, like Kim Ok-ja, are already grandmothers.

1711
02:51:51,572 --> 02:52:01,316
[SPEAKER_37]: Younger women on Jeju Island would rather work in offices or hotels than don a wetsuit and hold their breath in the icy Korean straits.

1712
02:52:01,956 --> 02:52:05,878
[SPEAKER_49]: I always take painkillers when I go into the water.

1713
02:52:06,818 --> 02:52:13,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Divers like me often take painkillers because there are a lot of stresses on the body.

1714
02:52:14,387 --> 02:52:22,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm having to increase the doses because I've taken this medicine for so long, it's becoming less and less effective.

1715
02:52:23,568 --> 02:52:26,990
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, next year I'll be 80.

1716
02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going strong.

1717
02:52:29,952 --> 02:52:38,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though I've not completely recovered after my first child, I still feel diving hasn't affected me too badly.

1718
02:52:39,717 --> 02:52:43,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my granddaughters now wants to learn to dive like me.

1719
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:51,265
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been to a special dive school on Jeju where they teach the new generation of women.

1720
02:52:51,965 --> 02:52:54,727
[SPEAKER_07]: She's carrying on the family trade.

1721
02:52:55,267 --> 02:52:58,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you proud that your granddaughter's decided to pick it up?

1722
02:53:02,904 --> 02:53:05,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was her decision.

1723
02:53:06,147 --> 02:53:16,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And while I'm very proud of her for making it, there is a part of me that feels worried about her safety, because I know how tough it is.

1724
02:53:17,901 --> 02:53:20,043
[SPEAKER_07]: But she said, I'm strong.

1725
02:53:20,463 --> 02:53:21,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do it.

1726
02:53:22,611 --> 02:53:31,256
[SPEAKER_37]: Breath holding may carry risks, but it's also a powerful force for good, according to former world record holder Stig Severinsen.

1727
02:53:31,956 --> 02:53:42,723
[SPEAKER_50]: When you do breath holding, you're actually stressing yourself and you are actually provoking that stress response, you know, because you're kind of moving closer to death, you know, when you're holding your breath for two, three, four minutes.

1728
02:53:43,203 --> 02:53:44,824
[SPEAKER_50]: But then when you learn to control that stress,

1729
02:53:45,857 --> 02:53:50,781
[SPEAKER_50]: It gives you a tool that you know you can use and you don't have to go to the gym, you don't have to call your mom or your doctor.

1730
02:53:51,161 --> 02:53:55,425
[SPEAKER_50]: You know that with your breathing, you can resort to that 24-7 and it's reliable.

1731
02:53:56,145 --> 02:53:59,929
[SPEAKER_37]: Stig's record breath hold of 22 minutes has since been broken.

1732
02:54:00,429 --> 02:54:04,933
[SPEAKER_37]: It's now over 24 minutes, longer than this radio program.

1733
02:54:05,113 --> 02:54:06,014
[SPEAKER_37]: Just imagine that.

1734
02:54:06,034 --> 02:54:09,596
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, well done.

1735
02:54:10,357 --> 02:54:10,757
[SPEAKER_47]: Go, go.

1736
02:54:10,817 --> 02:54:11,138
[SPEAKER_47]: Signal.

1737
02:54:13,643 --> 02:54:14,083
[SPEAKER_47]: Well done.

1738
02:54:14,103 --> 02:54:16,144
[SPEAKER_47]: Well, that was the best time you did it yet.

1739
02:54:16,164 --> 02:54:16,924
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you want to know how long?

1740
02:54:17,344 --> 02:54:18,044
[SPEAKER_47]: How long was that?

1741
02:54:18,184 --> 02:54:22,405
[SPEAKER_47]: OK, it was 1 minute 59, so we can put a two by the time I stopped it.

1742
02:54:22,565 --> 02:54:23,725
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, it's nearly two minutes!

1743
02:54:24,506 --> 02:54:25,246
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, no!

1744
02:54:25,406 --> 02:54:28,026
[SPEAKER_47]: I could have just hung on for one more second.

1745
02:54:28,947 --> 02:54:30,467
[SPEAKER_47]: I could have done two minutes.

1746
02:54:30,567 --> 02:54:33,888
[SPEAKER_37]: I was trying to remember.

1747
02:54:33,908 --> 02:54:36,629
[SPEAKER_37]: 1.59, just one measly second short of two minutes.

1748
02:54:37,449 --> 02:54:39,589
[SPEAKER_37]: Not bad for a first-timer, I'm told.

1749
02:54:40,149 --> 02:54:42,070
[SPEAKER_37]: Stig's been doing this his whole life.

1750
02:54:43,053 --> 02:54:46,094
[SPEAKER_37]: Actually, I found the discipline curiously invigorating.

1751
02:54:46,694 --> 02:54:50,316
[SPEAKER_37]: When breath-holding is involuntary, though, it can be frightening.

1752
02:54:51,076 --> 02:54:55,258
[SPEAKER_37]: It feels a bit like staring over the abyss towards the end of life.

1753
02:55:00,590 --> 02:55:05,392
[SPEAKER_37]: You've been listening to The Y Factor on the BBC World Service with me, Lucy Ash.

1754
02:55:05,832 --> 02:55:07,532
[SPEAKER_37]: The producer is Ben Crichton.

1755
02:55:08,092 --> 02:55:14,975
[SPEAKER_37]: If you liked this, you might want to listen to episodes on other bodily topics, such as the kiss or six packs.

1756
02:55:15,575 --> 02:55:18,296
[SPEAKER_37]: And we'd love to hear your ideas for future topics.

1757
02:55:18,716 --> 02:55:21,897
[SPEAKER_37]: You can reach us at yfactor at bbc.com.

1758
02:55:28,954 --> 02:55:32,277
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello and welcome to More or Less on the BBC World Service.

1759
02:55:32,497 --> 02:55:41,484
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm Charlotte MacDonald and this week we're talking about the latest recipient of this year's Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics, Richard Thaler.

1760
02:55:42,324 --> 02:55:47,769
[SPEAKER_35]: He's Professor of Behavioural Science and Economics at the Chicago Booth School of Business in the US.

1761
02:55:48,809 --> 02:55:52,132
[SPEAKER_35]: Now all we need is an economist who could tell us more about him.

1762
02:55:54,598 --> 02:55:57,342
[SPEAKER_52]: Uh, Charlotte, um, I'm an economist.

1763
02:55:57,863 --> 02:55:59,586
[SPEAKER_35]: Aha, Tim Harford.

1764
02:56:00,147 --> 02:56:01,590
[SPEAKER_35]: Really, you care about undercover?

1765
02:56:02,784 --> 02:56:05,527
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you know about Thaler?

1766
02:56:05,767 --> 02:56:06,868
[SPEAKER_52]: I do know about Thaler.

1767
02:56:06,908 --> 02:56:10,211
[SPEAKER_52]: I've interviewed him, I've met him, I've read his books, I've written about him.

1768
02:56:10,231 --> 02:56:12,113
[SPEAKER_52]: Alright, well that's good enough for us.

1769
02:56:12,374 --> 02:56:14,155
[SPEAKER_52]: So, well, tell us, who is he?

1770
02:56:14,255 --> 02:56:15,096
[SPEAKER_52]: Who is this person?

1771
02:56:15,376 --> 02:56:23,044
[SPEAKER_52]: He's a professor at the University of Chicago and he is, I suppose, the leading behavioural economist in the world.

1772
02:56:23,164 --> 02:56:24,966
[SPEAKER_52]: And behavioural economics is this

1773
02:56:26,187 --> 02:56:31,470
[SPEAKER_52]: It's really an attempt to introduce a sort of psychological realism into economics.

1774
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:37,353
[SPEAKER_52]: Classical economics has these quite formal, perhaps unrealistic assumptions about how humans behave.

1775
02:56:37,553 --> 02:56:44,777
[SPEAKER_52]: And the behavioral economists say, well, we could add psychology, or maybe just add a bit of common sense, and that would make economics work better.

1776
02:56:45,057 --> 02:56:45,978
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you give us an example?

1777
02:56:46,058 --> 02:56:47,879
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, what is behavioral economics?

1778
02:56:48,299 --> 02:56:51,684
[SPEAKER_52]: Sure, so one of Thaler's favourite examples is the bowl of cashews.

1779
02:56:52,085 --> 02:57:03,741
[SPEAKER_52]: So he describes having guests over for dinner and while the main course is cooking in the oven they're having drinks and as you do he puts a large bowl of cashew nuts in front of his guests.

1780
02:57:04,462 --> 02:57:07,665
[SPEAKER_52]: And they're sitting around having their drinks and they're hoovering up the cashews.

1781
02:57:07,705 --> 02:57:09,826
[SPEAKER_52]: They're just getting through them at a real rate of knots.

1782
02:57:10,487 --> 02:57:13,429
[SPEAKER_52]: And after a while, Thaler realizes they're going to spoil their appetite.

1783
02:57:14,069 --> 02:57:17,532
[SPEAKER_52]: So he removes the bowl of cashews, takes it off to the kitchen where they can't touch it.

1784
02:57:18,052 --> 02:57:20,574
[SPEAKER_52]: Now, they're grateful that he's done that.

1785
02:57:20,634 --> 02:57:22,576
[SPEAKER_52]: They're happy that he's removed the temptation.

1786
02:57:22,816 --> 02:57:23,617
[SPEAKER_52]: Now, Thaler's point is,

1787
02:57:24,217 --> 02:57:27,198
[SPEAKER_52]: This doesn't make any sense in the framework of classical economics.

1788
02:57:27,718 --> 02:57:31,439
[SPEAKER_52]: Because in classical economics, if you don't want to eat the cashew nuts, you just don't eat the cashew nuts.

1789
02:57:31,899 --> 02:57:34,760
[SPEAKER_52]: And if you do want to eat the cashew nuts, you won't be happy that they've been taken away.

1790
02:57:34,980 --> 02:57:40,882
[SPEAKER_52]: There's no way of saying, well, it makes sense to remove the cashew nuts and put them in the kitchen.

1791
02:57:41,162 --> 02:57:44,303
[SPEAKER_52]: But of course, common sense says, well, yeah, of course, I totally understand that.

1792
02:57:44,603 --> 02:57:45,664
[SPEAKER_52]: Now, Thaler's insight.

1793
02:57:46,504 --> 02:57:48,685
[SPEAKER_52]: is not something magical about the cashew nuts.

1794
02:57:48,985 --> 02:57:55,307
[SPEAKER_52]: Thaler's insight is, these seemingly trivial examples about human nature, they might turn out to be really important.

1795
02:57:55,787 --> 02:57:59,068
[SPEAKER_52]: They might help us understand, for example, how financial markets work.

1796
02:57:59,648 --> 02:58:05,090
[SPEAKER_52]: Or the example that Thaler is most famous for, they might help us make better pension policy.

1797
02:58:05,390 --> 02:58:13,053
[SPEAKER_52]: Because we're always wanting to save for a pension, but then when push comes to shove, we're tempted to do something short-termist and not save.

1798
02:58:13,673 --> 02:58:20,216
[SPEAKER_52]: So it's these trivial, common-sense, everyday examples made economically significant and economically relevant.

1799
02:58:20,776 --> 02:58:24,958
[SPEAKER_35]: You've described what he was spotting, something that humans do.

1800
02:58:24,998 --> 02:58:33,902
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah, so Thaler originally started with this list of behavioural anomalies on the blackboard in his office, like, stuff stupid people do.

1801
02:58:33,922 --> 02:58:37,204
[SPEAKER_52]: Right, let me rephrase that.

1802
02:58:37,784 --> 02:58:39,065
[SPEAKER_52]: Stupid stuff that people do.

1803
02:58:40,005 --> 02:58:43,787
[SPEAKER_35]: It kind of goes against what they think they should want, but what they actually end up doing.

1804
02:58:44,027 --> 02:58:47,169
[SPEAKER_52]: It's stuff that doesn't make any sense in the standard economic paradigm.

1805
02:58:47,709 --> 02:59:04,779
[SPEAKER_52]: Then he takes it to the economics profession in a column called Anomalies, which is published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which is a well-respected journal, where every issue of this journal, he points to something that people do that makes no sense in the framework of regular economics.

1806
02:59:05,559 --> 02:59:09,362
[SPEAKER_52]: And he debunks all the attempts by economists to rationalize this behavior.

1807
02:59:09,782 --> 02:59:11,523
[SPEAKER_52]: And he shows that it's economically significant.

1808
02:59:11,824 --> 02:59:14,666
[SPEAKER_52]: So examples, for instance, there's the December effect.

1809
02:59:14,726 --> 02:59:19,629
[SPEAKER_52]: So if I remember rightly, stocks fall in December, and then they rise again in January.

1810
02:59:19,769 --> 02:59:20,830
[SPEAKER_52]: But it shouldn't happen.

1811
02:59:20,890 --> 02:59:23,152
[SPEAKER_52]: In perfect markets, that shouldn't happen.

1812
02:59:23,592 --> 02:59:24,733
[SPEAKER_52]: But Thaler identifies it.

1813
02:59:24,753 --> 02:59:25,674
[SPEAKER_52]: And he said, this is important.

1814
02:59:25,694 --> 02:59:27,535
[SPEAKER_52]: And there's no straightforward way to explain it.

1815
02:59:28,015 --> 02:59:29,396
[SPEAKER_52]: So he's pointing to these examples.

1816
02:59:29,436 --> 02:59:32,098
[SPEAKER_52]: And he's saying to economists, you have to pay attention to this.

1817
02:59:32,279 --> 02:59:34,060
[SPEAKER_52]: This stuff really matters.

1818
02:59:34,917 --> 02:59:40,581
[SPEAKER_35]: OK, well, Richard Thaler's book Nudge was an inspiration to governments around the world.

1819
02:59:41,162 --> 02:59:45,965
[SPEAKER_35]: For instance, the UK government set up the Behavioural Insight Unit in 2010.

1820
02:59:46,406 --> 02:59:51,750
[SPEAKER_35]: Its remit was to develop ways to get more people across the country to engage with government policies.

1821
02:59:52,727 --> 02:59:56,468
[SPEAKER_35]: That should help them in the long run, but maybe perhaps they've been putting off.

1822
02:59:56,928 --> 02:59:58,148
[SPEAKER_35]: Tim, could you tell us a bit more about that?

1823
02:59:58,529 --> 03:00:06,911
[SPEAKER_52]: So these units were trying to take ideas from behavioural economics and from social psychology, to be fair, and turn them into policy relevant ideas.

1824
03:00:06,951 --> 03:00:09,892
[SPEAKER_52]: So how do we persuade people to pay their taxes?

1825
03:00:10,172 --> 03:00:12,192
[SPEAKER_52]: How can we reform pension policy?

1826
03:00:12,252 --> 03:00:13,813
[SPEAKER_52]: How can we get people to insulate their lofts?

1827
03:00:14,573 --> 03:00:21,876
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, the way that happened, it started with a research paper that Thaler published with a guy called Cass Sunstein, who's a legal scholar.

1828
03:00:22,436 --> 03:00:25,498
[SPEAKER_52]: They identified this thing they called libertarian paternalism.

1829
03:00:26,138 --> 03:00:29,239
[SPEAKER_52]: Libertarian paternalism is this idea that we keep people's freedom to choose.

1830
03:00:29,259 --> 03:00:34,602
[SPEAKER_52]: We respect that people may know what's best for them, but we also have a paternalistic side.

1831
03:00:34,762 --> 03:00:36,162
[SPEAKER_52]: So maybe people don't know what's best for them.

1832
03:00:36,202 --> 03:00:37,183
[SPEAKER_52]: Maybe we need to nudge them

1833
03:00:38,143 --> 03:00:39,466
[SPEAKER_52]: into doing the right thing.

1834
03:00:39,908 --> 03:00:45,320
[SPEAKER_52]: So, you know, I give you the freedom to opt in or opt out of a pension, you know, whatever you want.

1835
03:00:46,082 --> 03:00:50,344
[SPEAKER_52]: But maybe I'll nudge you to have a pension by making that the default option.

1836
03:00:50,464 --> 03:00:51,344
[SPEAKER_35]: And then you have to opt out.

1837
03:00:51,404 --> 03:00:52,185
[SPEAKER_52]: And you have to opt out.

1838
03:00:52,405 --> 03:00:54,306
[SPEAKER_52]: Now, in classical economics, it doesn't make any difference.

1839
03:00:54,326 --> 03:00:56,266
[SPEAKER_52]: You either want a pension or you don't want a pension.

1840
03:00:56,426 --> 03:00:56,887
[SPEAKER_52]: Exactly.

1841
03:00:57,147 --> 03:00:57,487
[SPEAKER_52]: Exactly.

1842
03:00:57,747 --> 03:01:01,529
[SPEAKER_52]: But according to behavioral economics, the default probably does matter.

1843
03:01:01,809 --> 03:01:05,971
[SPEAKER_52]: So he introduces this idea with Cass Sunstein of libertarian paternalism.

1844
03:01:06,371 --> 03:01:08,912
[SPEAKER_52]: And then they give it this much catchier title, nudge.

1845
03:01:09,572 --> 03:01:13,554
[SPEAKER_52]: And they publish a book called Nudge in, if I remember rightly, about 2007, 2008.

1846
03:01:13,874 --> 03:01:15,394
[SPEAKER_52]: It's about 10 years ago.

1847
03:01:15,975 --> 03:01:19,796
[SPEAKER_52]: And this book becomes very sexy for politicians.

1848
03:01:20,396 --> 03:01:26,699
[SPEAKER_52]: And if you recall, David Cameron was elected prime minister in 2010, Barack Obama president in 2008.

1849
03:01:27,399 --> 03:01:35,402
[SPEAKER_52]: And both of these men were talking about nudge ideas because it seemed like just a smart way to make better policy.

1850
03:01:35,862 --> 03:01:45,485
[SPEAKER_52]: And as they won their elections, then Thaler and Sunstein became highly policy relevant and these behavioural insight units were set up.

1851
03:01:46,305 --> 03:01:52,507
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you give an example of something that a policy that has come to fruition that we think may have had a successful nutshell effect?

1852
03:01:53,038 --> 03:01:59,603
[SPEAKER_52]: One of the other things that Thaler says, it's a very straightforward point, is if you want people to do something, you make it easy.

1853
03:02:00,284 --> 03:02:18,038
[SPEAKER_52]: You actually have to think about how things are designed, so what happens by default, how many boxes do I have to fill in, could some forms already be filled in by default, because the government, say, wants me to fill in my taxes, and they already know a lot of stuff about me, so maybe all that stuff should be filled in automatically, and I can just correct it if there's a problem.

1854
03:02:18,558 --> 03:02:27,147
[SPEAKER_52]: So, you know, behavioral economics has been used to redesign tax forms, for example, in the United States, basically to try to make it easier to do the right thing.

1855
03:02:27,307 --> 03:02:35,334
[SPEAKER_35]: One of the other things I was reading about Thaler earlier is that some of his work that he's done helps us spot some of the naughty tricks that marketers

1856
03:02:36,055 --> 03:02:37,355
[SPEAKER_35]: and advertising use.

1857
03:02:37,595 --> 03:02:39,236
[SPEAKER_35]: It's going back to the cashew nuts thing isn't it?

1858
03:02:39,256 --> 03:02:42,477
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like I don't really want cashew nuts but if they're there I'm going to eat them.

1859
03:02:42,777 --> 03:02:52,939
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah so I mean in in the book Nudge, Thaler is talking about you know nudging people to do the right thing but of course you can nudge people to do the wrong thing and advertisers and marketers have known this for a very very long time.

1860
03:02:52,979 --> 03:02:58,320
[SPEAKER_52]: You can nudge people to smoke, you can nudge people to eat fatty, salty, sugary food.

1861
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:01,861
[SPEAKER_52]: These days they have the the term evil nudges

1862
03:03:02,981 --> 03:03:04,542
[SPEAKER_52]: And Thaler also talks about something else.

1863
03:03:04,582 --> 03:03:05,483
[SPEAKER_52]: He calls it sludge.

1864
03:03:05,923 --> 03:03:18,549
[SPEAKER_52]: So sludge is basically just noise when you're trying to make a clear decision and companies are just confusing you with all kinds of irrelevant information or just making it hard to unsubscribe from something that you want to unsubscribe to.

1865
03:03:18,830 --> 03:03:24,413
[SPEAKER_52]: So yeah, I mean, these tricks have been used for a very long time for good and for evil in the private sector.

1866
03:03:25,113 --> 03:03:28,315
[SPEAKER_52]: Thaler is saying the public sector needs to take them seriously as well.

1867
03:03:28,675 --> 03:03:30,656
[SPEAKER_52]: And ideally, one would hope,

1868
03:03:31,559 --> 03:03:33,911
[SPEAKER_52]: Our enlightened governments are going to use nudges.

1869
03:03:34,943 --> 03:03:36,924
[SPEAKER_35]: In the right way.

1870
03:03:37,124 --> 03:03:37,504
[SPEAKER_35]: I love it.

1871
03:03:37,584 --> 03:03:38,825
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a force for good or evil.

1872
03:03:39,085 --> 03:03:40,826
[SPEAKER_35]: Please governments, use it for good.

1873
03:03:41,566 --> 03:03:42,767
[SPEAKER_52]: But it is a powerful force.

1874
03:03:43,047 --> 03:03:44,047
[SPEAKER_52]: It is a powerful force.

1875
03:03:44,527 --> 03:03:46,388
[SPEAKER_52]: It's worth paying attention to.

1876
03:03:46,928 --> 03:03:54,592
[SPEAKER_52]: And it has been a blind spot in classical economics that we've ignored these design factors and these psychological factors.

1877
03:03:55,072 --> 03:04:02,395
[SPEAKER_52]: And I think Thaler has, he's not the only one, but he's done more than anybody else to convince the economic profession to take these behavioral factors seriously.

1878
03:04:03,237 --> 03:04:06,418
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you very much, Tim Harford, for being an expert for us.

1879
03:04:07,359 --> 03:04:08,319
[SPEAKER_52]: My pleasure.

1880
03:04:08,659 --> 03:04:11,180
[SPEAKER_35]: That's all we have time for this week on the programme.

1881
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:18,103
[SPEAKER_35]: But if you want to hear an interview that Tim Harford did with Professor Thaler back in 2015, then check out this week's podcast.

1882
03:04:18,683 --> 03:04:27,287
[SPEAKER_35]: If you want to get in touch with us, then email more or less at bbc.co.uk or tweet at BBC more or less.

1883
03:04:29,045 --> 03:04:35,831
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the BBC World Service, where we're looking for solutions to the problem of domestic violence.

1884
03:04:35,851 --> 03:04:38,593
[SPEAKER_24]: 100 women on the BBC World Service.

1885
03:04:38,853 --> 03:04:49,903
[SPEAKER_23]: The domestic violence will always happen if the men keep thinking that they have the right to hit the woman and if the wife keep thinking that they deserve to be hit by the man.

1886
03:04:50,203 --> 03:04:51,604
[SPEAKER_33]: Behind closed doors.

1887
03:04:52,005 --> 03:04:56,248
[SPEAKER_33]: Listen to the whole series at bbcworldservice.com slash 100 women.

1888
03:04:59,788 --> 03:05:01,829
[SPEAKER_33]: We're in the studio in 30 minutes.

1889
03:05:02,029 --> 03:05:08,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Join Itay Mautner, the artistic director of Mekadeshit, as he prepares an arts and culture festival in Jerusalem.

1890
03:05:08,890 --> 03:05:16,772
[SPEAKER_19]: From smoking volcano artwork high on the rooftops, to a concert bringing together musicians from all sides of this beloved and disputed city.

1891
03:05:16,932 --> 03:05:19,293
[SPEAKER_33]: BBC World Hacks is next.

1892
03:05:19,633 --> 03:05:23,254
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

1893
03:05:28,951 --> 03:05:33,974
[SPEAKER_36]: After the news, it's World Hacks, the programme where we test out solutions to the world's biggest problems.

1894
03:05:34,094 --> 03:05:37,295
[SPEAKER_36]: And this week, William, we're looking at something that's quite difficult to talk about.

1895
03:05:37,795 --> 03:05:41,717
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes, not the sort of thing that you would want to bring up with your colleagues at work, for example.

1896
03:05:41,777 --> 03:05:46,240
[SPEAKER_36]: No, I don't think I've ever told my colleagues this information because it's all about pay.

1897
03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:47,901
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know what you get paid.

1898
03:05:48,041 --> 03:05:49,261
[SPEAKER_36]: Hopefully you don't know what I get paid.

1899
03:05:49,381 --> 03:05:50,402
[SPEAKER_53]: No, I don't.

1900
03:05:50,842 --> 03:05:51,402
[SPEAKER_53]: I don't want to know.

1901
03:05:51,422 --> 03:05:52,243
[SPEAKER_53]: Don't tell me.

1902
03:05:52,803 --> 03:05:53,423
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a secret.

1903
03:05:54,264 --> 03:06:01,228
[SPEAKER_36]: But it is important to talk about it because in every country in the world, no matter where you go, women will be paid on average less than men.

1904
03:06:01,628 --> 03:06:06,972
[SPEAKER_54]: But I have been to Iceland, which is trying out something new.

1905
03:06:07,172 --> 03:06:14,697
[SPEAKER_54]: The government is going to force companies to change the way that they pay men and women to stop them from discriminating in their salaries.

1906
03:06:15,577 --> 03:06:19,403
[SPEAKER_54]: and companies that play ball are going to get a nice sticker for their website.

1907
03:06:19,884 --> 03:06:25,072
[SPEAKER_54]: So I've met a few women who've had playwrights and I've met some HR professionals who've tried out the new system.

1908
03:06:25,432 --> 03:06:27,135
[SPEAKER_36]: That's all coming up after the BBC News.

1909
03:06:29,543 --> 03:06:31,884
[SPEAKER_45]: Hello, this is Fiona MacDonald with the BBC News.

1910
03:06:32,544 --> 03:06:41,088
[SPEAKER_45]: The US State Department has called for calm after Iraqi government forces seized the northern city of Kirkuk and nearby oil fields from Kurdish control.

1911
03:06:41,669 --> 03:06:46,951
[SPEAKER_45]: Armoured vehicles moved into Kirkuk on Monday in an advance that took less than 24 hours.

1912
03:06:47,371 --> 03:06:48,392
[SPEAKER_45]: Peter Bowes reports.

1913
03:06:48,992 --> 03:06:56,494
[SPEAKER_34]: A spokeswoman for the State Department said the United States was calling on all parties to coordinate military activities and restore calm.

1914
03:06:57,075 --> 03:07:01,476
[SPEAKER_34]: Earlier, Donald Trump, speaking at the White House, said, we don't like the fact that they're clashing.

1915
03:07:01,876 --> 03:07:04,057
[SPEAKER_34]: He added that the US was not taking sides.

1916
03:07:04,617 --> 03:07:11,199
[SPEAKER_34]: The State Department said it supported the peaceful exercise of joint administration, consistent with the Iraqi constitution.

1917
03:07:11,779 --> 03:07:19,282
[SPEAKER_34]: Washington arms and trains both Iraqi federal forces and the Peshmerga, the Kurdish forces, to fight Islamic State militants.

[SPEAKER_45]: On Saturday, 100 local IS fighters were allowed to leave with their families to other areas, as Saeed Shahata from BBC Arabic reports.

1922
03:07:49,115 --> 03:07:50,315
[SPEAKER_12]: there's two destinations.

1923
03:07:50,335 --> 03:07:57,857
[SPEAKER_12]: The one is Idlib, where most of IS fighters left homes, and other cities where there is having truce between Syrian Democratic Forces and the IS.

1924
03:07:58,477 --> 03:08:03,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other destination is Turkey, because Iraq is very close to the border with Turkey.

1925
03:08:03,478 --> 03:08:08,358
[SPEAKER_12]: It is symbolically destroying the idea of the Islamic Khilafah on the ground.

1926
03:08:08,979 --> 03:08:16,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And materially, it will be a big boost for the Syrian Democratic Forces from one side, from the Americans supporting them, and the Syrian regime.

1927
03:08:18,097 --> 03:08:18,537
[SPEAKER_45]: The U.S.

1928
03:08:18,578 --> 03:08:26,045
[SPEAKER_45]: Defense Department says its forces have carried out an airstrike on two Islamic State training camps in Yemen, killing dozens of militants.

1929
03:08:26,566 --> 03:08:32,772

1930
03:08:33,884 --> 03:08:40,050
[SPEAKER_45]: More than a thousand people have taken part in a vigil in Malta for a journalist murdered on Monday by a powerful car bomb.

1931
03:08:40,570 --> 03:08:44,374
[SPEAKER_45]: Daphne Caruana Galizia was a leading investigative journalist.

1932
03:08:44,774 --> 03:08:51,621
[SPEAKER_45]: She highlighted alleged corruption by senior politicians, including Malta's Prime Minister, who has denied any wrongdoing.

1933
03:08:52,341 --> 03:08:57,967
[SPEAKER_45]: Addressing the mourners gathered in the town of Slima, a family friend said she was a fearless journalist.

1934
03:08:58,738 --> 03:09:06,223
[SPEAKER_01]: This is undoubtedly a dark and sad, sad, sad, sad day for Malta as a Maltese citizen.

1935
03:09:06,423 --> 03:09:20,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Daphne was not only a journalist and an absolutely fearless human being but a fourth pillar of our democracy and I know that her life was definitely not for nothing and I'm sure that the torch will be carried by somebody else.

1936
03:09:21,214 --> 03:09:24,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it will be carried by everyone here and everyone would like to be here.

1937
03:09:28,786 --> 03:09:36,408
[SPEAKER_45]: There have been protests in Barcelona over the Spanish High Court decision to remand in custody two pro-independence Catalan leaders.

[SPEAKER_45]: People banged pots and pans in the streets and honked car horns after Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cujart became the first senior Catalonian separatist figures to be jailed pending an investigation for possible sedition.

1939
03:09:51,333 --> 03:09:59,641
[SPEAKER_45]: In an address recorded before he entered detention, Mr Sanchez called for permanent protest until an independent Catalonia was realised.

1940
03:10:04,764 --> 03:10:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the judge's decision is to take away our freedom.

1941
03:10:08,227 --> 03:10:10,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an act that doesn't correspond to any principles of justice.

1942
03:10:11,589 --> 03:10:17,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an act aimed at frightening us and punishing us for defending freedom and peacefully taking to the streets, as we have done so many times.

1943
03:10:18,455 --> 03:10:24,080
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I want to sincerely ask that you respond with permanent protest, which will lead us to the proclamation of the Republic.

1944
03:10:24,500 --> 03:10:26,202
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't defeat us if we remain strong.

1945
03:10:27,618 --> 03:10:28,639
[SPEAKER_45]: The governor of the U.S.

1946
03:10:28,659 --> 03:10:35,102
[SPEAKER_45]: state of Florida has declared a state of emergency ahead of a public speech by a white nationalist leader later this week.

1947
03:10:35,662 --> 03:10:45,307
[SPEAKER_45]: Governor Rick Scott said his executive order would ensure the security forces had all resources necessary to police the event at the University of Florida on Thursday.

1948
03:10:46,067 --> 03:10:53,331
[SPEAKER_45]: In August, Richard Spencer helped organize a demonstration in Charlottesville in Virginia, which ended in violence and one death.

1949
03:10:54,770 --> 03:11:05,944
[SPEAKER_45]: The new UN envoy for the disputed territory of Western Sahara is visiting the region to assess the possibility of restarting peace talks between Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front.

1950
03:11:06,464 --> 03:11:12,752
[SPEAKER_45]: Reports say Horst Koehler, a former German president, met the Moroccan foreign minister in Rabat on Monday.

1951
03:11:14,072 --> 03:11:22,556
[SPEAKER_45]: The Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier say it's entered into a partnership agreement with European company Airbus to sell the C-series jet.

1952
03:11:22,956 --> 03:11:26,777
[SPEAKER_45]: Bombardier has been under pressure because of a trade dispute with Boeing.

1953
03:11:27,418 --> 03:11:28,198
[SPEAKER_45]: BBC News.

1954
03:11:29,036 --> 03:11:32,078
[SPEAKER_36]: Imagine for a minute working in a big, open-plan office.

1955
03:11:32,398 --> 03:11:35,180
[SPEAKER_36]: If you're actually in one, then you can stop, have a quick look around.

1956
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:37,721
[SPEAKER_36]: Now imagine it's a Monday afternoon in autumn.

1957
03:11:38,061 --> 03:11:41,203
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a clear day and there's sun streaming through the windows.

1958
03:11:41,984 --> 03:11:44,985
[SPEAKER_36]: Suddenly, all the women in the office start moving.

1959
03:11:45,706 --> 03:11:52,410
[SPEAKER_36]: Without saying very much, they log off their computers, they pop their coats on and they file out of the door, leaving the men in the office at their desks.

1960
03:11:53,245 --> 03:11:57,429
[SPEAKER_36]: It's exactly 2.38 in the afternoon and it's not just your office.

1961
03:11:57,970 --> 03:12:00,432
[SPEAKER_36]: Women are filing out of buildings up and down the street.

1962
03:12:01,453 --> 03:12:05,557
[SPEAKER_36]: This happened right across Iceland on October the 24th last year.

1963
03:12:06,418 --> 03:12:13,144
[SPEAKER_36]: The women left work early, shaving 30% of their working day because in Iceland they take home on average 30% less pay than men.

1964
03:12:15,503 --> 03:12:20,914
[SPEAKER_36]: And in Reykjavik, the capital, lots of shops and schools closed as all the women headed down to Parliament Square.

1965
03:12:21,355 --> 03:12:26,125
[SPEAKER_36]: The crowd numbered around 20,000 and Marianne Traustadottir was one of the organisers.

1966
03:12:28,967 --> 03:12:30,909
[SPEAKER_15]: The atmosphere was really fantastic.

1967
03:12:31,529 --> 03:12:35,472
[SPEAKER_15]: We had speeches, we were singing.

1968
03:12:36,193 --> 03:12:41,937
[SPEAKER_15]: We put our hands as far away as we could and we said, inequality should be out.

1969
03:12:42,898 --> 03:12:50,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So you had like thousands of women and men, you know, here at Østuvel, everybody shouting, everything should be out.

1970
03:12:57,475 --> 03:12:59,976
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like some magical happening.

1971
03:13:02,177 --> 03:13:12,082
[SPEAKER_36]: Since then, the government has brought in rules that will make Iceland the first country to put in place a rigorous system to try and force companies to provide evidence that they're paying men and women equally.

1972
03:13:12,782 --> 03:13:18,805
[SPEAKER_36]: Is this tiny Nordic island nation about to show the rest of the world how to eliminate unequal pay once and for all?

1973
03:13:20,826 --> 03:13:22,827
[SPEAKER_45]: Well, perhaps.

1974
03:13:29,875 --> 03:13:31,857
[SPEAKER_36]: This is World Hacks on the BBC World Service.

1975
03:13:32,017 --> 03:13:32,718
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm India Rackson.

1976
03:13:33,278 --> 03:13:40,925
[SPEAKER_36]: On this show, we travel and scour the surface of our troubled planet, seeking the people and the ideas that could actually change or improve the way we live.

1977
03:13:41,446 --> 03:13:45,570
[SPEAKER_36]: And the solution we're exploring today is all about a big difference between men and women.

1978
03:13:46,190 --> 03:13:50,374
[SPEAKER_36]: Because whatever country you go to in the world, one fact will be true.

1979
03:13:50,975 --> 03:13:54,158
[SPEAKER_36]: The women there, on average, will not be paid as much as the men.

1980
03:13:54,758 --> 03:13:57,921
[SPEAKER_36]: Yep, we are today talking about the gender pay gap.

1981
03:13:58,441 --> 03:14:05,447
[SPEAKER_36]: For decades it has remained a seemingly unbridgeable issue despite advances in female education and the number of women working.

1982
03:14:06,332 --> 03:14:12,238
[SPEAKER_36]: Globally, on average, women take home just over half the wages of men, according to the World Economic Forum.

1983
03:14:12,678 --> 03:14:15,862
[SPEAKER_36]: But what exactly does Iceland have up its sleeve to address this?

1984
03:14:16,482 --> 03:14:18,845
[SPEAKER_36]: Our reporter William Kramer has been there to find out more.

1985
03:14:18,965 --> 03:14:19,345
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, William.

1986
03:14:19,705 --> 03:14:20,166
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, India.

1987
03:14:20,306 --> 03:14:20,967
[SPEAKER_36]: Thanks for joining us.

1988
03:14:21,507 --> 03:14:25,311
[SPEAKER_36]: So you've been out in Iceland, William, probing today's solution.

1989
03:14:25,952 --> 03:14:26,492
[SPEAKER_36]: Why Iceland?

1990
03:14:26,552 --> 03:14:28,074
[SPEAKER_36]: How bad is it for the gender pay gap?

1991
03:14:28,604 --> 03:14:34,666
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, actually, Iceland is rated as the best country in the world by the World Economic Forum for gender equality generally.

1992
03:14:34,686 --> 03:14:35,306
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, that's good.

1993
03:14:35,686 --> 03:14:36,066
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, yeah.

1994
03:14:37,107 --> 03:14:40,648
[SPEAKER_54]: But as far as the gender pay gap is concerned, they're only number 23.

1995
03:14:41,068 --> 03:14:42,569
[SPEAKER_36]: Globally, 23 is not a bad number.

1996
03:14:42,589 --> 03:14:46,030
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, I mean, there's over 100 countries in the ranking, so you might think that's quite good.

1997
03:14:46,250 --> 03:14:51,692
[SPEAKER_54]: But they're determined to improve, and the government has pledged to eliminate the gender pay gap completely by 2022.

1998
03:14:53,147 --> 03:15:14,162
[SPEAKER_36]: So we heard just then that women left early because they got paid 30% less than men, but that figure's not taking into account hours, part-time work and things like that, because of course a country's pay gap isn't just because of how the companies pay women, there's also a matter of different lives that women have to men, so career choices, breaks in career, maternity leave, part-time working, that sort of thing.

1999
03:15:14,493 --> 03:15:21,396
[SPEAKER_54]: But here's the thing, even when you look at women and men doing similar jobs for the same hours, there's still a gender pay gap.

2000
03:15:21,917 --> 03:15:22,817
[SPEAKER_54]: Though it is much smaller.

2001
03:15:23,037 --> 03:15:27,579
[SPEAKER_54]: This is sometimes called the unexplained pay gap and it's still an issue all around the world.

2002
03:15:27,740 --> 03:15:29,320
[SPEAKER_54]: In Iceland it's reckoned to be about 6 or 7%.

2003
03:15:31,101 --> 03:15:33,902
[SPEAKER_36]: OK, but it has been illegal for decades, hasn't it?

2004
03:15:34,002 --> 03:15:39,204
[SPEAKER_36]: It's been illegal here to pay women less than men, and in the States, and in the EU, across the world.

2005
03:15:39,324 --> 03:15:42,405
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes, and in Iceland it's been illegal since 1961.

2006
03:15:43,206 --> 03:15:45,947
[SPEAKER_54]: Despite this, it hasn't gone away.

2007
03:15:46,107 --> 03:15:53,950
[SPEAKER_54]: So even though it's illegal, and quite possibly companies don't want to pay men more than women, they still are doing it.

2008
03:15:54,150 --> 03:15:55,130
[SPEAKER_36]: It's still a really big issue.

2009
03:15:55,150 --> 03:15:56,111
[SPEAKER_54]: Still an issue everywhere.

2010
03:15:56,431 --> 03:16:01,993
[SPEAKER_54]: And we heard at the beginning of the programme from the organiser of the women's protest, Mariana Thrustadóttir.

2011
03:16:02,694 --> 03:16:06,835
[SPEAKER_54]: She works for the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, an umbrella group for trade unions.

2012
03:16:07,336 --> 03:16:12,198
[SPEAKER_54]: Mariana has been supporting workers on this issue of unequal pay for decades now.

2013
03:16:12,878 --> 03:16:20,181
[SPEAKER_54]: About 10 years ago, she got together with Business Iceland, the organisation that represents employers, and they were also keen to tackle the issue.

2014
03:16:20,593 --> 03:16:24,574
[SPEAKER_15]: We at the Union, we saw that law didn't work.

2015
03:16:24,995 --> 03:16:26,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Awareness campaigns did not work.

2016
03:16:27,315 --> 03:16:33,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So we decided that we would turn to the, some say, boring world of bureaucracy.

2017
03:16:34,718 --> 03:16:39,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And we came together with the business community and the government.

2018
03:16:40,180 --> 03:16:46,510
[SPEAKER_15]: to develop a certification scheme for equal pay which workplaces could apply.

2019
03:16:46,831 --> 03:16:47,151
[SPEAKER_36]: Excellent.

2020
03:16:47,191 --> 03:16:50,337
[SPEAKER_36]: William, we haven't had a little tinkering with bureaucracy on the programme in a while.

2021
03:16:50,677 --> 03:16:52,320
[SPEAKER_36]: So what exactly is this hack?

2022
03:16:52,841 --> 03:16:55,523
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, it's called IST 85 colon 2012.

2023
03:16:55,703 --> 03:16:57,164
[SPEAKER_54]: Nice and catchy.

2024
03:16:57,644 --> 03:16:58,665
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a good title.

2025
03:16:58,825 --> 03:17:00,506
[SPEAKER_54]: It's also known as the equal pay standard.

2026
03:17:00,526 --> 03:17:00,947
[SPEAKER_36]: That's better.

2027
03:17:01,427 --> 03:17:02,828
[SPEAKER_54]: And it's a, what is it?

2028
03:17:02,868 --> 03:17:03,888
[SPEAKER_54]: It's a set of guidelines.

2029
03:17:03,909 --> 03:17:08,331
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, it's a booklet, a management standard, which took four years to write.

2030
03:17:08,512 --> 03:17:10,273
[SPEAKER_54]: It's the first of its type in the world.

2031
03:17:19,402 --> 03:17:24,543
[SPEAKER_54]: The Equal Pay Standard was published in 2012 and a pilot to implement it was carried out the following year.

2032
03:17:25,163 --> 03:17:29,944
[SPEAKER_54]: The very first organisation to be accredited with the Equal Pay Standard was the Customs Office.

2033
03:17:30,485 --> 03:17:32,105
[SPEAKER_54]: I met their friendly head of HR.

2034
03:17:32,585 --> 03:17:37,066
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Unnurir Kristjánsdóttir and I'm Director of Human Resources at Icelandic Customs.

2035
03:17:37,566 --> 03:17:41,147
[SPEAKER_54]: So just take me through, what did you do, how did you actually implement the standard?

2036
03:17:41,927 --> 03:17:45,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You evaluate all jobs that's within the organisation.

2037
03:17:45,830 --> 03:17:51,934
[SPEAKER_11]: After the evaluation, you look at the pay, just the salary, go with the points that you have evaluated.

2038
03:17:52,334 --> 03:17:55,937
[SPEAKER_54]: First of all, you're looking at the jobs in the organisation, not the people.

2039
03:17:56,057 --> 03:17:58,859
[SPEAKER_54]: You're looking at the positions and assigning them a value.

2040
03:17:59,059 --> 03:18:05,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and it's very important that you look at the position, the core value of each position, not the individual doing the job.

2041
03:18:06,362 --> 03:18:12,565
[SPEAKER_54]: And then after you've done that and you've re-evaluated all the jobs in the organisation, then you start looking at what you're actually paying people, is that right?

2042
03:18:12,825 --> 03:18:18,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, then we do sort of a salary analysis to check that we are paying equal wages for equal jobs.

2043
03:18:18,747 --> 03:18:23,749
[SPEAKER_36]: So, William, how did the Customs Office decide on these core values that they're talking about for each position?

2044
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:32,633
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, Una and her colleagues came up with a set of criteria and then they got the managers in the Customs Office to agree to those definitions.

2045
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:40,137
[SPEAKER_11]: The core criteria of knowledge, we have a sub-criteria of education and then another sub-criteria of work experience.

2046
03:18:40,457 --> 03:18:52,709
[SPEAKER_54]: They were looking at things like, for example, how educated you needed to be to do a job, how much responsibility was required, whether you could do it at your desk or whether you had to go outside in the famously bitter Icelandic wind.

2047
03:18:53,620 --> 03:19:03,589
[SPEAKER_11]: main criteria is the work environment and then we got there mental and emotional stress, physical strain and work conditions and environmental stimulus.

2048
03:19:04,029 --> 03:19:12,496
[SPEAKER_36]: So you've got all these categories like responsibility, working conditions and different jobs can score higher or lower amounts in these different categories, is that right?

2049
03:19:12,557 --> 03:19:12,717
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah.

2050
03:19:13,342 --> 03:19:17,246
[SPEAKER_54]: But very different jobs can end up with the same total score.

2051
03:19:17,947 --> 03:19:27,237
[SPEAKER_54]: So if you think about it, India, this system has the potential to elevate completely different types of work in a company or an organisation that might have been previously overlooked.

2052
03:19:27,657 --> 03:19:31,962
[SPEAKER_54]: So next, Una had to agree how each job was scored with the managers in the customs office.

2053
03:19:32,402 --> 03:19:34,785
[SPEAKER_54]: And frankly, this sounds like it was a complete nightmare.

2054
03:19:35,145 --> 03:19:36,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it took lots of meetings.

2055
03:19:37,347 --> 03:19:43,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Most managers think their jobs is very complex and maybe more complex than other jobs.

2056
03:19:43,851 --> 03:19:54,558
[SPEAKER_11]: We were looking at it over and over again and the main challenge of it was also that managers tend to go and think of the person doing the job and that's not what the standard is about.

2057
03:19:54,598 --> 03:19:57,480
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to evaluate the job, not the person doing it.

2058
03:19:57,885 --> 03:20:03,288
[SPEAKER_54]: Finally, after months of internal wrangling, Öner had a massive Excel spreadsheet.

2059
03:20:03,388 --> 03:20:07,970
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh great, so she's now living the HR dream with a whole new set of data.

2060
03:20:08,030 --> 03:20:15,554
[SPEAKER_54]: Exactly, a huge, great big data set showing every job in the organisation and how many points each one was now deemed to be worth.

2061
03:20:16,335 --> 03:20:22,158
[SPEAKER_54]: She had to put the names of her staff next to all the jobs and basically everyone got their salary checked.

2062
03:20:22,718 --> 03:20:25,800
[SPEAKER_54]: And that's a key thing, it wasn't just the women, it was everybody in the organisation.

2063
03:20:26,020 --> 03:20:32,684
[SPEAKER_36]: That makes sense because she's got this whole new data set and so she can look across it and see whether there might be discrimination in other places.

2064
03:20:32,744 --> 03:20:34,986
[SPEAKER_36]: So this could act as a brake on discrimination of all sorts.

2065
03:20:35,106 --> 03:20:36,107
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, it ought to.

2066
03:20:36,267 --> 03:20:41,610
[SPEAKER_36]: But a question, William, isn't this sort of communism or at least making jobs very prescriptive?

2067
03:20:42,050 --> 03:20:45,793
[SPEAKER_36]: So why wouldn't you just do the job that you're being paid to do?

2068
03:20:46,511 --> 03:20:47,352
[SPEAKER_54]: OK, that's several questions.

2069
03:20:47,632 --> 03:20:47,852
[SPEAKER_54]: Sorry.

2070
03:20:48,253 --> 03:20:53,657
[SPEAKER_54]: So no, it's not communism, because I mean, we do talk about equal pay, but you're not paying everyone equally.

2071
03:20:54,257 --> 03:20:57,200
[SPEAKER_54]: What's equal is the mechanisms for paying everyone.

2072
03:20:57,460 --> 03:21:03,185
[SPEAKER_54]: The decisions that you are taking when you are paying people are the same for whether you're talking about a man or a woman.

2073
03:21:03,345 --> 03:21:06,447
[SPEAKER_54]: So in actual fact, there is some wriggle room within the standard.

2074
03:21:06,567 --> 03:21:08,549
[SPEAKER_54]: It allows for different kind of salary systems.

2075
03:21:08,569 --> 03:21:13,293
[SPEAKER_54]: So you could have, for example, bonuses, or you could have like a commission-based salary system.

2076
03:21:13,853 --> 03:21:18,837
[SPEAKER_54]: That can all be accommodated within the standard, but it's just that all those decisions need to be transparent.

2077
03:21:19,217 --> 03:21:22,420
[SPEAKER_36]: Still a good reason to kind of go above and beyond your job and to work hard.

2078
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:25,282
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't have that.

2079
03:21:25,362 --> 03:21:27,003
[SPEAKER_36]: So it just has to be fair, basically.

2080
03:21:27,323 --> 03:21:30,666
[SPEAKER_54]: It has to be fair and you have to be able to document that decision-making process.

2081
03:21:31,086 --> 03:21:32,587
[SPEAKER_36]: So what happened at the customs office?

2082
03:21:32,888 --> 03:21:34,108
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, drumroll please.

2083
03:21:35,730 --> 03:21:39,132
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, 10% of women had a pay rise and 1% of men did.

2084
03:21:40,285 --> 03:21:40,926
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, OK.

2085
03:21:41,246 --> 03:21:42,186
[SPEAKER_36]: And were they big pay rises?

2086
03:21:42,567 --> 03:21:44,248
[SPEAKER_54]: Apparently they weren't huge pay rises.

2087
03:21:44,608 --> 03:21:45,128
[SPEAKER_36]: Any pay cuts?

2088
03:21:45,669 --> 03:21:46,129
[SPEAKER_54]: Pay cuts?

2089
03:21:46,429 --> 03:21:47,170
[SPEAKER_54]: No, apparently not.

2090
03:21:47,330 --> 03:21:51,753
[SPEAKER_54]: I think Una could have gone about it that way, but she chose to raise people's salaries instead.

2091
03:21:51,933 --> 03:21:55,555
[SPEAKER_54]: But there was one quite interesting example relating to customs officers.

2092
03:21:55,856 --> 03:21:59,118
[SPEAKER_54]: You know the people that are at the airport, you know, they want to look in your bag?

2093
03:21:59,418 --> 03:22:01,499
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, they check all the sort of goods coming through and yeah.

2094
03:22:01,759 --> 03:22:05,461
[SPEAKER_54]: So when they did the standard, those people have quite a bit of training that goes into their jobs.

2095
03:22:05,581 --> 03:22:07,722
[SPEAKER_54]: They have to go outside in all weathers.

2096
03:22:07,742 --> 03:22:09,223
[SPEAKER_54]: They've got quite a lot of responsibility.

2097
03:22:09,243 --> 03:22:12,344
[SPEAKER_54]: So they're at quite a lot of points and actually they get paid quite well.

2098
03:22:12,885 --> 03:22:16,186
[SPEAKER_54]: They're also, for whatever reason, very often men that do that job.

2099
03:22:16,866 --> 03:22:28,132
[SPEAKER_54]: The pattern that had developed over a period of years at the customs office is that when customs officers were approaching retirement, they were allowed to come out of the cold weather and go into the HQ.

2100
03:22:28,632 --> 03:22:29,513
[SPEAKER_36]: Nice cosy desk.

2101
03:22:29,913 --> 03:22:38,680
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, but you can see the problem is that they ended up working alongside clerical workers who were very often female and doing very similar work to them, but being paid much better.

2102
03:22:38,860 --> 03:22:40,361
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, that's going to be a big problem, isn't it?

2103
03:22:40,381 --> 03:22:41,382
[SPEAKER_36]: So what do they do?

2104
03:22:41,602 --> 03:22:42,443
[SPEAKER_36]: Do they take a pay cut?

2105
03:22:43,083 --> 03:22:46,226
[SPEAKER_54]: No, they were sent back outside to do the job they were being paid to do.

2106
03:22:46,544 --> 03:22:46,764
[SPEAKER_36]: Right.

2107
03:22:47,044 --> 03:22:47,785
[SPEAKER_36]: How do they feel about that?

2108
03:22:47,985 --> 03:22:50,947
[SPEAKER_54]: I didn't speak to any of them, but apparently they were a little bit grumpy about it.

2109
03:22:51,007 --> 03:22:51,927
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, we can see why.

2110
03:22:51,947 --> 03:22:55,489
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a bit of a bit of a shock to have to go back out to the job.

2111
03:22:55,669 --> 03:22:56,250
[SPEAKER_54]: It is, yeah.

2112
03:22:56,290 --> 03:22:57,691
[SPEAKER_54]: But you know, fair's fair, I suppose.

2113
03:22:57,991 --> 03:23:01,313
[SPEAKER_36]: So is it now in the customs office, some sort of pay slip utopia?

2114
03:23:01,353 --> 03:23:03,494
[SPEAKER_36]: Is there now complete equality there?

2115
03:23:03,934 --> 03:23:08,297
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, actually, I couldn't tell me what the current adjusted pay gap was for the customs office.

2116
03:23:08,637 --> 03:23:15,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it has gone down a bit because we have done the immediate actions that we need to do.

2117
03:23:16,801 --> 03:23:20,723
[SPEAKER_11]: We are still looking at it and how we can get it better.

2118
03:23:21,603 --> 03:23:23,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, of course it should be zero.

2119
03:23:23,464 --> 03:23:27,086
[SPEAKER_54]: Una told me that she'll find out more when they do their next salary review.

2120
03:23:27,473 --> 03:23:29,957
[SPEAKER_36]: And what about the other organisations that took part in the pilot?

2121
03:23:30,778 --> 03:23:37,109
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, again, the Icelandic government couldn't tell me precise figures on how much the adjusted pay gap reduced across the pilot.

2122
03:23:37,650 --> 03:23:41,777
[SPEAKER_54]: They just said that two thirds of the organisations that took part had to raise some salaries.

2123
03:23:50,463 --> 03:23:56,305
[SPEAKER_36]: You're listening to World Hacks on the BBC World Service, and today we're talking about Iceland's attempt to bring down the gender pay gap.

2124
03:23:56,885 --> 03:23:59,886
[SPEAKER_36]: William, we've gone over how the equal pay standard is supposed to work.

2125
03:24:00,307 --> 03:24:02,668
[SPEAKER_36]: Now please, I would like to hear from someone who's had a pay rise.

2126
03:24:02,948 --> 03:24:04,968
[SPEAKER_54]: So let's meet Sigfridur Gunnlaugsdóttir.

2127
03:24:05,208 --> 03:24:09,690
[SPEAKER_54]: She's the international affairs manager at the customs office, so it's a pretty senior position.

2128
03:24:09,810 --> 03:24:11,411
[SPEAKER_54]: She works quite closely with the director.

2129
03:24:12,351 --> 03:24:16,876
[SPEAKER_54]: When they were implementing the standard, Sigfrida found that she'd been underpaid.

2130
03:24:17,277 --> 03:24:24,925
[SPEAKER_54]: Her basic salary was the same as the men on her level, but unlike them, she and another female colleague were not being paid for their overtime.

2131
03:24:25,906 --> 03:24:26,787
[SPEAKER_54]: Were you a bit annoyed?

2132
03:24:30,332 --> 03:24:40,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I wasn't annoyed so much, but I just thought, OK, this is a reflection of reality as it represents itself in our society.

2133
03:24:40,515 --> 03:24:42,935
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, there's a reason for the gender pay gap.

2134
03:24:43,476 --> 03:24:47,177
[SPEAKER_26]: Potentially, I could have gone and said, well, I'm working some overtime.

2135
03:24:47,217 --> 03:24:48,777
[SPEAKER_26]: I should get paid for it.

2136
03:24:49,677 --> 03:24:51,218
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't look at it that way.

2137
03:24:51,278 --> 03:24:55,319
[SPEAKER_26]: I just thought, OK, I will just have to try to limit the overtime that I do.

2138
03:24:55,339 --> 03:24:58,640
[SPEAKER_26]: In retrospect, I probably should have.

2139
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:00,600
[SPEAKER_26]: asked for that.

2140
03:25:01,101 --> 03:25:01,841
[SPEAKER_54]: You're blaming yourself?

2141
03:25:01,941 --> 03:25:05,363
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not blaming myself in that sense.

2142
03:25:06,163 --> 03:25:15,168
[SPEAKER_26]: In a way, I think it's a good thing that people are not expected to work a lot of overtime because it's not good in terms of your private life, in terms of your family.

2143
03:25:15,569 --> 03:25:19,931
[SPEAKER_26]: But then again, a male should not be expected to do that either.

2144
03:25:20,831 --> 03:25:26,835
[SPEAKER_54]: And have you thought about maybe working out how much overtime you've been doing for the last few years and asking for back pay?

2145
03:25:28,015 --> 03:25:29,116
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I've not thought about that.

2146
03:25:30,074 --> 03:25:31,215
[SPEAKER_54]: That thought hadn't occurred to you?

2147
03:25:31,315 --> 03:25:32,636
[SPEAKER_26]: No, no, it hasn't.

2148
03:25:32,696 --> 03:25:33,096
[SPEAKER_26]: It hadn't.

2149
03:25:34,177 --> 03:25:35,498
[SPEAKER_54]: Are you going to now, I've suggested?

2150
03:25:38,721 --> 03:25:39,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably not.

2151
03:25:39,882 --> 03:25:40,462
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably not.

2152
03:25:40,802 --> 03:25:43,645
[SPEAKER_36]: I actually hadn't thought about back pay at all until now.

2153
03:25:43,725 --> 03:25:45,546
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's going to be quite big, isn't it?

2154
03:25:45,586 --> 03:25:48,168
[SPEAKER_36]: So companies could have been breaking the law before the review.

2155
03:25:48,228 --> 03:25:49,709
[SPEAKER_36]: So obviously money is going to be owed.

2156
03:25:49,729 --> 03:25:53,172
[SPEAKER_36]: That sounds good for workers, but perhaps quite expensive for businesses.

2157
03:25:53,623 --> 03:25:56,805
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes, and we were laughing in that clip, but it's not really a joke.

2158
03:25:57,426 --> 03:26:06,152
[SPEAKER_54]: When the UK tried something like this with local governments about 10 years ago, it led to claims for back pay from hundreds of women running into millions and millions of pounds.

2159
03:26:06,973 --> 03:26:14,758
[SPEAKER_54]: And I understand that legally this could be an issue in Iceland too, though to be honest, no one I spoke to about it over there seems very worried about it.

2160
03:26:15,899 --> 03:26:18,241
[SPEAKER_36]: But what's Iceland doing that's different in this case?

2161
03:26:18,261 --> 03:26:20,463
[SPEAKER_36]: Because you just mentioned a similar pay review in the UK.

2162
03:26:21,538 --> 03:26:30,361
[SPEAKER_54]: OK, so salary re-evaluations themselves are not new, but I think there are three things that make what's happening in Iceland different and special.

2163
03:26:39,304 --> 03:26:49,874
[SPEAKER_54]: Firstly, the fact that the work is laid out in a management standard, the equal pay standard, Una told me that by putting it in terms that businesses understand, it does make it easier for them to implement.

2164
03:26:50,735 --> 03:26:55,199
[SPEAKER_54]: And the standard has now been translated, so in theory it could be put in place by any company in the world.

2165
03:26:56,357 --> 03:27:07,722
[SPEAKER_54]: Secondly, after carrying out this equal pay work, the results are certified by an external body and then employers get a certificate to prove they do not discriminate and they can display a special logo on their websites.

2166
03:27:08,442 --> 03:27:10,663
[SPEAKER_54]: So India, this is the equal pay logo.

2167
03:27:11,642 --> 03:27:11,962
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, OK.

2168
03:27:12,342 --> 03:27:14,263
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is what they get if they've been certified.

2169
03:27:14,283 --> 03:27:20,245
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's a black and white, round image with bold lines crossing through it and curving through it.

2170
03:27:20,465 --> 03:27:20,685
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah.

2171
03:27:20,765 --> 03:27:22,585
[SPEAKER_36]: Sort of a bit like a stained glass window.

2172
03:27:22,665 --> 03:27:24,646
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, it does look a bit like a circular window.

2173
03:27:24,666 --> 03:27:30,568
[SPEAKER_54]: What it's supposed to be is two smiling faces, which are different but equal, that have been brought together.

2174
03:27:31,368 --> 03:27:33,808
[SPEAKER_54]: And it's also supposed to resemble a coin a little bit.

2175
03:27:34,109 --> 03:27:34,489
[SPEAKER_36]: That's clever.

2176
03:27:34,509 --> 03:27:36,829
[SPEAKER_36]: It's quite abstract, but I can see that, two different faces in it.

2177
03:27:37,389 --> 03:27:38,910
[SPEAKER_36]: So what's the third thing you mentioned, William?

2178
03:27:39,738 --> 03:27:41,920
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, so the third thing is actually the most significant.

2179
03:27:47,005 --> 03:27:53,670
[SPEAKER_54]: Earlier this year, the Icelandic government went a step further with all of this, and they made it mandatory for companies to implement the standard.

2180
03:27:54,351 --> 03:27:58,555
[SPEAKER_54]: So basically, they're going to be rolling it out over the next four years, starting in January.

2181
03:27:59,235 --> 03:28:02,238
[SPEAKER_54]: And if companies don't comply, they could get fined.

2182
03:28:02,579 --> 03:28:08,465
[SPEAKER_36]: OK, so it's a bit like going to the dentist, either you get a really lovely sticker for being very good or some sort of nasty pain in the face.

2183
03:28:09,906 --> 03:28:10,927
[SPEAKER_36]: How big are these fines?

2184
03:28:11,548 --> 03:28:15,692
[SPEAKER_54]: So the figure that's in the legislation is 50,000 Icelandic krona a day.

2185
03:28:16,132 --> 03:28:18,455
[SPEAKER_54]: So that's almost 500 US dollars.

2186
03:28:19,015 --> 03:28:22,438
[SPEAKER_54]: But my understanding is that the fines are going to be pretty much a last resort.

2187
03:28:23,099 --> 03:28:34,168
[SPEAKER_54]: There's also talk of specific targets, so, for example, companies will have to get their adjusted pay gap to under 3%, I also heard the figure 5%, or they'll get put on some kind of special measures.

2188
03:28:34,448 --> 03:28:35,829
[SPEAKER_36]: And how do businesses feel about it?

2189
03:28:36,349 --> 03:28:44,035
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, making it mandatory like this has been quite controversial, and not just with businesses, with the people that actually designed the standard in the first place.

2190
03:28:44,336 --> 03:28:45,697
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, why are they concerned about it, though?

2191
03:28:45,717 --> 03:28:46,938
[SPEAKER_36]: Because they made it.

2192
03:28:47,598 --> 03:28:56,411
[SPEAKER_54]: Well, the managing director of Icelandic standards told me that management standards are by definition voluntary and they don't generally contain sort of set targets like this.

2193
03:28:56,752 --> 03:28:58,194
[SPEAKER_54]: There's also practical concerns.

2194
03:28:58,374 --> 03:29:03,482
[SPEAKER_54]: So next year, about 150 companies, large companies in Iceland are going to need to be certified.

2195
03:29:03,862 --> 03:29:07,868
[SPEAKER_54]: And there's currently only two companies that can check that they're compliant.

2196
03:29:07,969 --> 03:29:09,731
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay, it's a lot of work then for two companies.

2197
03:29:09,851 --> 03:29:10,212
[SPEAKER_54]: Exactly.
