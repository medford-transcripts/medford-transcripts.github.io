[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for joining tonight in person and on Zoom.

25
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:55,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The action and discussion item for this committee meeting is 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innis Associates team.

26
00:11:56,908 --> 00:12:03,094
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our fourth meeting of this committee of the year, and it's also our fourth meeting on the neighborhood and urban residential

27
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: topic.

28
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:12,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that Innis Associates will be walking through kind of the progression of this topic that we've seen over the past couple months in their presentation just shortly.

29
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:19,511
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a nutshell, this is the part of our citywide... Sorry, I'm going to turn my volume up.

30
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I hear the fans coming on, this is the has my volume better.

31
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

32
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:36,248
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part of the city wide review of our community zoning in which we are looking at zoning and specifically residential districts.

33
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:56,338
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at everything from the lowest density districts in the city up to the highest density districts where we currently see the highest density for residential uses and also those areas where it makes sense to prioritize denser residential housing because of new T stations in the community.

34
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:04,723
[SPEAKER_06]: The goal of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal is to look at the areas of the city that are already residential and craft a

35
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:21,815
[SPEAKER_06]: updated and thoughtful proposal that responds to what is already there, what the geography and topography and characteristics dictate for what can go into each section of the city, and to create a more thoughtful gradient of housing options from the lowest density residential up to the highest density

36
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:22,896
[SPEAKER_06]: residential.

37
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:29,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been workshopping and iterating on this for the past, the three prior committee meetings.

38
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:36,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that Paola in just a minute is going to run us through kind of how this proposal has evolved over those past three meetings.

39
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,235
[SPEAKER_06]: What is new tonight, in my understanding, which we talked about last or two weeks ago,

40
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: is that now that we have revised the district map, that bird's eye view of what residential subdistrict could go where throughout the city, we're now going to take a closer look at dimensional standards.

41
00:13:56,717 --> 00:14:05,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are also going to look at different options for how to protect non-conforming structures in the potential updated residential subdistricts.

42
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:10,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're also going to talk a little bit about what comes after this phase of the project.

43
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, I will check and see if there are any counselors who have initial questions or comments up top.

44
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I will hand it over to Ines Associates for a presentation and we can take things from there.

45
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And as usual, we will take all public comment at the end of the meeting.

46
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So bear with us.

47
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:34,904
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, seeing none, happy to pass it over to Emily or Paola to walk us through our presentation.

48
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

49
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well.

50
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Good afternoon.

51
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Paula Ramos-Martinez.

52
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:47,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the senior planner at Innes Associates.

53
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:55,746
[SPEAKER_12]: With me today, we also have Emily Innes, director of Innes Associates, and Jimmy Rocha, and he's our spatial analyst.

54
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:00,868
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to start sharing the presentation.

55
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:18,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

56
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:37,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So today, there are some things that I'm going to try to go a little bit faster than the other times, because we have seen it several times.

57
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:45,756
[SPEAKER_12]: In any case, if somebody has any question, we can totally go back and explain a little bit more.

58
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will go through the timeline.

59
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,802
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the 2025 schedule?

60
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,306
[SPEAKER_12]: When we have that opportunities for more public comments.

61
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:08,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Some introduction and analysis that we have done towards these presentation and to analyze the residential districts.

62
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,920
[SPEAKER_12]: What which have been all the proposals that we have done and all the different iterations.

63
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,245
[SPEAKER_12]: and then the final updated proposal, and we will look at the first zoning draft.

64
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:32,915
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, at the end, we are very available for your Q and A. So today we are looking at the neighborhood and urban residential.

65
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:39,620
[SPEAKER_12]: We have done already, this is the fourth meeting talking about this topic.

66
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So

67
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,183
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the sorry, let's start a little bit.

68
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are all the permitting a plan permitting in committee meetings.

69
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:59,537
[SPEAKER_12]: that we have and all the different topics that we will talk about from January to May.

70
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:06,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we also have the CDB, the Community Development Boards, and when we will have those.

71
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:13,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have also the public Q&A moments that we are looking to have.

72
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,803
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had in February 10th, Salem Street.

73
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:22,325
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking to also have another public meeting on March.

74
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:29,128
[SPEAKER_12]: the dates that we are looking for, and these are optionals is March 20th and the March 27th.

75
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:39,311
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we will have another public Q and a in April to talk about the squares, and this will be in April, the 10th or the 29th.

76
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:46,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are some still we need to, uh, between the city us and city council when these dates would be, um

77
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:54,202
[SPEAKER_12]: better for all of us, but this we just wanted to show that we are looking into

78
00:17:56,655 --> 00:18:03,097
[SPEAKER_12]: into setting some dates already for people to know with enough time in advance.

79
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:11,400
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this we already have spoken about, so our 2025 schedule.

80
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:17,863
[SPEAKER_12]: There is only one thing that we are changing, and it's very specific.

81
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:21,904
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in the topics that are citywide, and it's our neighborhood notes.

82
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:24,585
[SPEAKER_12]: We have moved them to April.

83
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:34,588
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk more about the commercial districts, the mixed districts, we will also talk about this because it's the smallest scale of that commercial.

84
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will bring back those neighborhood notes in April.

85
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,690
[SPEAKER_12]: For the rest is very similar to what we had.

86
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,400
[SPEAKER_12]: So here we have all those opportunities for public comments.

87
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,443
[SPEAKER_12]: We have said that City Council is an opportunity for people to give their opinion.

88
00:18:53,804 --> 00:19:02,689
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have the Community Development Board, and then we also have again, the Community Development Board will vote on a topic and refer it back to City Council.

89
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:08,352
[SPEAKER_12]: And when it's back to City Council, it's another opportunity to hear the residents.

90
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:09,553
[SPEAKER_12]: opinions.

91
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,857
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now we are in City Council.

92
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:18,004
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still talking about the neighborhood, the residential districts.

93
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:24,292
[SPEAKER_12]: And once we have more updated the next public meetings, we will also place them in here.

94
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:38,534
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have already talked, and the president, colleagues, you have talked about what are we doing here.

95
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:46,521
[SPEAKER_12]: We are updating the zoning according to what came from the comprehensive plan that was released in January 2023.

96
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:52,606
[SPEAKER_12]: These are some of the different goals and objectives that the plan had.

97
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,888
[SPEAKER_12]: and we are looking at all of these.

98
00:19:55,908 --> 00:20:01,389
[SPEAKER_12]: These are referring to housing, and so we are looking at all of this to bring into your zoning.

99
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:13,792
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the vision map, and so we are looking at all the corridors, the squares, transformational areas, nodes, and all the residential districts from low to higher density.

100
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:22,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So from here, we are building on top of the zoning built on the comprehensive plan and from this idea.

101
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:37,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So a lot of the different maps that we use to build up our residential districts, I'm just going to go through them very quick, but your current zoning will be something that we look at.

102
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:43,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Your transit system, all the non-residential districts.

103
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are those?

104
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:59,808
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the corridors, squares, institutional and special districts that we have and how they relate to the residential, all the different building types, residential building types of single family, two family and where are those as well as dimensions.

105
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:08,373
[SPEAKER_12]: and a lot of others, but some, those are, let's say, the most important for what we are doing now.

106
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,436
[SPEAKER_12]: So in here is just what are we considering.

107
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:29,067
[SPEAKER_12]: So is that proximity to highly frequent and efficient public transit, proximity to higher job density areas, which is the map that we have here on the right, the lot sizes and the topography, existing residential types, and then the transitions between those low and medium density areas.

108
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a lot of proposals.

109
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:37,633
[SPEAKER_12]: We have, this is the version one, then we amended, we had a new proposal.

110
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:45,134
[SPEAKER_12]: This was the amended proposal number three with the neighborhood and the urban, and this is the final draft.

111
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,155
[SPEAKER_12]: So we changed the colors.

112
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:48,795
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that it's something different.

113
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,536
[SPEAKER_12]: We just heard that it was a bit confusing.

114
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:59,578
[SPEAKER_12]: We were using the yellow color palette because that's the residential color that is used for residential use.

115
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,379
[SPEAKER_12]: But in this way, we understand that it's more identifiable.

116
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:22,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have the only changes that were done was to extend urban residential one to the south of Ball Square, the T station, and to the west of that site for the rest was pretty much keeping the same.

117
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:39,181
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is what we try to do always, which is where are these new districts and how they overlay in the building types that you have and currently are existing.

118
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,943
[SPEAKER_12]: These I'm not going to talk about.

119
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:51,925
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm thinking if we stop here or if I just continue with the presentation.

120
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

121
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:59,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Paola, thank you for that, for the introduction to how the proposal maps have changed over the past three meetings.

122
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:14,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to highlight two things that I don't want to get lost in the discussion, or things that I want to clarify, you're saying that the only change for the Proposal 4 map from Proposal 3, which we looked at two weeks ago, is that the UR1, Urban Residential 1 subdistrict,

123
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,053
[SPEAKER_06]: now extends closer to Ball Square.

124
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:18,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And the colors have changed.

125
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:24,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in response to feedback that the different shades of yellow were just really hard to parse, hard for people to tell what was different.

126
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:28,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people are seeing a new teal or green on the map, that's not a new sub-district.

127
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:33,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a new, more contrasting color for the same sub-district as we were looking at before.

128
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:37,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I capture the part about Ball Square sub-district correctly?

129
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:37,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's perfect.

130
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:38,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

131
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:39,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

132
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:41,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also just want to I forgot to say this up top.

133
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:53,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it's my understanding that this also has not changed from the original version of the proposal that when we're talking about these residential sub districts, the maximum by right height for all residential sub districts is three stories.

134
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:55,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's correct.

135
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

136
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:59,465
[SPEAKER_12]: We will go through the draft, but yes, thank you.

137
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:17,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so we got some concerns about the typologies that we had and just we wanted to just make sure that everybody understands when we have those residential typologies.

138
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,314
[SPEAKER_12]: What are those?

139
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:19,575
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we talking about?

140
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:25,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And why we use the detach attach, um, definitions.

141
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:26,260
[SPEAKER_12]: So very quickly.

142
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just I just wanted to explain that.

143
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:37,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we talk about detached is that the building is not touching any of the lot lines.

144
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:40,130
[SPEAKER_12]: That's basically what detached means.

145
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:47,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So the building, the principal building, it's going to be on the lot, and there are going to be setbacks that are going to be bigger than zero.

146
00:24:49,215 --> 00:25:00,318
[SPEAKER_12]: When we have one of that lot lines, the building is touching one of those lot lines and is connected to the building that is on the other lot.

147
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,838
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what we call semi-detached.

148
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:09,780
[SPEAKER_12]: They share a wall, but each building and each principal building is standing on one different lot.

149
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,404
[SPEAKER_12]: And attach is when they share both walls.

150
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:16,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is as well.

151
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:19,628
[SPEAKER_12]: One principal building, one lot.

152
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:29,295
[SPEAKER_12]: They are not all in the same lot because we have, and maybe I explain it better like this.

153
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:32,117
[SPEAKER_12]: So one unit dwelling detached.

154
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:39,443
[SPEAKER_12]: It means that you have one, in one lot, you're going to have one unit.

155
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:51,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't matter how that is, the shape of the building, it's one lot, one unit, and you have setbacks that are bigger than zero.

156
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:59,118
[SPEAKER_12]: If we go to two-unit dwelling detached, it means that in one lot, you have two units.

157
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:05,381
[SPEAKER_12]: And that building can be attached one next to the other.

158
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,823
[SPEAKER_12]: One unit is above the other.

159
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:12,565
[SPEAKER_12]: One unit is fronting the street, and the other is in the rear.

160
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:14,526
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

161
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:16,947
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one lot, two units.

162
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:21,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the principal building can be as divided as they want.

163
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:29,504
[SPEAKER_12]: three-unit dwelling detached, this is the same, but instead of two units, it's a three.

164
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:32,305
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't mind how these three units are divided.

165
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:39,108
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in the same principal building, and it's one lot, three units.

166
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:45,550
[SPEAKER_12]: So it can be the type of triple-decker, or it can be just a big house that has been divided into three units.

167
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:56,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Multiplex, in this case, we talk about building units of the principal building contains four to six units.

168
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:04,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And here again, we have one lot and then four to six units depend on the principal building.

169
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:22,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we say one unit dwelling attached, and we call it also row house, this is the typology, the building type where we have one unit per lot.

170
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,488
[SPEAKER_12]: and they are attached to the next one.

171
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:31,571
[SPEAKER_12]: But as you can see, in every lot, we will have one unit.

172
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are still talking about one unit dwelling.

173
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:35,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Here, we don't have two.

174
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:36,653
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not three.

175
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:38,034
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not all on the same lot.

176
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:43,636
[SPEAKER_12]: It's each of these are divided, and each one of these has its own lot.

177
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,258
[SPEAKER_12]: They will have their private garden, their backyard.

178
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,038
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't share.

179
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,464
[SPEAKER_12]: They have each one of them their own.

180
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:55,521
[SPEAKER_12]: So their side-to-side back for the one in the middle would be zero for both.

181
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:02,681
[SPEAKER_12]: When we have a townhouse is when this is a multifamily building.

182
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:09,723
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one lot, and they just represent the statics of a row house, but they are all in one lot.

183
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:17,545
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are talking about, for example, if we have three together, it would be one lot, but we have three units.

184
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:21,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is basically the difference in zoning for attach and detach.

185
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:31,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry if this is a little bit too dry, but hopefully that helps with the examples.

186
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:36,976
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I want to go to the draft.

187
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:44,520
[SPEAKER_12]: And so going very quickly, just if you have questions again, let me know.

188
00:28:44,960 --> 00:29:06,030
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to amend section 94.2.1, Division into District, amend section 94.3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, Dimensional Standards, 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, Table B, and then amend the 94.12.0, Definitions.

189
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:26,857
[SPEAKER_12]: So the neighborhood, the new division into district, we will have Neighborhood Residential 1, the classification is residential, NR1, Neighborhood Residential 2, abbreviation NR2, Neighborhood Residential 3, NR3, Urban Residential 1, UR1, and Urban Residential 2, UR2.

190
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:35,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

191
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:37,924
[SPEAKER_12]: On the uses.

192
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:41,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to talk about the detached one unit dwelling.

193
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:49,648
[SPEAKER_12]: This is your typical single family, um, will be allowed in and are 123 and not allowed in.

194
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,468
[SPEAKER_12]: You are one and two.

195
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:54,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Attached one unit dwelling.

196
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:55,209
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be

197
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, NR3, UR1, and UR2.

198
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:09,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Detached to unit dwelling.

199
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:12,424
[SPEAKER_12]: This is your typical duplex that is in one lot.

200
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:17,846
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to not be allowed in NR1, but it is allowed in NR2.

201
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:22,509
[SPEAKER_12]: and then in three, you are one and you are two.

202
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:31,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Multiplex are not allowed in NR1, 2, and 3, and they are allowed in UR1 and UR2.

203
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Multiple dwelling when they are bigger than six, they are not going to be allowed in NR1, 2, 3,

204
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:40,258
[SPEAKER_12]: and you are one.

205
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:41,959
[SPEAKER_12]: They're only allowed in.

206
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,059
[SPEAKER_12]: You are too.

207
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:46,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to go through those typologies.

208
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Um and so we had the table of uses.

209
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:54,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Let us know if there is any use that you would like to talk about.

210
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

211
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to recognize

212
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:10,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bit of a cold, which is why I'm not there in person.

213
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:23,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that the audio in the chambers doesn't make me completely beyond comprehension.

214
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:25,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it.

215
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

216
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking through these use tables and the proposed maps,

217
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:43,169
[SPEAKER_02]: What ADUs were allowed in accessory dwelling units was a little bit unclear to me.

218
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:48,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Are ADUs going to be discussed later?

219
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:59,602
[SPEAKER_02]: on and is there sort of like differences in where ADUs are allowed for each one of these different types of residential uses?

220
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:05,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, and is that kind of like its own separate table?

221
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just like looking through, I was trying to get some clarity on the ADUs situation and I wasn't really finding it.

222
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:15,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Paola.

223
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:16,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, if I may.

224
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so we are talking about that.

225
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:31,593
[SPEAKER_12]: This week, we were going through, and I have them here, the final state law, the published law, and then the

226
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:41,119
[SPEAKER_12]: the section 94-8.2 accessory dwelling units that Medfair has in their zoning.

227
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:55,826
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to first update the ADU zoning, which we were expecting to have it quite soon, I hope next week.

228
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:59,207
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the next meeting, we can talk about it and we can bring it.

229
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are not a lot of changes, but there are some that needs to be updated to be within your law.

230
00:33:09,174 --> 00:33:15,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we want to do after that is to bring into the accessory uses the ADU use.

231
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:23,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you will have it in the table and you can see very clearly if it is allowed or not, depending on which district.

232
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:27,927
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this moment, the law states that

233
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:33,570
[SPEAKER_12]: only in single family districts.

234
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is any district that has that use allowed.

235
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:43,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So it doesn't have to be exclusive single family, but it can be any residential district that allows single family.

236
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:49,075
[SPEAKER_12]: It's where you have to give that right of the ADUs.

237
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,636
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is a protected use.

238
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,881
[SPEAKER_12]: If there is no single family in that district, you don't have to do it.

239
00:33:55,381 --> 00:34:02,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we follow that idea, it will mean that in our

240
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:18,130
[SPEAKER_12]: in our proposal in the residential districts, you would have NR1, NR2, and NR3, as all of the three contain the detached one-unit dwelling as a yes.

241
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:26,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Then all those three by right could have the ADU.

242
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:32,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you are one and you are two, by state law, they don't have to.

243
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,446
[SPEAKER_12]: by right have the ADUs.

244
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:44,793
[SPEAKER_12]: That is up to us to decide for everyone here to decide if that's something we want to also include them.

245
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be okay.

246
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,876
[SPEAKER_12]: That is not going against the law.

247
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:54,060
[SPEAKER_12]: You can have in all of them be able to have an ADU.

248
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:56,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

249
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

250
00:34:58,812 --> 00:34:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

251
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:02,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the for the clarification.

252
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:02,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

253
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:12,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was seeing 80 you mentioned on some of the proposed residential zoning maps, like single unit dwelling plus 80 you under.

254
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:17,813
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 2, 1, 2, and 3.

255
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:27,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was unclear to me if ADUs, from looking at that, if ADUs were allowed on two or three unit dwellings.

256
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like those are still all on the table and will be discussed next week.

257
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:38,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's going to be a topic of later discussion, I'm happy to just move on.

258
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:46,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so in NR1, 2, and 3, we need to follow the state law.

259
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:55,127
[SPEAKER_12]: So in those, you have to permit the ADUs.

260
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:59,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So in NR1, is it only single-unit dwellings that can have ADUs?

261
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:06,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is a two-unit dwelling allowed to have an additional ADU as well?

262
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:17,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So in any district that has single family, you can have an ADU.

263
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:29,900
[SPEAKER_12]: We will need to, we need some legal advice, but what we think is that any principal building can have an ADU.

264
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And that means that a two unit and a three unit could have one ADU by right.

265
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:38,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And the second would be by special permit.

266
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right, that clarifies it.

267
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:43,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you very much.

268
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:58,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and I see Attorney Silverstein, who's working on this project on Zoom, I'll recognize you as well.

269
00:36:58,876 --> 00:36:59,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

270
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:03,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to answer that question, the way that the

271
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:20,976
[SPEAKER_17]: regulations have been promulgated by the executive office of housing and local communities is that an ADU can be allowed or is allowed by right in any single family district.

272
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:30,178
[SPEAKER_17]: And a single family district is any zoning district in which a single family home is an allowed use either by right or by special permit.

273
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:38,977
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're in a district that allows single family residences by right or by special permit, you have to allow an ADU.

274
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:48,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the ADU is accessory to a principal dwelling.

275
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:54,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And a principal dwelling is a structure that has at least one dwelling unit.

276
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:59,647
[SPEAKER_17]: So the way that the state has promulgated the regulations is that

277
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:17,671
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have an ADU on the same premises as a residential building that has one or more dwelling units in a single family residential zoning district, then the ADU is allowed by right.

278
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:24,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

279
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:26,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that guidance, Attorney Silverstein.

280
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:26,719
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

281
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemming, do you have more on that topic?

282
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:31,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that satisfy your question?

283
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.

284
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, from what they're explaining, if

285
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:52,986
[SPEAKER_02]: If a single unit dwelling is allowed in a given district, then any principal unit in that district also has to be able to have an ADU by right.

286
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:55,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what you're saying.

287
00:38:55,367 --> 00:39:03,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's in like an urban residential, which doesn't allow single family homes, then you're not necessarily required to allow ADUs.

288
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:15,931
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not you get a second ADU would be up to the Community Development Board in any case.

289
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that an accurate summary?

290
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:24,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

291
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:33,024
[SPEAKER_17]: That is the rule as set forth in the HLC regulations.

292
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it, just for one further clarification,

293
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:48,712
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're allowed one ADU, like if the zoning says you're allowed one ADU, is there any place in the zoning where you can say, no, you're not allowed a second ADU, even with a special permit?

294
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you allow one ADU, do you have to allow for the possibility of a second ADU?

295
00:39:55,354 --> 00:40:07,056
[SPEAKER_17]: So the statute says that for more than one ADU in a single family residential zoning district, quote, there shall be a special permit.

296
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:30,307
[SPEAKER_17]: The HLC regulations actually suggest that a community does not have to allow more than one by special permit, and the regulations say that if a community chooses to allow more than one, then that is by special permit.

297
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be honest.

298
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:37,215
[SPEAKER_17]: don't necessarily agree with that interpretation.

299
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:55,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how the HLC regulations that suggest this is optional can be melded with the language in the statute that says there shall be a special permit for more than one.

300
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,112
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know, obviously that this is

301
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:05,939
[SPEAKER_17]: one among several ambiguities in the statute that are going to have to be decided by courts at some point.

302
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

303
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the permit granting body always the Community Development Board or can it be some other body within the city?

304
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:26,704
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, the statute doesn't say who the special permit granting authority is.

305
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:29,125
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be CBA, it could be

306
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,308
[SPEAKER_17]: planning board or in Medford, the Community Development Board, it can be the council, but it just says there shall be a special permit.

307
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, could that be like the staff level?

308
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:51,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Likely not because of the definition of special permit grading.

309
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:59,780
[SPEAKER_17]: It's already in the Zoning Act, which is pretty much limited to the council, ZBA or planning board.

310
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:01,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

311
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:03,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

312
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies for the extended questioning.

313
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand we are going to get deeper into the ADU's discussion in two weeks, as Paula mentioned.

314
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:12,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's very helpful.

315
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:16,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for the legal guidance, Attorney Silverstein.

316
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:28,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for the purposes of this proposal, we could probably put a pin in that discussion for now, but really appreciate the clarity on how it relates to the districts in this proposal where single family homes

317
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,476
[SPEAKER_06]: are allowed by rightness.

318
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any by special permit in this table currently.

319
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:40,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

320
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you.

321
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:45,044
[SPEAKER_12]: So now in the section 94-4.1, we have

322
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:55,234
[SPEAKER_12]: the table of dimensional requirements, they will be by incorporating the following table.

323
00:42:56,555 --> 00:42:58,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we have all the dimensional standards.

324
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:04,178
[SPEAKER_12]: So the lot area minimum, the frontage minimum, facade build out, residential density.

325
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:05,679
[SPEAKER_12]: And here we have

326
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:15,990
[SPEAKER_12]: minimum, maximum that we wanted to have, and then a subsection, it will be the historical conversion that works a little bit different.

327
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:25,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So the residential density in NR1 is one unit, NR2 goes from one to two units, NR3, one to three.

328
00:43:25,621 --> 00:43:27,243
[SPEAKER_12]: You are one from two to six.

329
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:40,257
[SPEAKER_12]: And you are to it goes from two, and there is not a maximum there is no cap on the, on the maximum historical conversion we have.

330
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:45,593
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are here having only the maximums for NR1.

331
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,914
[SPEAKER_12]: We are doing an increase in one unit.

332
00:43:47,994 --> 00:43:53,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So in NR1 will be two units, NR2, three units, NR3, four units.

333
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:58,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the urban residential, we don't have a unit density limit.

334
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:02,239
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be depending on the square footage of those houses.

335
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:06,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we do require is that the minimum area per unit

336
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,842
[SPEAKER_12]: is at least 900 square feet.

337
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:14,449
[SPEAKER_12]: So those will be the regulations for the density.

338
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:22,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Now ADUs in here, and I will just say that very quickly, by the state law

339
00:44:25,157 --> 00:44:26,058
[SPEAKER_12]: We have it here.

340
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:31,641
[SPEAKER_12]: It says protected use ADUs shall not be counted in any density calculations.

341
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:38,205
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there is an ADU, so that is another unit, it doesn't count here for the residential density.

342
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:41,066
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be in the table of use.

343
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:43,828
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's allowed, then it's allowed.

344
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:47,450
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't have to do with the maximum densities that we have here.

345
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,672
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be apart from this.

346
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:58,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Maximum heights we have for NR1 2.5, NR2 2.5, and then the rest of them is always three stories.

347
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:13,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Setbacks, we have some changes, NR1, NR2 have the front 15 feet, side seven and a half, and then the rear will be 15.

348
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,919
[SPEAKER_12]: In NR3 is 10 front, 5 on the side, and rear 15.

349
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Your 1 is 10 front, again 5 side, but the rear is 10, and your 2 same.

350
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:24,588
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 on the front side, 5 rear, 10.

351
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we have the building coverage.

352
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:43,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Green score will only apply in UR2 because of the, is where we have the multifamily, more than six units.

353
00:45:44,895 --> 00:45:47,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's where it will only apply.

354
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:52,921
[SPEAKER_12]: For the rest, applies the pervious surface minimum and an open space landscape.

355
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:59,388
[SPEAKER_12]: The open space landscape, it is already a pervious surface, I have the definitions.

356
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:08,899
[SPEAKER_12]: So, these 20% of open space landscape it's, it doesn't add to the pervious surface is within the pervious surface.

357
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:26,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we add the definitions of historic conversion, multiplex, then pervious surface, a surface that allow water to infiltrate the soil beneath it, also known as permeable surface, and open space landscape, open space design and planted for pleasing appearance with trees, shrubs, ground covering grass.

358
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:33,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Such a space may not include lot area used for parking, loading, access drives, other areas with hard surface.

359
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:35,906
[SPEAKER_12]: or usable open space.

360
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:43,252
[SPEAKER_12]: So those areas just to make sure that the pervious surface will have a minimum that will be a green area.

361
00:46:45,073 --> 00:46:51,778
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is for now the final, yeah, the end of the draft.

362
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:56,261
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking into, for the UR2, we need the...

363
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:03,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, the standards, development standards for multifamily.

364
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is something we will bring also on the next in two weeks.

365
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:14,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much for that overview.

366
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:21,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exciting to see the two months of discussions distilled into a couple of organized tables.

367
00:47:21,223 --> 00:47:22,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that clarity.

368
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:25,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have another section to the presentation that we're talking about tonight.

369
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:29,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we move on to that, are there any further questions from councillors?

370
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:33,709
[SPEAKER_06]: on the dimensional requirements or any of the new, we'd say new definitions.

371
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,952
[SPEAKER_06]: These are topics that we were talking about throughout this process and are also present.

372
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:44,279
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, have been present for a long time, but any questions on the definitions and dimensionals presented tonight?

373
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:45,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll recognize President Behrs.

374
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:46,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

375
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:53,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And sorry if this isn't the next section, but if you guys talk a little bit about the

376
00:47:55,453 --> 00:47:59,517
[SPEAKER_18]: protection for single families in the UR1 and UR2 districts.

377
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:08,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfectly teed up the next section of the presentation.

378
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you very much again for the record Emily and us and then as associates.

379
00:48:16,662 --> 00:48:28,148
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard it the last time that there were people who were concerned about having single family, not be allowed as a right in the urban districts.

380
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:45,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we wanted to do was go back and see what the protections in your existing bylaw were for non conforming uses and then see if there was anything else that we needed to add to that so I did check your existing ordinance.

381
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it actually it had almost everything that I was looking for.

382
00:48:50,181 --> 00:49:03,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to have a conversation with Attorney Silverstein, just to make sure that you know from a legal perspective I am reading the non conforming regulations the way that they are intended to be read.

383
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:23,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what we are looking to see what we are looking to make sure is that somebody who has a non conforming use like a single family home in this district if this passes is still able to invest in it is still able to do improvements such as you know a porch or a deck or an addition.

384
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:28,687
[SPEAKER_07]: without having to be overly burdened by a permitting process.

385
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:50,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially what your regulations state now is that if you are not increasing the existing non-conformity, so for example, say your single family home is non-conforming because of the dimensional regulation and you're not increasing that, then you would not have to go through the variance process.

386
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:53,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, and there are some exceptions.

387
00:49:53,648 --> 00:50:01,551
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, if the lot size, which has nothing to do with the building, uh, is an issue, um, then there's an exception already built in your zoning for that.

388
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:13,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to check with, uh, Attorney Silverstein if we also need to make a specific exception for a single-family house in a, um, uh, an area where it's not allowed as a right.

389
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:19,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But in fact, under state law, there are existing protections for single-family and two-family houses.

390
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:42,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going to have a conversation with him but I think I can confirm that your ordinance is already on the right track track and if we need to make any additional tweaks we can suggest those, but I based on that I was not initially concerned that the people who have existing single family homes in these districts would be unduly burdened by this change.

391
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much for looking at the current ordinance to see if the protections that we'd want to make sure are present under the new zoning, if those still apply to the current zoning.

392
00:51:00,129 --> 00:51:01,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to hear that.

393
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:16,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like we won't have to make many, if any, further tweaks to make sure that if, should the noose of districts be approved, and this goes into effect, that people who live in existing single family homes in districts where maybe single family homes, new ones will not be allowed by right,

394
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:27,798
[SPEAKER_06]: will not suffer, you know, a burdensome and onerous and inconvenient permitting process when they want to make the kind of improvements to their homes that anybody should be able to do.

395
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to hear.

396
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:30,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

397
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Any additional questions on that point, President Behrs or other councilors?

398
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:38,982
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

399
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none.

400
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:43,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

401
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:52,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have before us the updated draft zoning proposal for the neighborhood and urban residential.

402
00:51:53,421 --> 00:52:15,278
[SPEAKER_06]: We ran through the zoning map that the text describes, the updated zoning map, the dimensional requirements, had a discussion about how that affects ADUs, and we know that at our next meeting in two weeks, we're gonna dive in a little bit deeper on the ADU issue, kind of a citywide approach, not specific to this proposal.

403
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:25,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll also hear a little bit more about development standards for multifamily buildings in that one highest density residential subdistrict, UR2.

404
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:30,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have that to look forward to.

405
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:46,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that next phase of our process will also dovetail with us starting to get a little bit deeper into a kind of shifting out of residential sub districts for the moment, talking more about a commercial framework.

406
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:55,402
[SPEAKER_06]: which will guide our discussions later in the spring about the more commercial areas of the city, some additional corridors, squares.

407
00:52:55,462 --> 00:52:57,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people are eager for us to talk about Medford Square.

408
00:52:57,904 --> 00:53:06,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working hard to make sure that that conversation dovetails with the other work, RFP, other consultant work that's been in the works around Medford Square.

409
00:53:06,088 --> 00:53:13,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a lot coming up on the pipeline as folks, so on the timeline earlier in the process.

410
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:15,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll recognize President Behrs.

411
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:17,972
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Chair Collins.

412
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:38,087
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think just to add to that point, specifically, we're going to be talking commercial framework, Medford Square, West Medford Square, Wellington, Glenwood, and we're especially going to be talking about the Tufts Institutional District and Boston Ave and Main Street.

413
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:44,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And those are, I think I did those out of order, but those are the four remaining topics.

414
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:47,835
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

415
00:53:55,238 --> 00:53:59,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I will run through that timeline one more time before we adjourn tonight.

416
00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:13,330
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we kind of give that overview and move to public comment, I wanted to ask if there are any motions on the proposal before us, any additional questions or comments from councilors.

417
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:23,177
[SPEAKER_06]: As we all know, but just to reiterate it, this is kind of the long first or second step in the zoning amendment process, depending on how you want to look at it.

418
00:54:25,118 --> 00:54:27,420
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our fourth meeting on this proposal.

419
00:54:28,722 --> 00:54:38,810
[SPEAKER_06]: After a new zoning or zoning amendment is referred out of this committee, it is then referred by the City Council to the Community Development Board for public hearings, one or more, where there may be more public comment.

420
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:48,719
[SPEAKER_06]: We are working with the zoning consultant and city staff to make sure that we host another public Q&A session for this proposal before the CBP public hearing or hearings on it.

421
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:51,365
[SPEAKER_06]: like we did for the Salem Street corridor.

422
00:54:51,385 --> 00:55:00,972
[SPEAKER_06]: After review by the CDB and it puts forward its recommendations, it will then come back to the city council for another public meeting where we will take a vote on it.

423
00:55:00,992 --> 00:55:05,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's again, just to like to say it at least once every meeting is the process that all zoning has to go through.

424
00:55:05,455 --> 00:55:12,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot of moving parts, but we really do hope that everybody participates in as many pieces of that process as they can and want to.

425
00:55:21,656 --> 00:55:23,617
[SPEAKER_18]: just to clarify for me as well.

426
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:28,319
[SPEAKER_18]: The next meeting of this committee, we're going to be talking about the commercial framework.

427
00:55:33,102 --> 00:55:34,263
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing the commercial framework.

428
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:36,484
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to kick off the commercial framework at the next meeting.

429
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:37,284
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

430
00:55:37,345 --> 00:55:38,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that's right.

431
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So we should be moving together.

432
00:55:39,826 --> 00:55:40,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

433
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:40,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

434
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:44,809
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll make that motion and then we should hear from everybody.

435
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:46,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

436
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll make a motion to refer this to the regular meeting.

437
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but we should certainly do public participation before we take any votes.

438
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:55,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

439
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:01,963
[SPEAKER_18]: And one, one other question.

440
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:02,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

441
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:06,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you guys are going to look at the comments from the building commissioner.

442
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:14,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

443
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:21,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing no further comments or questions from councilors, we'll go now to public participation on this proposal.

444
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:25,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

445
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:30,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody will have three minutes to state comments or ask questions.

446
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:39,848
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are questions, you can then bundle them and have the zoning consultants or city staff or councilors respond to them at the end of all public comment as appropriate.

447
00:56:41,238 --> 00:56:43,240
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll start on Zoom.

448
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:46,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

449
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,807
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Zachary Chartalk, 5 Allmont Street.

450
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,971
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to clarify the documents and the updated maps.

451
00:56:55,051 --> 00:57:02,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Will those be, including the proposal maps, will those be made publicly available and accessible online and in person shortly to reflect any updates and changes?

452
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:05,241
[SPEAKER_19]: There's been inconsistency with that in the past.

453
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:09,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

454
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: They're available on Civiclerk right now.

455
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:13,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put the link in the chat.

456
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:20,847
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

457
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:23,628
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the floor if you have any other questions for us tonight, Zachary.

458
00:57:24,148 --> 00:57:24,848
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all for now.

459
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:25,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

460
00:57:26,248 --> 00:57:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

461
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:34,010
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

462
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thanks for moving that, Paolo.

463
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:41,288
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Gaston, please go ahead.

464
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:42,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

465
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:45,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

466
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stingley Road.

467
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I just got two questions.

468
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:58,863
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one is on page four, under section C, open recreational and agricultural uses, item three, exempt agriculture.

469
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,144
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that mean?

470
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:03,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

471
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:04,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we do.

472
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:13,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to pass the mic.

473
00:58:13,562 --> 00:58:14,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I can stand up.

474
00:58:14,943 --> 00:58:24,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Under Mass General Laws 40A, Section 3, commercial agriculture is exempt from zoning restrictions or most zoning restrictions.

475
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually look at that section, there are a number of exempt uses under that.

476
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:34,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are usually put in the table of uses as exempt uses.

477
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:34,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's called out.

478
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:40,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Some communities also allow what would be called non-exempt agriculture.

479
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:42,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So we usually make a differentiation.

480
00:58:42,568 --> 00:58:45,793
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's when you refer to exempt agriculture, that's what it means.

481
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the section three.

482
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:50,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

483
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Non-exempt agriculture just means that it's an agricultural use that doesn't meet the requirements to be exempt agriculture.

484
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:00,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's dimensional requirements.

485
00:59:00,534 --> 00:59:01,995
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an acreage requirement.

486
00:59:02,396 --> 00:59:07,940
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a requirement for the number, the amount that you grow or sell in a year.

487
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the first very long paragraph of that section.

488
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah.

489
00:59:16,327 --> 00:59:31,452
[SPEAKER_15]: And the second question was related to the surface is, is there going to be a minimum permeability rating or something that would qualify as a perfect surface or a one go about that.

490
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:35,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, that's a great question.

491
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:37,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will appear on our standards.

492
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So next week, next meeting, we will bring that.

493
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:50,369
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is only the definition, but we will attach to this also the standards of what is actually permeable surface and how that is rated.

494
00:59:53,754 --> 01:00:02,262
[SPEAKER_15]: actually, the last one is so on open space landscape when it says such space may not include it means that it does not include parking etc.

495
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, perfect.

496
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:03,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

497
01:00:03,903 --> 01:00:05,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your questions.

498
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:09,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, we'll go back to Zachary.

499
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:11,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a new hand and not an old hand.

500
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:15,214
[SPEAKER_19]: I have Zach Zachary char talk five almost straight I'm trying to

501
01:00:17,308 --> 01:00:19,869
[SPEAKER_19]: do different hand raises for questions so I don't hog the mic here.

502
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:27,110
[SPEAKER_19]: But going back to when the original meeting schedule was gone through, I just want a clarification because I couldn't quite find it.

503
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:38,093
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like in that original schedule outline that any upcoming public Q&A that's scheduled for Salem Street and a couple of others are going to extend after the city council vote on March 11th.

504
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:44,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Are those intended for participatory for review or just purely for public disclosure on what's already been decided?

505
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:48,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

506
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had the public q&a.

507
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:56,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just to state up top the we've been updating the timelines as we've been going along.

508
01:00:57,227 --> 01:01:01,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're referring to a timeline from a past meeting packet, it's probably not.

509
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:05,270
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm actually talking about the one that Paula went through at the beginning of the presentation tonight.

510
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:07,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

511
01:01:07,266 --> 01:01:08,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

512
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:26,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Our intent with the public Q and A's is for that to kind of be slotted in between the city council committee creation of the proposal before the CDB holds public hearings on it to create an additional chance for public comment before it's referred out of the CDB and back to the city council for a vote.

513
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:34,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So an opportunity for comment for Q and A is before the zoning proposal is referred back to the city council for a vote to ordain.

514
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:42,874
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to simplify that, that's intended to invoke the CD board for continued public participation.

515
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:58,723
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically if there's any meetings regarding something that extends past the vote that's planned for March 11th on the current agenda, that that would make the March 11th meeting non-binding because there are extra sessions that go beyond it.

516
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:04,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the public Q&A is not, it is not a function of the CD board.

517
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go to President Behrs to respond to this.

518
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:09,936
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no further proposed public Q&A on the Salem Street.

519
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:16,340
[SPEAKER_18]: The Salem Street public Q&A was dated as February 10th, because that's when we had it at the Roberts School.

520
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:26,305
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what Vice President Collins is describing is that essentially these planning and permitting committee meetings are to develop a draft

521
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:34,842
[SPEAKER_18]: That draft is then referred to the Community Development Board, which is when the official public hearing process required by state law for zoning occurs.

522
01:02:35,442 --> 01:02:39,163
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have a public hearing in the Community Development Board and then a public hearing of the council.

523
01:02:39,683 --> 01:02:56,108
[SPEAKER_18]: We are creating this public Q&A meeting in addition to, it's outside of the legal process, but it occurs between the referral of this to the initial referral of a proposal drafted by the Planning and Permitting Committee to the Community Development Board

524
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,962
[SPEAKER_18]: and the first hearing of the Community Development Board.

525
01:02:59,502 --> 01:03:01,784
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've already had the Q&A for Salem Street.

526
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:04,807
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no further Q&As planned.

527
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:19,739
[SPEAKER_18]: The next Q&As are planned for a March Q&A regarding the residential proposals we're discussing tonight, and an April Q&A for at least some of the commercial proposals we intend to start discussing next meeting.

528
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

529
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognize Director Hunt at the microphone as well, then we'll go back to you, Zachary.

530
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:31,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, I just want to be clear, just because there's a date throwing around that there isn't actually a meeting scheduled for.

531
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:39,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So the CD board has continued their hearing on the Salem Street proposal to March 5, that is a public hearing.

532
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there will be

533
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:45,733
[SPEAKER_08]: public comment can be taken during that meeting.

534
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:57,198
[SPEAKER_08]: It is anticipated that the city board is likely to close their hearing on March 5th and refer that back to the City Council and give their recommendations to the City Council.

535
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:01,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know actually when the City Council continued their Salem Street 2.

536
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:03,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps that's the March 11th.

537
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:04,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the March 11th date.

538
01:04:05,402 --> 01:04:15,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so if the city board meeting, the board closes on March 5th, which is, I anticipate they will, although they're a public board and I don't tell them what to do.

539
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:20,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just sort of thinking about how what they know and what they don't know.

540
01:04:21,726 --> 01:04:25,427
[SPEAKER_08]: If they close, then they'll refer it to the city council for their hearing on March 11.

541
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:27,549
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't, it could go longer.

542
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:33,075
[SPEAKER_08]: The public meetings, Q&As that are scheduled are on different topics.

543
01:04:34,056 --> 01:04:35,677
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to be very clear about that.

544
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:41,904
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that was why I asked, because it wasn't clear from the glance over, and I couldn't find it in the documentation.

545
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:42,405
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

546
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:45,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

547
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:46,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the clarifying question.

548
01:04:49,872 --> 01:04:52,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I see no further hands raised on Zoom.

549
01:04:53,115 --> 01:04:53,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

550
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:55,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll go back to Zoom.

551
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:56,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Just your name and address for the record, please.

552
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,143
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Judith Weinstock at 144 Burgett Avenue.

553
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:07,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually wrote a letter to the voting members of the committee, and I know several of my neighbors did as well.

554
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I have sort of a list of questions.

555
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:17,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are procedural, sort of like, okay, so in my neighborhood, I live proximal in what you would now call, if it goes through, a UR1.

556
01:05:19,384 --> 01:05:21,686
[SPEAKER_05]: at Anberg et al.

557
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say roughly 50% of the homes that are designated under the UR1 around my area are all single family homes and the remainder are mostly two family homes.

558
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:43,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So for pondering and not necessarily for answering tonight, I am curious what your vision is for my current community

559
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:50,790
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 and 20 and 30 years from now, because eventually homes do have a useful life.

560
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:56,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Single family homes do need to be replaced in order to move in perpetuity, right?

561
01:05:56,772 --> 01:06:03,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if that will not be allowed in UR1 communities, what do you envision will happen?

562
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:10,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the plan to actually begin to migrate those communities into these much higher density areas?

563
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,015
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one question, and some of it is predicated

564
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:20,966
[SPEAKER_05]: on what will be allowed, if I'm reading your table correctly, I live on a 4,000-square-foot lot.

565
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:24,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a very small 1,300-square-foot home.

566
01:06:24,168 --> 01:06:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's nonconforming.

567
01:06:28,376 --> 01:06:38,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying that someone could buy my house, knock it down, and put up a multiplex on that space, a six-unit building?

568
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:52,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to understand from your chart what the dimensional square footage for a lot has to be in order for different size things to be there, different types of structures.

569
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:06,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that I really would ask folks to think about what are you really envisioning is going to happen in my community where currently it's very family friendly, families want to live in single family homes.

570
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:17,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately, as they age out, my house is over 100 years old, as they age out, there would not be single family homes under this proposal in that community, which would really change.

571
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:18,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's the goal.

572
01:07:19,298 --> 01:07:22,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what you're attempting to do over decades of time.

573
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So separate issue.

574
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:46,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't answer that because I only know the people in my community and I think that we all feel that in NR3 or whatever, the residential that allows single family homes along with all those other things except the multiplex, given that we almost all have non-conforming lots of 4,000 square feet or less,

575
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:53,617
[SPEAKER_05]: can't even imagine having the density that you're speaking about and still have it be a community that actually knows each other.

576
01:07:54,597 --> 01:08:05,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just say, please give that incredible pause because it has been an enclave of family friendly homes for over 50 or 60, 70, 80 years.

577
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're really, I don't know if I want to live there, frankly.

578
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:26,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say that a developer, if all these other things are allowed, developers are going to make a killing, and so will those single-family homeowners, because their properties will be in hot demand for somebody to turn it over into two or three units.

579
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:32,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't tell from your proposal, another just very basic question I had is, are condos

580
01:08:33,302 --> 01:08:36,363
[SPEAKER_05]: considered multifamily homes or not?

581
01:08:36,503 --> 01:08:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And are they allowed under these proposals, or are they not?

582
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:46,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of specific, which I would be happy to send through, because I don't want to take up more than my time.

583
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:52,567
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would ask, what's the vision for this particular community that we are not there?

584
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there are two.

585
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:54,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not Ball Square.

586
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:57,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the other one, Tufts Medford.

587
01:08:58,531 --> 01:09:05,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't imagine what the vision really is given that over 50% of the homes are single family on non-conforming lots right now.

588
01:09:12,837 --> 01:09:13,017
sure.

589
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:14,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your questions.

590
01:09:14,177 --> 01:09:15,518
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to president bears first.

591
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:19,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think that gets to the crux of the, of the whole zoning project really.

592
01:09:19,998 --> 01:09:29,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I think the vision based on the comprehensive plan is that every neighborhood would see some incremental increase in its density.

593
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:42,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now let me ask you, does any of the other new designations have a subtraction of what's allowed or is it only the current community that has single family, the two that have single family homes,

594
01:09:43,844 --> 01:09:50,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they the only ones that are experiencing a retraction and subtraction of what's allowed in their neighborhoods?

595
01:09:57,075 --> 01:09:57,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

596
01:10:03,961 --> 01:10:04,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

597
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so apologies to everybody listening.

598
01:10:09,742 --> 01:10:13,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I heard you say something about you are one going over six units.

599
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:15,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, did I misheard.

600
01:10:15,746 --> 01:10:18,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just want to actually it's two to.

601
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:30,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just want to clarify that the plan for urban residential water the proposed uses is a two unit dwelling historic conversion of an existing home of two to five units.

602
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:39,885
[SPEAKER_07]: townhouse, or a multiple unit dwelling of two to four units so that would be the limitation so I just wanted to make sure before we have the rest of the conversation.

603
01:10:41,222 --> 01:10:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: 3000 3000.

604
01:10:42,382 --> 01:10:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So but the building still has to meet.

605
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:47,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the minimum lot size.

606
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, and that's a that's a good point.

607
01:10:49,765 --> 01:10:53,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll step out of the way unless the rest of the conversation continue.

608
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:59,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you're thinking about placing a building on the lot, the building has to fit, it has to fit within the setbacks.

609
01:11:00,128 --> 01:11:04,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to allow for the surface parking, it has to allow for open space requirements.

610
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:10,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So even though something says it's a minimum of 3000 square feet, you might not be able to

611
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:18,654
[SPEAKER_07]: fit a particular building type that would say have four units on 3,000 square feet because you have the other requirements.

612
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:20,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something else to consider.

613
01:11:21,134 --> 01:11:37,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We dropped the square footage for many of the lots in these areas because we were looking at the non-conforming maps that showed that there were a lot of existing housing that was on lots that were smaller than the zoning allows for now.

614
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:40,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to reduce the number of non-conformities by lot size.

615
01:11:41,259 --> 01:11:46,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't mean that all building types can fit on a lot of that size.

616
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have to meet the other requirements.

617
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to step back and let the rest of the conversation continue, but I just wanted to clarify the units and the lot size requirements.

618
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:07,810
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would only be new.

619
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:29,751
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you were to, I think the answer to the question is no, but it's probably the place where that's most happening because of the uniqueness of the SF district in that neighborhood, like surrounding that SF district is mostly non-SF districts, where in most other parts of the city with existing SF districts,

620
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:33,134
[SPEAKER_18]: They're surrounded by SF districts, if that makes sense.

621
01:12:34,735 --> 01:12:37,656
[SPEAKER_18]: And also because of the transit.

622
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:48,743
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are, it's probably the place where the impact is happening the most, but I wouldn't say it's the only place where you have a single family allowed by right now where it wouldn't be allowed by right in the future.

623
01:12:49,684 --> 01:12:53,787
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you made a point about the useful life of the existing structure.

624
01:12:54,832 --> 01:13:00,542
[SPEAKER_18]: if you had a 120-year-old single family and you are, if this passed as is,

625
01:13:01,395 --> 01:13:17,490
[SPEAKER_18]: with a UR1 and you had 120-year-old single family that was nearing its end of its useful life and needed reconstruction, because it's an existing nonconforming use, you could still rebuild the single family on that lot because of how the zoning's written.

626
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:24,517
[SPEAKER_18]: So if someone has a single family and they say, I can't renovate this, I need a new single family, they could still do that.

627
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:36,823
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be if someone had an empty lot, or wanted to convert a two family to a single family, or basically wanted to build a new single family where one didn't already exist.

628
01:13:37,123 --> 01:13:39,244
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be the only piece that wouldn't be allowed.

629
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:44,726
[SPEAKER_18]: If you could just speak into the microphone.

630
01:13:44,826 --> 01:13:45,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, it's okay.

631
01:13:45,847 --> 01:13:46,627
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a pain in the butt.

632
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I wanted to raise my house, which by the way, I don't want to do, I'm not the least bit interested in raising my house.

633
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:57,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I wanted to, I could raise it and put up a new house.

634
01:13:58,431 --> 01:14:00,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

635
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:02,513
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a huge clarification, I think.

636
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:08,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a clarification that an ad buyer who wanted to buy my house could do the same thing.

637
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:13,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because it's not about just- I think you really need to make that clear, because I don't think that's been clear at all.

638
01:14:13,098 --> 01:14:18,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what people have heard is no more single family homes, and we can't imagine that.

639
01:14:19,009 --> 01:14:19,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

640
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:21,750
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's one of the hard parts about zoning.

641
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:32,154
[SPEAKER_18]: And when you talk about the vision, it is a, it's a vision for 10 to 20 years and it's about doing something or even 30 to, you know, 10 to 40 years really.

642
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:35,996
[SPEAKER_18]: And the comprehensive plan that we put together talks about a 30 year kind of timeline.

643
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:39,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And by we, I mean literally a ton of people worked on that.

644
01:14:40,498 --> 01:14:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And are condo conversions allowed if I had a two family, which I don't, so I have no skin in this game.

645
01:14:47,218 --> 01:14:57,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I go to the board and say, or the zoning, whoever, the building, and say, I want to convert this two-person apartment building into two condos as a legal structure.

646
01:14:57,609 --> 01:14:58,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I be permitted to do that?

647
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,272
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's allowed right now.

648
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:02,714
[SPEAKER_18]: There are state laws governing condo conversion.

649
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:07,860
[SPEAKER_18]: And then KITT has been working on a condo conversion ordinance specifically for Medford.

650
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:09,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

651
01:15:09,262 --> 01:15:22,107
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just want to talk more about the vision because I think it's important and I think you know there's probably disagreement on it I'm not saying we disagree but generally I don't think we've had a lot of conversations lately about what it means for everyone to agree on something and that's very rare.

652
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:30,660
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think in general, the vision is there's an incremental increase in density across the city, across all of the city's zoning districts.

653
01:15:31,161 --> 01:15:51,725
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do think that the neighborhood that we're talking about, not necessarily all of Hillside, but this section that is close to the train and is the single family district right now is probably seeing more an increase of like two increments more than, and then a lot of places might only be seeing one increment more.

654
01:15:52,265 --> 01:16:05,348
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, you know, just to be direct to the question, I think, yeah, I think in 10 to 20 years, you'd probably see more two and three families where there are single families right now in that neighborhood.

655
01:16:05,388 --> 01:16:15,351
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think a lot of that is, you know, yes, there is the demand for, you know, families to live in single family homes.

656
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:16,671
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a high demand neighborhood.

657
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:20,372
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the question is, who does that demand get to benefit, right?

658
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:29,390
[SPEAKER_18]: If we leave the zoning as it is, you end up with single family homes that are worth $1.2, $1.4, $1.6, $1.8 million.

659
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:29,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish.

660
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:35,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't live in those.

661
01:16:36,214 --> 01:16:36,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

662
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:43,637
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm saying in that 10 to 20 year time frame, it wouldn't surprise me if that was the value with the walkability to the Green Line.

663
01:16:44,417 --> 01:16:45,478
[SPEAKER_18]: and the neighborhood.

664
01:16:45,498 --> 01:16:47,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know that's going to happen anyway, right?

665
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:47,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

666
01:16:47,660 --> 01:17:01,331
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the question I'm saying is, how do you distribute that so that maybe, yes, that structure is still going to be worth that, but can you have more people living there so that the demand is that people are going to want to live there?

667
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:06,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want it to only be accessible to a family that can afford a $2 million single family?

668
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:12,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Or do you want it to be accessible to maybe two families who want to live in $1 million

669
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:31,474
[SPEAKER_18]: condos or a two family apartment, you know, and that's where I think the density piece comes in is you're saying that more, yes, more people can live on a single lot, but it also means that people, you don't have to have as ridiculously high of an income to live in the neighborhood.

670
01:17:31,534 --> 01:17:32,475
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's a balance.

671
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:39,460
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but the transitions that you're talking about will actually increase the per square foot pricing in our neighborhood.

672
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:40,261
[SPEAKER_05]: It will.

673
01:17:40,747 --> 01:17:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: because you will get developers who will come in and offer people money for their homes that are pretty outrageous prices.

674
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I can get for my house now.

675
01:17:49,192 --> 01:17:50,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, by the way, I'm not breaking a million.

676
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:54,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless something extraordinary should happen.

677
01:17:56,897 --> 01:18:05,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone, a developer could come in, assuming they could meet if they looked at my lot and said, I want that house, I want that house, I want that house.

678
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:25,477
[SPEAKER_05]: developer could come in, offer the homeowner a huge amount of money relative to what the homeowner might get on the open market, build two, three, four unit places where that's permissible, the relative price is going to be much higher than it would have been if someone just bought my house and lived there.

679
01:18:26,037 --> 01:18:34,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying the per square foot cost will rise under this proposal because you're going to have developers out there who want

680
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:36,809
[SPEAKER_05]: the properties pretty dramatically.

681
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's my opinion because we all know that actually the parts are worth more than the sum of the original whole.

682
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:54,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I could convert my house to a two family and condoize that building and sell them both, I might get to 1.6 million for the entire property.

683
01:18:54,793 --> 01:18:55,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

684
01:18:55,653 --> 01:18:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But so you will see the prices go up no matter what.

685
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,435
[SPEAKER_18]: But your per unit costs would be lower.

686
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,575
[SPEAKER_05]: The square foot price will be higher.

687
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, I think the question is the square foot versus the per unit.

688
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:10,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but the square foot pricing is high.

689
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:11,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

690
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:14,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think it's a great debate.

691
01:19:14,718 --> 01:19:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair to say I want to win.

692
01:19:18,241 --> 01:19:19,022
[SPEAKER_18]: I would guess that.

693
01:19:19,182 --> 01:19:19,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

694
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,721
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was a good discussion.

695
01:19:22,741 --> 01:19:23,241
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.

696
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:23,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

697
01:19:23,661 --> 01:19:23,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

698
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:25,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your questions, Judith.

699
01:19:25,202 --> 01:19:25,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

700
01:19:25,982 --> 01:19:27,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is clarifying for a lot of people.

701
01:19:27,823 --> 01:19:39,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, if you have further questions, anybody in the chambers or online, please do feel free to forward them to the planning staff or myself, and we will make sure that they get to the right person.

702
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:43,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to recognize Councillor Scarpelli, and then we have some folks who haven't spoken yet on Zoom.

703
01:19:43,751 --> 01:19:44,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Councillor Scarpelli.

704
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:51,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

705
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

706
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:57,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me, Madam Chair?

707
01:19:58,273 --> 01:19:59,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can hear you now.

708
01:19:59,093 --> 01:19:59,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

709
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

710
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:16,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think what Judith is bringing up and what some residents have reached out to me and, um, and the understanding of, um, this type of change zoning change in the one family neighborhoods.

711
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the realistic

712
01:20:17,883 --> 01:20:26,591
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer has to be that this is a realistic outcome, that it's not going to be 10, 20, 30 years.

713
01:20:29,214 --> 01:20:43,307
[SPEAKER_00]: After last week's meeting, I had developers calling me that shared that, George, just so you know, as a developer, that we won't wait 10, 20 years, and they'll do it as soon as possible.

714
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:53,258
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking on those doors for those one family homes and offering some pretty substantial monies to purchase those homes.

715
01:20:53,818 --> 01:21:09,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that to share the information, the questions that residents have been reaching out to me that the reason why they brought it to my attention because we talked about this at the meeting a few weeks ago is that

716
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:23,058
[SPEAKER_00]: the fear of losing their close-knit neighborhood and then turning it into a very dense, transient community.

717
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:26,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that, you know, it's not what I believe.

718
01:21:26,879 --> 01:21:28,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, you can have

719
01:21:31,082 --> 01:21:45,863
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods of three-family homes and still have a community failing that a one-family neighborhood has, but it's a realistic fear that the residents in these neighborhoods have shared the concern.

720
01:21:46,964 --> 01:21:53,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't want to minimize or I don't want to be on the council in two or three, four years.

721
01:21:53,787 --> 01:21:59,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see drastic changes in one family neighborhoods in that district.

722
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:03,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden saying, wait a second, this wasn't supposed to happen this quick.

723
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:08,913
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it sure, I mean, it could move forward.

724
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:20,922
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 30-year process as people age out, but this could also happen within a year of these zoning changes that developers are knocking on doors.

725
01:22:20,962 --> 01:22:22,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people have to understand that.

726
01:22:23,144 --> 01:22:30,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is one reason why I wouldn't support this venture because I think that

727
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:36,372
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't informed our neighbors enough of these changes.

728
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:41,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've tried and we're, we're making strides and getting more information out.

729
01:22:41,834 --> 01:22:49,637
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are the same issues that, you know, we have a resident like miss Briggs that just came to the podium, very educated, very involved.

730
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:56,480
[SPEAKER_00]: She came to the city council meeting, but we have multiple other members of our community that are very confused.

731
01:22:57,461 --> 01:23:04,883
[SPEAKER_00]: who don't want to come to a meeting that don't understand this process, and we're not going into their neighborhood.

732
01:23:05,343 --> 01:23:07,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I just needed to share that.

733
01:23:07,044 --> 01:23:16,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying it since we started the meetings, when we started our rezoning meetings, and that we do have to do a better job so residents can understand this.

734
01:23:16,646 --> 01:23:18,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Councilor Behrs did a great job.

735
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:49,022
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, answering the question about the one family and people not being able to build their one families if it comes down or it has to redo an existing one family, that was something that was very confusing to a lot of people, including myself, and I appreciate that description, but I do think that we have to be realistic and we have to be, make sure that both sides of their concerns are heard because

736
01:23:49,902 --> 01:24:13,410
[SPEAKER_00]: uh yes it is we do need rezoning yes and we need some we need more housing but at the same time it is true that within a relatively possibly when within a relatively short period of this rezoning that these neighborhoods can be and will be drastically different the one family

737
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:17,368
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, neighborhood feeling will be gone.

738
01:24:17,588 --> 01:24:20,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a realistic outlook.

739
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:21,969
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not trying to be divisive.

740
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:26,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's people want to know that, is that a possibility?

741
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:41,775
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to be fair that yes, we could see the possibility of attrition and the process go through so we can see the changes that might be needed, but also could also be something very drastic and very fast.

742
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:56,396
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh could be very it could be changed very very quickly so i appreciate the time madam chair but i think that i had to share what conversations i have had with members of that community and i think that as we move forward um

743
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:57,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

744
01:24:57,597 --> 01:25:01,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Briggs brought up another very important question that, is it just this neighborhood?

745
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:07,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that with our consultants and our community development board, we really have to put a list together.

746
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:18,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So those neighbors that aren't being talked about, people that aren't at the table right now, that they know that this type of situation is coming to their neighborhood.

747
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,095
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd appreciate that.

748
01:25:20,135 --> 01:25:20,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

749
01:25:23,898 --> 01:25:24,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpale.

750
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:26,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, if I could just

751
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:31,448
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think this is basically the discussion we're having, right?

752
01:25:32,509 --> 01:25:36,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We're seeing land values increase generally already.

753
01:25:36,272 --> 01:25:40,415
[SPEAKER_18]: The value of land, the value of structures in the community has increased significantly.

754
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:51,924
[SPEAKER_18]: It drives that and the demand generally again for people wanting to live close to Boston drives rent increases, it drives increase in land value and

755
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:56,777
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we're having this discussion I don't think anyone's disputing that.

756
01:25:57,798 --> 01:26:05,706
[SPEAKER_18]: What is an up zoning is going to increase the land value per square foot of these lots right that's going to happen.

757
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:16,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think the question is, on a per unit basis and again you know we talked a lot at a previous meeting I'd like to see a lot of, you know,

758
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:26,528
[SPEAKER_18]: federal investment, state investment, non-market solutions to lower the price of housing, because I think housing is about housing people, not just as serving as a commodity.

759
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:40,162
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think what we've seen is that it's because it's been commodified, we end up in this conflict where, you know, again, moving on from that, we have the land values are going up.

760
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:44,674
[SPEAKER_18]: allowing someone to build more on a lot is going to increase the land values more.

761
01:26:45,774 --> 01:26:54,539
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the question is, what you allow them to build, does it actually potentially allow you to house more people there and reduce the per unit cost of housing people?

762
01:26:55,039 --> 01:27:04,084
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's the kind of crux where we're looking at this specific project, which is just about the rules that we're setting for the market in Medford.

763
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:15,049
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that intersects in a lot of different ways with policies that we should be implementing that aren't about just letting the market do it at once.

764
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:21,951
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think one of the reasons that we got here is that the city's existing zoning is exclusionary zoning.

765
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:26,372
[SPEAKER_18]: It's dated after the construction of a lot of these neighborhoods.

766
01:27:27,012 --> 01:27:38,154
[SPEAKER_18]: So the reason that a single family in that neighborhood is nonconforming is because somebody said, 120 years ago, people were like, we want to build these houses here on this lot size, this shape.

767
01:27:38,694 --> 01:27:41,875
[SPEAKER_18]: And we don't even really have to ask anybody what we want to do.

768
01:27:42,566 --> 01:27:47,807
[SPEAKER_18]: And then 50 or 60 years after that, people wrote a law that said, actually, we don't want to let them do that anymore.

769
01:27:49,487 --> 01:27:51,348
[SPEAKER_18]: And we'd have to go look back at the intent of that.

770
01:27:51,428 --> 01:28:01,350
[SPEAKER_18]: But a lot of that was because communities didn't want to let more people live here, or certain kinds of people live here, or shape neighborhoods in certain ways.

771
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:11,292
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think one of the intents of what we're trying to do is to say, at the very least, the zoning should at least look like what the neighborhoods looked like when they were built.

772
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:22,067
[SPEAKER_18]: And that because of the need for housing in our community, they should allow somewhat more housing in those neighborhoods.

773
01:28:23,128 --> 01:28:30,194
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think I think everyone's completely right that's going to look at that will look like change neighborhoods will change.

774
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:40,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Whether they change incredibly fast or incredibly slow is going to be up to the people the private owners of those properties, because we're setting

775
01:28:41,052 --> 01:28:46,315
[SPEAKER_18]: essentially the rules for the private market agnostic of whoever those private actors are.

776
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,457
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't control who buys land.

777
01:28:48,497 --> 01:28:49,957
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't control who develops land.

778
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:56,081
[SPEAKER_18]: All we can say is here's what we allow you to build on this land through the different processes that the state law allows.

779
01:28:57,942 --> 01:29:03,766
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think talking about the neighborhood around the

780
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:13,116
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, Brookings Street and George Street and the Medford-Tufts Station, that's one place.

781
01:29:13,196 --> 01:29:17,099
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the only single-family district south of the river.

782
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:22,744
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the only single-family district in such close proximity to a rapid transit line.

783
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:29,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I think the change and the pace of change, both the scope of change and the pace of change,

784
01:29:30,087 --> 01:29:37,050
[SPEAKER_18]: will probably seem bigger than in some other parts of the city, but I don't think any part of the city will see no change.

785
01:29:39,111 --> 01:29:50,756
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's a reality that we're facing because people want to live in cities and more people want to live here than we have the ability to house here.

786
01:29:51,357 --> 01:29:56,439
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we do nothing, then we will continue to limit

787
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:06,447
[SPEAKER_18]: who can live here based on class and their cost of housing or their luck to have purchased a house at a certain time in the past rather than a time in the future.

788
01:30:07,707 --> 01:30:09,568
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think those are our values.

789
01:30:10,808 --> 01:30:25,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes those conversations will put our different values in conflict and we'll have to come up with what we think is an approach that sits with reality, but also maybe doesn't satisfy everything that we would like to see.

790
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:34,836
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll also say that I think we're taking a thoughtful approach.

791
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:43,123
[SPEAKER_18]: And for me personally, I'm on the line here in this neighborhood around the NR3 versus the UR1 designation.

792
01:30:43,483 --> 01:30:44,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I've gone back and forth.

793
01:30:47,246 --> 01:30:49,728
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've heard that from folks.

794
01:30:51,149 --> 01:30:54,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And similarly, I think there's a bunch of geographic

795
01:30:56,279 --> 01:31:08,549
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's certain sets of conditions that, to me, put certain neighborhoods on this borderline of, for certain values and reasons, you could go this way.

796
01:31:08,909 --> 01:31:10,890
[SPEAKER_18]: For certain values and reasons, you could go this way.

797
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,292
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a close call.

798
01:31:13,012 --> 01:31:19,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I got an email from Laurel today about the NR3 versus the R1.

799
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:21,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm hearing what you're saying about it.

800
01:31:21,318 --> 01:31:25,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and I think that is one of the harder

801
01:31:26,322 --> 01:31:39,172
[SPEAKER_18]: This is one of the places where, because of the unique conditions, some of your values are going to say this should go the UR1 just because it has such high demand and access.

802
01:31:39,752 --> 01:31:51,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of you say you should go the NR3 because it's probably the district that's seeing the greatest change because it's a unique location for a single family district in the city right now.

803
01:31:52,662 --> 01:31:53,803
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was a long and rambling

804
01:31:54,801 --> 01:32:00,423
[SPEAKER_18]: thought, but I hope it at least goes to show that we're thinking and talking about these different issues.

805
01:32:01,524 --> 01:32:02,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

806
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Bereson.

807
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:11,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Judith, for kicking off a thoughtful discussion and to Councilor Scarpelli for weighing in.

808
01:32:11,528 --> 01:32:17,330
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of people on Zoom that have been waiting, so if you don't mind, I'm going to hop to that queue and then we'll come right back to the podium.

809
01:32:18,271 --> 01:32:19,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Janie's hand first.

810
01:32:20,272 --> 01:32:21,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Janie, I'm going to unmute you.

811
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:23,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Please name and address for the record, and you have three minutes.

812
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:30,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Janie Tallarita at 68 Charnwood Road.

813
01:32:30,598 --> 01:32:33,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a comment and a question.

814
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hand raised for a while, so my comment had to do with this whole conversation about affordable housing.

815
01:32:41,266 --> 01:32:45,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And my concern was that there was no conversation about affordable housing.

816
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:53,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to stress how important it is that these conversations are hand in hand.

817
01:32:54,256 --> 01:32:55,577
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we're building

818
01:32:56,168 --> 01:33:05,093
[SPEAKER_01]: If the idea is that density is going to create more housing and that's going to bring costs down, it's not going to happen.

819
01:33:05,173 --> 01:33:08,215
[SPEAKER_01]: What Judy said is true.

820
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:12,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Developers do not go into their business to make a living.

821
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:16,560
[SPEAKER_01]: They go into their business to make a killing, period.

822
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:23,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to come in and unless there's some guardrails in place, and I don't know

823
01:33:24,338 --> 01:33:46,012
[SPEAKER_01]: What that is, I also feel as though, you know, we should not be subjected to their, you know, pushing beyond our zoning to fast track it because they're going to include some affordable housing.

824
01:33:46,052 --> 01:33:51,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Affordable housing just needs to be part of any larger development.

825
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:53,217
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I say this

826
01:33:53,988 --> 01:34:00,631
[SPEAKER_01]: as someone who grew up in multi-family homes on Section 8.

827
01:34:01,632 --> 01:34:05,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, my home, is the first single-family home I've ever lived in.

828
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:15,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can, and I love it, I can also appreciate the importance of having density of housing.

829
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:19,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have friends who are still

830
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:29,066
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling and can't find housing around here or struggling to, you know, have to choose between paying rent or buying food.

831
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:38,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends who are renters who live in multi-unit housing who can't buy, but they care very much about their communities.

832
01:34:38,994 --> 01:34:47,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that this mix of people is what makes our community strong, in my opinion.

833
01:34:50,499 --> 01:34:52,600
[SPEAKER_01]: these conversations need to go hand in hand.

834
01:34:52,640 --> 01:35:00,001
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gotta be a way where we, there's gotta be a way to not, I don't know.

835
01:35:00,482 --> 01:35:06,723
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gotta be some solution and I don't know what it is, but these conversations have to always be happening hand in hand.

836
01:35:06,783 --> 01:35:17,486
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're gonna increase housing, we can't do it without talking about affordability and having some kind of a real plan in place while also respecting

837
01:35:19,495 --> 01:35:24,339
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling of our space here, the built environment matters.

838
01:35:26,581 --> 01:35:36,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair to have any of us be surrounded by two tall buildings, two big buildings.

839
01:35:39,712 --> 01:35:40,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know the solution.

840
01:35:40,973 --> 01:35:44,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying we need to keep these conversations hand in hand.

841
01:35:46,427 --> 01:35:57,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know if I quite expressed myself well, but my second is a question and it is about the commercial framework.

842
01:35:59,031 --> 01:36:01,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a little unclear on the date.

843
01:36:01,891 --> 01:36:05,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Boston Ave right up there.

844
01:36:05,973 --> 01:36:14,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all know how concerned all of us here in Hillside are about Tufts development and anything that's going on up on Boston Ave.

845
01:36:15,045 --> 01:36:23,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was just on the website, um, and looking at the city council at the, um, event.

846
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:27,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, calendar and I don't see a date there.

847
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that updated?

848
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually where I go to find links to these meetings.

849
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:34,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that be updated?

850
01:36:34,552 --> 01:36:37,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it March?

851
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:41,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, appreciate you bringing that up.

852
01:36:41,282 --> 01:36:48,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to begin talking about that's going to be a part of the next phase, the next chapter of the zoning overhaul.

853
01:36:49,406 --> 01:36:56,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to begin talking about the commercial framework broadly in March, and we're not going to be diving straight into a new proposal for.

854
01:36:58,449 --> 01:37:15,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Boston have the Boston have district we are very much going to be looking at an institutional zone for Tufts University made making sure to prioritize discussions with the residents to form the basis of that we don't have a I don't want to advertise a specific committee day we're going to be talking about Boston have yet just because we're still putting together that timeline.

855
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:24,204
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to be just making sure that we're scheduling meetings for the community really thoughtfully.

856
01:37:24,304 --> 01:37:31,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be putting out a more specific calendar when those dates become available.

857
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:36,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I think between March and April, those will be coming up, but if you're not seeing the dates right now, it's just because they aren't on the website.

858
01:37:36,592 --> 01:37:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go to President Behrs, I see you have a comment.

859
01:37:39,034 --> 01:37:41,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to, and I don't wanna, I don't wanna,

860
01:37:42,996 --> 01:38:02,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Contrary to anything you said, but generally the events calendar is the last is the final place where the meetings dates and times and links go up because those are created by the city communications department after the clerk's office at Vice President Collins and I published the agendas.

861
01:38:02,713 --> 01:38:05,355
[SPEAKER_18]: So the events calendars usually only updated

862
01:38:06,103 --> 01:38:06,423
[SPEAKER_18]: meeting.

863
01:38:06,443 --> 01:38:19,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Um you know, the Friday before those meetings if you go to the City Council page on the website, there's a link to the January to June 2025 City Council meeting schedule.

864
01:38:20,691 --> 01:38:26,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Um and the meetings of this committee for March, April, May and June are all on there right now.

865
01:38:27,714 --> 01:38:30,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Um for March and April, it's March

866
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:49,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I think March 26 or April 9 is probably when we will talk about those specifics, but I defer to the Chair on exactly the date for the Boston Ave.

867
01:38:49,955 --> 01:38:51,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Tufts Main Street.

868
01:38:51,996 --> 01:38:57,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's also likely but not confirmed just now and we'll be sure to, I'm sure that at our first meeting about the commercial framework

869
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:09,706
[SPEAKER_06]: on March 12th, if I'm remembering that correctly, we will be able to present a more specific timeline for meetings under that category, which will include Austin Ave as well as other corridors such as Main Street.

870
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:13,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that question.

871
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:24,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would just add again, like if folks are interested in this process through the end of June, our meetings are on the website, March 12th, March 26th, April 9th, April 30th, May 14th,

872
01:39:26,935 --> 01:39:29,736
[SPEAKER_18]: May 28th, June 11th and June 25th.

873
01:39:30,836 --> 01:39:42,501
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's these meetings where we develop the proposals before they get referred into the zoning process and the public hearings and the state law, the whole state law process.

874
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:45,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your efforts.

875
01:39:46,379 --> 01:39:46,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.

876
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:50,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the more specific answer than I was offering.

877
01:39:51,684 --> 01:39:53,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your comments, Janie.

878
01:39:53,646 --> 01:39:56,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just do want to acknowledge the point that you're making about affordable housing.

879
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:58,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate you bringing that into this discussion.

880
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:03,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a long discussion about that two weeks ago in this committee.

881
01:40:05,156 --> 01:40:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's certainly on the forefront of all of our minds.

882
01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:08,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a value that we share.

883
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to make sure that

884
01:40:11,722 --> 01:40:21,029
[SPEAKER_06]: this zoning, our updated zoning, encourages and incentivizes affordable housing wherever possible and where that is not possible within the confines of what zoning can do.

885
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:37,802
[SPEAKER_06]: The City Council, in collaboration with many City Hall departments, is working very hard on other parts, on other affordable housing strategies, such as supporting our affordable housing trust fund, a brand new community land trust,

886
01:40:38,642 --> 01:40:45,345
[SPEAKER_06]: and other, for example, we were able to put online affordable housing incentives for veteran renters this year.

887
01:40:45,565 --> 01:40:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot to deal with this very, very gargantuan regional issue of housing unaffordability.

888
01:40:53,088 --> 01:40:55,249
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to do that in zoning where we can, where we can't.

889
01:40:55,269 --> 01:40:58,791
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of other strategies that we're collaborating on, and thank you for making sure that

890
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:02,312
[SPEAKER_06]: We're keeping this up for this discussion and others.

891
01:41:03,532 --> 01:41:09,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go back to podium, and then we'll go to folks who have hands raised on Zoom, prioritizing folks who haven't spoken yet.

892
01:41:10,374 --> 01:41:11,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

893
01:41:11,814 --> 01:41:12,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Three minutes.

894
01:41:12,974 --> 01:41:15,615
[SPEAKER_14]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

895
01:41:15,635 --> 01:41:20,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to start by thanking everyone involved, the committee and the consultants.

896
01:41:20,556 --> 01:41:27,178
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been following this process throughout, and I think it's done a good job of increasing the allowable density.

897
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,077
[SPEAKER_14]: in every neighborhood.

898
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:37,327
[SPEAKER_14]: This particular zoning proposal here, this section of the project, this is our bread and butter zoning.

899
01:41:37,868 --> 01:41:40,211
[SPEAKER_14]: It's covering most of the land area in the city.

900
01:41:41,893 --> 01:41:44,076
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to make that point.

901
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:51,121
[SPEAKER_14]: hopefully it's going to contribute to addressing the housing shortage.

902
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:58,124
[SPEAKER_14]: The state did a study and they came up with that the state commonwealth needs 222,000 units.

903
01:41:58,164 --> 01:41:58,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we are.

904
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:01,365
[SPEAKER_14]: We need by 2035, I think they said.

905
01:42:03,246 --> 01:42:15,090
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I guess just if there's been any thought given to how much we think we're going to get out of this, how much work are we doing our part to address the regional housing shortage.

906
01:42:15,717 --> 01:42:17,237
[SPEAKER_14]: do we think enough will be built?

907
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:24,999
[SPEAKER_14]: I also heard some idea that could potentially be considered, at least some of the urban residentials.

908
01:42:25,459 --> 01:42:32,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be worth looking at something higher than four stories to make sure that we're contributing enough units, first of all?

909
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:39,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, when you get up past three stories into four stories, a lot of times they're going to put in an elevator there.

910
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:44,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think the economics really work below that.

911
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,981
[SPEAKER_14]: for an elevator, so that'll improve accessibility.

912
01:42:48,021 --> 01:42:52,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that could be a sort of a positive, if you were to consider that.

913
01:42:52,822 --> 01:43:04,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say another thing, and that is that near Bedford Tufts, we talked about how that within the city of Bedford, that's going to sort of be a really big increment compared to other parts of the city.

914
01:43:04,706 --> 01:43:08,768
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's true, but this is a housing market, it's regional, right?

915
01:43:11,488 --> 01:43:14,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford isn't the only city doing upzoning right now.

916
01:43:15,249 --> 01:43:16,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Cambridge just did a pretty major one.

917
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:23,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the densities that currently exist near Fresh Pond are probably quite similar to the neighborhood we're discussing.

918
01:43:26,153 --> 01:43:37,279
[SPEAKER_14]: They've showed that when you have lots of upzoning in a region happening at once, it does, I think, attenuate the speed at which the uptake happens, because you just have so many different places that could be developed, right?

919
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,801
[SPEAKER_14]: You can picture like Kendall Square in Cambridge.

920
01:43:40,221 --> 01:43:44,324
[SPEAKER_14]: You upzone just that one spot, whoop, grew very, very quickly, went right up.

921
01:43:45,244 --> 01:43:54,970
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you have all across the region, huge increases in capacity, it's not gonna go at Kendall Square speeds, you know?

922
01:43:56,345 --> 01:43:56,805
[SPEAKER_14]: probably.

923
01:43:56,846 --> 01:44:03,252
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it does, then we have an even more housing shortage than I thought, in which case we really need those units.

924
01:44:03,292 --> 01:44:05,634
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think it'll be quite as, you know what I mean?

925
01:44:05,674 --> 01:44:09,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it's based on how much extra capacity there is across a wide area.

926
01:44:09,858 --> 01:44:11,479
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

927
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:18,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I also wanted to point out, there really are benefits to density, not just affordability.

928
01:44:18,506 --> 01:44:19,467
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other benefits.

929
01:44:21,115 --> 01:44:27,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about how much time you spend in a retail store now than you might have in the year 2000 hours per week.

930
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:35,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I would think that it's a lot less for most of us because of online shopping and other things.

931
01:44:35,847 --> 01:44:43,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you want the same activity in your commercial centers and the same number of businesses in your commercial centers as you had in the year 2000,

932
01:44:45,732 --> 01:44:51,094
[SPEAKER_14]: then I think you need more people per area to support those or else you're not going to have that.

933
01:44:52,795 --> 01:45:03,280
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want a grocery store in your neighborhood, if you want the MBTA to run more buses through your neighborhood at greater frequencies, all those things are going to be helped by additional people living there.

934
01:45:04,306 --> 01:45:15,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's a benefit to people who live there, not just for affordability, not just for people trying to move from outside, but there are a lot of benefits that people get to enjoy the dense neighborhood.

935
01:45:16,675 --> 01:45:29,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I think as we talk about some of the problems that come with density for the people already in there, we should also think about some of the benefits, some of the benefits that are going to be there.

936
01:45:30,362 --> 01:45:38,767
[SPEAKER_14]: in terms of what a neighborhood can support when there are more people, more customers, more neighbors, more passengers for the bus, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

937
01:45:39,027 --> 01:45:39,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

938
01:45:41,589 --> 01:45:42,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, William.

939
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:46,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go next to Cheryl on Zoom.

940
01:45:46,152 --> 01:45:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

941
01:45:47,472 --> 01:45:48,093
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

942
01:45:55,157 --> 01:45:55,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Cheryl.

943
01:45:55,917 --> 01:45:56,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking you to unmute.

944
01:46:00,597 --> 01:46:00,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

945
01:46:00,817 --> 01:46:01,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

946
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:02,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I unmuted?

947
01:46:02,799 --> 01:46:03,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're good.

948
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

949
01:46:04,141 --> 01:46:05,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

950
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheryl Rodriguez 281 Park Street.

951
01:46:08,985 --> 01:46:15,532
[SPEAKER_10]: So I noticed that every meeting that we start out mentioning that the comprehensive plan people who participate in it wanted more density.

952
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:20,392
[SPEAKER_10]: The areas with the larger lots and more parking should be the ones being made more dense.

953
01:46:20,892 --> 01:46:24,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly that land and those streets can hold more than the dense areas.

954
01:46:25,354 --> 01:46:29,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Those in the least dense areas had the most participation in the comprehensive plan.

955
01:46:30,436 --> 01:46:38,580
[SPEAKER_10]: And no zone should disallow two families if your goal is more housing, especially since those singles sit on the largest lots.

956
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:49,446
[SPEAKER_10]: But instead, the neighborhoods struggling with current density are being increased dramatically, despite having no meaningful transit, despite being already dense and crowded.

957
01:46:49,787 --> 01:46:53,169
[SPEAKER_10]: We have smaller lots than those being zoned for far less.

958
01:46:53,749 --> 01:46:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: We are already seeing the effects of a prolific flipper in this area with the mega townhouses.

959
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,254
[SPEAKER_10]: The corridor zoning will also impact us here near Salem Street.

960
01:47:03,754 --> 01:47:09,741
[SPEAKER_10]: The unstudied impacts of both of those zoning changes combined will be very harmful to us.

961
01:47:11,123 --> 01:47:14,287
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a neighborhood character that we want to keep too.

962
01:47:15,734 --> 01:47:24,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside of Salem Street, Glenwood is consistently mentioned as the best area to trick and treat in, and they get hundreds of kids per year.

963
01:47:24,339 --> 01:47:31,083
[SPEAKER_10]: The neighbors walk their dogs, stop to talk, sit on porches together on a daily basis.

964
01:47:31,524 --> 01:47:34,145
[SPEAKER_10]: They wave to each other and help each other shovel snow.

965
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:38,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Many sections of this area are a good deal single family.

966
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:42,929
[SPEAKER_10]: We also know that you will lower the parking minimums in May.

967
01:47:43,269 --> 01:47:49,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So it seems wrong to suggest that parking minimums will be a measure that will slow the density that you are zoning for.

968
01:47:50,831 --> 01:47:59,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And this does not compare to the Cambridge zoning, which has larger lot sizes required and doesn't have sacrificial neighborhoods to spare others.

969
01:48:00,154 --> 01:48:06,756
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyone who compares this to the Cambridge zoning has likely read nor understood neither.

970
01:48:06,776 --> 01:48:07,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

971
01:48:10,783 --> 01:48:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.

972
01:48:13,185 --> 01:48:13,585
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

973
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:16,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to continue on Zoom.

974
01:48:17,368 --> 01:48:18,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll go back to folks who have spoken already.

975
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:21,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Maryann, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

976
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:23,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

977
01:48:23,233 --> 01:48:23,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Three minutes.

978
01:48:27,796 --> 01:48:28,097
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

979
01:48:28,117 --> 01:48:29,578
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

980
01:48:29,898 --> 01:48:30,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

981
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:31,539
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

982
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:36,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Maryann Tomazuk, and I live at 29 Garfield Avenue.

983
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:47,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in the Glenwood area and I'm in a single family and it is a very family friendly neighborhood.

984
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:51,426
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a wonderful community and I'd like to stay that way.

985
01:48:55,587 --> 01:48:57,088
[SPEAKER_11]: We do sit outside.

986
01:48:57,368 --> 01:48:58,429
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk to each other.

987
01:48:58,529 --> 01:48:59,530
[SPEAKER_11]: We walk the dogs.

988
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,752
[SPEAKER_11]: When people go away, we walk each other.

989
01:49:01,832 --> 01:49:03,213
[SPEAKER_11]: We check on each other's house.

990
01:49:03,834 --> 01:49:04,654
[SPEAKER_11]: We get the mail.

991
01:49:05,235 --> 01:49:07,096
[SPEAKER_11]: We take care of each other's pets.

992
01:49:08,678 --> 01:49:12,501
[SPEAKER_11]: My husband passed away and people shovel my walk now.

993
01:49:16,487 --> 01:49:28,029
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the highest density area in the city and I don't understand why it's being targeted to be even more dense than any of the other areas in the city.

994
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:42,832
[SPEAKER_11]: You're protecting the other areas like these two women from the Tufts area called in and they're worried about their areas when you're actually doing less there and they have the rapid transit.

995
01:49:43,252 --> 01:49:45,232
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one bus line that comes through.

996
01:49:46,396 --> 01:49:51,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I volunteer 30 hours a week at the senior center, and I don't drive.

997
01:49:52,001 --> 01:49:54,803
[SPEAKER_11]: But because of the neighborhood and all, I get rides.

998
01:49:57,105 --> 01:50:03,910
[SPEAKER_11]: This morning, and almost every morning, depends what time I go, when you try to get down Salem Street, it is backed up.

999
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:09,635
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes 15 minutes just to get to the square, to get to the senior center.

1000
01:50:11,256 --> 01:50:13,198
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to add about 1,000 units here.

1001
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:15,880
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be worse.

1002
01:50:18,523 --> 01:50:23,104
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have, like I say, this is the highest density area in the city.

1003
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:25,685
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have rapid transit.

1004
01:50:26,785 --> 01:50:28,125
[SPEAKER_11]: We are family friendly.

1005
01:50:28,825 --> 01:50:30,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody brings their kids out.

1006
01:50:31,226 --> 01:50:32,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Halloween, we all sit outside.

1007
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:34,606
[SPEAKER_11]: We all decorate.

1008
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:36,647
[SPEAKER_11]: We all go out there.

1009
01:50:38,387 --> 01:50:43,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave out 140 pieces of candy last year.

1010
01:50:45,309 --> 01:50:46,349
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not unusual.

1011
01:50:49,027 --> 01:50:52,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Christmas people bake, give each other things.

1012
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:53,730
[SPEAKER_11]: We have block parties.

1013
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:55,210
[SPEAKER_11]: We have barbecues together.

1014
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:02,614
[SPEAKER_11]: We have little get togethers and parties all the time.

1015
01:51:02,994 --> 01:51:05,616
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a wonderful area to be in.

1016
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:07,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna die here.

1017
01:51:08,217 --> 01:51:13,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not wanna leave this neighborhood and I'd like to stay in my home.

1018
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:18,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not want to have to, I can't drive.

1019
01:51:19,371 --> 01:51:20,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm stuck here, I'm disabled.

1020
01:51:23,013 --> 01:51:26,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wonderful that I can go up the street, take a bus.

1021
01:51:26,575 --> 01:51:29,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I can walk to different places.

1022
01:51:30,218 --> 01:51:33,820
[SPEAKER_11]: But with what you're proposing, I won't be able to do anything.

1023
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:38,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is terrible.

1024
01:51:38,523 --> 01:51:45,207
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gonna be putting all this density in an already dense area, and you're gonna save

1025
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:58,165
[SPEAKER_11]: places that, now I lived in that area in Tufts, so Burgett Avenue, I grew up in that area, but it was a field and not Tufts buildings when I grew up there.

1026
01:51:59,085 --> 01:52:06,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's no need to not put more density in that area because it's all spaced out.

1027
01:52:06,469 --> 01:52:07,149
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still

1028
01:52:08,348 --> 01:52:10,229
[SPEAKER_11]: empty, basically, compared to here.

1029
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:13,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And Boston Avenue, that's commercial.

1030
01:52:14,552 --> 01:52:16,114
[SPEAKER_11]: That needs to be more dense.

1031
01:52:16,594 --> 01:52:23,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Main Street, High Street, Mystic Avenue, those are all areas you should be touching.

1032
01:52:23,499 --> 01:52:24,800
[SPEAKER_11]: But here, on a 3,000 square foot lot,

1033
01:52:27,113 --> 01:52:28,134
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessary.

1034
01:52:28,494 --> 01:52:30,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need any more density here.

1035
01:52:31,035 --> 01:52:37,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also have the, we have the flippers coming over here constantly taking houses and flipping them around and making a mess.

1036
01:52:38,338 --> 01:52:40,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So please leave our area alone.

1037
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:42,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't destroy us.

1038
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't ruin our neighborhood.

1039
01:52:45,461 --> 01:52:47,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get rid of housing that we have.

1040
01:52:47,882 --> 01:52:49,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get rid of everything we have here.

1041
01:52:50,624 --> 01:52:51,464
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no need.

1042
01:52:51,844 --> 01:52:56,046
[SPEAKER_11]: There's too much traffic now and we can't stand the traffic.

1043
01:52:56,565 --> 01:52:58,547
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't pave the streets.

1044
01:52:59,247 --> 01:53:05,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Salem Street has not been paved in decades, and not this area.

1045
01:53:05,673 --> 01:53:12,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The only part of Salem Street that's been paved every few years is the part on the other side of the rotary.

1046
01:53:13,239 --> 01:53:19,064
[SPEAKER_11]: So just listen to the area.

1047
01:53:19,265 --> 01:53:20,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop driving here every morning.

1048
01:53:21,718 --> 01:53:27,564
[SPEAKER_11]: start walking here every day and realize this is the densest part of the city.

1049
01:53:28,224 --> 01:53:41,236
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanna put more density in the city, go to the areas that are less dense, put a little all around, spread it all around, but don't put more density in the most dense part of the city.

1050
01:53:41,537 --> 01:53:41,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1051
01:53:44,179 --> 01:53:45,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comments, Mary Ann.

1052
01:53:47,912 --> 01:53:49,494
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we will return to the podium.

1053
01:53:50,254 --> 01:53:52,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And for folks who have spoken already, we'll just request.

1054
01:53:54,559 --> 01:53:57,161
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only folks who have already spoke left, so we'll alternate back.

1055
01:53:57,522 --> 01:54:01,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And for folks who have already spoke, if you could try to limit your comments to just a minute or two, that'd be appreciated.

1056
01:54:01,586 --> 01:54:01,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1057
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:13,895
[SPEAKER_15]: I just a clarification regarding what President Baird said on the neighborhood around the Tufts slash Medford station regarding single family houses.

1058
01:54:13,915 --> 01:54:19,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So I asked that question during the last meeting to Director Hunt and there wasn't an answer.

1059
01:54:19,637 --> 01:54:27,520
[SPEAKER_15]: So I said, what would happen if someone that currently lives in that neighborhood in a single family home

1060
01:54:29,485 --> 01:54:40,569
[SPEAKER_15]: needs to not even tear down their house and build it again, but just like do a renovation that it's more than 50% of the total cost of the house.

1061
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:54,534
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was told that we couldn't have that discussion until we clarified with the building commissioner, because there's a difference between new construction related to permitting and new construction related to zoning.

1062
01:54:55,827 --> 01:55:18,979
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to know what happened between two weeks ago and this week to be sure that we can state without any doubt that someone that is currently living in that neighborhood in a single family home, and it's on a 120 year old house, can basically tear down the house and rebuild it without having any

1063
01:55:21,546 --> 01:55:25,651
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, impediment from the government to do that.

1064
01:55:25,771 --> 01:55:28,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that actually true, and where can I go and read about that?

1065
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:39,807
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't say any impediment, and knowing your definition of impediment, I'm just, I'm trying to be a little lighthearted, but

1066
01:55:40,783 --> 01:55:47,407
[SPEAKER_18]: We read the, if you want to, we read the non-conforming, we reviewed the non-conforming use and structure section of the ordinance.

1067
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:52,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And right now it allows you to build up to a hundred percent.

1068
01:55:53,271 --> 01:56:01,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So you could have, you have a 1300 square foot single family, and let's say a UR1 passes, it becomes a non-conforming use on that lot.

1069
01:56:01,796 --> 01:56:02,556
[SPEAKER_18]: You could build up to a 2600.

1070
01:56:04,157 --> 01:56:10,965
[SPEAKER_18]: square foot, single family, I think you have to do within two years but Alicia probably has that right in front of her.

1071
01:56:11,025 --> 01:56:11,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1072
01:56:11,705 --> 01:56:17,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Madam President, Alicia Hunt, part of what happened in the two weeks is I went out of town and they did some research.

1073
01:56:18,853 --> 01:56:21,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's actually in our zoning section 94 5.5.

1074
01:56:23,638 --> 01:56:29,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you, normally when we get questions like this, it's about commercial structures and stuff.

1075
01:56:29,701 --> 01:56:34,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But this section is specifically about single and two-family residential structures.

1076
01:56:35,425 --> 01:56:45,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And because it exists in zoning, the building commissioner is able to do these permits without them ever coming past our office, because we would only ever see them if they go to the zoning board.

1077
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So what it says is nonconforming single and two-family residential structures

1078
01:56:50,853 --> 01:57:11,299
[SPEAKER_08]: may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the building commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure and adds not more than 100% to its gross floor area.

1079
01:57:12,119 --> 01:57:14,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if I might give an example, when we see them

1080
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:26,108
[SPEAKER_08]: is we allow two and a half story buildings, which literally means a two story house with the second, the third floor being not more than 50% of the second floor.

1081
01:57:27,309 --> 01:57:38,017
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody wants to add dormers and make their third floor 75% of the second floor, that goes to the zoning board because that's increasing the nonconformity of it.

1082
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:41,780
[SPEAKER_08]: If however, and just assume they're on a lot that's too small.

1083
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of our single families are nonconforming right now.

1084
01:57:45,082 --> 01:57:56,965
[SPEAKER_08]: If, however, they want to do something like add an addition out the back that isn't going too close to the lot line, right, to the setbacks, they still need all their setbacks, that's fine.

1085
01:57:57,085 --> 01:57:58,886
[SPEAKER_08]: We would never see them up in our office.

1086
01:57:58,926 --> 01:58:01,186
[SPEAKER_08]: They would just get approved by the building commissioner.

1087
01:58:01,726 --> 01:58:07,908
[SPEAKER_08]: If there was a single family, if they were one story and they wanted to be two stories,

1088
01:58:09,101 --> 01:58:18,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were nonconforming, which lot size now or use later, they could just do that by right the building commissioner would approve it and we would never see it.

1089
01:58:18,813 --> 01:58:20,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's some, some of the difference.

1090
01:58:21,076 --> 01:58:24,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very similar to this use has to be continuous.

1091
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:28,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So if your house is abandoned for more than two years.

1092
01:58:29,025 --> 01:58:31,526
[SPEAKER_08]: you lose the protections of an existing.

1093
01:58:31,986 --> 01:58:36,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same as if a gas station is abandoned for more than two years.

1094
01:58:36,448 --> 01:58:42,410
[SPEAKER_08]: The difference being a fire, but I think you still have a requirement that you have to rebuild within two years of your fire.

1095
01:58:43,271 --> 01:58:49,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as it's a continuing or the use hasn't stopped for more than two years, you can do it.

1096
01:58:50,213 --> 01:58:54,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's special protections already in zoning for single and two family houses.

1097
01:58:55,105 --> 01:58:58,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just thought that we should be super clear about that.

1098
01:58:58,188 --> 01:59:04,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anybody wants to see it online, it's section 945.5 of our current zoning.

1099
01:59:08,557 --> 01:59:09,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Gaston, could you speak into the microphone?

1100
01:59:09,858 --> 01:59:10,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1101
01:59:10,078 --> 01:59:11,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they can't hear you.

1102
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:12,640
[SPEAKER_15]: What constitutes abandonment?

1103
01:59:13,681 --> 01:59:15,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So one stops paying taxes or what?

1104
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:18,324
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's if it's literally not in use.

1105
01:59:18,344 --> 01:59:21,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something that's come up in front of us over time.

1106
01:59:21,747 --> 01:59:23,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a piece of property.

1107
01:59:23,768 --> 01:59:27,531
[SPEAKER_08]: They are no longer using it for that use.

1108
01:59:28,111 --> 01:59:33,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So and the example that's come in front of me a few times is it's a gas station.

1109
01:59:33,134 --> 01:59:34,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a repair shop.

1110
01:59:34,595 --> 01:59:36,536
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's had a fence up and it's been closed.

1111
01:59:36,896 --> 01:59:38,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the owner still place taxes on it.

1112
01:59:39,357 --> 01:59:53,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the owner may say hey but we're using that building and I've got an old car in there and I work on it sometimes, but it's not a public repair shop and it hasn't been for six years that use has been abandoned, even though the property is not abandoned.

1113
01:59:54,321 --> 01:59:56,562
[SPEAKER_08]: so that protection does not stay.

1114
01:59:56,982 --> 02:00:09,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you had a single family house that was not occupied for more than two years, now imagine that actually happening, that's gonna be a weird situation, it's probably a foreclosure, like it's something weird going on there.

1115
02:00:11,088 --> 02:00:12,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that clarify it?

1116
02:00:13,049 --> 02:00:23,173
[SPEAKER_08]: But just because they pay taxes on it doesn't mean that it's not abandoned per zoning, it's that the use is no longer occurring at that location.

1117
02:00:39,533 --> 02:00:48,396
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I see one more hand raised on Zoom.

1118
02:00:48,856 --> 02:00:49,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Zachary, I'll unmute you.

1119
02:00:49,677 --> 02:00:52,618
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could keep your follow-up comments to just a moment or two, that'd be appreciated.

1120
02:00:52,638 --> 02:00:53,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

1121
02:00:53,978 --> 02:00:56,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, and this is the last one, and I promise it's not procedural.

1122
02:00:57,519 --> 02:01:23,245
[SPEAKER_19]: First, I wanted to appreciate the comment that you put forward, Vice President Collins, that with regards to the land value commentary and affordable housing, having had experience in these types of processes before, worked on them and experienced them, it often requires a regional planning effort involved with some of the multi-city committees that the mayor's already currently involved with to work out a regional plan for affordable housing, because the housing market doesn't limit itself to Medford.

1123
02:01:24,105 --> 02:01:39,546
[SPEAKER_19]: Zoning has the opportunity to improve it, but there's also a reason why non-market solutions are not really favored anymore because in the past they moved to and resulted in property dereliction, particularly as developers.

1124
02:01:40,307 --> 02:01:45,711
[SPEAKER_19]: tend to try to drive down the values for repurposing of those properties.

1125
02:01:47,112 --> 02:02:09,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Shifting the narrative a little bit, so far in looking at the fabric of the overall city where we can see that there's a lot of dissonance between where our densest centers are and where our transit access centers are, a lot of Medford's densest areas have evolved organically without real concentrated planning and spillover from their comparable density in their neighboring towns and cities.

1126
02:02:10,368 --> 02:02:12,910
[SPEAKER_19]: It's why we have low density valleys where we have them.

1127
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:23,116
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was wondering, because it's been hard for me to piece together with all of the different maps, and I appreciate we're segmenting the different community proposals because it's the easiest way to get through it.

1128
02:02:23,777 --> 02:02:39,307
[SPEAKER_19]: But is there anywhere available that Innis or the city can shed light on how the fabric is coming together to try to centralize zoning in Medford and fan it out rather than taking it zone by zone in a silo?

1129
02:02:40,027 --> 02:02:53,480
[SPEAKER_19]: to make the densest areas more dense, preserve the least dense areas without necessarily doing a full fabric review, to try to re-centralize and realign density with the highest density areas with those transit access quarters.

1130
02:02:54,140 --> 02:03:00,386
[SPEAKER_19]: It just seems like we're preserving a lot of the inconsistency about how our higher density areas have evolved.

1131
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:07,515
[SPEAKER_19]: rather than trying to change the character towards a more centralized and aligned density plan.

1132
02:03:08,016 --> 02:03:11,560
[SPEAKER_19]: I may be reading that wrong, but in trying to piece the maps together, it's just not clear.

1133
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:16,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1134
02:03:17,147 --> 02:03:17,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Zachary.

1135
02:03:17,788 --> 02:03:18,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate that comment.

1136
02:03:20,334 --> 02:03:40,132
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm apprehending your question correctly and I see Emily approaching the podium, I think for folks looking to get that kind of source material for where is the vision for this coming from, the land use map that Paola referenced up top at the start of the presentation from the comprehensive plan I look to is kind of the source image for

1137
02:03:42,293 --> 02:03:45,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we looking to do what we're looking to do where?

1138
02:03:45,716 --> 02:03:53,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's drawn on, as we know, looking at current features of the community, social, demographic, natural, architectural, et cetera.

1139
02:03:53,763 --> 02:03:56,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at existing trends, looking at what can occur where.

1140
02:03:58,748 --> 02:03:59,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that you've looked at it already.

1141
02:03:59,869 --> 02:04:04,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the best single source for how all of this comes together.

1142
02:04:04,112 --> 02:04:05,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that does shed light on

1143
02:04:07,655 --> 02:04:14,377
[SPEAKER_06]: both why the current density is where it is and why what we're trending towards is what it is as well.

1144
02:04:17,078 --> 02:04:18,798
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize for the interruption.

1145
02:04:18,898 --> 02:04:33,243
[SPEAKER_19]: It just doesn't seem like we're rectifying some of the density disparities that we currently have and instead are exacerbating some of the density variations that we have away from some of the critical infrastructure where it should be increasing.

1146
02:04:33,863 --> 02:04:36,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I may be reading that wrong, but that's what it looks like to me.

1147
02:04:37,741 --> 02:04:41,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It might also be that there are different opinions about where density should occur.

1148
02:04:41,143 --> 02:05:00,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that on our approach, there are many factors guiding where we think lower density is appropriate and where we think higher density is appropriate, but concentrating around major institutions, our best sources of transit and existing density is kind of the North Star for that.

1149
02:05:00,716 --> 02:05:03,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do wanna recognize Emily from Menace Associates who's approached the podium.

1150
02:05:05,126 --> 02:05:15,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, I do want to call attention to the maps that were at the beginning of the presentation I know this is online now I know that certainly for the people in the room.

1151
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:21,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little hard to see them on the screen for the people who may be joining us by zoom.

1152
02:05:22,472 --> 02:05:41,616
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to go to the PDF and zoom in and out of those maps I think might answer a lot of questions you'll see of course the map that we extracted from the comprehensive plan also your current zoning map, but it's the analysis I think that goes beyond that into the transit systems, you'll see in pages or slides 12 and 13 the current proposed

1153
02:05:45,637 --> 02:05:47,739
[SPEAKER_07]: mixed-use districts and how they break down.

1154
02:05:47,799 --> 02:05:49,640
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't studied them yet.

1155
02:05:49,820 --> 02:06:04,992
[SPEAKER_07]: We know, as we have with this residential-only process, where we've already started to talk about maybe we need to move a boundary of this district here, maybe we need to change that district there, that we will be doing the same thing with the mixed-use district.

1156
02:06:05,052 --> 02:06:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, this has been and continues to be an iterative process.

1157
02:06:09,555 --> 02:06:11,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to look at those.

1158
02:06:12,057 --> 02:06:14,779
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also the current types of residential dwellings,

1159
02:06:15,219 --> 02:06:33,062
[SPEAKER_07]: to see what you have now I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second, looking at, we show in this presentation, the lot size dimensions we also have the analysis of non conformities that we did at the beginning of the process, or this stage of the process last summer which is online.

1160
02:06:33,442 --> 02:06:38,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important to go and look at those so there's there's a lot of analytical work that's going into this.

1161
02:06:39,123 --> 02:06:54,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Paula mentioned the considerations that we talked about earlier, you know the proximity to transit with the proximity to job density areas, existing lot sizes and topography, there's a lot of topographical change.

1162
02:06:54,446 --> 02:07:00,987
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of barriers you have a river you have a train line what happens on one side can't necessarily happen on the other.

1163
02:07:01,627 --> 02:07:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And we like to, you know, think about how these areas are transitioning in between each other.

1164
02:07:07,172 --> 02:07:21,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say for the residential our initial remit has been and I think the slide at the end that shows proposed zoning districts for and the existing residential types, our remit has been for the residential only areas.

1165
02:07:22,044 --> 02:07:28,868
[SPEAKER_07]: to strike this balance between where do we simply recognize what's on the ground.

1166
02:07:29,008 --> 02:07:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why looking at the existing residential types is so important because what's on the ground doesn't necessarily match the uses that are in your current zoning district.

1167
02:07:41,036 --> 02:07:51,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at this very colorful map of where single family, two family, condo conversions, et cetera, exists now.

1168
02:07:51,702 --> 02:08:06,796
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at all of the other considerations and trying to decide how do we use these to draw these zoning boundaries and the reason we've been doing it and all of January and February, as it's not an easy decision reasonable people can disagree on where that boundary should be.

1169
02:08:07,577 --> 02:08:11,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We're excited at Innis about the conversation.

1170
02:08:11,379 --> 02:08:14,860
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have the Q&A to hear from more voices on that.

1171
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:16,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We've heard from some tonight.

1172
02:08:17,341 --> 02:08:19,763
[SPEAKER_07]: This is still very much that iterative process.

1173
02:08:19,803 --> 02:08:26,265
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to say that there's been a lot of technical analysis, existing conditions analysis.

1174
02:08:26,305 --> 02:08:30,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We do continue to visit different neighborhoods of Medford.

1175
02:08:30,907 --> 02:08:36,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we getting this right on the ground, as well as are we getting it right from the technical analyses?

1176
02:08:36,730 --> 02:09:04,148
[SPEAKER_07]: but is very much a balance of what's there now, what should be there based on the goals of the comprehensive plan based on these other considerations that we're taking into so thank you for the opportunity to answer that and I encourage people to dive into the maps because at least on the technical side, that is where we're getting a lot of the information, of course, from the public input side, it's these meetings and the other meetings that we've been holding.

1177
02:09:04,828 --> 02:09:05,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1178
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:06,189
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Emily.

1179
02:09:06,269 --> 02:09:08,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And I are there seconds.

1180
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:10,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll recognize you.

1181
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Emily, for that presentation.

1182
02:09:12,651 --> 02:09:15,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate you bringing us back to the context.

1183
02:09:16,613 --> 02:09:18,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Zachary, please go ahead for another minute.

1184
02:09:18,354 --> 02:09:24,656
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is this is the last bit the existing conditions analysis, Emily, and I apologize for any informality that you referenced.

1185
02:09:25,837 --> 02:09:29,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Are those publicly available or those only for disclosure to the city?

1186
02:09:30,379 --> 02:09:31,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are publicly available.

1187
02:09:31,379 --> 02:09:31,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing.

1188
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:33,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1189
02:09:35,221 --> 02:09:36,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go next to the podium.

1190
02:09:37,482 --> 02:09:38,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1191
02:09:38,703 --> 02:09:39,364
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

1192
02:09:40,344 --> 02:09:42,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

1193
02:09:43,206 --> 02:09:51,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to speak in general support of the overall plan here and appreciation for moving the city forward.

1194
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:54,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a quick anecdote.

1195
02:09:54,873 --> 02:09:55,794
[SPEAKER_16]: A few months ago, I was kind of

1196
02:09:56,870 --> 02:10:19,290
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of short but enjoyable weekend in Astoria, Queens, which if folks aren't familiar with it, has a lot of basically like two or three story, you know, two and three family houses and fairly high density with, you know, shops within, you know, decent walking distance.

1197
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:20,010
[SPEAKER_16]: And

1198
02:10:21,951 --> 02:10:34,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I, you know, I just found it to be overall like, you know, an enjoyable neighborhood where, you know, you know, friends living in the same neighborhood who, you know, maybe had other friends as tenants even in their, in the buildings.

1199
02:10:35,582 --> 02:10:38,325
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was, it was nice.

1200
02:10:38,405 --> 02:10:41,367
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it was not at all incompatible with a sense of community.

1201
02:10:41,387 --> 02:10:44,290
[SPEAKER_16]: I felt very strong sense of community there.

1202
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:47,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that like this gradual increase in zoning,

1203
02:10:48,922 --> 02:11:02,967
[SPEAKER_16]: and the plans for, I think, fostering, you know, more opportunities and outlets, you know, for people to, you know, engage and interact with one another, you know, does work to improve the city.

1204
02:11:03,147 --> 02:11:13,951
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm, you know, excited for, you know, where that goes, although I realize it probably will take a long time for some or a lot of that to, you know, mature and develop.

1205
02:11:14,811 --> 02:11:15,411
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's all.

1206
02:11:15,491 --> 02:11:15,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1207
02:11:17,072 --> 02:11:17,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comments.

1208
02:11:19,211 --> 02:11:21,092
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Eric on Zoom.

1209
02:11:22,252 --> 02:11:23,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1210
02:11:23,613 --> 02:11:24,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have three minutes.

1211
02:11:26,854 --> 02:11:29,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Eric Bergland, 782 Marshall Street.

1212
02:11:29,195 --> 02:11:30,716
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll keep my comment brief.

1213
02:11:31,436 --> 02:11:45,703
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to add a voice in support of the committee's vision for the zoning change and the benefits to our community character and other benefits it would bring, such as mitigation of climate change that zoning near mass transit would promote.

1214
02:11:46,063 --> 02:11:46,343
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1215
02:11:48,888 --> 02:11:49,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your comments, Eric.

1216
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I see no further hands on Zoom for the moment.

1217
02:11:56,212 --> 02:11:57,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Any additional public comment in the chambers?

1218
02:12:02,715 --> 02:12:04,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1219
02:12:04,697 --> 02:12:07,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Lori Spinifly, 55 Garfield Avenue.

1220
02:12:10,848 --> 02:12:12,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I've lived in this city my entire life.

1221
02:12:13,029 --> 02:12:20,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you telling me that the historical values of the homes in the city, which are mostly single family, don't matter anymore?

1222
02:12:23,273 --> 02:12:25,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up next door to Park Street.

1223
02:12:26,235 --> 02:12:29,036
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a house there on Park Street that

1224
02:12:30,523 --> 02:12:32,364
[SPEAKER_09]: is circus.

1225
02:12:33,144 --> 02:12:36,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what the year it was, but it's historical homes.

1226
02:12:36,605 --> 02:12:42,007
[SPEAKER_09]: These people weren't even able to do things to their homes because they were historical homes.

1227
02:12:43,088 --> 02:12:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really don't understand why we should be discriminated by the state

1228
02:12:50,237 --> 02:12:57,001
[SPEAKER_09]: as one of the 177 communities who happen to have the transit system in.

1229
02:12:57,661 --> 02:13:09,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Which brings up a question, and maybe you can answer or confirm this, that I'm hearing now that the car bombs on Salem Street are now moving to the Budweiser plant.

1230
02:13:09,848 --> 02:13:10,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct?

1231
02:13:11,088 --> 02:13:11,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not aware of this.

1232
02:13:12,729 --> 02:13:14,270
[SPEAKER_09]: You would know, you're the zoning people.

1233
02:13:21,481 --> 02:13:22,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Budweiser.

1234
02:13:24,623 --> 02:13:37,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if, if they are, and that's the word around town, what happens to the toxic area on Salem street that has been housing the car bonds my entire life?

1235
02:13:39,575 --> 02:13:47,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think, so now you're going to create another toxic area by allowing them to go to that property.

1236
02:13:47,762 --> 02:13:49,043
[SPEAKER_09]: If that is truly the case.

1237
02:13:50,141 --> 02:13:52,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And people in that area, that's what they're hearing.

1238
02:13:55,285 --> 02:14:00,849
[SPEAKER_09]: And on Salem Street, we're 1.25 miles from Walden Station.

1239
02:14:01,649 --> 02:14:07,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should not be getting the majority of the density in the city.

1240
02:14:08,194 --> 02:14:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Salem Street is not a corridor, it's a street.

1241
02:14:12,177 --> 02:14:13,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a very congested street.

1242
02:14:14,578 --> 02:14:16,760
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, my husband took pictures

1243
02:14:17,937 --> 02:14:21,759
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to get into our driveway last week at 4.30 in the afternoon.

1244
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't even move down in that area.

1245
02:14:26,721 --> 02:14:29,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're looking to put all this housing.

1246
02:14:30,463 --> 02:14:43,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And the caller last week who asked about affordable housing, which you actually said, oh, that's terrible, another displaced Methodist.

1247
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:44,951
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my nephew.

1248
02:14:45,848 --> 02:14:46,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

1249
02:14:46,668 --> 02:14:52,310
[SPEAKER_09]: He's driving 60 miles from Manchester, New Hampshire to go to his job here in Memphis.

1250
02:14:53,370 --> 02:15:01,132
[SPEAKER_09]: He's five generations in this city, and he can't live here because there's nothing to buy.

1251
02:15:02,093 --> 02:15:04,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked him, he called me tonight, he goes, are you going to the meeting?

1252
02:15:04,773 --> 02:15:06,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm going to the meeting.

1253
02:15:06,394 --> 02:15:14,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask you, Jim, if you were able to buy at this point in your life, what would you be looking to buy?

1254
02:15:15,582 --> 02:15:23,625
[SPEAKER_09]: a single family home, because that's where he wants to raise a family, not in an apartment building, not in a condo.

1255
02:15:24,245 --> 02:15:29,227
[SPEAKER_09]: You obviously don't have children of your own because you need space when you have children.

1256
02:15:31,008 --> 02:15:32,848
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need any more density.

1257
02:15:33,228 --> 02:15:43,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am truly concerned about my property right now, because I have an abandoned home that's been empty for six years.

1258
02:15:44,077 --> 02:15:46,599
[SPEAKER_09]: after Ray's another story.

1259
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:57,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I've even called him asking to rent, lease, purchase, but various people in my family and friends, nothing.

1260
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:11,120
[SPEAKER_09]: He takes that, a developer comes in and wants to buy that house and the commercial going across to the three Decker and then Jackson's place.

1261
02:16:12,549 --> 02:16:14,490
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like a huge complex.

1262
02:16:15,871 --> 02:16:24,296
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't have any sunlight, we won't have any air, nor will we have any privacy as single family residents in that area.

1263
02:16:25,897 --> 02:16:32,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see you going down to West Medford and putting pictures out for four stories.

1264
02:16:33,021 --> 02:16:40,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that whole square is commercial as well as residential and single families.

1265
02:16:41,718 --> 02:16:46,879
[SPEAKER_09]: None of what you're proposing is going to bring affordable housing to the city at all.

1266
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:57,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And having lived here all my life, Washington Street, at least when they tried to do affordable housing, they put a lottery in there for Medford residents.

1267
02:16:58,362 --> 02:16:59,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Got first come.

1268
02:17:01,543 --> 02:17:05,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe it was like 10 years that they had to own it before they could sell it.

1269
02:17:07,044 --> 02:17:08,564
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to get affordable housing.

1270
02:17:08,924 --> 02:17:10,965
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to decrease our property values

1271
02:17:11,342 --> 02:17:16,246
[SPEAKER_09]: by all your developers that you have in your pockets to build this stuff.

1272
02:17:16,547 --> 02:17:20,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the residents, you can say we can go up two, three stories.

1273
02:17:21,251 --> 02:17:22,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people can't afford to do that.

1274
02:17:23,513 --> 02:17:26,255
[SPEAKER_09]: We just had a 10.5% tax increase.

1275
02:17:26,816 --> 02:17:30,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're going for an $8 million water and soil loan.

1276
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:38,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really disturbing that we have records from the 1800s when our homes were built.

1277
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:41,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't have anything from them beyond.

1278
02:17:42,792 --> 02:17:43,733
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the fire?

1279
02:17:43,753 --> 02:17:45,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I never heard about that.

1280
02:17:47,937 --> 02:17:49,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And all these records were destroyed.

1281
02:17:49,719 --> 02:17:51,100
[SPEAKER_09]: When was it, and where was it?

1282
02:17:54,342 --> 02:18:00,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to keep our conversation to the topics that were noticed for this community meeting at the City Council meeting last night.

1283
02:18:00,387 --> 02:18:07,013
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about an MWA bond for replacing lead servicemen.

1284
02:18:07,413 --> 02:18:11,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be beyond that today.

1285
02:18:13,098 --> 02:18:15,620
[SPEAKER_06]: We're veering into a separate issue here.

1286
02:18:16,081 --> 02:18:19,544
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just keep moving it around so people don't know that it's there?

1287
02:18:22,537 --> 02:18:24,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know how to begin to respond to the comment.

1288
02:18:25,079 --> 02:18:29,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's what happened to the $25 million that were in the free cash, wasn't it?

1289
02:18:29,862 --> 02:18:32,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It all moved around to other different buckets.

1290
02:18:32,083 --> 02:18:33,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it doesn't exist.

1291
02:18:33,264 --> 02:18:33,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it exists.

1292
02:18:34,004 --> 02:18:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the capital stabilization fund.

1293
02:18:35,806 --> 02:18:37,867
[SPEAKER_18]: It's in the city's reserve funds.

1294
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:40,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did you move it all around?

1295
02:18:40,593 --> 02:18:42,254
[SPEAKER_09]: So that it could be put to productive use.

1296
02:18:42,274 --> 02:18:49,300
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so it can be accessed during the time between when the fiscal year ends and when free cash is certified each year.

1297
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:51,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, the money is not accessible for use.

1298
02:18:51,482 --> 02:18:51,902
[SPEAKER_18]: It's state.

1299
02:18:52,583 --> 02:18:54,605
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are crushing the city.

1300
02:18:54,645 --> 02:18:55,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Crushing it.

1301
02:18:55,786 --> 02:18:55,886
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1302
02:18:57,195 --> 02:18:58,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your comments.

1303
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:01,141
[SPEAKER_18]: I can comment on a couple pieces of that.

1304
02:19:02,564 --> 02:19:07,812
[SPEAKER_18]: On the car barn question, I think you can see from the zoning that we

1305
02:19:11,028 --> 02:19:22,272
[SPEAKER_18]: are really hoping that we could see that neighborhood knit back together with the disruptive MBTA site, hopefully paired with the target site in the large parking lot.

1306
02:19:22,352 --> 02:19:28,935
[SPEAKER_18]: The idea for Haines Square is that we no longer have bus storage, but and essentially

1307
02:19:29,835 --> 02:19:41,060
[SPEAKER_18]: empty parking lots and bus storage, but a vibrant mixed-use district on Salem Street and on the Felsway, where we have the T property now.

1308
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:47,403
[SPEAKER_18]: But we haven't, as Alicia noted, A, we can't control the MBTA from buying anything.

1309
02:19:47,463 --> 02:19:51,285
[SPEAKER_18]: If they bought the Budweiser location and plan to put something there, that's their

1310
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:53,451
[SPEAKER_18]: choice to do that.

1311
02:19:54,291 --> 02:20:04,276
[SPEAKER_18]: The city doesn't control who buys and sells property, nor do we control what the state agencies do, much to our chagrin, I would add.

1312
02:20:08,138 --> 02:20:10,319
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really, I think, all I have there.

1313
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:12,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Just on this affordability question,

1314
02:20:17,844 --> 02:20:19,305
[SPEAKER_18]: trying to collect my thoughts.

1315
02:20:19,665 --> 02:20:39,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I think something that we talk about, like we're, and it's happened multiple times on the different policies that we've tried to look at here, whether we're talking about a conversation about condo conversion or rent stabilization or rental registry or transfer fee or zoning, those are all

1316
02:20:40,601 --> 02:20:46,843
[SPEAKER_18]: individual potential pieces of a comprehensive solution to a regional housing crisis.

1317
02:20:46,883 --> 02:20:50,844
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are also pieces of the solution that are within the scope of what the city can do.

1318
02:20:52,225 --> 02:21:06,650
[SPEAKER_18]: What we're seeing regionally is high demand for housing, stagnant supply due to the financialization and commodification of land and housing, due to the high cost of construction,

1319
02:21:07,561 --> 02:21:12,944
[SPEAKER_18]: doing to regulatory limits on supply and zoning, and what you end up seeing is increasing prices.

1320
02:21:13,825 --> 02:21:18,927
[SPEAKER_18]: And in terms of a comprehensive solution, there are basically three options.

1321
02:21:18,967 --> 02:21:20,228
[SPEAKER_18]: You can increase supply.

1322
02:21:21,729 --> 02:21:32,235
[SPEAKER_18]: One is by reducing those regulatory barriers to construction by allowing people to build larger structures and more housing units than they were before, which is generally done through zoning.

1323
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:38,498
[SPEAKER_18]: You can have public funding for the construction of housing, generally that's income restricted and affordable housing.

1324
02:21:39,138 --> 02:21:40,899
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's your increased supply bucket.

1325
02:21:41,919 --> 02:21:50,722
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we all know the city of Medford does not have large amounts of money to build housing, nor are we allowed to borrow money using municipal bonds to build housing.

1326
02:21:51,382 --> 02:21:58,345
[SPEAKER_18]: So in that increasing supply bucket, basically the only tool we have is to change the zoning and the rules for private land.

1327
02:21:59,617 --> 02:22:01,318
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's increased supply, that's one solution.

1328
02:22:01,358 --> 02:22:03,639
[SPEAKER_18]: The second solution is you can subsidize costs.

1329
02:22:04,199 --> 02:22:07,481
[SPEAKER_18]: So you could increase rental assistance.

1330
02:22:09,002 --> 02:22:12,524
[SPEAKER_18]: That's to try to just reduce the price to the end user.

1331
02:22:13,645 --> 02:22:16,286
[SPEAKER_18]: We've generally seen that that's not an effective solution.

1332
02:22:16,866 --> 02:22:19,027
[SPEAKER_18]: It's basically a pass through to property owners.

1333
02:22:20,668 --> 02:22:27,532
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been some ways that this has worked a little bit better, like inclusionary zoning, which is like getting a private subsidy.

1334
02:22:29,673 --> 02:22:31,033
[SPEAKER_18]: for housing.

1335
02:22:32,034 --> 02:22:33,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, there are federal programs around this.

1336
02:22:34,854 --> 02:22:39,695
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the third thing you can do is you can control, literally do price controls.

1337
02:22:40,215 --> 02:22:45,316
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can have rent control, rent stabilization, or you can limit profiteering, right?

1338
02:22:45,496 --> 02:22:49,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are essentially your three solutions to the problem.

1339
02:22:49,297 --> 02:22:51,358
[SPEAKER_18]: And the problem is that the price of housing is too high.

1340
02:22:53,178 --> 02:22:57,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what's actually within our power to do in that entire bucket?

1341
02:22:57,988 --> 02:23:00,789
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the state authority to do rent stabilization.

1342
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:11,975
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have the state authority to do the transfer fee, which is a price control in some ways, or at least it de-incentivizes profiteering.

1343
02:23:13,436 --> 02:23:20,940
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's in some ways a private subsidy, because if someone wants to, if you instituted a transfer fee on a flip or flipped houses, for example,

1344
02:23:21,872 --> 02:23:34,556
[SPEAKER_18]: you could then, you know, someone still went through that, A, it's disincentivizing that because they're gonna have to pay more money, and then that money goes to the city and that could be used to subsidize cost of housing or fund construction of new housing.

1345
02:23:35,916 --> 02:23:39,277
[SPEAKER_18]: But my point generally being that those are your policy options.

1346
02:23:40,397 --> 02:23:49,140
[SPEAKER_18]: And I personally support a combination of those options, but within our authority, and the reason we've spent 20, this is the 20th meeting?

1347
02:23:50,219 --> 02:24:04,982
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think the reason that we put so much of our focus on the zoning question is that it's the only element of that policy basket that is entirely within municipal control, or at least largely within municipal control by Massachusetts law.

1348
02:24:07,082 --> 02:24:10,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Do I agree that just changing the zoning solves the problem?

1349
02:24:10,783 --> 02:24:11,023
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1350
02:24:12,703 --> 02:24:16,284
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just think it's why we're spending so much time talking about it.

1351
02:24:17,675 --> 02:24:27,399
[SPEAKER_18]: So just wanted to put that out there again, because I think it's important to note that we have talked about asking the state to give us more authority in some of these other policies.

1352
02:24:27,419 --> 02:24:33,562
[SPEAKER_18]: We either haven't asked them, or they've said no to other cities, so we haven't tried to ask them.

1353
02:24:35,442 --> 02:24:36,983
[SPEAKER_18]: But personally, I would support.

1354
02:24:40,132 --> 02:24:46,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, I would support the state and federal government spending billions of dollars to build more income-restricted and affordable housing.

1355
02:24:46,716 --> 02:25:03,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's actually the huge missing piece of these conversations when it comes to increasing the supply of housing that's actually affordable for most people and allowing people of all incomes to afford housing in Medford.

1356
02:25:03,586 --> 02:25:03,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1357
02:25:05,707 --> 02:25:06,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Paris.

1358
02:25:08,508 --> 02:25:20,937
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the many issues on which localities, municipalities are left fighting for scraps to try to feed a vast array of critical needs and constituent services.

1359
02:25:21,518 --> 02:25:22,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll recognize Councilor Lemming.

1360
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1361
02:25:26,041 --> 02:25:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to echo the point that a lot of the fundamental points that

1362
02:25:34,622 --> 02:25:43,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Council President Behrs was just saying, except in more fundamental terms, which is that a lot of this is about trade-offs.

1363
02:25:45,848 --> 02:25:59,496
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not ever going to have a situation where you have a neighborhood consisting of a bunch of beautiful single-family homes that your nephew can afford.

1364
02:26:01,504 --> 02:26:03,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless your nephew is very rich.

1365
02:26:03,805 --> 02:26:09,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not that was the Situation in an economy from a few generations ago.

1366
02:26:09,888 --> 02:26:12,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the case today.

1367
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:18,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So you If you want to if you want to talk if you want to

1368
02:26:20,454 --> 02:26:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about issues with density, that's a conversation that can be had.

1369
02:26:23,896 --> 02:26:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk about issues with affordability, that's a conversation that can be had.

1370
02:26:29,459 --> 02:26:45,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to come up and talk about how you don't want density, but you also don't want your kids or grandkids to be pushed out of the community because they can't afford it, those are contradictory things because

1371
02:26:47,239 --> 02:26:49,284
[SPEAKER_02]: because of just basic supply and demand.

1372
02:26:49,344 --> 02:26:52,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is...

1373
02:26:53,819 --> 02:26:57,781
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to be a case where everybody can have everything they want.

1374
02:26:57,921 --> 02:27:14,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason that rezoning is happening is because enough of the community over time came together and realized that keeping things at the status quo would be a worse state of affairs than changing them.

1375
02:27:14,608 --> 02:27:18,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are trying to change them into something that would be better.

1376
02:27:20,627 --> 02:27:23,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And as people have been saying, not everybody is going to agree on that.

1377
02:27:23,810 --> 02:27:42,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But I personally do want to do this to prioritize the affordability and supply issues that have been facing both this community and frankly, the rest of the nation for a long time.

1378
02:27:42,688 --> 02:27:45,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if

1379
02:27:47,282 --> 02:27:57,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of my further colleagues would also want to speak further if there's any more public comment, but I'm not seeing any, so I'd just like to follow that up with a motion to adjourn.

1380
02:28:00,548 --> 02:28:00,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1381
02:28:00,968 --> 02:28:07,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So we currently have on the table a motion from prior to public comment from President Behrs.

1382
02:28:08,292 --> 02:28:13,734
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a motion to... A motion to refer the draft to the regular meeting.

1383
02:28:16,985 --> 02:28:19,848
[SPEAKER_18]: take that to combine that with the motion to adjourn.

1384
02:28:19,868 --> 02:28:20,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1385
02:28:22,270 --> 02:28:23,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second that.

1386
02:28:23,651 --> 02:28:30,678
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a motion to refer this draft of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal to a regular meeting and to adjourn.

1387
02:28:30,738 --> 02:28:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to reiterate one more time, this draft is being referred to the City Council for regular meeting where procedurally will be immediately referred to the Community Development Board

1388
02:28:39,806 --> 02:28:41,387
[SPEAKER_06]: to begin the public hearings process.

1389
02:28:43,489 --> 02:28:44,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And those will be noticed.

1390
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also working to schedule a public Q and A, which is separate from the public hearing process, just an addition onto it and an opportunity for additional public comment that we will work to schedule for some time before the CD board starts its public hearing on this topic.

1391
02:29:00,281 --> 02:29:06,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the public hearing will continue in the city council when it's referred back from the CD board.

1392
02:29:08,735 --> 02:29:15,598
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by President Behrs to refer to City Council and adjourn, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1393
02:29:16,558 --> 02:29:17,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1394
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:21,740
[SPEAKER_04]: President Behrs?

1395
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:22,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1396
02:29:23,141 --> 02:29:23,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

1397
02:29:26,902 --> 02:29:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she's on anymore.

1398
02:29:28,483 --> 02:29:29,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like she dropped off.

1399
02:29:30,024 --> 02:29:31,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli did as well.

1400
02:29:31,104 --> 02:29:32,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1401
02:29:33,385 --> 02:29:33,905

1402
02:29:34,285 --> 02:29:34,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Three in favor, two absent, the motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
