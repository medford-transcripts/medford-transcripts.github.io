[SPEAKER_11]: to educational opportunities, to find a deputy's service, to the citizens of Medford, as a city hall mayor and state representative.

11
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:43,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy to be on this beautiful campus and to talk about what wonderful things you're going to see and hear and learn about the McGlynn School today.

12
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

13
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,693
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Mr. Tucci, principal of the McGlynn Middle School, and welcome to the McGlynn Middle School remote open house.

14
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my honor to be speaking to you remotely here today to introduce you to our school.

15
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:00,245
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening to this video, I'm sure that you've gotten your results.

16
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:06,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope you're very happy, because I know we are very enthused to accept you and welcome you.

17
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,368
[SPEAKER_07]: to the McGlynn Middle School.

18
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:25,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a great time to be on board our school, and I hope that today's presentation is going to welcome you and introduce you to our school in a fashion where you'll get to know some teachers, some students, and a little bit about the building and the activities and how you can find your way as a Mustang here at the McGlynn.

19
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:30,444
[SPEAKER_07]: The John J. McGlynn Middle School serves 440 students in grades 6, 7, and 8.

20
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:34,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Each grade level consists of two academic teams on side A, B,

21
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:48,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Each team is made up of an English language arts teacher, social studies teacher, science teacher, math teacher, English language learner teacher, and special education teacher.

22
00:03:49,706 --> 00:04:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to the academic classes, students have the opportunity for exploratory classes during the school day, plus an array of expanding after-school clubs and greater Boston League sports on a seasonal basis.

23
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: In the 2020 school year,

24
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,842
[SPEAKER_07]: all world language students, grades six through eight, meet three times per week.

25
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:19,670
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, students that were identified as needing intervention in math and ELA were assigned to math and literacy skills classes that meet three times per week.

26
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:33,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Our school also has a wind block that meets once per week and has continued to engage students for what I need, that's what that acronym stands for, which is another means of intervention overseen by their co-homeroom teachers

27
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:49,551
[SPEAKER_07]: The wind block has also been used as a vehicle to build school culture and promote social-emotional learning through the use of these principle-driven school assemblies and activities that take place during a day in the life of a McGlynn Middle School student.

28
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:55,195
[SPEAKER_07]: When you arrive at the McGlynn Middle School, students arrive each day to school between 7.15 and about 7.45 in the morning.

29
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,042
[SPEAKER_07]: you arrive through our front door and come into our cafeteria.

30
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:05,384
[SPEAKER_07]: In our cafeteria we encourage all students to have a free breakfast to start your day.

31
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:15,448
[SPEAKER_07]: In the cafeteria you can eat your breakfast and socialize with your friends, but also you have the opportunity to head outside, hang out with your friends, play a little bit of ball in the schoolyard,

32
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:29,323
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, if you have a little bit of work to get done prior to the school day, we encourage students to head up to our library, where you can have some quiet time to access the computer, collaborate with small groups of friends on some schoolwork as well in the library center.

33
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a fantastic opportunity to start your day.

34
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:39,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And at 7.50, the school bell will ring to begin the day where all students will head up into their homes.

35
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:49,573
[SPEAKER_07]: You head up to your homerooms, go to your locker, and then shortly after you put your belongings away at your locker, you head into your homeroom, where you'll have two homeroom teachers.

36
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll sit down and watch our McGlynn Morning News Show.

37
00:05:53,754 --> 00:06:06,298
[SPEAKER_07]: The McGlynn Morning News Show is a fantastic way to be informed, to start your day with some great, engaged, and fantastic student presenters that will present the morning news and activities to begin your day.

38
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:07,678
[SPEAKER_07]: After homeroom,

39
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will be having and going through eight different 45-minute periods during the course of the school day.

40
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:22,795
[SPEAKER_07]: During these eight 45-minute time periods, students will have the opportunity to go to each one of their core classes.

41
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:31,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We also get to have a double block where one of your core classes will meet for back-to-back periods during the course of that school day as well.

42
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:37,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will engage in those eight 45-minute periods during the day and get dismissed at 2.15.

43
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:52,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, after dismissal, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, we have after-school programming that takes place on those days, Tuesday through Thursday, from 2.15 until about 3.05.

44
00:06:53,212 --> 00:07:00,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And during that, we encourage students to get involved with sports, clubs, activities, and the arts.

45
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:15,429
[SPEAKER_07]: We also offer a late bus service on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to drop off students, pick up students at the school and drop them off at their household on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday so that they can take advantage of extracurricular activities.

46
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Jodi, the assistant principal.

47
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,971
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see me in the mornings when you're having breakfast with your friends.

48
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:29,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to check in with kids at this time because I'm one of the people that you can come to with any questions or concerns.

49
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,433
[SPEAKER_09]: always find a solution, or at least help.

50
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:41,779
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the great tips that I want to share with you is to get to know all the adults in your buildings, especially the teachers for all the team.

51
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:47,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Other pieces of advice I'd like to share, middle school is a great place to spread your wings.

52
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:52,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Join an activity, a sport, or volunteer at one of our many events.

53
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,126
[SPEAKER_09]: These are times and places that you can

54
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Find your talent, meet new people, and develop those talents.

55
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, try to make a new friend each day.

56
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So please say hi and be kind.

57
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:22,542
[SPEAKER_07]: During middle school, students will have the opportunity to engage in their core academic curriculum classes, like math, English, language arts, science, and social studies.

58
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: But in addition to those classes there, in order to become a very well-rounded student, we also offer a unified arts curriculum.

59
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:37,851
[SPEAKER_07]: These are classes like world languages, Spanish and Italian, physical education, general music, art,

60
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:46,741
[SPEAKER_07]: computer technology, science technology, health, and orchestra are certainly options too as well to embed in the schedule.

61
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:47,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And also,

62
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,274
[SPEAKER_07]: and literacy skills.

63
00:08:54,614 --> 00:09:07,420
[SPEAKER_10]: The Unified Arts Curriculum is a great way to become a well-rounded student, and we love to say that they educate, we educate the whole child here at the Brooklyn Middle School, and they certainly help us accomplish that.

64
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, these Unified Arts classes, classes like General Music, Art, Computer Technology, and Science Technology, they meet on a quarterly basis.

65
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:21,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So a class, for instance, like Art, would meet for the first quarter,

66
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: four times a week, and then a student that takes art first quarter would then cycle on to the next UA rotation.

67
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:39,916
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, a student taking art first quarter might go to general music second quarter, third quarter they might then go to computer technology, and fourth quarter they can finish up the science technology class.

68
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:44,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Those UA rotational classes meet four times per week.

69
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,383
[SPEAKER_10]: You really get to know the subject matter and the teacher

70
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:51,443
[SPEAKER_10]: classes.

71
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:56,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Health and Guidance are both classes that actually meet on a semester basis.

72
00:09:56,547 --> 00:10:05,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So during first semester, which is quarters one and two, students who take health would take health first and second quarter, and then third quarter they would then take

73
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:06,415
[SPEAKER_07]: guidance.

74
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,877
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the rotations work for our Unified Arts classes.

75
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:18,103
[SPEAKER_07]: World language classes like Spanish or Italian, these classes meet all year round for three times per week.

76
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:26,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And most students may have physical education two times per week during the course of the entire school year.

77
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:34,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Now one of my biggest pieces of advice as your principal and getting acclimated to the middle school is to get involved right away in one of the extracurricular

78
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,910
[SPEAKER_07]: here at the McGlynn Middle School.

79
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:46,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We offer a wide array of them and these typically take place after school Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

80
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:55,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a whole host of clubs and activities like Student Council, Technology and Engineering Club, Chorus Club, Chess Club, Book Club, Drama Club, Builders Club,

81
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:05,257
[SPEAKER_07]: our media club, open gym, running club, yearbook, and our award-winning orchestra ensemble.

82
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,641
[SPEAKER_07]: You name a club, we have it.

83
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And also we share our clubs and activities with the Andrews Middle School.

84
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:23,883
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fantastic way for a lot of Glynn Middle School students to join up with your fellow peers at the end of middle school after school so that you can engage in the clubs and activities that both schools have to offer.

85
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:32,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Now one new activity that we just began offering this current school year that will also be available next year is our sports program.

86
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:46,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really fantastic to see that the middle schools have joined with the Greater Boston League to offer sports like softball and baseball and cross country and girls and boys basketball and out to a track.

87
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:58,444
[SPEAKER_07]: We look forward to expanding these sports and competing as Mustangs on the playing field and representing our fantastic school and community and the different communities in the Greater Boston League area.

88
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,625
[SPEAKER_07]: At the McGlynn Middle School,

89
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustang Way philosophy.

90
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,572
[SPEAKER_04]: At the McGlynn Middle School, we are all Mustangs.

91
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,114
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to do things the Mustang Way every day.

92
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:15,876
[SPEAKER_07]: That means we respect each other in all of our interactions.

93
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We respect our school building and property.

94
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:23,000
[SPEAKER_07]: We demonstrate good citizenship and we work hard to achieve our goals.

95
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:31,424
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, at the McGlynn Middle School, I try to preach the philosophy of bringing your ace every single day you walk in the doors of our school.

96
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:38,389
[SPEAKER_07]: ACE is an acronym that stands for A for Attitude, C for Concentration, and E for Effort.

97
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:46,493
[SPEAKER_07]: If you bring your ACE every single school day, I know that it will help you find your success as a student and person during your middle school years.

98
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:57,109
[SPEAKER_10]: what it's like to be a student of McGlynn Middle School led by some of our eighth grade ambassadors.

99
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:09,819
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll also have a chance to hear from some of our current students and teachers where they share with you some of their success and also they'll tell you a little bit about what they feel about how they feel McGlynn Middle School is a very special place.

100
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:16,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we conclude, I do want to share with you three things that I ask of my students each and every day.

101
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:22,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like you to think about these as you begin to transition from elementary school to middle school.

102
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are the three things I expect out of my students at school each and every day.

103
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:30,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask them to be the best that you can be every day.

104
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to pass along what you've learned to others.

105
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,664
[SPEAKER_07]: and I want you to leave the world better than you found it.

106
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:49,513
[SPEAKER_07]: You do those three things, I'm confident that you will certainly make an impact during the course of your time as a middle school student at McGlynn Middle School, and certainly prepare yourself for the road ahead.

107
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:57,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching our sixth grade McGlynn Middle School remote open house, and enjoy the rest of our video.

108
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome to the McGlynn Middle School.

109
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,936
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Mr. Tucci, the principal of the McGlynn Middle School.

110
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

111
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:20,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

112
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:21,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the McGlynn.

113
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:23,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the McGlynn.

114
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the McGlynn.

115
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:26,578
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Margaret.

116
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:27,678
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm from Isabella.

117
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to be your eighth grade and math teacher.

118
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,699
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to be showing you around our school.

119
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:43,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Here at the McGlinn Middle School, we follow the Mustang Way and we honor those who live by the Mustang Way as well.

120
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:46,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of following the Mustang Way is to bring your ACE every day to school.

121
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,840
[SPEAKER_07]: ACE stands for Attitude, Concentration, and Effort.

122
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do that, you're going to be on your path to success at our school.

123
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,725
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait to get to class.

124
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

125
00:14:59,225 --> 00:14:59,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go!

126
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:29,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Here at the McGlynn, we value concentration in our studies.

127
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:33,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Here at the McGlynn, we always keep our eye on our lungs.

128
00:15:53,506 --> 00:16:04,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Here at the McGlynn, we realize the importance of bringing our best effort to school every day, in our studies and in our extracurriculars.

129
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:39,589
[SPEAKER_13]: We are some of the sixth grade teachers and we just wanted to give you some words of advice.

130
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,732
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing for me is, we're always here to help, just ask.

131
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:46,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay organized and keep your mind clean.

132
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:48,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be nervous, everything's gonna be fine.

133
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't forget to save for extra help before testing quizzes.

134
00:16:54,338 --> 00:17:02,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Here at the McGlynn, we have a variety of clubs and activities that we encourage you to join.

135
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:18,894
[SPEAKER_13]: clubs and activities such as Drama Club, which recently did the Brothers Green Spectacular Con this past year, and Student Council, which has an upcoming rock and roll show, and we have Orchestra, which you can probably see behind us, and we also have String Ensemble and Culture Club.

136
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:19,836
[SPEAKER_13]: We have lots of different things.

137
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for tuning in to Montgomery Windows.

138
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:04,125
Thank you.

139
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:45,458
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope you enjoyed the tour of our school.

140
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,120
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the McGlynn.

141
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We are Mustangs.

142
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: We look forward to you joining our family.

143
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:09,937
[SPEAKER_03]: What we want to do is we're going to try to surround them with information in order to help them achieve a better balance in this age of visual distraction.

144
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:12,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Principal Nick Tucci loves the idea.

145
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Challenge the kids to take breaks, but on their terms with small, real goals as a group.

146
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:20,464
[SPEAKER_13]: The students relate with each other is the big part.

147
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:24,646
[SPEAKER_13]: So if they say that they're doing it, other students are going to be interested in doing it.

148
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:28,409
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think about the challenge personally for you and your relationship with your phone?

149
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I, sometimes I can be a little addicted to my phone.

150
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,413
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the lookup challenge really helped me.

151
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Whether it's challenging yourself to get off for an hour or a day, it's up to the student.

152
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:42,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Small hurdles with apparently big results.

153
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,060
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot more real conversations.

154
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,742
[SPEAKER_13]: By your iPhone, you're like, oh, did you see this thing on TikTok?

155
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:48,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

156
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:52,285
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just talking about what's on your phone and you're not engaging.

157
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:58,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I have more time to focus on things that matter more than just social media and YouTube and Netflix.

158
00:19:59,169 --> 00:19:59,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Derek Moreno.

159
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Today is Derek Day.

160
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:13,436
[SPEAKER_13]: It started at the Midway Middle School and ended at the Locanti Ice Rink, where hundreds of his fellow students turned out to say they're behind him.

161
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:17,738
[SPEAKER_13]: They raised money to help his family fill in the gaps, and they had a lot of fun.

162
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,998
[SPEAKER_13]: He's one of my best friends.

163
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,039
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known him since the second grade.

164
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,421
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot of people walking together and helping him because of how big

165
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Ideal this is and how good of a community we are.

166
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:37,083
[SPEAKER_13]: The school also put together a video of well-wishers for Derek from the Red Sox, Alex Cora, to the Patriots, the Bruins, and even the WBZ-TV news team.

167
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,724
[SPEAKER_10]: We're thinking about you, wishing you all the best.

168
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:55,174
[SPEAKER_10]: and I want him to understand that this is Medford coming together strong to support him and his cause to battle and win this battle against the homeless.

169
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,055
[SPEAKER_13]: It's insane how many people have come out and helped with everything.

170
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,135
[SPEAKER_13]: It means the world.

171
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:00,156
[SPEAKER_13]: It really does.

172
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:06,799
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Michael Kremen and I am the 6th grade ELA teacher at the John J. Bowie Middle School.

173
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:13,412
[SPEAKER_10]: on Team 6B, and I just want to introduce myself and say hello and welcome everyone to the Midland Middle School.

174
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:17,576
[SPEAKER_10]: We're very excited and happy that you and your families will be with us next year.

175
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:18,676
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

176
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:27,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mr. Tucci asked me to talk about a few things that are very different in middle school than they are in elementary school, and that is the team model that we have.

177
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:34,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you go to a school with three floors and hundreds of kids, it can seem very intimidating.

178
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:37,728
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually quite a small school, and here's why.

179
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: When your sixth graders come into our building, they're going to be assigned to a team, either 6A or 6B.

180
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So right off the bat, we kind of divide the kids in half.

181
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Then your son or daughter will be assigned

182
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,792
[SPEAKER_10]: social studies, science, or math.

183
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:58,593
[SPEAKER_10]: In that homeroom they'll have, as I said, a teacher and also a co-teacher.

184
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:02,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are two adults assigned to your child right out the door.

185
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Home is where they start every day on their team.

186
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:10,757
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll have a locker assigned to them where they can keep their books and their lunches and their backpacks and that kind of stuff.

187
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:19,040
[SPEAKER_10]: They come in the homeroom and we check in with them, make sure everything's doing okay, take care of any paperwork we have to do, you know, solve problems.

188
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:24,170
[SPEAKER_10]: As we go through our day, your kid will mostly stay with their team.

189
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:32,705
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little mixed together with all of their friends in different classes, always kind of staying with them.

190
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:38,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So I tell you all this because the school seems large, but the term model makes it very small.

191
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you might ask, well, what if my son or daughter has a friend on the other team?

192
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they ever get to see them?

193
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:45,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they will.

194
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:48,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Our UA classes are mixed together.

195
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:52,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So R in computers and gym, they'll be with the other six grades on the other team.

196
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,974
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, lunchtime and recess, they can do whatever they want to.

197
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:58,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So they will get to see everybody.

198
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:03,499
[SPEAKER_10]: The teachers on your child's team meet routinely.

199
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,820
[SPEAKER_10]: By routinely, I mean just about every day.

200
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,564
[SPEAKER_10]: We get together and we talk about your kids, who we all have at home.

201
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:13,005
[SPEAKER_10]: What are their needs?

202
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:14,586
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we help support them?

203
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:26,013
[SPEAKER_10]: We have quarantine meetings two or three times a week where we'll meet with our administrators, with our support staff, with special ed teachers, with our ELL teachers, with our specialists.

204
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So your children are gonna be well-informed

205
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,262
[SPEAKER_10]: lost in this big shuffle.

206
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just not how we work.

207
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:41,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a high school teacher for years before I switched to middle school, and the thing I like the most about middle school is the team model.

208
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though the building's big,

209
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:50,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I'm in a small school with people I know and work really well who have all the same kids in common.

210
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:52,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a great thing.

211
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:59,835
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that switching from elementary school to middle school is a big change for a lot of kids and for their families.

212
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:01,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to assure you

213
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:08,508
[SPEAKER_10]: that your children will be normal, they will be taken good care of, and we're very, very happy to have them come and see us.

214
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:13,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome to McGlynn, and we are looking forward to seeing you, hopefully, in September.

215
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:14,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care now.

216
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello there.

217
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:16,614
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Mr. McCarthy.

218
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:24,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I teach seventh grade at the McGlynn Middle School, and I am thrilled to be able to be one of the first teachers to welcome you to our wonderful school.

219
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you're very, very lucky to have been chosen to join the McGlynn Middle School.

220
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:37,854
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful, wonderful schools, both filled with wonderful teachers and great kids.

221
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,434
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to talk to you a little bit about McGlynn.

222
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:46,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're very lucky to have been chosen to join our school because of the amazing things that we offer.

223
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:52,858
[SPEAKER_05]: For one thing, we've got the morning news show with Mr. Lamar and Mr. Scholar and many, many other teachers involved too.

224
00:24:53,678 --> 00:25:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are students that give you updates every single morning about what's going on during the school day, what's going on after school.

225
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:04,677
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of jokes and sort of news updates, you know, from the real world.

226
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:09,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a club that you can join when you get to be in the 7th or 8th grade.

227
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The CCSR run by Ms.

228
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Olsen, another fantastic organization that brings all kinds of positive energy into our school and into our community.

229
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:21,863
[SPEAKER_05]: The Culture Club that Mr. DeBerry has run.

230
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:29,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I was able to attend one of the culture club cookouts a couple of years ago, and was able to sample all kinds of different food from many different parts of the world.

231
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fantastic.

232
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:34,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Zeckman and Mrs. Flint's Puzzles and Games Club.

233
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:41,577
[SPEAKER_05]: These are two teachers that are in love with puzzles and games, so they're the perfect two if you're running that for the batch.

234
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:48,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Open Gym Club is a place where you can go and, you know, burn off some energy, blow off some steam, play a little basketball, maybe some floor hockey.

235
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these and many, many, many

236
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunities are available to you.

237
00:25:55,056 --> 00:26:01,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing that's great is that our principal, Mr. Turchin, has brought in some amazing outside speakers.

238
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Our students will remember Pete Biscott a couple of years back.

239
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:12,479
[SPEAKER_05]: He also reached out to us again this year during this troubling that we're all dealing with, this COVID-19.

240
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Metagraphically, we talked to our students about

241
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:19,317
[SPEAKER_05]: how to create comic books and graphic novels.

242
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:24,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We've met David McGilvery, who's the coordinator of the Boston marathon.

243
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: He's spoken to us about perseverance and kind of digging down deep to achieve your goals.

244
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:41,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We met David Flood, who's another person that spoke a lot about making sure that we include everybody and that we're friends with everybody, right?

245
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:45,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all positive messages that we've received from many, many people that come into our school.

246
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,536
[SPEAKER_05]: from many different parts of the world.

247
00:26:49,417 --> 00:27:02,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, the best thing about, is that it's a place that at least I love to be, any of my other teacher friends love coming to work every day as well.

248
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:06,896
[SPEAKER_05]: This extended school closure has been a challenge for all of us.

249
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:12,562
[SPEAKER_05]: We really miss coming to school every day because, again, it is truly a place that we love to be.

250
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,042
[SPEAKER_05]: We love working with each other.

251
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:16,563
[SPEAKER_05]: We love interacting with our students.

252
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:25,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have a place where the teachers are happy and they love to be there, it makes a great learning environment.

253
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:29,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fun place to be, and I can't wait to get back to school again next year.

254
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:40,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Music Music Music Music

255
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:10,222
[SPEAKER_15]: do do

256
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:40,601
[SPEAKER_15]: you.

257
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the McGlynn Library.

258
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:40,879
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Miss Johnson, the middle school librarian, and I wanted to give you a little tour of our library.

259
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:49,302
[SPEAKER_13]: You will find lots of open space to work on a project or to sit and read a book.

260
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:54,348
[SPEAKER_13]: The library has computers and Chromebooks for you to use.

261
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:02,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are open study hall hours, a time for you to come and use the library and library resources.

262
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:08,353
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, the library has lots and lots of books.

263
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:18,936
[SPEAKER_13]: As a sixth grader, you'll be coming to the library on a regular basis with your ELA teacher.

264
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:26,163
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when you'll have time to review a book and to check one out.

265
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:44,730
[SPEAKER_13]: The library also has special events and activities like our STEAM workshops, build a projector, make a stop motion movie, create a wallet using duct tape,

266
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,835
[SPEAKER_13]: These are just a few of our STEAM activities.

267
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:58,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait to welcome you to the library in the fall.

268
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,219
[SPEAKER_13]: See you then!

269
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:23,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And also my friends, because I get to make new friends, and I get to keep the ones that I have from elementary school.

270
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:29,170
[SPEAKER_13]: And last thing is because you can join any sports team and compete against other cities.

271
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I did cross country, and I loved it, and my mom was a coach.

272
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, incoming sixth graders.

273
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:41,373
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Nimis Socker, and my piece of advice for you is to use your agenda.

274
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:51,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I use an agenda and most of your teachers use agendas as well to keep track of our homework and our assignments.

275
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:58,335
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a way to make sure you get all your stuff and to know what you have to do every night.

276
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:01,919
[SPEAKER_13]: So my advice again is use your agenda.

277
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, incoming McGlynn 6th graders.

278
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:11,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Sofia Hernandez, and I am a current 8th grader at McGlynn Middle School.

279
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:17,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And our community is so great because we don't just think about the ideal student.

280
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,700
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't think about the perfect student because that doesn't exist.

281
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,822
[SPEAKER_13]: What doesn't exist is you.

282
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:26,605
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know at the McGlynn community, we value that.

283
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:31,649
[SPEAKER_13]: We value you, and we value your thoughts and your opinions, and I hope you guys

284
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:37,062
[SPEAKER_13]: have an amazing year at the MacLenn and many more to come.

285
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:46,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope to see you sometime soon when this is over, even though I'm going to be in high school, but I'll still make sure to stop by.

286
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye, everyone.

287
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,991
[SPEAKER_13]: All the teachers, staff, and the principal are very supportive and are always there to help.

288
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:55,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you have a question, whether it's silly or not, they will be there to answer it.

289
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:58,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Something that I've learned in my time at the MacLenn is that

290
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:03,088
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a bunch of fun clubs and sports that you should participate in.

291
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Another bonus of the clubs and sports is that it's combined with Andrews.

292
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:12,378
[SPEAKER_18]: So even if all your friends went to the Andrews, you'll still be able to see them if you sign up for the same club or sport.

293
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:18,905
[SPEAKER_18]: I personally signed up for book club and cross country and had a lot of fun being able to spend time with my friends.

294
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:23,563
[SPEAKER_13]: The only way to be in those clubs and sports, though, is if your grades are good.

295
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:28,045
[SPEAKER_13]: And a way to keep your grades up is to keep your binder organized.

296
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:31,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Your binder is where everything that you need is stored.

297
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:34,669
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's organized, it's going to make it much, much easier to get your grades.

298
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I hope you have a really, really good time at the Melbourne, and I'll see you in the hall.

299
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

300
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:43,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you're all doing well and staying safe at home.

301
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,496
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Mrs. Baptist, and I'm the band teacher at the middle school.

302
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:58,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Now if you chose to enter into the instrumental music world in elementary school, whether band or strings, you probably saw me around or maybe I was even your teacher.

303
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:06,424
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though middle school is a really exciting time in your life, it can still be stressful or cause some anxiety because it's something new.

304
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:12,809
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it's often comforting when you identify familiar people who will be on the journey with you.

305
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:25,711
[SPEAKER_13]: So whether it's a friend or neighbor attending the same school as you, or already knowing one of your teachers like me, if you're a band student, sometimes that familiarity can help to ease your anxiety of the unknown.

306
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:34,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Regardless, middle school is going to be a wonderful phase of your academic career, and I can't wait to see my future band students on week one.

307
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Until then, take care,

308
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,234
[SPEAKER_13]: stay well, and keep practicing those instruments.

309
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:41,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye!

310
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,741
[SPEAKER_08]: about and that you should walk into middle school confident.

311
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:07,845
[SPEAKER_08]: After the win, you'll be able to contribute to our community and benefit from the diverse learning environment that is present here at McGlynn.

312
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:19,291
[SPEAKER_08]: You might walk into eighth, sixth grade nervous and afraid, but I can assure you that by the end of eighth grade, you'll be able to walk out confident and prepared for what awaits you in the future, just like what I'll be doing in two months.

313
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: elementary school, it has really become a part of who I am.

314
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:33,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that your experiences at the McGlynn Middle School are exceptional and will make your middle school experience memorable.

315
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you have a great year and thanks for tuning in.

316
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:42,617
[SPEAKER_13]: McGlynn Middle School is special because we have the EL program, so you will make friends from all over the world.

317
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:45,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi everyone, my name is Caroline.

318
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a sixth grader at McGlynn Middle School.

319
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:49,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I was asked to be a part of your open house.

320
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:55,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So Caroline, when you go to school, is there a special place to learn and grow as a person?

321
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:56,569
[SPEAKER_14]: That's easy.

322
00:35:56,689 --> 00:36:00,590
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers, they're so welcoming, they're so kind, and they really make it easy to learn.

323
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:08,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any tips or strategies for incoming 6th grade students who may be conscious about their transition to middle school?

324
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:12,355
[SPEAKER_14]: The best piece of advice that I have is to be prepared and do your job.

325
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:15,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the people you meet in 6th grade will be your friends forever.

326
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome incoming 6th graders!

327
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:18,950
[SPEAKER_13]: students.

328
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,191
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Mrs. Watson.

329
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:22,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the School Psychologist at the Magdalena Middle School.

330
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:26,035
[SPEAKER_13]: We're so excited to meet you next year.

331
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:32,379
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a great opportunity for you at lunch to sit with new people to make some new friends.

332
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:41,546
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Magdalena, we have so many fabulous clubs, such as the Builders Club, the Art Club, the Chess Club.

333
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,687
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have many sports.

334
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:46,669
[SPEAKER_13]: You can play basketball, volleyball,

335
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:58,648
[SPEAKER_14]: There are teachers who want to help you, so don't be afraid to ask for help at any time.

336
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:26,595
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to share a few things that may be able to help you with your transition to the school next year.

337
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:31,158
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, there's no need to be nervous or anxious about coming into middle school.

338
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:34,100
[SPEAKER_13]: There are always going to be challenges along the way, but it's a great place to be.

339
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:39,905
[SPEAKER_13]: All the teachers are very understanding and are willing to stay after school with you if you need any help with your pedagogy for their class or subjects.

340
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:41,446
[SPEAKER_13]: And make sure to keep them up on that.

341
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:44,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Staying after school makes a big difference and a positive impact on your grades.

342
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:49,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, being in middle school can give you many opportunities to make new friends and meet new people and get everyone to join together.

343
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:56,379
[SPEAKER_13]: And even if you do not have the same status as one of your friends, you can always just catch up with them in the morning or at lunch and reach them.

344
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,120
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what I do with some of my friends.

345
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, staying in middle school means that you will not have a variety of classes with many different teachers.

346
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:04,622
[SPEAKER_13]: This may sound complicated, but it's not.

347
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:07,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said earlier, you can always ask your teachers for help.

348
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:10,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And being able to switch classes also gives you more freedom within the school.

349
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:13,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And you do not have to stay in line, which you may have had to in the past in elementary school.

350
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it here at the Maglum Middle School.

351
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:16,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everybody.

352
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:17,805
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Stark Marino.

353
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:20,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently in eighth grade at the Maglum Middle School.

354
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm about to be a freshman.

355
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:24,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came into the Maglum Middle School

356
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: middle school in seventh grade in these past two years have been anything I could ever dream of in middle school.

357
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,390
[SPEAKER_02]: The McGlynn has it all.

358
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:35,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They have clubs.

359
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the greatest teachers.

360
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,713
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll always be there to help you.

361
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:43,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Any teacher that you want to talk to, you need help with something, they will help you with anything.

362
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:44,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want to stay organized.

363
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to stay on top of your homework.

364
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be on top of everything going on in class.

365
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:50,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask questions.

366
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:53,700
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need any help with something, definitely ask questions.

367
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay after if you have to.

368
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything, all that simple stuff, it all helps.

369
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:02,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say the most important thing would be to be one step ahead.

370
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:13,041
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you know something's coming up, try to do, say you do your homework, say you have homework that's due in a week or you have a project.

371
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:23,648
[SPEAKER_02]: do it day by day, little by little, if you have to, because then you don't want it to end up being, oh, you have a whole entire project due in two days and you haven't even started.

372
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:26,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just smart to be one step ahead, and it really helps.

373
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:33,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially as you go on in middle school, you know, seventh and eighth grade, it really does help to be on top of everything.

374
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,431
[SPEAKER_02]: know what's going on.

375
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, ask questions.

376
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:38,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Every teacher will be there to help you.

377
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:41,896
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need help with anything, you will have help with the McGlynn.

378
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:43,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is Mia Davis.

379
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:49,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I was an eighth grader from McGlynn last year, and from my experience, it was a very good time.

380
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:56,919
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll even go as far as to say that these past three years have been probably the best three years of my life so far.

381
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, I do in fact have two pieces of advice.

382
00:40:01,122 --> 00:40:08,488
[SPEAKER_13]: First off is please, please don't spend time thinking or worrying about your social status.

383
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:11,490
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so unimportant and overrated.

384
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,643
[SPEAKER_13]: and I think that a lot of people get caught up worrying about it, which is dumb.

385
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:24,369
[SPEAKER_13]: The second piece of advice that I have for you is to develop healthy relationships with the people around you, meaning your teachers and peers.

386
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Make relationships with your teachers.

387
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:28,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very important.

388
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:34,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I can honestly say that all the staff members are good people and they just want to see you succeed.

389
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:36,719
[SPEAKER_13]: That's their job.

390
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:44,139
[SPEAKER_13]: This piece of advice is kind of cliche, but it's very important, and it's to make new friends.

391
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:50,101
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are coming from a place where you've been surrounded by the same people for about six years.

392
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:53,142
[SPEAKER_13]: For most of you, that's the majority of your life.

393
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:58,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me, I know it's tough making new friends, but it will definitely be worth it.

394
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:04,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it must seem scary going into middle school, especially at a time like now, but I'm here to give you some tips.

395
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:08,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure you stay organized throughout all of your years at the movement.

396
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:12,507
[SPEAKER_13]: It will come so in handy, and it will make you feel so much better about yourself.

397
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:16,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Second of all, listen to your teachers.

398
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:20,609
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that is hard sometimes, but they know what's best for you.

399
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,449
[SPEAKER_13]: So just listen.

400
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And last but not least, enjoy your time at the MacMillan.

401
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Your years at the MacMillan will fly by.

402
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,571
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll notice it.

403
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:35,992
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that I felt like I was in your position just a couple months ago, but really it was your

404
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:40,171
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you guys enjoy your 3rd grade at the McGlynn.

405
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi future McGlynn 6th graders!

406
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:44,453
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Ms.

407
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:46,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Mosh and I'm one of the teachers on Team 6B.

408
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:54,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to start with you by saying how excited I am to get to meet all of you soon, and that you'll be coming to the McGlynn next year.

409
00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:00,882
[SPEAKER_13]: If I had to offer one piece of advice for any 6th grader coming in, it would be to always ask for help when you need it.

410
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:02,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Your teachers are here to help you,

411
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:08,242
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll start a school on days that we can to help you out with the transition to sixth grade, because sometimes it can be scary.

412
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:10,524
[SPEAKER_13]: So best of luck.

413
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:11,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't wait to meet you all soon.

414
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:12,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

415
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:16,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here to make a video helping you explain some tips and strategies we have for your first year of middle school.

416
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:29,641
[SPEAKER_13]: On the topic of different classes, all of your core classes, meaning math, science, ELA, and ancient civilizations, will be on the top floor online in many ways, like music, art, tech, engineering, and computer will be on the top two floors.

417
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:32,709
[SPEAKER_13]: 7th and 6th grade.

418
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Academically in your classes, my best tips for you would be to keep your mind on your projects.

419
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:42,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Always know your teachers are there to support you.

420
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:47,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I am Simona Guardi, the Lieutenant Teacher at the McGlynn Middle School.

421
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:53,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to give you a quick introduction of what we're going to do in 6th grade.

422
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:58,046
[SPEAKER_13]: This is our classroom and it's built on the 3rd floor.

423
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:10,487
[SPEAKER_13]: What we've been doing in sixth grade is learning about the Italian alphabet, numbers, readings, colors, learning about the classroom commands.

424
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,990
[SPEAKER_13]: We learn about the very basic, because this is our first year.

425
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:23,079
[SPEAKER_13]: We learn about the Italian geography history, the food family, and how to describe ourselves.

426
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:28,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Our typical class greetings were not fresh.

427
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:35,119
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk about new vocabulary or we practice about something that we are working on.

428
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,201
[SPEAKER_13]: We do some writing and speaking assignments.

429
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:44,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes we watch videos, we play games, and we work with authentic material.

430
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually, I give you homework two or three times a week.

431
00:43:51,488 --> 00:43:55,509
[SPEAKER_13]: and we do tests and quizzes one or two times per quarter.

432
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,730
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'd really like to do with you is projects.

433
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,032
[SPEAKER_13]: And usually, we do projects once every subject we learn.

434
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:10,875
[SPEAKER_13]: There are so many reasons to learn Italian, and I can't wait to know what is yours.

435
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:16,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the meantime, I want to wish you good luck in middle school, and I can't wait to meet you all.

436
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:17,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Ciao.

437
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And I very much hope to build a bridge between elementary school

438
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: in the McGlynn Middle School, because the McGlynn Middle School has so much to offer.

439
00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:32,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I say that is because we have an unbelievable faculty that cares so deeply in our students.

440
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to wrap up by saying that I'm very humble today.

441
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:53,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a person that at one point in time was sitting in chairs like yours as a student of the Medford Public School System.

442
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:58,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how special of an education and opportunity that you all have as students in our school system.

443
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:05,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure you guys, each and every day, bring your best attitude, concentration, and effort to school each day.

444
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:12,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that if you do that, you'll be in a situation where you open up so many different opportunities for yourself, and the world will be yours.

445
00:45:12,388 --> 00:45:15,550
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll make the city proud of you, and that will be the Mustang winning.

446
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, everybody.

447
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:39,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good evening and thank you for tuning in to our remote McGlynn Middle School open house.

448
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:41,594
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope that you enjoyed the video.

449
00:45:41,895 --> 00:45:49,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna thank Mr. Jack Dempsey, a long time teacher and coach in the Metro Public School for doing the editing and working his magic to produce the video showcasing our school.

450
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,021
[SPEAKER_07]: We did get some feedback that the video quality was streamed in a choppy fashion.

451
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,943
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna repost the YouTube video right after our presentation.

452
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:03,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So please try to stay tuned for that, because I do understand that it was choppy and I'm sorry for that.

453
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:08,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the panel's question and answer forum portion of tonight's presentation.

454
00:46:09,388 --> 00:46:14,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Here with me today is a wonderful collection of students and educators from our school who are here to answer your questions.

455
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:18,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We encourage you to submit your questions on Facebook or YouTube.

456
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Our moderator will screen the questions and send them our way.

457
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:24,324
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do our best to answer your questions for the next 20 to 30 minutes.

458
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:31,462
[SPEAKER_07]: In the coming days after our open house, we will post the transcript of the question and answer panel on our school's website.

459
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:36,884
[SPEAKER_07]: The transcripts of our discussion will be translated into the languages of our students and families.

460
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:46,167
[SPEAKER_07]: We encourage any English learner students and families to submit your questions during the open house to the following email address.

461
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:56,358
[SPEAKER_07]: medford.delac at gmail.com and I believe there's a banner that popped up on the screen during the video about that.

462
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let's start off by introducing our panel.

463
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:00,722
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Nick Tucci.

464
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:02,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the proud principal of the McGlynn Middle School.

465
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:05,946
[SPEAKER_07]: With me is assistant principal Jody Liu.

466
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:08,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have sixth grade teachers.

467
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:13,359
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Jamie Taylor, a science teacher on side 6B, and Ms.

468
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:17,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Amalia Whalen, an English language arts teacher on side 6A.

469
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:24,326
[SPEAKER_07]: We're happy to also have eighth grade math teacher, Mr. Dan Harrington, here to round out our panel of educators.

470
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my pleasure to introduce our student ambassadors on our panel.

471
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,492
[SPEAKER_07]: We have sixth graders, Emma Beardsley and Vinny DiMartino.

472
00:47:32,992 --> 00:47:36,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have eighth grade student ambassadors, Gnarly Pierre,

473
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:40,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Sofia Hernandez-Ezparela, and Derek Marino.

474
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:44,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to all of our panelists for their time this evening.

475
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:44,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get started.

476
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:54,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Our first question that comes in here this morning is, this evening is, where do I go in the morning when I come into school every school day?

477
00:47:54,968 --> 00:47:58,331
[SPEAKER_07]: This question is going to be answered by assistant principal, Jody Liu.

478
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:02,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

479
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,402
[SPEAKER_22]: So each morning, all students enter through the front doors at the McGlynn Middle School.

480
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:18,028
[SPEAKER_22]: And before you come in, as you're getting off the bus or walking in, please take off your phones, turn off your phones, put them into your backpack.

481
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:21,249
[SPEAKER_22]: When you come in and to the left, you will see our cafeteria.

482
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,990
[SPEAKER_22]: There you'll have your breakfast.

483
00:48:23,871 --> 00:48:25,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Breakfast is free for everyone in that group.

484
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:28,453
[SPEAKER_22]: And you will then have three choices.

485
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:31,615
[SPEAKER_22]: You can either stay in the cafeteria, finish up work,

486
00:48:32,267 --> 00:48:46,937
[SPEAKER_22]: chat with your friends, or choice number three, you can go to the library if you want a quiet place to read or use a computer, or choice three, which is go outside to the basketball courtyard and shoot some hoops or just chat with a friend to get some fresh air.

487
00:48:47,617 --> 00:48:52,781
[SPEAKER_22]: At 7.50, Mr. Teacher, I will blow the whistle and you will be off to your homeroom.

488
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:55,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Just know that no one should be in the corridors before 7.50.

489
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:56,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Ms.

490
00:48:59,525 --> 00:48:59,705
Rue.

491
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question that's coming in here is, if I need help in my studies, what is the best way to do this?

492
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Students gonna be answering this is Vinny D. Martino, sixth grader.

493
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:12,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Vinny.

494
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

495
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:32,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to, if you're struggling in school or you need some help, you should talk to your teachers and talk to your teachers and, cause they provide after certain days after school,

496
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:37,200
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can catch up on your work or what you're struggling with.

497
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:43,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to worry about getting home because there's a late bus that will take you home.

498
00:49:43,843 --> 00:49:49,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage everybody to stay after school if you're struggling or you need help because it's very beneficial.

499
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:52,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Vinny.

500
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:53,193
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

501
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:55,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Vinny's done a great job as a sixth grader this year.

502
00:49:56,518 --> 00:50:05,028
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question that comes into our panel is, how do UA rotations work for classes like music, art, computer applications, and technology workshop?

503
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:06,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take that question.

504
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is a very important part of what we offer here at the McGlynn Middle School, at the middle schools in Medford.

505
00:50:12,415 --> 00:50:15,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It provides a very well-rounded education, these unified arts classes.

506
00:50:16,459 --> 00:50:27,008
[SPEAKER_07]: What we do is we take a class like music, for instance, students that are enrolled in a class like music first quarter will go to that class four times per week for first quarter.

507
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:30,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when second quarter hits, would rotate.

508
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:34,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Students taking music would then go on to one of the computer or science classes.

509
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:43,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So for instance, the next thing that they might take, the next class that they might take as a UA class would be computer applications during second quarter, meeting four times per week.

510
00:50:44,183 --> 00:50:46,185
[SPEAKER_07]: The third quarter, they would take art.

511
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:50,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the fourth quarter, a student would take Tech Workshop.

512
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:56,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fantastic way, like I said, to become well-rounded, to support a lot of the work that you're doing in the core classes, too, as well.

513
00:50:57,121 --> 00:51:01,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of students report having a lot of fun in each one of these classes, too, in addition to learning.

514
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:07,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So certainly, we want you to have a great experience in our UA rotational classes.

515
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:14,814
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question that comes in, looks like from the question board is, where's my locker and how does that whole situation work?

516
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:17,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And to answer that question is Mrs. Taylor.

517
00:51:18,473 --> 00:51:19,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

518
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:20,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everyone.

519
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:23,714
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't wait to see some of you coming in next year.

520
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:24,654
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited.

521
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:33,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Your locker will be located near your homeroom, so you will not have to go too far in the morning from your locker to your homeroom.

522
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:36,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of us will assign you a locker just because it makes it so much easier.

523
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:44,138
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have the option of having a lock on your locker, but we really do suggest you buy a lock because then you can practice.

524
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:47,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Using a combination lock can be very tricky.

525
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:50,324
[SPEAKER_12]: There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to do it.

526
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:57,773
[SPEAKER_12]: We really try to have you not get the ones with the key because if you forget your key at home, we can't help you.

527
00:51:57,793 --> 00:52:01,677
[SPEAKER_12]: At least with a combination lock, you can write it down in your agenda.

528
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,340
[SPEAKER_12]: You can write it down and give it to your teacher so that we have it.

529
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:08,744
[SPEAKER_12]: The last thing we want to do is have to cut a lock that you bought yourself.

530
00:52:09,244 --> 00:52:12,427
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would suggest combination locker, practice at home.

531
00:52:12,747 --> 00:52:18,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you come in for the first day of school, we will tell you where your locker is so that you can put all of your stuff away.

532
00:52:18,812 --> 00:52:21,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And that will be your locker for the whole year for sixth grade.

533
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:23,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

534
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:42,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Mr. Kremen said, who made a video appearance during the video, he mentioned how we have a teaming system, how students will be broken up between sides A and side B. There are four homerooms on side A and another four homerooms on side B. And as Mrs. Taylor just noted, your locker will be right across or right next to your homeroom.

535
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:43,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

536
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that question.

537
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:45,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

538
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:53,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question that comes in is how do I sign up for a club or activity and what is the commitment like for a club at the middle school level?

539
00:52:54,278 --> 00:52:59,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Here to kick that question off and answer that question is eighth grader Derek Marino and we'll have others joining in soon.

540
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:03,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead Derek.

541
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:04,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you Mr. Tucci.

542
00:53:06,187 --> 00:53:12,392
[SPEAKER_23]: So when you are going to join a club, there's a big club fair and you can you get little previews of the club.

543
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:16,776
[SPEAKER_23]: You see what everything involves and you get to sign up for them.

544
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:19,799
[SPEAKER_23]: And you want to go to the club as much as you can.

545
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:24,262
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you can't make it one day, it's totally OK if you can't make it.

546
00:53:24,723 --> 00:53:27,285
[SPEAKER_23]: But you just try to go as much as you can.

547
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:30,247
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's fun and it makes them seem like more than just the school.

548
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:33,290
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can really connect with other people and do fun things with the school.

549
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:34,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Derek.

550
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,044
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll kick it over to you, Sophia.

551
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:50,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so yeah, just to add on Derek, there's a big club fair and you get a sneak peek of all the clubs and for commitment wise, um, I'm in a lot of clubs and it mainly depends on.

552
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's running the club.

553
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:01,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause I know some people might be more lenient and some might be like really strict to come, but I think you guys should join as many clubs as you can.

554
00:54:01,982 --> 00:54:05,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause it just makes your McGlynn experience so much better.

555
00:54:06,238 --> 00:54:06,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

556
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:09,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Gnarly, did you have anything to add about the club or activities experience?

557
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:11,523
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could unmute yourself, that'd be great.

558
00:54:13,445 --> 00:54:21,272
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I have nothing to add because this is a really, really good thing about the club.

559
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the things they already said.

560
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:27,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my.

561
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:31,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Nali, I appreciate it.

562
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:36,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Derek and Sophia and Nali alluded to as well, we start off our year with a club and activities fair.

563
00:54:37,345 --> 00:54:41,868
[SPEAKER_07]: That club and activities fair takes place during one of our wind blocks in the month of September.

564
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:50,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we also do is we have each one of the grades go through that club and activities fair and get a little taste of some of the clubs that are offered at our school.

565
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:59,018
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, that day after school, our students get a chance to travel over to the Andrews Middle School and visit their club and activities fair after school.

566
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:09,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as we talked about, you know, we certainly want to encourage our students at both the Andrews and McGlynn to come see each other, see their friends after school and meet up in a club and activity setting.

567
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:14,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So certainly a very valuable part of the middle school experience to make you feel like you're a part of it.

568
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,672
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make you feel invested in our school.

569
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:20,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the greatest ways to do that is to get involved right from the get-go.

570
00:55:21,337 --> 00:55:21,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everybody.

571
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next question.

572
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:25,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep Gnarly up, actually.

573
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Gnarly is an eighth grader, a wonderful student ambassador.

574
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: She's actually an English language learner student.

575
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And Gnarly, this question is for you.

576
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:34,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an EL student.

577
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So what type of classes do I have at the middle school?

578
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,864
[SPEAKER_20]: What type of classes do I have?

579
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:50,326
[SPEAKER_20]: The type of classes I have is like ELA, science, math, and

580
00:55:51,460 --> 00:56:19,456
[SPEAKER_20]: civics and ELA is like that if that depend on the level you are like if you speak really good English you'll be a B4 ELA student but if you are like someone who is like new and you are learning English you will have um one form that is Miss McDonough teacher that have I have her

581
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:21,438
[SPEAKER_20]: and because I'm an ELA.

582
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,981
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm an ELA once and for all.

583
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:28,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Narali.

584
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:29,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

585
00:56:29,404 --> 00:56:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things Narali was alluding to was one of her EL teachers.

586
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:34,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those EL teachers like Ms.

587
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:34,908
[SPEAKER_07]: McDonough.

588
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the sixth grade, we have EL teachers like Ms.

589
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Rangel or Mr. Seip who are there to support the students.

590
00:56:42,093 --> 00:56:47,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Students like Narali are in some co-taught classes at the middle school level.

591
00:56:47,957 --> 00:56:59,583
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our, we build an inclusive model for educating our students at the McGlynn Middle School and students like Narali would be in co-taught math as well as science classes.

592
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:07,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Even some of the level ones and two students, the students that are just new to our country and new to our school will take those types of classes there.

593
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:11,930
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, they participate in all the rest of our UA offerings and

594
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:16,973
[SPEAKER_07]: clubs and activities and certainly are a very valuable part of our school community.

595
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:21,396
[SPEAKER_07]: The students coming from different countries and might be learning the English language.

596
00:57:21,776 --> 00:57:29,300
[SPEAKER_07]: They add a lot to our school and one of the best parts of our school is the wonderful diversity that we celebrate every day.

597
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,961
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much, Natalie.

598
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:31,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

599
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:36,991
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question today is coming in from the audience here.

600
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, what is your favorite extracurricular club activity or sport and why?

601
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Here to answer that question is sixth grader, Amber Beardsley.

602
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:47,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

603
00:57:48,894 --> 00:58:02,163
[SPEAKER_18]: My favorite sport would probably be cross country, because it was really fun to be able to see people, both from the Andrews and other people from the McGlynn, who were also in seventh grade or eighth grade.

604
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:04,945
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was nice to see the teachers, too.

605
00:58:05,305 --> 00:58:08,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And being able to go to the away meets was fun, too.

606
00:58:10,189 --> 00:58:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Emma.

607
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Vinny, do you have anything to add on that particular topic there about your favorite extra-curricular callback to your sport and why?

608
00:58:19,924 --> 00:58:20,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, no.

609
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:25,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about you Sophia?

610
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:30,491
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of my favorite clubs is actually String Ensemble.

611
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:42,979
[SPEAKER_16]: This is kind of an addition to orchestra and you audition for it and we meet every Tuesday and it's so fun because you get to meet with all your friends and you just make really fun music.

612
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:45,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

613
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:46,521
[SPEAKER_07]: How about yourself Derek?

614
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:50,100
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, my favorite

615
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,604
[SPEAKER_23]: After school activity was definitely baseball, because this was the first year that they had the middle school teams for sports.

616
00:58:57,245 --> 00:59:02,088
[SPEAKER_23]: And I wasn't, I couldn't actually play on the team, but I still went to pretty much every game.

617
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:03,909
[SPEAKER_23]: And they were all fun to go to.

618
00:59:04,049 --> 00:59:09,914
[SPEAKER_23]: And they were competitive games, actual playing baseball for representing the school.

619
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:11,675
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was really fun.

620
00:59:11,975 --> 00:59:19,841
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think if you're into any sport, because they have basketball, they have a good variety of sports that you can play for whatever you enjoy.

621
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:20,341
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's fun.

622
00:59:21,252 --> 00:59:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

623
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:36,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, recommendation that a lot of the students and teachers mentioned about getting involved in your club activity or sport and build off of what Derek mentioned about the sports and the greater Boston League sports programming.

624
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That was such a fantastic addition to our school year this current year.

625
01:00:54,974 --> 01:00:57,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're just having a little bit of technical difficulties.

626
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:09,711
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

627
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:10,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

628
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:11,493
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Peter Cushing.

629
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:12,734
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the assistant superintendent.

630
01:01:12,954 --> 01:01:18,760
[SPEAKER_21]: And so unfortunately, we have lost Mr. Tucci's feed live from the McGlynn Elementary School.

631
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:21,763
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to continue to go through the questions that are coming in.

632
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:26,287
[SPEAKER_21]: As you can see, I'm in a sweatshirt, so I wasn't even prepared to be on screen tonight.

633
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:34,015
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I have to say that Mr. Tucci and all his team have put in a tremendous amount of effort, and we've definitely encountered some technical bugs.

634
01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:48,920
[SPEAKER_21]: With our streaming tonight that we're not here when we did a test run the other day, so we apologize for that however We're gonna wait for mr.. Tucci to come in and in the interim we will continue with the questions and so I

635
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:53,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the school have a PTO?

636
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:55,654
[SPEAKER_21]: And if so, how can you get involved?

637
01:01:56,014 --> 01:02:03,457
[SPEAKER_21]: What's awesome is that the schools in Medford all have really phenomenal and awesome PTOs.

638
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:16,322
[SPEAKER_21]: They've put together some tremendous events in my first year being in Medford, and they were working on the Wizards game, which would have happened right as we were unfortunately going out for closure.

639
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:24,036
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that the PTOs are doing a tremendous job to bring families together and to bring students together as well.

640
01:02:25,138 --> 01:02:33,026
[SPEAKER_21]: I just see that Principal Tucci has come back in, so I will turn the baton back over to him and hopefully we are all good to go.

641
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:40,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you and I look forward to seeing all of you as students in the McGlynn Middle School next year.

642
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:48,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everybody, I'm back and thank you very much for your patience here during this process.

643
01:02:49,287 --> 01:03:00,331
[SPEAKER_07]: The question was about our PTO and I just certainly wanted to just mention that we would love to have any parents or guardians out there involved and actively involved in our school's PTO.

644
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:09,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a PTO page on Facebook and would love for you to go in and like that page and inquire with our active PTO to see how you can get involved in the life of our school.

645
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:27,529
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an organization that meets on a monthly basis and we collaborate in order to try to find ways to make the operations at our school so much better for our students and bring in some inspirational speakers to come and speak to our students and to have some wonderful extracurricular events too as well.

646
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:36,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Our PTO is wonderful and I can't thank them enough and I would love to invite and welcome the newest Mustangs and the members of your family and your

647
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: guardians to participate in our school's PTO.

648
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:43,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So please do like our PTO page on Facebook if you have a moment.

649
01:03:43,902 --> 01:03:49,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question that is coming in is going to be directed towards Mr. Harrington, our eighth grade teacher.

650
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:50,968
[SPEAKER_07]: He teaches math.

651
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:55,252
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, is there a way for me to take accelerated classes at the middle school level?

652
01:03:57,227 --> 01:04:00,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci, and welcome to our incoming sixth graders.

653
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:03,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to seeing you all in the fall.

654
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:10,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Most classes at the middle school are heterogeneously grouped, which means students are grouped randomly.

655
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:15,437
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is an opportunity for students to get on an advanced track in mathematics.

656
01:04:16,137 --> 01:04:21,120
[SPEAKER_01]: As it is currently, at the end of your sixth grade year, you would take what we call a placement exam.

657
01:04:22,931 --> 01:04:32,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Those exam results, coupled with other factors such as your grade and teacher recommendation, contribute to whether or not you'd be selected for what we call an accelerated seventh grade year.

658
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:38,823
[SPEAKER_01]: That seventh grade course would combine your seventh and eighth grade math curriculum, so it's pretty rigorous.

659
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:45,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Upon successful completion of that seventh grade course, you would then take Algebra I as an eighth grader.

660
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:52,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking Algebra 1 as an 8th grader would allow you more opportunities for more advanced classes later on in high school.

661
01:04:53,654 --> 01:05:05,622
[SPEAKER_01]: But rest assured, whether or not you take Algebra 1 or you're in regular grade 8 math, you're going to get an excellent education with very supportive adults who are there to help you at every step along the way.

662
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. Harrington.

663
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:09,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

664
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:12,635
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question comes in from the audience once again.

665
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's asked, can I join a club at the Andrews Middle School so that I can see my friends there?

666
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:26,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering if we could put a few of the students on and ask them this question to see if they had the opportunity to participate in a club or activity.

667
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:28,787
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe with any of the Andrews at the Andrews Middle School.

668
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there are a couple really popular ones that our middle school students have attended, you know, in addition to those greater Boston League sports that we collaborate with the Andrews Middle School on as well.

669
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:42,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So can I turn it over to Sophia or Emma or Derek to take that question?

670
01:05:51,412 --> 01:05:58,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I personally didn't do a club at the Andrews, but I do know that you can sign up for clubs at the Andrews and see your friends.

671
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:04,223
[SPEAKER_18]: And if any kids from the Andrews sign up for clubs at the McGlynn, that also can work.

672
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:07,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

673
01:06:07,237 --> 01:06:14,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that one of the more popular clubs that many of our students will go to at the Andrews Middle School is the soccer club.

674
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:20,512
[SPEAKER_07]: They have an indoor soccer club that takes place right in the fall at the Andrews Middle School, and a lot of our students love attending that club.

675
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:26,839
[SPEAKER_07]: One other club at the Andrews Middle School that our students love to go to is the basketball club at the Andrews Middle School office, which is wonderful.

676
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:40,004
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a very popular club that we have here at McGlynn Middle School, which is our engineering club, and many students from Andrews Middle School come to our engineering club every single week.

677
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:51,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So certainly, we like to build that bridge between the middle schools right next to one another, and we want to give students many opportunities to go collaborate and interact with their peers across Medford Public Schools.

678
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next question that comes in is for sixth grade teachers, Mr. Taylor and Ms.

679
01:06:56,871 --> 01:06:57,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Whalen.

680
01:06:57,672 --> 01:07:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, how do I know which teachers stay after and on which days?

681
01:07:04,861 --> 01:07:05,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Ms.

682
01:07:05,402 --> 01:07:06,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Whalen is going to take this one.

683
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:17,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi guys, I'm really excited to meet all of you next year.

684
01:07:17,509 --> 01:07:20,050
[SPEAKER_19]: I am so looking forward to being back in school.

685
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:28,073
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, when you guys come into our classrooms on the very first day, we're going to give you something like a letter of introduction or a syllabus.

686
01:07:28,513 --> 01:07:31,915
[SPEAKER_19]: And on there, we'll have our days that we stay after school.

687
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:39,618
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition, we usually have our days put up on the board and they sometimes change from week to week, depending on meetings that we might have after school.

688
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:46,926
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know a lot of teachers also keep those days updated on their personal websites or on team websites, so you can always check there as well.

689
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:49,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

690
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:50,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Whittle, and I appreciate it.

691
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:53,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question here is going to be to Ms.

692
01:07:53,975 --> 01:07:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Liu, the assistant principal.

693
01:07:55,356 --> 01:07:58,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do I pick up the bus in the morning and also in the afternoon?

694
01:07:58,921 --> 01:07:59,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

695
01:07:59,161 --> 01:07:59,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Liu, take it away.

696
01:08:02,543 --> 01:08:03,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

697
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:15,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the week before school starts, you should go and check on Mecklenburg Public Schools' website for the list of the buses and look at the stops and find the one closest to your house.

698
01:08:16,032 --> 01:08:18,954
[SPEAKER_17]: That will bring you to the front of the school in the mornings.

699
01:08:19,454 --> 01:08:21,656
[SPEAKER_17]: It goes right to the front of the McGlynn.

700
01:08:22,256 --> 01:08:27,059
[SPEAKER_17]: In the afternoon at 2.15, you'll walk over to the Andrews and pick up the afternoon bus.

701
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,644
[SPEAKER_17]: You should also check to make sure that your afternoon bus is the same bus number or a different one.

702
01:08:33,744 --> 01:08:35,405
[SPEAKER_17]: That you can also check on the website.

703
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:37,947
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we also have the late buses.

704
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:45,271
[SPEAKER_17]: The late buses usually will, they start at three o'clock and that will be time to your after school activities.

705
01:08:45,612 --> 01:08:51,976
[SPEAKER_17]: You always want to get down here and be in the cafeteria and you wait for Mr. Chuchi to call when your late bus arrives.

706
01:08:52,376 --> 01:08:54,237
[SPEAKER_17]: because it will go to the Andrews first.

707
01:08:54,737 --> 01:08:55,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Chiu-Chiu.

708
01:08:59,199 --> 01:08:59,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

709
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:00,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Lu.

710
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:03,500
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question that we have is directed towards some students.

711
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,922
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, is there recess in the middle school?

712
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:08,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you do at recess?

713
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:14,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll bring some of our students back on and hopefully they can help us answer that question right there.

714
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:16,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Emma.

715
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:27,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so for the middle school, we do have recess, but we don't have like a playground or any specific area, um, except for the basketball courts.

716
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:41,265
[SPEAKER_18]: And we do go out to the formality field and you can run around the track and, um, you and miss Lou bring out the, um, the bag with all basketballs and soccer balls and other stuff that you can use.

717
01:09:43,516 --> 01:09:44,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

718
01:09:44,117 --> 01:09:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other students who would like to add to the recess experience at the middle school level?

719
01:09:50,964 --> 01:09:51,905
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I think it's covered.

720
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:54,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, thank you.

721
01:09:54,489 --> 01:10:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, one thing I should add is that I mentioned in the video that the day is broken up into eight different blocks or periods.

722
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:07,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of those periods, one of the eight, is our lunch and recess time.

723
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:18,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd have the opportunity to, by grade level, go and access the cafeteria, eat your lunch, and then after students are done eating lunch, then we typically will head outside for recess, as the student said.

724
01:10:18,863 --> 01:10:20,664
[SPEAKER_07]: We tend to congregate by the basketball court,

725
01:10:21,444 --> 01:10:26,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also are very blessed to have an opportunity where we have Hormel Stadium right across the way from us.

726
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:37,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So we open up the gates and we get the chance to play on the synthetic turf material at the field and run around and play some ball and socialize and just get some fresh air and get ready to learn once again after recess is over.

727
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:39,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much, students.

728
01:10:40,253 --> 01:10:43,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question is going to be going towards sixth grader Vinny D. Martino.

729
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:48,757
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, how do I sign up for a fall sport like baseball, softball, or cross country?

730
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:51,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the time commitment like for a sport?

731
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:54,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Vinny played on the basketball team.

732
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:00,604
[SPEAKER_07]: He was one of the sixth graders that made the basketball team this last year, and they were greater Boston League champions.

733
01:11:01,105 --> 01:11:02,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Vinny.

734
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us a little bit about that.

735
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:05,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Mr. Tucci.

736
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:10,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to sign up for a sport, your parents have to fill out a form on the

737
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,392
[SPEAKER_00]: school's website to allow you to try out.

738
01:11:14,973 --> 01:11:20,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Mr. Tucci said, I was fortunate enough to play on the boys basketball team.

739
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:27,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commitment, the time and commitment was like two to three days a week, games and practices.

740
01:11:28,304 --> 01:11:31,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And your grades play a huge, huge part in this.

741
01:11:31,707 --> 01:11:35,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage everybody to try out because it was just a great experience.

742
01:11:37,363 --> 01:11:38,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Vinny.

743
01:11:38,244 --> 01:11:39,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

744
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:43,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly in the fall, we plan to offer both baseball and softball.

745
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And in addition, we'll also be offering cross country.

746
01:11:47,494 --> 01:11:53,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the cross country is a co-ed sport, so both boys and girls can play in the cross country team.

747
01:11:53,900 --> 01:12:06,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So these were fantastic, as I said before, a great opportunity for our students to wear Medford across their chest and to represent the blue and white both in our school community and in other communities.

748
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:09,157
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to play a greater Boston League sport,

749
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:39,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Students have to pass all of their core classes and they also have to maintain a very good behavior record in school Do a great job of representing themselves and following the Mustang way and being on time to school and being having consistent school attendance so certainly we want to make sure that people are carrying themselves to a very high esteem and Representing ourselves in our school in a very proper way in their communities We really encourage you to give a shot these clubs activities or sports It seems to be a common theme and many of the questions we're feeling here tonight people are interested in that

750
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next question I have goes to a few teachers.

751
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:50,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there one place where I can find out what's going on in the school each day or week?

752
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:59,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Every single morning you're gonna come in and they're gonna show the morning show during homeroom and that's a great way to find out what's going on not only during the week but on that particular day.

753
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:07,878
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mr. Tucci does a really good job of updating the school's Google calendar, which you can access from the school's website.

754
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:17,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So that way, if parents want to know if there's a PTO meeting or a dance coming up or anything like that, they have the ability to see things that are in the coming weeks.

755
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:26,631
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I'll also add is that it was mentioned during the video that we have our morning show, as Ms.

756
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:27,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Wayland mentioned.

757
01:13:27,592 --> 01:13:31,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And that morning show is broadcast every single day inside the students' homeroom.

758
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:37,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a great way where students exercise some leadership and get the great opportunity to broadcast the morning news.

759
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:39,360
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a great way for students to get involved.

760
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,741
[SPEAKER_07]: We highlight student achievements there.

761
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:42,382
[SPEAKER_07]: We show some pretty cool videos.

762
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: and make sure that people are very much informed.

763
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make sure we inform our students.

764
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:54,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, I do invite you to go to our school's website and check out the McGlynn morning show.

765
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:57,086
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually still doing it even during the school closure.

766
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:03,538
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he was saying to check out the McGlynn morning show during the school closure.

767
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:14,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Villard, who operates the morning show during the school year, he has been putting together remote shows with the help of a lot of students and teachers that have been sending in clips.

768
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:15,763
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been really wonderful to watch.

769
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:28,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Miss Bellini, who's a seventh grade science teacher, has been doing a moment of science, and you'll see a bunch of different teachers showing you how they stay active and how they stay engaged and they continue to learn during this time of remote learning.

770
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:32,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for picking up while I was off there.

771
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

772
01:14:35,297 --> 01:14:35,677
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

773
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:39,098
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done here with just wrapping up with a few more questions.

774
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:44,800
[SPEAKER_07]: The next question we have from the audience is, when will I find out where my homeroom is and who my teachers are?

775
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll take that question.

776
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:55,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the summertime, this is a time where myself as a principal, I'll be busy scheduling and making sure that everybody has a good schedule and is placed accordingly.

777
01:14:55,703 --> 01:15:04,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that sometime in about mid-August, we will have students in the sixth grade have an opportunity to have a good understanding of who their teachers are and what their schedules are.

778
01:15:05,153 --> 01:15:12,501
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, our plans are to have a summer barbecue and orientation about a week or a week and a half before the school year begins.

779
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:14,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll invite you to that event.

780
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:21,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that'll be a great way for you to come together, meet some of your sixth grade teachers, and that's when we will give you your schedule.

781
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:24,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll get your schedule in advance of any other student here at the school.

782
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:34,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll walk you through when you come in for an orientation, and get you a chance to meet with each one of your teachers, you know, find out where your locker is, and really

783
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:41,573
[SPEAKER_07]: feel very connected and feel very much like you are going to have a positive experience before even the school year starts.

784
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:50,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say that you'll get a chance to understand who your teachers are, where your homeroom is, your locker, at least a week before the school year starts.

785
01:15:50,455 --> 01:15:52,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll make sure that you feel very comfortable along those lines.

786
01:15:53,336 --> 01:15:59,317
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, though, if there's any questions, you can certainly reach out to me in advance, and I'm happy to make any special arrangements.

787
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:10,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and our final question, just in conclusion here this evening, is what advice do you offer to an incoming sixth grader to help guide them towards achieving their goals in middle school?

788
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So I keep the teachers on the screen here, and I'll start with Ms.

789
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:16,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Whalen, if you don't mind, Ms.

790
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Whalen, what's your piece of advice for an incoming sixth grader?

791
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:23,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I am all about organization.

792
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:27,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I really recommend that you keep your agenda and your binder organized.

793
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:29,866
[SPEAKER_19]: That is going to help you stay on top of everything.

794
01:16:30,486 --> 01:16:34,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you ever need help organizing something, all of your teachers are there to help you.

795
01:16:34,627 --> 01:16:36,287
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally love organization.

796
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:37,907
[SPEAKER_19]: You can visit me anytime.

797
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:40,408
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have a grand time just going through your binder.

798
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:47,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, but just if you stay organized and you have a clean binder and a clean locker, it's going to make your day a lot easier.

799
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:49,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

800
01:16:49,957 --> 01:16:50,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Whalen.

801
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:51,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Harrington, can I go to you next?

802
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:53,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

803
01:16:53,480 --> 01:17:00,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest piece of advice I could give these sixth graders would be to listen to the advice that these wonderful student ambassadors have given you tonight.

804
01:17:01,406 --> 01:17:03,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the guys that are in it each and every day.

805
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:05,870
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all going to be in their shoes next year.

806
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:11,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And they serve as wonderful role models, a cream of the crop of our school.

807
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:13,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen to what they have to tell you.

808
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:15,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also give you two pieces of advice.

809
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:17,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, get involved.

810
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:28,561
[SPEAKER_01]: There are extracurricular opportunities in drama, athletics, the arts, CCSR, all of those highlighted in the video that we showed earlier, right, the middle school experience is what you make of it.

811
01:17:28,741 --> 01:17:31,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be, we want to see you involved.

812
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:34,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, I would say to advocate for yourself.

813
01:17:35,647 --> 01:17:37,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle school is a new phase in your life.

814
01:17:38,428 --> 01:17:44,050
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing, you're getting more mature, and oftentimes this is when students find their voice, right?

815
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:48,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Derek Marino advised you earlier, if you have a question, ask.

816
01:17:48,871 --> 01:17:52,092
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have something to share in class, do so.

817
01:17:53,133 --> 01:18:00,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as I mentioned earlier, the adults are there to support you and foster you, and I look forward to seeing you in the fall.

818
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

819
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Stanton.

820
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:09,174
[SPEAKER_12]: One piece of advice that I could give is treat school like family.

821
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:12,015
[SPEAKER_12]: We are your family as soon as you walk in that door.

822
01:18:12,035 --> 01:18:15,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how you're treated all those three years with every single teacher you're going to have.

823
01:18:16,377 --> 01:18:22,300
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you have a problem, if you're upset or something is going on, you can always come to us.

824
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,021
[SPEAKER_12]: We're there for you every single day.

825
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And every day is a new day.

826
01:18:27,022 --> 01:18:29,587
[SPEAKER_12]: If you make a mistake one day, the next day is a clean slate.

827
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:33,274
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to be holding grudges because we are all learning.

828
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:36,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Even as adults, every day, we are learning with you.

829
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are all in this together.

830
01:18:39,295 --> 01:18:40,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. Taylor.

831
01:18:41,136 --> 01:18:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, certainly, I hope that everybody enjoyed the experience here this evening, and thank you very much for persevering through some technical glitches.

832
01:18:48,839 --> 01:18:49,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I greatly appreciate it.

833
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:53,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to take a moment to once again thank our panel for participating in this presentation.

834
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,261
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a great job answering the questions.

835
01:18:55,821 --> 01:18:57,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to thank you for tuning in to watch.

836
01:18:58,402 --> 01:19:05,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you found it to be informative and please do not be afraid to reach out to me in the coming weeks or months leading up to your transition to the Lynn Middle School.

837
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:12,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for watching and we hope that you have a great finish to the school year and have a wonderful night.

838
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:13,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everybody.
