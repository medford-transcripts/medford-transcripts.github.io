    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=164.85s">My</a>  name is Mr. Tucci, principal of the McGlynn Middle School, and welcome to the McGlynn Middle School remote open house.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=171.596s">It</a>  is my honor to be speaking to you remotely here today to introduce you to our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=177.202s">If</a>  you're listening to this video, I'm sure that you've gotten your results. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=181.526s">And</a>  I hope you're very happy, because I know we are very enthused to accept you and welcome you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=186.687s">to</a>  the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=188.869s">It's</a>  such a great time to be on board our school, and I hope that today's presentation is going to welcome you and introduce you to our school in a fashion where you'll get to know some teachers, some students, and a little bit about the building and the activities and how you can find your way as a Mustang here at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=205.801s">The</a>  John J. McGlynn Middle School serves 440 students in grades 6, 7, and 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=210.524s">Each</a>  grade level consists of two academic teams on side A, B, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=216.795s">Each</a>  team is made up of an English language arts teacher, social studies teacher, science teacher, math teacher, English language learner teacher, and special education teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=229.706s">In</a>  addition to the academic classes, students have the opportunity for exploratory classes during the school day, plus an array of expanding after-school clubs and greater Boston League sports on a seasonal basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=242.057s">In</a>  the 2020 school year, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=244.378s">all</a>  world language students, grades six through eight, meet three times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=249.502s">In</a>  addition, students that were identified as needing intervention in math and ELA were assigned to math and literacy skills classes that meet three times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=260.851s">Our</a>  school also has a wind block that meets once per week and has continued to engage students for what I need, that's what that acronym stands for, which is another means of intervention overseen by their co-homeroom teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=275.581s">The</a>  wind block has also been used as a vehicle to build school culture and promote social-emotional learning through the use of these principle-driven school assemblies and activities that take place during a day in the life of a McGlynn Middle School student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=290.492s">When</a>  you arrive at the McGlynn Middle School, students arrive each day to school between 7.15 and about 7.45 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=298.041s">you</a>  arrive through our front door and come into our cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=301.422s">In</a>  our cafeteria we encourage all students to have a free breakfast to start your day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=306.084s">In</a>  the cafeteria you can eat your breakfast and socialize with your friends, but also you have the opportunity to head outside, hang out with your friends, play a little bit of ball in the schoolyard, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=316.095s">But</a>  also, if you have a little bit of work to get done prior to the school day, we encourage students to head up to our library, where you can have some quiet time to access the computer, collaborate with small groups of friends on some schoolwork as well in the library center. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=330.524s">So</a>  this is a fantastic opportunity to start your day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=334.267s">And</a>  at 7.50, the school bell will ring to begin the day where all students will head up into their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=340.23s">You</a>  head up to your homerooms, go to your locker, and then shortly after you put your belongings away at your locker, you head into your homeroom, where you'll have two homeroom teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=350.333s">And</a>  you'll sit down and watch our McGlynn Morning News Show. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=353.754s">The</a>  McGlynn Morning News Show is a fantastic way to be informed, to start your day with some great, engaged, and fantastic student presenters that will present the morning news and activities to begin your day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=367.098s">After</a>  homeroom, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=368.109s">Students</a>  will be having and going through eight different 45-minute periods during the course of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=376.772s">During</a>  these eight 45-minute time periods, students will have the opportunity to go to each one of their core classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=383.575s">We</a>  also get to have a double block where one of your core classes will meet for back-to-back periods during the course of that school day as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=392.734s">Students</a>  will engage in those eight 45-minute periods during the day and get dismissed at 2.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=399.62s">Now,</a>  after dismissal, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, we have after-school programming that takes place on those days, Tuesday through Thursday, from 2.15 until about 3.05. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=413.212s">And</a>  during that, we encourage students to get involved with sports, clubs, activities, and the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=421.164s">We</a>  also offer a late bus service on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to drop off students, pick up students at the school and drop them off at their household on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday so that they can take advantage of extracurricular activities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=437.229s">Hi,</a>  I'm Jodi, the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=440.25s">You'll</a>  see me in the mornings when you're having breakfast with your friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=443.751s">I</a>  like to check in with kids at this time because I'm one of the people that you can come to with any questions or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=450.032s">always</a>  find a solution, or at least help. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=453.814s">One</a>  of the great tips that I want to share with you is to get to know all the adults in your buildings, especially the teachers for all the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=461.859s">Other</a>  pieces of advice I'd like to share, middle school is a great place to spread your wings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=468.002s">Join</a>  an activity, a sport, or volunteer at one of our many events. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=473.225s">These</a>  are times and places that you can <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=475.851s">Find</a>  your talent, meet new people, and develop those talents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=481.777s">Lastly,</a>  try to make a new friend each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=484.819s">So</a>  please say hi and be kind.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=492.136s">During</a>  middle school, students will have the opportunity to engage in their core academic curriculum classes, like math, English, language arts, science, and social studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=502.922s">But</a>  in addition to those classes there, in order to become a very well-rounded student, we also offer a unified arts curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=510.266s">These</a>  are classes like world languages, Spanish and Italian, physical education, general music, art, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=518.411s">computer</a>  technology, science technology, health, and orchestra are certainly options too as well to embed in the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=527.041s">And</a>  also, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=533.073s">and</a>  literacy skills.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=534.614s">The</a>  Unified Arts Curriculum is a great way to become a well-rounded student, and we love to say that they educate, we educate the whole child here at the Brooklyn Middle School, and they certainly help us accomplish that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=548.0s">Now,</a>  these Unified Arts classes, classes like General Music, Art, Computer Technology, and Science Technology, they meet on a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=557.964s">So</a>  a class, for instance, like Art, would meet for the first quarter, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=562.381s">four</a>  times a week, and then a student that takes art first quarter would then cycle on to the next UA rotation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=568.827s">For</a>  instance, a student taking art first quarter might go to general music second quarter, third quarter they might then go to computer technology, and fourth quarter they can finish up the science technology class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=580.397s">Those</a>  UA rotational classes meet four times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=584.58s">You</a>  really get to know the subject matter and the teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=590.963s">classes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=592.003s">Health</a>  and Guidance are both classes that actually meet on a semester basis.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=596.547s">So</a>  during first semester, which is quarters one and two, students who take health would take health first and second quarter, and then third quarter they would then take <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=605.914s">guidance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=606.995s">That's</a>  how the rotations work for our Unified Arts classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=610.418s">World</a>  language classes like Spanish or Italian, these classes meet all year round for three times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=618.604s">And</a>  most students may have physical education two times per week during the course of the entire school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=626.91s">Now</a>  one of my biggest pieces of advice as your principal and getting acclimated to the middle school is to get involved right away in one of the extracurricular <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=638.65s">here</a>  at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=640.191s">We</a>  offer a wide array of them and these typically take place after school Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=647.273s">We</a>  have a whole host of clubs and activities like Student Council, Technology and Engineering Club, Chorus Club, Chess Club, Book Club, Drama Club, Builders Club, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=658.687s">our</a>  media club, open gym, running club, yearbook, and our award-winning orchestra ensemble. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=665.598s">You</a>  name a club, we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=668.042s">And</a>  also we share our clubs and activities with the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=671.969s">That's</a>  a fantastic way for a lot of Glynn Middle School students to join up with your fellow peers at the end of middle school after school so that you can engage in the clubs and activities that both schools have to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=684.364s">Now</a>  one new activity that we just began offering this current school year that will also be available next year is our sports program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=692.631s">It</a>  is really fantastic to see that the middle schools have joined with the Greater Boston League to offer sports like softball and baseball and cross country and girls and boys basketball and out to a track. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=706.998s">We</a>  look forward to expanding these sports and competing as Mustangs on the playing field and representing our fantastic school and community and the different communities in the Greater Boston League area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=719.765s">At</a>  the McGlynn Middle School,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=724.19s">Mustang</a>  Way philosophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=726.151s">At</a>  the McGlynn Middle School, we are all Mustangs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=728.932s">We</a>  try to do things the Mustang Way every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=732.714s">That</a>  means we respect each other in all of our interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=736.076s">We</a>  respect our school building and property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=738.617s">We</a>  demonstrate good citizenship and we work hard to achieve our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=743.58s">In</a>  fact, at the McGlynn Middle School, I try to preach the philosophy of bringing your ace every single day you walk in the doors of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=752.026s">ACE</a>  is an acronym that stands for A for Attitude, C for Concentration, and E for Effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=758.89s">If</a>  you bring your ACE every single school day, I know that it will help you find your success as a student and person during your middle school years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=772.145s">what</a>  it's like to be a student of McGlynn Middle School led by some of our eighth grade ambassadors.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=777.549s">You'll</a>  also have a chance to hear from some of our current students and teachers where they share with you some of their success and also they'll tell you a little bit about what they feel about how they feel McGlynn Middle School is a very special place.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=790.279s">But</a>  as we conclude, I do want to share with you three things that I ask of my students each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=796.285s">So</a>  I'd like you to think about these as you begin to transition from elementary school to middle school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=802.47s">Here</a>  are the three things I expect out of my students at school each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=806.434s">I</a>  ask them to be the best that you can be every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=811.779s">I</a>  want you to pass along what you've learned to others. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=814.642s">and</a>  I want you to leave the world better than you found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=818.245s">You</a>  do those three things, I'm confident that you will certainly make an impact during the course of your time as a middle school student at McGlynn Middle School, and certainly prepare yourself for the road ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=830.114s">Thank</a>  you for watching our sixth grade McGlynn Middle School remote open house, and enjoy the rest of our video.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=853.756s">And</a>  welcome to the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=856.056s">My</a>  name is Mr. Tucci, the principal of the McGlynn Middle School.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=876.753s">Here</a>  at the McGlinn Middle School, we follow the Mustang Way and we honor those who live by the Mustang Way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=883.377s">Part</a>  of following the Mustang Way is to bring your ACE every day to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=887.459s">ACE</a>  stands for Attitude, Concentration, and Effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=891.221s">If</a>  you do that, you're going to be on your path to success at our school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=897.664s">I</a>  can't wait to get to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=898.765s">Me</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=899.225s">Let's</a>  go! <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=924.464s">Here</a>  at the McGlynn, we value concentration in our studies.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=929.448s">Here</a>  at the McGlynn, we always keep our eye on our lungs.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=953.506s">Here</a>  at the McGlynn, we realize the importance of bringing our best effort to school every day, in our studies and in our extracurriculars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=995.387s">We</a>  are some of the sixth grade teachers and we just wanted to give you some words of advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1000.07s">One</a>  thing for me is, we're always here to help, just ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1004.432s">Stay</a>  organized and keep your mind clean.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1006.994s">Don't</a>  be nervous, everything's gonna be fine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1010.335s">Don't</a>  forget to save for extra help before testing quizzes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1014.338s">Here</a>  at the McGlynn, we have a variety of clubs and activities that we encourage you to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1022.734s">clubs</a>  and activities such as Drama Club, which recently did the Brothers Green Spectacular Con this past year, and Student Council, which has an upcoming rock and roll show, and we have Orchestra, which you can probably see behind us, and we also have String Ensemble and Culture Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1038.914s">We</a>  have lots of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1049.514s">Thank</a>  you for tuning in to Montgomery Windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1119.953s">We</a>  hope you enjoyed the tour of our school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1126.119s">We</a>  are the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1127.56s">We</a>  are Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1129.022s">We</a>  look forward to you joining our family.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1138.669s">What</a>  we want to do is we're going to try to surround them with information in order to help them achieve a better balance in this age of visual distraction.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1150.077s">Principal</a>  Nick Tucci loves the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1152.298s">Challenge</a>  the kids to take breaks, but on their terms with small, real goals as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1158.162s">The</a>  students relate with each other is the big part. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1160.484s">So</a>  if they say that they're doing it, other students are going to be interested in doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1164.726s">What</a>  do you think about the challenge personally for you and your relationship with your phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1169.129s">I,</a>  sometimes I can be a little addicted to my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1171.991s">So</a>  I think the lookup challenge really helped me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1174.673s">Whether</a>  it's challenging yourself to get off for an hour or a day, it's up to the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1179.236s">Small</a>  hurdles with apparently big results. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1183.039s">A</a>  lot more real conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1185.5s">By</a>  your iPhone, you're like, oh, did you see this thing on TikTok? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1187.762s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1188.042s">You're</a>  just talking about what's on your phone and you're not engaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1192.585s">I</a>  have more time to focus on things that matter more than just social media and YouTube and Netflix. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1199.169s">Derek</a>  Moreno. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1199.95s">Today</a>  is Derek Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1204.112s">It</a>  started at the Midway Middle School and ended at the Locanti Ice Rink, where hundreds of his fellow students turned out to say they're behind him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1213.856s">They</a>  raised money to help his family fill in the gaps, and they had a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1217.918s">He's</a>  one of my best friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1219.038s">I've</a>  known him since the second grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1220.059s">I</a>  think a lot of people walking together and helping him because of how big <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1225.374s">Ideal</a>  this is and how good of a community we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1228.316s">The</a>  school also put together a video of well-wishers for Derek from the Red Sox, Alex Cora, to the Patriots, the Bruins, and even the WBZ-TV news team.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1237.103s">We're</a>  thinking about you, wishing you all the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1247.31s">and</a>  I want him to understand that this is Medford coming together strong to support him and his cause to battle and win this battle against the homeless.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1255.274s">It's</a>  insane how many people have come out and helped with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1258.075s">It</a>  means the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1259.396s">It</a>  really does.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1260.576s">My</a>  name is Michael Kremen and I am the 6th grade ELA teacher at the John J. Bowie Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1267.808s">on</a>  Team 6B, and I just want to introduce myself and say hello and welcome everyone to the Midland Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1273.513s">We're</a>  very excited and happy that you and your families will be with us next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1278.176s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1279.197s">So</a>  Mr. Tucci asked me to talk about a few things that are very different in middle school than they are in elementary school, and that is the team model that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1287.763s">So</a>  when you go to a school with three floors and hundreds of kids, it can seem very intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1295.707s">It's</a>  actually quite a small school, and here's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1298.168s">When</a>  your sixth graders come into our building, they're going to be assigned to a team, either 6A or 6B. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1304.231s">So</a>  right off the bat, we kind of divide the kids in half. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1307.052s">Then</a>  your son or daughter will be assigned <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1312.131s">social</a>  studies, science, or math. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1314.492s">In</a>  that homeroom they'll have, as I said, a teacher and also a co-teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1318.633s">So</a>  there are two adults assigned to your child right out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1323.135s">Home</a>  is where they start every day on their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1325.836s">They'll</a>  have a locker assigned to them where they can keep their books and their lunches and their backpacks and that kind of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1332.258s">They</a>  come in the homeroom and we check in with them, make sure everything's doing okay, take care of any paperwork we have to do, you know, solve problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1340.524s">As</a>  we go through our day, your kid will mostly stay with their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1344.351s">It's</a>  a little mixed together with all of their friends in different classes, always kind of staying with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1353.755s">So</a>  I tell you all this because the school seems large, but the term model makes it very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1359.78s">Now</a>  you might ask, well, what if my son or daughter has a friend on the other team? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1363.223s">Will</a>  they ever get to see them? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1364.964s">Yes,</a>  they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1365.785s">Our</a>  UA classes are mixed together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1368.547s">So</a>  R in computers and gym, they'll be with the other six grades on the other team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1372.831s">And</a>  of course, lunchtime and recess, they can do whatever they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1376.994s">So</a>  they will get to see everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1380.037s">The</a>  teachers on your child's team meet routinely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1383.519s">By</a>  routinely, I mean just about every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1386.08s">We</a>  get together and we talk about your kids, who we all have at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1392.104s">What</a>  are their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1393.065s">How</a>  can we help support them? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1395.206s">We</a>  have quarantine meetings two or three times a week where we'll meet with our administrators, with our support staff, with special ed teachers, with our ELL teachers, with our specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1406.473s">So</a>  your children are gonna be well-informed <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1411.201s">lost</a>  in this big shuffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1412.282s">That's</a>  just not how we work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1414.543s">I</a>  was a high school teacher for years before I switched to middle school, and the thing I like the most about middle school is the team model. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1422.408s">Even</a>  though the building's big, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1424.623s">I</a>  feel like I'm in a small school with people I know and work really well who have all the same kids in common. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1431.488s">So</a>  it's a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1433.73s">We</a>  know that switching from elementary school to middle school is a big change for a lot of kids and for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1440.055s">I</a>  just want to assure you <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1441.943s">that</a>  your children will be normal, they will be taken good care of, and we're very, very happy to have them come and see us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1449.048s">So</a>  welcome to McGlynn, and we are looking forward to seeing you, hopefully, in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1453.912s">Take</a>  care now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1454.732s">Hello</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1455.573s">My</a>  name is Mr. McCarthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1457.134s">I</a>  teach seventh grade at the McGlynn Middle School, and I am thrilled to be able to be one of the first teachers to welcome you to our wonderful school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1465.62s">I</a>  think that you're very, very lucky to have been chosen to join the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1471.932s">wonderful,</a>  wonderful schools, both filled with wonderful teachers and great kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1478.934s">But</a>  I'm going to talk to you a little bit about McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1481.375s">I</a>  think you're very lucky to have been chosen to join our school because of the amazing things that we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1486.376s">For</a>  one thing, we've got the morning news show with Mr. Lamar and Mr. Scholar and many, many other teachers involved too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1493.678s">And</a>  there are students that give you updates every single morning about what's going on during the school day, what's going on after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1501.036s">There's</a>  lots of jokes and sort of news updates, you know, from the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1505.678s">And</a>  that's a club that you can join when you get to be in the 7th or 8th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1510.079s">The</a>  CCSR run by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1512.44s">Olsen,</a>  another fantastic organization that brings all kinds of positive energy into our school and into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1519.282s">The</a>  Culture Club that Mr. DeBerry has run. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1522.621s">I</a>  was able to attend one of the culture club cookouts a couple of years ago, and was able to sample all kinds of different food from many different parts of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1529.587s">It</a>  was fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1531.388s">Mrs.</a>  Zeckman and Mrs. Flint's Puzzles and Games Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1534.711s">These</a>  are two teachers that are in love with puzzles and games, so they're the perfect two if you're running that for the batch. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1542.197s">Open</a>  Gym Club is a place where you can go and, you know, burn off some energy, blow off some steam, play a little basketball, maybe some floor hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1549.303s">All</a>  of these and many, many, many <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1551.715s">opportunities</a>  are available to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1555.056s">Another</a>  thing that's great is that our principal, Mr. Turchin, has brought in some amazing outside speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1563.017s">Our</a>  students will remember Pete Biscott a couple of years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1566.298s">He</a>  also reached out to us again this year during this troubling that we're all dealing with, this COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1572.539s">Metagraphically,</a>  we talked to our students about <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1576.656s">how</a>  to create comic books and graphic novels. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1580.397s">We've</a>  met David McGilvery, who's the coordinator of the Boston marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1585.339s">He's</a>  spoken to us about perseverance and kind of digging down deep to achieve your goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1591.602s">We</a>  met David Flood, who's another person that spoke a lot about making sure that we include everybody and that we're friends with everybody, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1601.185s">So</a>  these are all positive messages that we've received from many, many people that come into our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1606.274s">from</a>  many different parts of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1609.417s">I</a>  think that, you know, the best thing about, is that it's a place that at least I love to be, any of my other teacher friends love coming to work every day as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1623.112s">This</a>  extended school closure has been a challenge for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1627.841s">We</a>  really miss coming to school every day because, again, it is truly a place that we love to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1632.882s">We</a>  love working with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1634.322s">We</a>  love interacting with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1637.763s">And</a>  when you have a place where the teachers are happy and they love to be there, it makes a great learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1645.505s">It's</a>  a fun place to be, and I can't wait to get back to school again next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1770.134s">Welcome</a>  to the McGlynn Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1772.055s">This</a>  is Miss Johnson, the middle school librarian, and I wanted to give you a little tour of our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1782.819s">You</a>  will find lots of open space to work on a project or to sit and read a book. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1791.087s">The</a>  library has computers and Chromebooks for you to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1796.529s">And</a>  there are open study hall hours, a time for you to come and use the library and library resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1805.452s">And</a>  of course, the library has lots and lots of books. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1808.373s">As</a>  a sixth grader, you'll be coming to the library on a regular basis with your ELA teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1821.741s">That's</a>  when you'll have time to review a book and to check one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1828.264s">The</a>  library also has special events and activities like our STEAM workshops, build a projector, make a stop motion movie, create a wallet using duct tape, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1849.414s">These</a>  are just a few of our STEAM activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1851.855s">I</a>  can't wait to welcome you to the library in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1858.799s">See</a>  you then! <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1874.546s">And</a>  also my friends, because I get to make new friends, and I get to keep the ones that I have from elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1883.588s">And</a>  last thing is because you can join any sports team and compete against other cities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1889.69s">I</a>  did cross country, and I loved it, and my mom was a coach.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1893.131s">Hello,</a>  incoming sixth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1895.311s">My</a>  name is Nimis Socker, and my piece of advice for you is to use your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1903.917s">I</a>  use an agenda and most of your teachers use agendas as well to keep track of our homework and our assignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1911.707s">It's</a>  a way to make sure you get all your stuff and to know what you have to do every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1918.755s">So</a>  my advice again is use your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1923.166s">Hello,</a>  incoming McGlynn 6th graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1926.889s">I'm</a>  Sofia Hernandez, and I am a current 8th grader at McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1931.833s">And</a>  our community is so great because we don't just think about the ideal student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1937.237s">We</a>  don't think about the perfect student because that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1941.06s">What</a>  doesn't exist is you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1943.522s">And</a>  I know at the McGlynn community, we value that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1946.725s">We</a>  value you, and we value your thoughts and your opinions, and I hope you guys <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1952.099s">have</a>  an amazing year at the MacLenn and many more to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1957.723s">I</a>  hope to see you sometime soon when this is over, even though I'm going to be in high school, but I'll still make sure to stop by. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1966.368s">Bye,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1967.309s">All</a>  the teachers, staff, and the principal are very supportive and are always there to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1971.852s">Even</a>  if you have a question, whether it's silly or not, they will be there to answer it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1976.234s">Something</a>  that I've learned in my time at the MacLenn is that <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1979.224s">There</a>  are a bunch of fun clubs and sports that you should participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1983.609s">Another</a>  bonus of the clubs and sports is that it's combined with Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1987.192s">So</a>  even if all your friends went to the Andrews, you'll still be able to see them if you sign up for the same club or sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1993.719s">I</a>  personally signed up for book club and cross country and had a lot of fun being able to spend time with my friends.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=1999.721s">The</a>  only way to be in those clubs and sports, though, is if your grades are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2003.983s">And</a>  a way to keep your grades up is to keep your binder organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2008.326s">Your</a>  binder is where everything that you need is stored. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2011.187s">So</a>  if it's organized, it's going to make it much, much easier to get your grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2015.71s">Anyway,</a>  I hope you have a really, really good time at the Melbourne, and I'll see you in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2020.552s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2021.072s">I</a>  hope you're all doing well and staying safe at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2024.274s">My</a>  name is Mrs. Baptist, and I'm the band teacher at the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2028.306s">Now</a>  if you chose to enter into the instrumental music world in elementary school, whether band or strings, you probably saw me around or maybe I was even your teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2039.197s">So</a>  even though middle school is a really exciting time in your life, it can still be stressful or cause some anxiety because it's something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2047.608s">However,</a>  it's often comforting when you identify familiar people who will be on the journey with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2053.649s">So</a>  whether it's a friend or neighbor attending the same school as you, or already knowing one of your teachers like me, if you're a band student, sometimes that familiarity can help to ease your anxiety of the unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2066.591s">Regardless,</a>  middle school is going to be a wonderful phase of your academic career, and I can't wait to see my future band students on week one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2074.773s">Until</a>  then, take care, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2076.991s">stay</a>  well, and keep practicing those instruments.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2080.775s">Bye!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2098.12s">about</a>  and that you should walk into middle school confident. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2101.162s">After</a>  the win, you'll be able to contribute to our community and benefit from the diverse learning environment that is present here at McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2108.486s">You</a>  might walk into eighth, sixth grade nervous and afraid, but I can assure you that by the end of eighth grade, you'll be able to walk out confident and prepared for what awaits you in the future, just like what I'll be doing in two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2124.506s">elementary</a>  school, it has really become a part of who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2127.908s">I</a>  hope that your experiences at the McGlynn Middle School are exceptional and will make your middle school experience memorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2134.632s">I</a>  hope you have a great year and thanks for tuning in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2136.954s">McGlynn</a>  Middle School is special because we have the EL program, so you will make friends from all over the world.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2142.637s">Hi</a>  everyone, my name is Caroline. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2145.579s">I'm</a>  a sixth grader at McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2148.381s">I</a>  was asked to be a part of your open house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2151.547s">So</a>  Caroline, when you go to school, is there a special place to learn and grow as a person? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2155.929s">That's</a>  easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2156.689s">The</a>  teachers, they're so welcoming, they're so kind, and they really make it easy to learn.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2160.65s">Do</a>  you have any tips or strategies for incoming 6th grade students who may be conscious about their transition to middle school?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2168.974s">The</a>  best piece of advice that I have is to be prepared and do your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2172.815s">Because</a>  the people you meet in 6th grade will be your friends forever.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2176.216s">Welcome</a>  incoming 6th graders! <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2178.45s">students.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2179.03s">This</a>  is Mrs. Watson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2180.431s">I'm</a>  the School Psychologist at the Magdalena Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2183.353s">We're</a>  so excited to meet you next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2187.016s">So</a>  this is a great opportunity for you at lunch to sit with new people to make some new friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2193.66s">At</a>  the Magdalena, we have so many fabulous clubs, such as the Builders Club, the Art Club, the Chess Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2202.166s">We</a>  also have many sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2203.747s">You</a>  can play basketball, volleyball,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2210.606s">There</a>  are teachers who want to help you, so don't be afraid to ask for help at any time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2239.089s">I</a>  just wanted to share a few things that may be able to help you with your transition to the school next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2247.135s">First</a>  off, there's no need to be nervous or anxious about coming into middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2251.539s">There</a>  are always going to be challenges along the way, but it's a great place to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2254.781s">All</a>  the teachers are very understanding and are willing to stay after school with you if you need any help with your pedagogy for their class or subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2260.365s">And</a>  make sure to keep them up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2261.706s">Staying</a>  after school makes a big difference and a positive impact on your grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2265.117s">Secondly,</a>  being in middle school can give you many opportunities to make new friends and meet new people and get everyone to join together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2270.367s">And</a>  even if you do not have the same status as one of your friends, you can always just catch up with them in the morning or at lunch and reach them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2276.82s">This</a>  is what I do with some of my friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2278.52s">Also,</a>  staying in middle school means that you will not have a variety of classes with many different teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2283.262s">This</a>  may sound complicated, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2285.022s">Like</a>  I said earlier, you can always ask your teachers for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2287.343s">And</a>  being able to switch classes also gives you more freedom within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2290.563s">And</a>  you do not have to stay in line, which you may have had to in the past in elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2293.824s">I</a>  love it here at the Maglum Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2295.885s">Hello,</a>  everybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2296.705s">My</a>  name is Stark Marino. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2298.025s">I'm</a>  currently in eighth grade at the Maglum Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2300.466s">And</a>  I'm about to be a freshman. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2302.806s">And</a>  I came into the Maglum Middle School <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2305.467s">middle</a>  school in seventh grade in these past two years have been anything I could ever dream of in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2313.43s">The</a>  McGlynn has it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2314.431s">They</a>  have clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2315.591s">They</a>  have the greatest teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2317.192s">They'll</a>  always be there to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2318.913s">Any</a>  teacher that you want to talk to, you need help with something, they will help you with anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2323.435s">But</a>  you want to stay organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2324.555s">You</a>  want to stay on top of your homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2326.456s">You</a>  want to be on top of everything going on in class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2329.638s">Ask</a>  questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2330.858s">If</a>  you need any help with something, definitely ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2333.78s">Stay</a>  after if you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2335.721s">Everything,</a>  all that simple stuff, it all helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2338.683s">And</a>  I'd say the most important thing would be to be one step ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2343.108s">You</a>  know, if you know something's coming up, try to do, say you do your homework, say you have homework that's due in a week or you have a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2353.622s">do</a>  it day by day, little by little, if you have to, because then you don't want it to end up being, oh, you have a whole entire project due in two days and you haven't even started. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2364.188s">It's</a>  just smart to be one step ahead, and it really helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2367.61s">Especially</a>  as you go on in middle school, you know, seventh and eighth grade, it really does help to be on top of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2374.45s">know</a>  what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2375.451s">Like</a>  I said, ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2377.512s">Every</a>  teacher will be there to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2379.034s">If</a>  you need help with anything, you will have help with the McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2381.936s">Hi,</a>  my name is Mia Davis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2383.597s">I</a>  was an eighth grader from McGlynn last year, and from my experience, it was a very good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2390.173s">I'll</a>  even go as far as to say that these past three years have been probably the best three years of my life so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2397.199s">And</a>  yes, I do in fact have two pieces of advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2401.122s">First</a>  off is please, please don't spend time thinking or worrying about your social status. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2409.048s">It's</a>  so unimportant and overrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2411.98s">and</a>  I think that a lot of people get caught up worrying about it, which is dumb. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2416.243s">The</a>  second piece of advice that I have for you is to develop healthy relationships with the people around you, meaning your teachers and peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2425.57s">Make</a>  relationships with your teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2427.672s">It's</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2429.193s">I</a>  can honestly say that all the staff members are good people and they just want to see you succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2435.078s">That's</a>  their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2439.757s">This</a>  piece of advice is kind of cliche, but it's very important, and it's to make new friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2444.759s">You</a>  guys are coming from a place where you've been surrounded by the same people for about six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2450.721s">For</a>  most of you, that's the majority of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2454.143s">Trust</a>  me, I know it's tough making new friends, but it will definitely be worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2459.025s">I</a>  know it must seem scary going into middle school, especially at a time like now, but I'm here to give you some tips. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2464.827s">Make</a>  sure you stay organized throughout all of your years at the movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2468.846s">It</a>  will come so in handy, and it will make you feel so much better about yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2473.347s">Second</a>  of all, listen to your teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2476.608s">I</a>  know that is hard sometimes, but they know what's best for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2480.949s">So</a>  just listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2483.309s">And</a>  last but not least, enjoy your time at the MacMillan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2487.31s">Your</a>  years at the MacMillan will fly by. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2489.571s">You'll</a>  notice it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2491.191s">I</a>  know that I felt like I was in your position just a couple months ago, but really it was your <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2497.009s">I</a>  hope you guys enjoy your 3rd grade at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2502.252s">Hi</a>  future McGlynn 6th graders! <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2504.193s">I'm</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2504.493s">Mosh</a>  and I'm one of the teachers on Team 6B. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2507.115s">I</a>  want to start with you by saying how excited I am to get to meet all of you soon, and that you'll be coming to the McGlynn next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2514.999s">If</a>  I had to offer one piece of advice for any 6th grader coming in, it would be to always ask for help when you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2520.902s">Your</a>  teachers are here to help you, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2522.797s">And</a>  we'll start a school on days that we can to help you out with the transition to sixth grade, because sometimes it can be scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2528.843s">So</a>  best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2530.544s">Can't</a>  wait to meet you all soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2532.105s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2532.286s">I'm</a>  here to make a video helping you explain some tips and strategies we have for your first year of middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2537.27s">On</a>  the topic of different classes, all of your core classes, meaning math, science, ELA, and ancient civilizations, will be on the top floor online in many ways, like music, art, tech, engineering, and computer will be on the top two floors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2551.488s">7th</a>  and 6th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2554.21s">Academically</a>  in your classes, my best tips for you would be to keep your mind on your projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2559.213s">Always</a>  know your teachers are there to support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2563.396s">I</a>  am Simona Guardi, the Lieutenant Teacher at the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2568.279s">I</a>  wanted to give you a quick introduction of what we're going to do in 6th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2573.443s">This</a>  is our classroom and it's built on the 3rd floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2580.438s">What</a>  we've been doing in sixth grade is learning about the Italian alphabet, numbers, readings, colors, learning about the classroom commands. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2591.008s">We</a>  learn about the very basic, because this is our first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2594.731s">We</a>  learn about the Italian geography history, the food family, and how to describe ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2605.373s">Our</a>  typical class greetings were not fresh. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2608.855s">We</a>  talk about new vocabulary or we practice about something that we are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2616.22s">We</a>  do some writing and speaking assignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2618.501s">Sometimes</a>  we watch videos, we play games, and we work with authentic material. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2628.127s">Usually,</a>  I give you homework two or three times a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2631.488s">and</a>  we do tests and quizzes one or two times per quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2636.03s">What</a>  I'd really like to do with you is projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2639.011s">And</a>  usually, we do projects once every subject we learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2646.293s">There</a>  are so many reasons to learn Italian, and I can't wait to know what is yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2651.415s">So</a>  in the meantime, I want to wish you good luck in middle school, and I can't wait to meet you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2657.017s">Ciao.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2657.417s">And</a>  I very much hope to build a bridge between elementary school</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2662.15s">in</a>  the McGlynn Middle School, because the McGlynn Middle School has so much to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2666.752s">And</a>  the reason why I say that is because we have an unbelievable faculty that cares so deeply in our students.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2684.167s">I</a>  just want to wrap up by saying that I'm very humble today. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2687.531s">I'm</a>  a person that at one point in time was sitting in chairs like yours as a student of the Medford Public School System.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2693.738s">I</a>  know how special of an education and opportunity that you all have as students in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2699.462s">I</a>  just want to make sure you guys, each and every day, bring your best attitude, concentration, and effort to school each day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2705.725s">Because</a>  I know that if you do that, you'll be in a situation where you open up so many different opportunities for yourself, and the world will be yours.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2712.388s">You'll</a>  make the city proud of you, and that will be the Mustang winning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2991.331s">Thank</a>  you very much, Vinny. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2992.432s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2993.514s">Vinny's</a>  done a great job as a sixth grader this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=2996.518s">The</a>  next question that comes into our panel is, how do UA rotations work for classes like music, art, computer applications, and technology workshop? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3005.569s">I'll</a>  take that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3006.77s">You</a>  know, this is a very important part of what we offer here at the McGlynn Middle School, at the middle schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3012.415s">It</a>  provides a very well-rounded education, these unified arts classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3016.459s">What</a>  we do is we take a class like music, for instance, students that are enrolled in a class like music first quarter will go to that class four times per week for first quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3027.688s">Then</a>  when second quarter hits, would rotate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3030.811s">Students</a>  taking music would then go on to one of the computer or science classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3035.115s">So</a>  for instance, the next thing that they might take, the next class that they might take as a UA class would be computer applications during second quarter, meeting four times per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3044.183s">The</a>  third quarter, they would take art. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3046.798s">And</a>  then the fourth quarter, a student would take Tech Workshop. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3050.479s">It's</a>  a fantastic way, like I said, to become well-rounded, to support a lot of the work that you're doing in the core classes, too, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3057.121s">And</a>  a lot of students report having a lot of fun in each one of these classes, too, in addition to learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3062.382s">So</a>  certainly, we want you to have a great experience in our UA rotational classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3068.004s">The</a>  next question that comes in, looks like from the question board is, where's my locker and how does that whole situation work? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3075.334s">And</a>  to answer that question is Mrs. Taylor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3078.473s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3080.053s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3081.033s">And</a>  I can't wait to see some of you coming in next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3083.734s">I'm</a>  very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3085.554s">Your</a>  locker will be located near your homeroom, so you will not have to go too far in the morning from your locker to your homeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3093.376s">Most</a>  of us will assign you a locker just because it makes it so much easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3096.536s">And</a>  you have the option of having a lock on your locker, but we really do suggest you buy a lock because then you can practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3105.479s">Using</a>  a combination lock can be very tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3107.741s">There</a>  are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3111.806s">We</a>  really try to have you not get the ones with the key because if you forget your key at home, we can't help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3117.793s">At</a>  least with a combination lock, you can write it down in your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3121.838s">You</a>  can write it down and give it to your teacher so that we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3125.542s">The</a>  last thing we want to do is have to cut a lock that you bought yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3129.244s">So</a>  I would suggest combination locker, practice at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3132.747s">And</a>  when you come in for the first day of school, we will tell you where your locker is so that you can put all of your stuff away. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3138.812s">And</a>  that will be your locker for the whole year for sixth grade.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3142.435s">Thank</a>  you, Mrs. Taylor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3143.356s">And</a>  as Mr. Kremen said, who made a video appearance during the video, he mentioned how we have a teaming system, how students will be broken up between sides A and side B. There are four homerooms on side A and another four homerooms on side B. And as Mrs. Taylor just noted, your locker will be right across or right next to your homeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3163.049s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3163.329s">Thank</a>  you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3164.21s">Thank</a>  you, Mrs. Taylor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3165.911s">Next</a>  question that comes in is how do I sign up for a club or activity and what is the commitment like for a club at the middle school level? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3174.278s">Here</a>  to kick that question off and answer that question is eighth grader Derek Marino and we'll have others joining in soon.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3182.605s">Go</a>  ahead Derek. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3183.345s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3186.187s">So</a>  when you are going to join a club, there's a big club fair and you can you get little previews of the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3192.412s">You</a>  see what everything involves and you get to sign up for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3197.437s">And</a>  you want to go to the club as much as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3199.859s">But</a>  if you can't make it one day, it's totally OK if you can't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3204.723s">But</a>  you just try to go as much as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3207.365s">And</a>  it's fun and it makes them seem like more than just the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3210.287s">And</a>  you can really connect with other people and do fun things with the school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3214.298s">Thank</a>  you, Derek. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3214.9s">We'll</a>  kick it over to you, Sophia.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3216.997s">Um,</a>  so yeah, just to add on Derek, there's a big club fair and you get a sneak peek of all the clubs and for commitment wise, um, I'm in a lot of clubs and it mainly depends on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3231.2s">Who's</a>  running the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3232.72s">Cause</a>  I know some people might be more lenient and some might be like really strict to come, but I think you guys should join as many clubs as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3241.982s">Cause</a>  it just makes your McGlynn experience so much better.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3246.238s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3246.679s">Gnarly,</a>  did you have anything to add about the club or activities experience? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3249.982s">If</a>  you could unmute yourself, that'd be great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3253.445s">No,</a>  I have nothing to add because this is a really, really good thing about the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3261.633s">Most</a>  of the things they already said. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3267.058s">Oh</a>  my.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3270.461s">Thank</a>  you, Nali, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3271.442s">And</a>  as Derek and Sophia and Nali alluded to as well, we start off our year with a club and activities fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3277.345s">That</a>  club and activities fair takes place during one of our wind blocks in the month of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3282.528s">And</a>  what we also do is we have each one of the grades go through that club and activities fair and get a little taste of some of the clubs that are offered at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3291.854s">In</a>  addition, that day after school, our students get a chance to travel over to the Andrews Middle School and visit their club and activities fair after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3299.478s">Because</a>  as we talked about, you know, we certainly want to encourage our students at both the Andrews and McGlynn to come see each other, see their friends after school and meet up in a club and activity setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3309.646s">So</a>  certainly a very valuable part of the middle school experience to make you feel like you're a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3314.13s">We</a>  want to make you feel invested in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3317.012s">And</a>  one of the greatest ways to do that is to get involved right from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3321.337s">Thank</a>  you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3321.917s">Okay,</a>  next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3323.718s">We're</a>  going to keep Gnarly up, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3325.058s">Gnarly</a>  is an eighth grader, a wonderful student ambassador. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3328.339s">She's</a>  actually an English language learner student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3331.2s">And</a>  Gnarly, this question is for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3332.881s">I'm</a>  an EL student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3335.201s">So</a>  what type of classes do I have at the middle school?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3340.503s">What</a>  type of classes do I have? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3343.104s">The</a>  type of classes I have is like ELA, science, math, and <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3351.46s">civics</a>  and ELA is like that if that depend on the level you are like if you speak really good English you'll be a B4 ELA student but if you are like someone who is like new and you are learning English you will have um one form that is Miss McDonough teacher that have I have her <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3380.117s">and</a>  because I'm an ELA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3384.26s">I'm</a>  an ELA once and for all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3387.783s">Thank</a>  you very much, Narali. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3388.743s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3389.404s">And</a>  one of the things Narali was alluding to was one of her EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3393.167s">Some</a>  of those EL teachers like Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3394.488s">McDonough.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3395.208s">And</a>  in the sixth grade, we have EL teachers like Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3398.29s">Rangel</a>  or Mr. Seip who are there to support the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3402.093s">Students</a>  like Narali are in some co-taught classes at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3407.957s">All</a>  of our, we build an inclusive model for educating our students at the McGlynn Middle School and students like Narali would be in co-taught math as well as science classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3420.044s">Even</a>  some of the level ones and two students, the students that are just new to our country and new to our school will take those types of classes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3428.128s">In</a>  addition, they participate in all the rest of our UA offerings and <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3432.55s">clubs</a>  and activities and certainly are a very valuable part of our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3437.533s">The</a>  students coming from different countries and might be learning the English language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3441.776s">They</a>  add a lot to our school and one of the best parts of our school is the wonderful diversity that we celebrate every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3449.801s">So</a>  thank you very much, Natalie. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3451.001s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3452.708s">The</a>  next question today is coming in from the audience here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3457.011s">It</a>  says, what is your favorite extracurricular club activity or sport and why? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3462.035s">Here</a>  to answer that question is sixth grader, Amber Beardsley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3466.258s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3468.894s">My</a>  favorite sport would probably be cross country, because it was really fun to be able to see people, both from the Andrews and other people from the McGlynn, who were also in seventh grade or eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3482.824s">And</a>  it was nice to see the teachers, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3485.305s">And</a>  being able to go to the away meets was fun, too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3490.189s">Thank</a>  you very much, Emma. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3491.53s">Vinny,</a>  do you have anything to add on that particular topic there about your favorite extra-curricular callback to your sport and why?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3499.924s">I</a>  don't think so, no.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3500.845s">Okay,</a>  how about you Sophia?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3507.069s">So</a>  one of my favorite clubs is actually String Ensemble. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3510.971s">This</a>  is kind of an addition to orchestra and you audition for it and we meet every Tuesday and it's so fun because you get to meet with all your friends and you just make really fun music.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3525.24s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3525.901s">How</a>  about yourself Derek?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3529.272s">Um,</a>  my favorite <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3530.78s">After</a>  school activity was definitely baseball, because this was the first year that they had the middle school teams for sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3537.245s">And</a>  I wasn't, I couldn't actually play on the team, but I still went to pretty much every game. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3542.168s">And</a>  they were all fun to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3544.049s">And</a>  they were competitive games, actual playing baseball for representing the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3550.374s">And</a>  that was really fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3551.975s">And</a>  I think if you're into any sport, because they have basketball, they have a good variety of sports that you can play for whatever you enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3559.981s">And</a>  it's fun.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3561.252s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3562.133s">And,</a>  you know, recommendation that a lot of the students and teachers mentioned about getting involved in your club activity or sport and build off of what Derek mentioned about the sports and the greater Boston League sports programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3577.261s">That</a>  was such a fantastic addition to our school year this current year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3654.974s">I</a>  think we're just having a little bit of technical difficulties.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3669.471s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3669.751s">Good</a>  evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3670.752s">My</a>  name is Peter Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3671.513s">I'm</a>  the assistant superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3672.954s">And</a>  so unfortunately, we have lost Mr. Tucci's feed live from the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3679.481s">We're</a>  going to continue to go through the questions that are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3682.604s">As</a>  you can see, I'm in a sweatshirt, so I wasn't even prepared to be on screen tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3687.489s">However,</a>  I have to say that Mr. Tucci and all his team have put in a tremendous amount of effort, and we've definitely encountered some technical bugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3694.914s">With</a>  our streaming tonight that we're not here when we did a test run the other day, so we apologize for that however We're gonna wait for mr.. Tucci to come in and in the interim we will continue with the questions and so I <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3712.113s">Does</a>  the school have a PTO? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3713.674s">And</a>  if so, how can you get involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3716.014s">What's</a>  awesome is that the schools in Medford all have really phenomenal and awesome PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3723.997s">They've</a>  put together some tremendous events in my first year being in Medford, and they were working on the Wizards game, which would have happened right as we were unfortunately going out for closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3737.39s">I</a>  know that the PTOs are doing a tremendous job to bring families together and to bring students together as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3745.138s">I</a>  just see that Principal Tucci has come back in, so I will turn the baton back over to him and hopefully we are all good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3753.426s">Thank</a>  you and I look forward to seeing all of you as students in the McGlynn Middle School next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3765.165s">Hi</a>  everybody, I'm back and thank you very much for your patience here during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3769.287s">The</a>  question was about our PTO and I just certainly wanted to just mention that we would love to have any parents or guardians out there involved and actively involved in our school's PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3780.651s">We</a>  have a PTO page on Facebook and would love for you to go in and like that page and inquire with our active PTO to see how you can get involved in the life of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3790.494s">This</a>  is an organization that meets on a monthly basis and we collaborate in order to try to find ways to make the operations at our school so much better for our students and bring in some inspirational speakers to come and speak to our students and to have some wonderful extracurricular events too as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3807.909s">Our</a>  PTO is wonderful and I can't thank them enough and I would love to invite and welcome the newest Mustangs and the members of your family and your <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3816.716s">guardians</a>  to participate in our school's PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3819.198s">So</a>  please do like our PTO page on Facebook if you have a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3823.902s">The</a>  next question that is coming in is going to be directed towards Mr. Harrington, our eighth grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3830.248s">He</a>  teaches math. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3831.309s">The</a>  question is, is there a way for me to take accelerated classes at the middle school level?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3837.227s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci, and welcome to our incoming sixth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3840.849s">I'm</a>  looking forward to seeing you all in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3844.211s">Most</a>  classes at the middle school are heterogeneously grouped, which means students are grouped randomly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3851.395s">However,</a>  there is an opportunity for students to get on an advanced track in mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3856.137s">As</a>  it is currently, at the end of your sixth grade year, you would take what we call a placement exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3862.931s">Those</a>  exam results, coupled with other factors such as your grade and teacher recommendation, contribute to whether or not you'd be selected for what we call an accelerated seventh grade year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3873.399s">That</a>  seventh grade course would combine your seventh and eighth grade math curriculum, so it's pretty rigorous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3879.803s">Upon</a>  successful completion of that seventh grade course, you would then take Algebra I as an eighth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3886.329s">And</a>  taking Algebra 1 as an 8th grader would allow you more opportunities for more advanced classes later on in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3893.654s">But</a>  rest assured, whether or not you take Algebra 1 or you're in regular grade 8 math, you're going to get an excellent education with very supportive adults who are there to help you at every step along the way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3907.23s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Harrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3908.451s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3909.792s">The</a>  next question comes in from the audience once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3912.875s">It's</a>  asked, can I join a club at the Andrews Middle School so that I can see my friends there? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3916.858s">So</a>  I'm wondering if we could put a few of the students on and ask them this question to see if they had the opportunity to participate in a club or activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3926.406s">maybe</a>  with any of the Andrews at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3928.967s">I</a>  know there are a couple really popular ones that our middle school students have attended, you know, in addition to those greater Boston League sports that we collaborate with the Andrews Middle School on as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3938.792s">So</a>  can I turn it over to Sophia or Emma or Derek to take that question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3951.412s">I</a>  personally didn't do a club at the Andrews, but I do know that you can sign up for clubs at the Andrews and see your friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3959.859s">And</a>  if any kids from the Andrews sign up for clubs at the McGlynn, that also can work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3966.596s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3967.237s">I</a>  know that one of the more popular clubs that many of our students will go to at the Andrews Middle School is the soccer club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3974.104s">They</a>  have an indoor soccer club that takes place right in the fall at the Andrews Middle School, and a lot of our students love attending that club. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3980.852s">One</a>  other club at the Andrews Middle School that our students love to go to is the basketball club at the Andrews Middle School office, which is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=3988.319s">There's</a>  a very popular club that we have here at McGlynn Middle School, which is our engineering club, and many students from Andrews Middle School come to our engineering club every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4000.344s">So</a>  certainly, we like to build that bridge between the middle schools right next to one another, and we want to give students many opportunities to go collaborate and interact with their peers across Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4012.625s">Okay,</a>  next question that comes in is for sixth grade teachers, Mr. Taylor and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4016.871s">Whalen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4017.672s">The</a>  question is, how do I know which teachers stay after and on which days?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4024.861s">I</a>  think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4025.402s">Whalen</a>  is going to take this one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4033.407s">Hi</a>  guys, I'm really excited to meet all of you next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4037.509s">I</a>  am so looking forward to being back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4040.79s">Um,</a>  when you guys come into our classrooms on the very first day, we're going to give you something like a letter of introduction or a syllabus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4048.513s">And</a>  on there, we'll have our days that we stay after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4052.395s">In</a>  addition, we usually have our days put up on the board and they sometimes change from week to week, depending on meetings that we might have after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4060.098s">And</a>  I know a lot of teachers also keep those days updated on their personal websites or on team websites, so you can always check there as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4068.228s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4069.069s">Whittle,</a>  and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4071.171s">Next</a>  question here is going to be to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4073.975s">Liu,</a>  the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4075.356s">Where</a>  do I pick up the bus in the morning and also in the afternoon? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4078.921s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4079.161s">Liu,</a>  take it away.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4082.543s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4083.964s">Okay,</a>  so the week before school starts, you should go and check on Mecklenburg Public Schools' website for the list of the buses and look at the stops and find the one closest to your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4096.032s">That</a>  will bring you to the front of the school in the mornings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4099.454s">It</a>  goes right to the front of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4102.256s">In</a>  the afternoon at 2.15, you'll walk over to the Andrews and pick up the afternoon bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4107.44s">You</a>  should also check to make sure that your afternoon bus is the same bus number or a different one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4113.744s">That</a>  you can also check on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4116.265s">And</a>  then we also have the late buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4118.327s">The</a>  late buses usually will, they start at three o'clock and that will be time to your after school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4125.612s">You</a>  always want to get down here and be in the cafeteria and you wait for Mr. Chuchi to call when your late bus arrives. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4132.376s">because</a>  it will go to the Andrews first. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4134.737s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chiu-Chiu.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4139.199s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4140.059s">Lu.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4140.939s">The</a>  next question that we have is directed towards some students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4144.14s">The</a>  question is, is there recess in the middle school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4147.682s">And</a>  what do you do at recess? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4149.242s">So</a>  we'll bring some of our students back on and hopefully they can help us answer that question right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4155.645s">Go</a>  ahead, Emma.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4157.319s">Um,</a>  so for the middle school, we do have recess, but we don't have like a playground or any specific area, um, except for the basketball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4168.002s">And</a>  we do go out to the formality field and you can run around the track and, um, you and miss Lou bring out the, um, the bag with all basketballs and soccer balls and other stuff that you can use.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4183.516s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4184.117s">Are</a>  there any other students who would like to add to the recess experience at the middle school level?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4190.964s">No,</a>  I think it's covered.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4193.709s">Okay,</a>  well, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4194.489s">You</a>  know, one thing I should add is that I mentioned in the video that the day is broken up into eight different blocks or periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4202.774s">And</a>  one of those periods, one of the eight, is our lunch and recess time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4207.557s">So</a>  you'd have the opportunity to, by grade level, go and access the cafeteria, eat your lunch, and then after students are done eating lunch, then we typically will head outside for recess, as the student said. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4218.863s">We</a>  tend to congregate by the basketball court, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4221.444s">And</a>  we also are very blessed to have an opportunity where we have Hormel Stadium right across the way from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4227.327s">So</a>  we open up the gates and we get the chance to play on the synthetic turf material at the field and run around and play some ball and socialize and just get some fresh air and get ready to learn once again after recess is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4238.152s">So</a>  thank you very much, students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4240.253s">Next</a>  question is going to be going towards sixth grader Vinny D. Martino. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4244.255s">The</a>  question is, how do I sign up for a fall sport like baseball, softball, or cross country? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4249.477s">And</a>  what's the time commitment like for a sport? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4251.759s">I</a>  know Vinny played on the basketball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4254.44s">He</a>  was one of the sixth graders that made the basketball team this last year, and they were greater Boston League champions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4261.105s">Congratulations,</a>  Vinny. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4262.385s">Tell</a>  us a little bit about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4264.027s">Thanks</a>  again, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4265.528s">So</a>  if you want to sign up for a sport, your parents have to fill out a form on the <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4271.75s">school's</a>  website to allow you to try out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4274.973s">And</a>  like Mr. Tucci said, I was fortunate enough to play on the boys basketball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4281.118s">And</a>  the commitment, the time and commitment was like two to three days a week, games and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4288.304s">And</a>  your grades play a huge, huge part in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4291.707s">And</a>  I encourage everybody to try out because it was just a great experience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4297.363s">Well,</a>  thank you, Vinny. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4298.244s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4299.766s">Certainly</a>  in the fall, we plan to offer both baseball and softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4304.29s">And</a>  in addition, we'll also be offering cross country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4307.494s">You</a>  know, the cross country is a co-ed sport, so both boys and girls can play in the cross country team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4313.9s">So</a>  these were fantastic, as I said before, a great opportunity for our students to wear Medford across their chest and to represent the blue and white both in our school community and in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4327.255s">In</a>  order to play a greater Boston League sport, <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4329.838s">Students</a>  have to pass all of their core classes and they also have to maintain a very good behavior record in school Do a great job of representing themselves and following the Mustang way and being on time to school and being having consistent school attendance so certainly we want to make sure that people are carrying themselves to a very high esteem and Representing ourselves in our school in a very proper way in their communities We really encourage you to give a shot these clubs activities or sports It seems to be a common theme and many of the questions we're feeling here tonight people are interested in that <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4360.679s">Okay,</a>  the next question I have goes to a few teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4363.38s">Is</a>  there one place where I can find out what's going on in the school each day or week?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4370.965s">Every</a>  single morning you're gonna come in and they're gonna show the morning show during homeroom and that's a great way to find out what's going on not only during the week but on that particular day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4381.475s">And</a>  Mr. Tucci does a really good job of updating the school's Google calendar, which you can access from the school's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4388.699s">So</a>  that way, if parents want to know if there's a PTO meeting or a dance coming up or anything like that, they have the ability to see things that are in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4400.407s">One</a>  of the things I'll also add is that it was mentioned during the video that we have our morning show, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4406.651s">Wayland</a>  mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4407.592s">And</a>  that morning show is broadcast every single day inside the students' homeroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4411.775s">And</a>  it's a great way where students exercise some leadership and get the great opportunity to broadcast the morning news. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4417.519s">It's</a>  really a great way for students to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4419.4s">We</a>  highlight student achievements there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4421.201s">We</a>  show some pretty cool videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4423.143s">and</a>  make sure that people are very much informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4425.927s">So</a>  we want to make sure we inform our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4428.532s">And</a>  in fact, I do invite you to go to our school's website and check out the McGlynn morning show. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4434.541s">We're</a>  actually still doing it even during the school closure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4440.257s">I</a>  think he was saying to check out the McGlynn morning show during the school closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4443.878s">Mr.</a>  Villard, who operates the morning show during the school year, he has been putting together remote shows with the help of a lot of students and teachers that have been sending in clips. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4454.162s">It's</a>  been really wonderful to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4456.123s">Miss</a>  Bellini, who's a seventh grade science teacher, has been doing a moment of science, and you'll see a bunch of different teachers showing you how they stay active and how they stay engaged and they continue to learn during this time of remote learning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4469.875s">Thank</a>  you very much for picking up while I was off there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4472.676s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4475.297s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4475.697s">We're</a>  done here with just wrapping up with a few more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4479.398s">The</a>  next question we have from the audience is, when will I find out where my homeroom is and who my teachers are? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4485.32s">So</a>  I'll take that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4487.34s">Over</a>  the summertime, this is a time where myself as a principal, I'll be busy scheduling and making sure that everybody has a good schedule and is placed accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4495.703s">I</a>  would say that sometime in about mid-August, we will have students in the sixth grade have an opportunity to have a good understanding of who their teachers are and what their schedules are. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4505.153s">In</a>  fact, our plans are to have a summer barbecue and orientation about a week or a week and a half before the school year begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4513.101s">So</a>  we'll invite you to that event. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4515.042s">We</a>  think that'll be a great way for you to come together, meet some of your sixth grade teachers, and that's when we will give you your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4521.765s">So</a>  you'll get your schedule in advance of any other student here at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4524.967s">We'll</a>  walk you through when you come in for an orientation, and get you a chance to meet with each one of your teachers, you know, find out where your locker is, and really <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4534.791s">feel</a>  very connected and feel very much like you are going to have a positive experience before even the school year starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4542.113s">So</a>  I would say that you'll get a chance to understand who your teachers are, where your homeroom is, your locker, at least a week before the school year starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4550.455s">So</a>  we'll make sure that you feel very comfortable along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4553.336s">As</a>  always, though, if there's any questions, you can certainly reach out to me in advance, and I'm happy to make any special arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4560.168s">Okay,</a>  and our final question, just in conclusion here this evening, is what advice do you offer to an incoming sixth grader to help guide them towards achieving their goals in middle school? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4571.0s">So</a>  I keep the teachers on the screen here, and I'll start with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4575.144s">Whalen,</a>  if you don't mind, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4576.405s">Whalen,</a>  what's your piece of advice for an incoming sixth grader?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4580.524s">Um,</a>  I am all about organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4583.365s">I</a>  really recommend that you keep your agenda and your binder organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4587.525s">That</a>  is going to help you stay on top of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4590.486s">And</a>  if you ever need help organizing something, all of your teachers are there to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4594.627s">I</a>  personally love organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4596.307s">You</a>  can visit me anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4598.207s">I'll</a>  have a grand time just going through your binder. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4601.048s">Uh,</a>  but just if you stay organized and you have a clean binder and a clean locker, it's going to make your day a lot easier.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4609.076s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4609.957s">Whalen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4610.277s">Mr.</a>  Harrington, can I go to you next?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4612.959s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4613.48s">I</a>  think the biggest piece of advice I could give these sixth graders would be to listen to the advice that these wonderful student ambassadors have given you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4621.406s">Those</a>  are the guys that are in it each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4623.308s">You're</a>  all going to be in their shoes next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4626.591s">And</a>  they serve as wonderful role models, a cream of the crop of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4631.075s">So</a>  listen to what they have to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4633.437s">But</a>  I would also give you two pieces of advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4635.799s">Number</a>  one, get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4638.257s">There</a>  are extracurricular opportunities in drama, athletics, the arts, CCSR, all of those highlighted in the video that we showed earlier, right, the middle school experience is what you make of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4648.741s">So</a>  we want to be, we want to see you involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4651.722s">And</a>  secondly, I would say to advocate for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4655.647s">Middle</a>  school is a new phase in your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4658.428s">You're</a>  growing, you're getting more mature, and oftentimes this is when students find their voice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4664.09s">So</a>  as Derek Marino advised you earlier, if you have a question, ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4668.871s">If</a>  you have something to share in class, do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4673.133s">Again,</a>  as I mentioned earlier, the adults are there to support you and foster you, and I look forward to seeing you in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4680.575s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Tucci.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4681.875s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Stanton.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4684.932s">One</a>  piece of advice that I could give is treat school like family. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4689.194s">We</a>  are your family as soon as you walk in that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4692.035s">And</a>  that's how you're treated all those three years with every single teacher you're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4696.377s">So</a>  if you have a problem, if you're upset or something is going on, you can always come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4703.26s">We're</a>  there for you every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4705.041s">And</a>  every day is a new day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4707.022s">If</a>  you make a mistake one day, the next day is a clean slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4709.787s">We're</a>  not going to be holding grudges because we are all learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4713.374s">Even</a>  as adults, every day, we are learning with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4716.44s">So</a>  we are all in this together.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4719.295s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Taylor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4721.136s">Well,</a>  certainly, I hope that everybody enjoyed the experience here this evening, and thank you very much for persevering through some technical glitches. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4728.839s">I</a>  greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4730.039s">I</a>  want to take a moment to once again thank our panel for participating in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4733.52s">They</a>  did a great job answering the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4735.821s">I</a>  also want to thank you for tuning in to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4738.402s">I</a>  hope that you found it to be informative and please do not be afraid to reach out to me in the coming weeks or months leading up to your transition to the Lynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4746.165s">Thank</a>  you very much for watching and we hope that you have a great finish to the school year and have a wonderful night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XR045-Loi0M&t=4753.249s">Thank</a>  you everybody.</p>
