00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:06,915
Good evening, everybody, and welcome to the Thursday, March 28th meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,017
We have four cases today.

3
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:16,600
Dennis, do you want to read in the language for the Zoom?

4
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:27,065
On March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the Open Meeting Law to March 31st, 2025.

5
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:37,875
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at any location, and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

6
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:47,856
The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law, other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

7
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:52,057
Thank you.

8
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:54,658
Our chair, Mike Caldera, is away today.

9
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,178
I'll be filling in for him as chair.

10
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:02,512
Do you want to read in the first item 290 Salem Street?

11
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:03,493
Yes.

12
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:09,719
290 Salem Street case number 8-2023-14 continued from February 29th.

13
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:19,608
Applicant and owner 290 Salem Street LLC is petitioning for a variance in the chapter 94 city micro zoning to construct a seven-unit residential structure with commercial space and a department one zoning district allowed use.

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:28,910
With insufficient front and side yard setbacks, block coverage, lot area, and number of units per square foot of land, City of Medford zoning ordinance, chapter 94, section 6, table B, table of dimensional requirements.

15
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:32,433
Thank you.

16
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,175
And do we have a representative for the applicant?

17
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,909
Good evening, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

18
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:41,314
My name is Adam Barnosky, for the record, 255 State Street, Boston.

19
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:42,595
I'm an attorney for the applicant.

20
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:49,342
With me tonight is Fernando Vento, the principal and owner of the property, as well as the project architect, Jacob Levine.

21
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:55,889
So we are here on a continued hearing relative to zoning only for new mixed-use development at 290 Salem.

22
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,414
At a hearing last month, we went through this project before the board in detail.

23
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:14,628
As you might recall, this board was supportive of the project and the request for relief, but due to the subsequent continued Community Development Board hearing, this board wanted to ensure that no changes would be requested by the Community Development Board that would affect

24
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,050
the dimensions of the project and the related relief that we're seeking.

25
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:26,437
As such, the board, the ZBA, continued the matter to allow the applicant to appear before this Community Development Board, which it did last week.

26
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:37,687
So now, due to recent changes in the zoning ordinance, as this board is likely aware, the Community Development Board cannot approve the site plan until the underlying zoning is approved.

27
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:44,456
So as a result, we do have another hearing before the Community Development Board in order to approve the site plan in the proper order.

28
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:52,707
But the Community Development Board did make clear on the record at last week's hearing that it was the requests that it's made, which are

29
00:02:53,648 --> 00:03:06,533
very minor considering the scope of the project relate only to aesthetics and there would be no request on anything that would affect the footprint, the use, the dimensions or anything else that could affect the zoning.

30
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:11,175
I believe that a memo was sent to the board by community development staff.

31
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,130
this afternoon to that effect.

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:35,388
So with that being said, Mr. Chair, if you'd like, understanding that there's no real impact to zoning, so there's no changes to this project that are new, that affect any relief that this board is granting, if you please, we could go through some of the changes that we made to impact the visual and streetscape of the building.

33
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:40,507
I put is just let let me interrupt I skipped a step we do need to do a roll call.

34
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,229
And then we'll proceed.

35
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,452
So just a real roll call for members.

36
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:46,913
Jim Torani.

37
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,416
Christie about it.

38
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,139
Mary Lee present.

39
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,363
You've got the last president and Jamie Thompson present.

40
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:10,661
And voting today, we are missing both Mike Caldera and Andre LaRue.

41
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:16,245
So Mary and Christy Vetta will be voting members today.

42
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,567
Back to 290 Salem Street.

43
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:19,947
Thank you.

44
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,708
Attorney Baranski, go ahead.

45
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,141
Yeah, so that was really the end of my preliminary comments.

46
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:34,202
I wanted to see if the board wanted to see the updates to the project, which we could go through relatively succinctly.

47
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:35,702
No, we appreciate it.

48
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:35,982
Thank you.

49
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,103
Sure, I'll pass it off to Jacob Levine.

50
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:41,443
Good evening, board.

51
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,164
My name is Jacob Levine.

52
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:47,564
I am at 27 Congress Street in Salem, Mass.

53
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,945
And I will share with everybody our updates.

54
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:03,736
So receiving feedback from the Community Development Board, there were a couple topics that wanted to be clarified with the project.

55
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:12,642
First of all was a look at the 3D with a little bit more landscape to match the actual landscape plan.

56
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:18,887
So as we walk through this update, you will see the landscape in the drawings and in the 3D.

57
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:33,885
The other topic of consideration was the corner on Salem Street and Park Street, and we'll show after this presentation a quick study of what we looked at this corner and where we landed on that design.

58
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,506
And the other change that you'll be able to see in 3D is just

59
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:51,468
Before we had this two-foot projection here on the balcony, we just opened up that balcony, gave that as open space to the tenant, and kept the bump out on Salem Street.

60
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,792
But on Park Street, we're just going to make it green space for them.

61
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,283
So I'm going to run through this presentation.

62
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:06,965
There are no changes to the floor plan, to the floor plate, to the ground floor, to our actual size of building or unit layouts.

63
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:16,287
Again, the only changes are we took the bump out here and gave them some outdoor space, which we felt like the Community Development Board appreciated.

64
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:20,548
Roof deck.

65
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:31,383
We wanted to provide a little bit more clarification on the materials of the building before we were showing kind of a red brick to match what was across the street.

66
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:36,665
And contextually, we ended up going with more of a textured color brick to match the lower floors.

67
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:39,227
We're going to have a glass curtain wall of some sort.

68
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:46,510
We were suggested to look at a project on Cabot Street over by Assembly Square.

69
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,851
They have a glass corner there.

70
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:55,724
You know, at this time, we're just showing glass, but in reality, it will be a form of curtain wall with spandrel panels and whatnot.

71
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:57,465
It won't be all clear glass.

72
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,366
And then a composite siding.

73
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:03,727
Before we were showing some more colors and trying to match and.

74
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:17,292
Sorry about that.

75
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:18,012
I was trying to.

76
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,110
Let someone in and I think I actually clicked on so I think you should be fine.

77
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:22,830
Thank you.

78
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,290
You're all good.

79
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,891
Sorry about that.

80
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:24,892
No problem.

81
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:31,877
So we wanted to show in context, the building and what it would look like on the corner.

82
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,540
Again, taking some feedback from the community development board.

83
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:47,681
We went with more of a gray scheme with this nice colored brick to try to match what's across the street, and then keeping in line the same bump outs that they have on Salem Street to try to create a unity looking down this street.

84
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,243
And then on Park Street would actually have the curved balconies.

85
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:54,467
But again, no change to the floor plan, floor plate, or anything of that matter.

86
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:03,134
We were also suggested to look at a shadow study, which we've presented to the Community Development Board, which everyone appreciated.

87
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:07,403
There's any questions on this I can answer them after but I'm just going to move to that.

88
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:19,021
We're also asked to present a figure ground drawing so you could just kind of see how on the first floor where the building actually sits in relation to the site, along with a solar study showing how much

89
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:34,939
solar panels we would fit on the back half of the building and what the actual outcome would be and the positive benefit of having a green quote space on the ground floor and then the solar panels on the top and the effect that would have on the micro environment.

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:49,794
And then lastly, we were asked just to kind of present a couple more images in context to show that massing on the building and how it might sit on the figure ground again, in relation to the street and in relation to its neighbors.

91
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:57,936
We again are showing the updated landscape plan and this new fancy corner.

92
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:03,638
So I'm going to just show briefly a slide here.

93
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,099
that, again, the Community Development Board appreciated.

94
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:15,063
We started with this open concept on the corner with the balconies, with the rounded part on Park Street.

95
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:24,108
Then we continued to develop the idea of balconies, and then looking at glass, and then looking at a solid with punch-outs.

96
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:30,911
That's what left us with the idea of the void, which was always the concept of the design there.

97
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,952
A lot of thought went into that corner.

98
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:46,906
And then if anyone has any questions, I also have the civil plans and the landscape plans, which had no changes since the last time we presented this to you last month.

99
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:51,267
So at this point, I'm open for questions and same with the rest of the team.

100
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:54,668
And if there's anything else we can answer, please let us know.

101
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,989
We appreciate this opportunity and your time tonight.

102
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:57,609
Thank you.

103
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:02,591
Okay.

104
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,264
Do any members of the board have questions for the applicant?

105
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,231
Yeah, I do.

106
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:22,743
Jamie, my question would be, could you show us where the commercial space is?

107
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:23,904
Could you point that out?

108
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,010
Absolutely.

109
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,931
So the commercial space would come in right off Salem State Street.

110
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,652
So we have two spaces here.

111
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:38,453
We have one and two, um, and it would be directly off Salem Street.

112
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:49,336
And then on Park Street, the entry for tenants would be either parking and coming through this door, or if they're walking or taking public transit, uh, coming through this door here.

113
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:54,897
So commercial space one and two, pretty much the whole ground floor is dedicated to commercial space.

114
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:57,198
Thank you.

115
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:10,826
OK, any other questions from the board?

116
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,067
Mr. Chair, I have a question.

117
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:13,748
Go ahead, Chris.

118
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,329
Thank you.

119
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:27,999
I appreciate the additional drawings, and especially the ground plate site plan drawing there.

120
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,379
It's good.

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,083
I asked a question a few weeks ago about,

122
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:43,778
the angle, the elevation, if you will, on Park Street looking, I guess, east.

123
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:59,661
And it wasn't clear to me what the back or rear of the building, I think, if I could call it that, the part farthest away from Salem Street would look like.

124
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,841
And do you have any

125
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,638
oblique angles from that direction.

126
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,580
I see the elevation.

127
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:26,090
There was one rendering, an aerial that you showed earlier, that sort of showed what the rear may look like, but it's the

128
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,331
Yeah.

129
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:40,416
But there's no angle from Park Street looking at the back of that, correct?

130
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:48,160
You would be referring to if I was standing where my mouse is over here on Park Street looking back at the building?

131
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,203
I don't have a 3D shot of that.

132
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:58,026
It's a pretty matching facade on the back.

133
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,381
Um, just in terms of the same band, the same composites.

134
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,944
And then we were actually recommended by the board.

135
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,225
I'm just gonna open the floor plan.

136
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:15,972
Uh, so it kind of be bedrooms back there and maybe a living space that if there's an opportunity, because this part is actually covered parking.

137
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:37,101
So is there an opportunity where we have a fence line here to do something more of like a green wall, or a kind of a nicer look at, you know, what could be possible with this, you know, rear, rear fence, which we appreciated and, you know, our landscape team was was looking at an option for that, you know, down the line.

138
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:38,995
on what that could be.

139
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:44,517
But in terms of just like a 3D shot of the rear of the building, I do not have it.

140
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,298
That would be the closest you could get.

141
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,998
But it's just the similar facade.

142
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,519
It's just the ribbon that wraps.

143
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,160
OK.

144
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:04,623
And is that going to be the service area where any trucks for the businesses would load and the dumpster would be kept?

145
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:13,699
So we've been thinking that the dumpster would actually be kept in here and service would happen through Park Street.

146
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,202
So back there would just be parking for tenants actually.

147
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:21,446
I have a just a simple kind of on that figure ground.

148
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:28,271
It just kind of shows where they plan to do roll out dumpsters so that we have what we call the lawn here on the site plan.

149
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:32,595
And then the dumpster and service spot would be here that kind of gets rolled out and picked up.

150
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:48,898
Okay, and just again on the rear of the building, there's no variance being requested for that, because you're 15 feet from the line, I believe?

151
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:58,985
Yeah, we are just looking at front and side yard setbacks.

152
00:14:59,505 --> 00:14:59,705
Okay.

153
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,096
OK, that's my question for now.

154
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:07,397
Thank you.

155
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,802
I appreciate it.

156
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:16,079
I'd like for you to expand a little bit more about the dumpster trash plan there.

157
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,203
It looks like a strained area for a dumpster to pass through, especially because the building overhangs.

158
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:29,125
And those spots are assigned spots for tenants, correct?

159
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:36,929
So that dumpster would be pulled out and sitting on a curb on waiting for it to be picked up and the same with

160
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:40,270
recycling bins and things of that nature.

161
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:48,512
I also live in a building and I recognize that those bins get taken out every week.

162
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:55,373
All of them rolled out, all lined up, taking up a specific spot in our parking lot.

163
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:59,294
But if we didn't have that spot in our parking lot, it would be on the sidewalk.

164
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:04,576
For this particular building, where would it live while they're waiting to get picked up?

165
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:05,816
Sure.

166
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:14,389
I are, Adam are our site plan team isn't on right now are they are the civil team.

167
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,212
No, they are not but from what I recall.

168
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:23,755
that they mentioned during the Community Development Board last week.

169
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:27,097
And Jacob, if you have anything to add to this, let me know.

170
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:40,546
But from what I recall, they said that they anticipated it would really depend on the company that was doing the picking up of the waste, but that they anticipated being able to hire a company that would park

171
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,552
and pull the dumpster into location, empty it, and put it back to location, right?

172
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,013
That would seem to be the preferred method.

173
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:54,196
Otherwise, it would create problems with folks within the building that were parking.

174
00:16:56,497 --> 00:17:04,401
So I guess to answer that question as well, there is a dedicated spot for the dumpster where it lives, let's say, you know,

175
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,059
6.8 times out of the week.

176
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:27,193
And then the dumpster truck comes in, it gets rolled out by the, um, you know, the property management team and disposed of, and then rolled back into its, its spot, which has been designated on the civil plan, the architecture plan, and, uh, the landscape plan has it as well.

177
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:31,036
Um, scale wise, you know, we're looking at those rollout dumpsters.

178
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,135
which are something similar to that in nature.

179
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:37,437
So one recycling, one trash, and it's seven units.

180
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:44,201
So it's not, you know, we're not talking about 30 units worth of trash and recycling here.

181
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:46,823
So it seems like that's a manageable route.

182
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,331
Any other questions from the board?

183
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:07,434
So in total, there's two dumpsters, one for the trash and one for recycle.

184
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,375
Is that correct?

185
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:09,336
That is correct.

186
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,210
Any other questions from the board?

187
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:31,366
All right, chair awaits a motion to open for public comment.

188
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:35,289
So moved.

189
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,433
Do I have a second?

190
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:41,534
Second.

191
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:43,356
Thank you.

192
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,518
All right, we are open for public comment.

193
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,042
If anybody from the public is on the meeting, if you would raise your hand.

194
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,965
You can also email Dennis at

195
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,577
Dennis, if you could put your email address in the chat.

196
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,984
I'll just give it a minute to see if we have anybody that wants to speak.

197
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,279
Okay dentistry have any emails.

198
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,023
We did not receive anything.

199
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:45,491
Thank you for your email or or in office correspondence.

200
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:48,494
Jerry it's a motion to close public comment.

201
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:51,316
Motion.

202
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,920
Thank you.

203
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:04,045
For the board, we do have a letter that was received from the Community Development Board.

204
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:07,366
It was late this afternoon.

205
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:13,909
I just want to read in a portion of that related to the meeting that was presented at March 20th, 2024.

206
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:27,254
Board members present at the meeting, Chair Jackie McPherson, Vice-Chair Emily Hedman, Ari Fishman, Rita Calves, Sally Akiki, Pam Mariansky, and Sharad Bajracharya were absent.

207
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,720
The applicant presented the revised plans.

208
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:38,363
The CDB were appreciative of the design changes and did have concerns regarding the glass curtain wall, which was presented and will be part of the living area of one of the residential units.

209
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:53,868
We do privacy, potential light glare, practicality of furniture placement, additional feedback related to the high visibility of the podium parking on the Park Street elevation, and request the applicant to explore screening the parking and better visually anchor the building, which has a top-heavy feel.

210
00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:05,775
The city board directed planning staff to convey to the ZBA that any rare mining design concerns that need to be addressed would not impact the footprint of the building or requested dimensional relief.

211
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,601
So for the board discussion on this project.

212
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:30,342
I, I'd like to say I like the improvements very much.

213
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,487
I think it makes it look much better.

214
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:43,173
Thank you, Jim.

215
00:21:47,253 --> 00:22:01,144
Okay, so specific for this project, 290 Salem Street, we are looking at insufficient front and side yard setbacks, lot coverage, lot area, and the number of units per square foot.

216
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,868
We'll vote on each of those individually.

217
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:09,291
I just wanna check and see if anybody has any questions before we move forward.

218
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:20,534
Okay, for these, this is a variant.

219
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:38,104
So again, taking into consideration the circumstances relating to soil condition, shape or topography of the land or structures, literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise impact to the petitioner.

220
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:50,044
Also taking into consideration that the relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intended purpose of the bylaw.

221
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:56,648
With regards to front and yard, side yard setbacks, I'd like to do a roll call vote.

222
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:58,289
Jim Torani?

223
00:22:59,409 --> 00:22:59,529
Aye.

224
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,470
Yvette Velez?

225
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:03,451
Aye.

226
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:05,432
Mary Lee?

227
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:06,553
Aye.

228
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:08,234
Christy Evanna?

229
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,696
Mister chair, I'm not sure if I can vote.

230
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:15,599
Actually, uh, this is a continuing ship.

231
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,040
You're correct for the continuance.

232
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,460
You cannot.

233
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,020
Thank you.

234
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,722
And Jamie Thompson.

235
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:24,926
I have four eyes, uh, side and front and side.

236
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:28,869
You had setbacks are approved with regards to the lot coverage.

237
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:31,671
Uh, Jim Torani.

238
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:32,872
Hi.

239
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,534
Hi, Mary Lee.

240
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:35,855
Hi.

241
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:40,749
And Jamie Thompson, aye.

242
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:44,090
Four votes affirmative.

243
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,512
With regards to the lot area and number of units per square foot.

244
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:49,673
Jim Tarani.

245
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:50,474
Aye.

246
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,115
Yvette Velez.

247
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:53,796
Aye.

248
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:55,156
Mary Lee.

249
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:56,277
Aye.

250
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,578
And Jamie Thompson, aye.

251
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:03,681
So we have approval of all the variances for 290 Salem Street.

252
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,882
Thank you very much for your presentation.

253
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:08,831
Thank you all.

254
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:13,333
You're welcome.

255
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:15,234
Dennis if you could read the next project.

256
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,777
1.21 3rd Street case number 8 as 2023 dash 21.

257
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,237
Can you from every 20.

258
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,000
Applicant and owner Sandra and Bartolomeo Dorenzo a petition for a variance in chapter 94 see what we're going to start or put fence.

259
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:38,618
at 121th Street on the front line of a corner, which is not allowed for the City of Memphis zoning ordinance, chapter 94, section 6.3.10, corner visibility.

260
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,460
Thank you, Dennis.

261
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,301
Do we have a representative from the applicant?

262
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,363
I see Mr. Donovan.

263
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:54,686
We can't hear you.

264
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:55,326
You're on mute.

265
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,440
I'm Mister Donovan, and this is the contract of Steve.

266
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:07,982
Thank you for that.

267
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:12,365
Go ahead, Steve.

268
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:18,988
Can you pull up the Google thing that you pulled up last time, the GSA maps, so we can get a picture of what we're looking at?

269
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,771
Sorry, I was doing two things at once.

270
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:24,652
What was the other thing?

271
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:30,113
You'll be able to pull up what you pulled up last time for me with like what the existing kind of looks like.

272
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,493
The drawing?

273
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:30,874
Yeah.

274
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:31,634
Yeah, hold on.

275
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:32,554
Yeah, just so they can.

276
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:32,814
30 seconds.

277
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:33,275
There you go.

278
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:22,412
Can everyone see that?

279
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:23,713
Yeah.

280
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,153
Okay.

281
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:27,355
I think if you just switch to street view down at the bottom, there you go.

282
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:30,356
Yep.

283
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:32,797
Yep.

284
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:33,718
Thank you.

285
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,721
So yeah, we're just trying to construct, continue the fence.

286
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:42,764
It was stopped because of the corner visibility ordinance.

287
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:52,551
Last meeting, William Forte, previous building commissioner, had some issues with it.

288
00:26:53,152 --> 00:27:00,237
And I was supposed to go back with him, but he was no longer there.

289
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:04,080
So I spoke to Scott, and he had checked it out, Scott Vander,

290
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:05,271
Wally.

291
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,655
And I don't see that he has any issues with that as well.

292
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:17,098
So we'd like to construct it the way it is, continue it down Marshall Street.

293
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,761
It's pretty much, I don't know what it is.

294
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:26,503
I don't know if there's any questions.

295
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,727
I have a question through the chair.

296
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:33,928
OK.

297
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:41,815
I thought that, did you get to work with anyone from the city?

298
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:52,540
As of like the first time when I was trying to work with the city, when I had stopped in, he had told me, you know, stop in.

299
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,402
And he, you know, William told me that just to go to the meeting.

300
00:27:57,562 --> 00:28:03,104
And then obviously last meeting he had an issue, but I did not have tried to reach out, never got anything.

301
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:04,185
I spoke to Scott.

302
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:13,980
Um, he's, um, the new commissioner, he stopped over and he really did not have an issue with, I mean, he's here, he's on the main as well with the visibility of it as well.

303
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,604
So I thought Bill was going to give you some ideas.

304
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,627
He had some ideas for this project.

305
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,570
Um, yeah, I didn't get any ideas from him.

306
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,991
I, he did not respond to me.

307
00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:33,015
So we, uh, through the chair, could we hear from Scott to get his opinion?

308
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,643
Building Commissioner, are you on, are you available?

309
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:43,525
I guess so, there it is.

310
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,526
I did look at the site.

311
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,708
I did speak to the contractor.

312
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:55,514
We acknowledged that it, you know, to make it fully compliant, it'd be basically at the front door due to all the restrictions.

313
00:28:55,554 --> 00:29:02,940
What I did suggest was that he try to make some accommodations to comply with the law and find some balancing point.

314
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,886
I don't see a strong balancing point here, but they make some proposals and suggest it to the board.

315
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:16,232
But when I was out there, all the parking spaces were clogged with vehicles.

316
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:20,136
I couldn't even see the fence, quite frankly, behind some of the vehicles that were sitting there.

317
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:22,759
I would like to see a little bit of accommodation.

318
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:42,395
which was my suggestion to him, try to find a balancing point between what bylaws ordinance requires and what the needs and expectations of, which in my mind would be, at least bring it back a couple of feet, maybe four feet, and maybe blunt off the edge, the corner a little bit.

319
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:50,379
Some combination in there, but I wasn't gonna make a strong suggestion, just I would not oppose some reasonable effort to pull it back a little bit.

320
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:04,123
Couldn't he just cut it off at the end and angle it versus like pulling it completely back?

321
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,144
Well, he could do a lot of things.

322
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:13,525
I mean, the technical language of the ordinance says you have to be so many feet back from the corner.

323
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,925
It's like 20 plus feet.

324
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:18,906
So that's not entirely feasible.

325
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:20,306
That would put it on his front door.

326
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:23,067
So the idea was to find some sort of accommodation between

327
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:28,482
what he's asked for right here and what the literal interpretation of the ordinance is.

328
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:40,924
Yeah, the whole idea is to simply give some view around the corner, but I wouldn't, I'd poke my head out a lot farther than the edge of that fence before I would pull out into that street just because of all the traffic that's around there.

329
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:48,346
So, and certainly many other houses on the streets, you can see across the street, they've got bushes that totally obscure the opposite direction, so.

330
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:54,019
I think there's a happy medium point for everybody somewhere and it may be blunting it off or pulling back a little bit.

331
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:04,249
You okay with that?

332
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:05,771
We needed to do that.

333
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:10,616
So from a

334
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:20,054
direction perspective, are we looking at some, I guess, if I could ask the building commissioner, we're looking at something along that.

335
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:34,507
So at that corner, there is a post, then we have the first post back, the second post back, when you refer to blunting it, are you referring to bringing the fence to that second post and then continuing over to Marshall at an angle?

336
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:37,129
Yeah, something like that would be something like that.

337
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:42,069
Yeah, if you take it to the first post, you're going to hit that tree right in the corner.

338
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:47,835
I would suggest maybe that second post or somewhere in between and just 45 degree in that corner.

339
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:49,697
So you get a reasonable view.

340
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:55,163
The fact is, you're still going to pull out much farther than that before you dare stick your nose out.

341
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:59,868
Just because of all the cars that are parked there on a regular basis.

342
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:14,052
I had asked the contractor if he could, is okay with wanting it back on the corner 45 in it.

343
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:26,142
I don't mind if we had to, um, you know, I initially, that's what I kind of, before we even brought it originally was asking, um, William about was, should I just bring it back to section and angle it?

344
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:29,916
So that's, that's kind of what I spoke to him about originally.

345
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:32,797
And then he told me to bring it this way originally.

346
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:34,597
So, um, that's kind of where I was.

347
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:43,880
I figured a section or so just are maybe six feet or so, whatever, whatever makes it work, where like I can use it, you did a foot section, you know what I mean?

348
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,880
Like cleanly.

349
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:51,222
So when I did double pulse that section, basically the diagonal, I think that curves it enough.

350
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:53,523
I mean, it gives it, you know,

351
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:57,594
Yeah, I might, I'd also suggest that I would not oppose that.

352
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:04,676
Okay.

353
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:12,397
Um, so I guess, uh, from the applicant's perspective, is there anything, any other guide that you want to provide us as we move forward in the discussion?

354
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:22,480
To me, folks, I, um, I was brought on, um, and as you can see,

355
00:33:23,996 --> 00:33:26,518
That's at the beginning of the walk on Marshall Street.

356
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:33,282
Like the commissioner said, you have to pull out before you can get to Winthrop Street, which is the main drag.

357
00:33:34,302 --> 00:33:41,026
And unlike when this picture was taken, on most days, that's parking on both sides of the road.

358
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:48,490
I've pulled out of this intersection about a thousand times since I've been in the family, and I haven't been closed once.

359
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:51,293
I am an ex-law enforcement in Woburn.

360
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,595
I have reconstructed accidents.

361
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:59,858
I do know offense has never been blamed for an accident, it's usually failure to yield.

362
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,420
And that's a driver's issue, not the property owner's issue.

363
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:12,004
And I just think they are open to cutting it back, like the commissioner said.

364
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:15,786
Okay.

365
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,027
Any questions from the board?

366
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:29,180
Well, I guess I don't have a question, but I do see what is being explained.

367
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:42,823
You could see that that road comes out a lot further than that fence, and that one wouldn't be stopping at that fence in order to see what's out here on the main drive.

368
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:55,206
And I guess if there were cars parked there, you would still have to pull out further before whether the fence was there or not to see it.

369
00:34:55,226 --> 00:35:08,197
But there's going to be, you're going to have some space between the, I guess you have, if we could go back and look at the fence that you have up just to see an example of the fence.

370
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:12,200
That's a space, it's called spaced.

371
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:16,384
But I mean, there are spaces there where you can still see through.

372
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,498
Will that be carried all the way down?

373
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,979
Yes, we'll continue this section.

374
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,100
That's, yeah, it's already done to the right.

375
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,400
We'll continue the same way.

376
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,340
Right.

377
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,340
It's going to be throughout the whole fence.

378
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:31,341
Right.

379
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:39,702
I do want to comment the day that I did tour it with another inspector, there was a large red pickup truck parked as tight as they could get to the crosswalk.

380
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:42,963
So you really couldn't see the fence until you sort of pulled out and saw it behind you.

381
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:47,798
So based on that, I said, hey, we can cut it off a little bit, give a little bit more view.

382
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:54,543
The fact that the fence runs all the way along is a little bit mooted by the fact you can't even see the fence itself.

383
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,825
OK, thank you.

384
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:04,950
Daniel Evans, City Planner.

385
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,219
Hi, good evening, Daniel Evans, senior planner.

386
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,721
There shouldn't be cars parking right up against the sidewalk.

387
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:18,584
That's state law that there should be space there.

388
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:33,732
It's not an actual parking space, so perhaps we should direct traffic and parking to that area as a non-parking space, or a condition of any approval would be to do that.

389
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:38,905
Daniella, you're talking about the crosswalk itself?

390
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:41,087
Yeah, you're not supposed to.

391
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,530
You can't park right up against the crosswalk.

392
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,951
It's not an actual parking space.

393
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,113
Yeah, no, I understand that.

394
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:50,877
I think what the commissioner was saying, they were parked in the crosswalk.

395
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:53,199
You can't park up against it.

396
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:55,381
There has to be some visibility.

397
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:57,282
I agree.

398
00:36:57,623 --> 00:36:57,763
Yeah.

399
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:09,774
Around the city, there's been striping and putting flex posts to prevent people from parking in those spaces.

400
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:12,697
It's starting to be enforced.

401
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,828
Thank you.

402
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:27,630
Any other questions from the board?

403
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:47,533
Planner Evans, would you, not in relation to the project, but outside of the project that we should reach out to DPW for that?

404
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:48,234
Good to share.

405
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:55,538
I would say the Director of Traffic and Transportation, Todd Blake, is

406
00:37:57,334 --> 00:38:03,718
leading where the striping is happening, but yet within DPW engineering.

407
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:05,799
Thank you.

408
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,320
I can take that action.

409
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,662
All right.

410
00:38:10,742 --> 00:38:11,983
Any other questions from the board?

411
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:18,627
Okay.

412
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:22,390
Seeing none, board awaits a motion to open for public comment.

413
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:26,072
Motion.

414
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:27,872
Second.

415
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:28,793
Second.

416
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:30,954
Thank you.

417
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:38,680
We are now open for public comment with regards to 120 Winthrop Street, construction of a four-foot fence along that property.

418
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:49,107
If anybody from the public would like to speak, please raise your hand or email Dennis McDougall, dmcdougall, at medford-ma.gov.

419
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:55,552
Just give that a minute.

420
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:16,756
Okay, uh, no hands raised.

421
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:18,777
Dennis, do you have anything in email?

422
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,760
No, I do not.

423
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:28,043
Uh, chair awaits a motion to close the public comment.

424
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,185
Motion to close the public comment.

425
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,149
Thank you.

426
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:38,910
I apologize.

427
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,771
I'm supposed to be taking a roll call for that.

428
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:42,632
Uh, Jim Tron.

429
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,360
Aye.

430
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:46,201
Yvette Gilles.

431
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:47,882
Aye.

432
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:49,483
Mary Lee.

433
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:50,464
Aye.

434
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,204
And Kristi Yvette.

435
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,686
Aye.

436
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:58,608
We are now in deliberations for the board.

437
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:11,415
It sounds to me as though we're going to discuss the fence as we've seen it with a cutoff from the second post from the corner to then continuing down Marshall Street.

438
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:16,988
I'm sorry, Jamie.

439
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,109
Can you please repeat that?

440
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:18,830
I couldn't hear you.

441
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,231
I'm sorry.

442
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:43,606
So the proposal at the moment is for the fence to, from the second post in, I'm sorry, third post in from the corner, to make, have that cut from that post to Marshall Street and then to continue down the side of the house, side of the sidewalk.

443
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,719
So that's meeting it halfway, right?

444
00:40:52,819 --> 00:41:03,586
That's the, from what is allowed to like what is, so the condition would be that from that, from what you described, that's what would be added.

445
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:05,147
Correct.

446
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:07,728
Okay.

447
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:10,190
I think that to me sounds reasonable.

448
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,653
And, you know, I think it's,

449
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:21,574
nice when neighbors want to add fences to their properties and to some extent they should be able to.

450
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:28,317
And so I think, you know, and unfortunately they have a corner unit and they have to comply with what's required.

451
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:37,040
And so I think that's a good halfway point for both the community and the property owner.

452
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:42,383
So what post are we saying?

453
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:54,663
Yeah, so you have the post, we're in deliberation right now, but it will be, you have that first post at the corner, the second post, and then the third post.

454
00:41:59,206 --> 00:41:59,406
Okay.

455
00:41:59,426 --> 00:42:00,847
Question from building commissioner.

456
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:12,744
I wonder if it might not be easier for everybody to more be defined a distance is not less than six or eight feet from the corner and let him lay out the post in any shape he wants.

457
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:19,168
It's easier for us to verify a footage requirement than posts because that's somewhat unclear.

458
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,470
Thank you, Commissioner.

459
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:27,054
I think that looked like eight feet to me.

460
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:36,946
The contractor confirmed that that was about eight feet?

461
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:40,307
It's about eight feet to the second post.

462
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:44,609
The next post to the right would be eight feet.

463
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:45,129
Yeah.

464
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:53,872
Yeah.

465
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,293
So I guess I have a clarification there.

466
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,154
Is it eight feet between each post?

467
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,675
Or is it four feet between each post?

468
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:02,103
eight feet.

469
00:43:03,424 --> 00:43:15,928
I think I would suggest the intent dissension is to bring back the sensing at least eight feet, no less than eight feet back from the corner in both opposing directions.

470
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:25,031
That would give it eight by eight by whatever the hypotenuse is clear space that we can easily measure from that corner of the concrete right there.

471
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:26,851
Okay.

472
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:28,252
Thank you, Commissioner.

473
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:41,776
Any other questions from the, any other comments from the board?

474
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:46,559
Okay, are we clear on the delineation of the line?

475
00:43:54,882 --> 00:44:00,525
Okay, so, I apologize.

476
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:17,210
And can we have a, can we add then because I thought I, I heard Danielle talk about maybe asking traffic commissioner to review that corner.

477
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,252
Like, is that part of can I ask is that part of this?

478
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:28,617
this conversation or is that completely separate?

479
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:32,438
Like is that part of the, can we add?

480
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:46,241
I'll take the action to talk with Todd Blake with regards to the street corner and potentially lining from that crosswalk so that parking would be better identified on what point the parking is allowable on that lane.

481
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:48,902
Okay.

482
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:03,671
So Jamie, would we be making a motion to bring it back eight feet?

483
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:16,435
So what we will be, so we have a, this is a special permit.

484
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:19,416
Am I correct?

485
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,317
No, I'm sorry, this is a variance.

486
00:45:22,357 --> 00:45:26,419
Again, for the four foot fence and the vote we will be making,

487
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:27,933
Commissioner?

488
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:30,215
I think you need to be clear.

489
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:36,239
The variance is both for the fence up at the sidewalk line, because normally it should be 20 feet back.

490
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,342
The accommodation from sidewalk on sidewalk is to blunt off the corner.

491
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:52,671
So you're going to give them a variance to place it to the back of the sidewalk on the two opposing sides, but to cut off the corner to a distance not less than eight feet back on both directions.

492
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:56,014
So you really give them the whole thing as the variance.

493
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,122
Otherwise he's got to be uptight to house.

494
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:11,209
Because the variance, you're identifying that the fence along the sidewalk is also requiring a variance.

495
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:17,901
Yeah, the ordinance requires that all fence you be 20 ft back from the sidewalk on both sides because he's in the corner lot.

496
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:27,984
So you're giving them a variance along, but most of it up by the sidewalk and then as an accommodation from going to the corner, we're going to sort of cut off that corner to a distance, not less than eight ft back.

497
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:31,605
That is sort of the whole meat of of the true variance.

498
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,888
Uh, director, have you had your hand raised?

499
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:50,318
I think that if not now for the decision, we're going to actually need to know.

500
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:57,785
So I noticed that the, I went to see what the ordinance actually said with regards to this so that we would be clear.

501
00:46:58,406 --> 00:47:04,511
And in the ad for this, it cites a corner visibility section 6310.

502
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:19,559
which doesn't have any measurements at all, and it's completely subjective, which is perhaps why you're running into this issue, that one building commissioner thought one thing and another thinks another, because it is completely subjective what's in the zoning.

503
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,801
So I have put a pin in that to fix for the future.

504
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:31,285
However, if the current commissioner feels that we need a variance for setbacks or where the fence is located,

505
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:41,532
We will need at least to write the decision, if not now, to know where in the ordinance it says that so that it can be cited correctly.

506
00:47:41,552 --> 00:47:44,434
I think part of it comes from the definitions as well.

507
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:45,354
OK.

508
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,035
And I'm not arguing at all.

509
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:56,920
Our zoning is complicated, and I was trying to find the right thing to also ensure you're giving the right variances and permits.

510
00:47:58,021 --> 00:48:01,423
So yeah.

511
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:03,957
Okay, so that is one.

512
00:48:04,337 --> 00:48:10,940
So the original in the ad was 6310, which basically says visibility requirements.

513
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:23,547
And that no planting or anything or wall or whatever can be constructed that obstructs the vision at any point within the corner visibility space.

514
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,750
But there is no definition of corner visibility space that I have been able to find.

515
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:31,016
There is further clarification.

516
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:43,449
There is a little bit further definition that talks about a space from two and a half feet above ground to seven feet above ground shall not be impacted from a distance of a corner where the two curbs meet to the outside.

517
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:47,154
So when you mix the two of those together, that's sort of what we're looking for a variance from.

518
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,296
Okay.

519
00:48:52,972 --> 00:49:05,799
And the variance could just say to allow the applicant to variance from any setbacks required or visibility requirements, such as to place the fence on both sides behind the sidewalk and then blocked off the corner distance not less than eight feet from the corner.

520
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,463
Dennis may need to play back the recording to get that.

521
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:16,825
But that's the language that should be used.

522
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:33,091
And I just, from my, I took notes down that I know in the case filing we listed this as a variance, but in my notes, for some reason I wrote it down as a special permit.

523
00:49:36,817 --> 00:49:40,738
Because of the visibility.

524
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:48,740
6 310 visibility 6 311 says special permit this SPGA you may buy special permit.

525
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:55,062
Reduce or waive the provision of this section if warranted considering among other things.

526
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:59,083
Okay, so I think that's I think what you were looking at.

527
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:04,905
But a variance may be a variance was what they were seeking and may be sufficient.

528
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:06,205
Okay.

529
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:28,157
All right, so for the board, we're looking at a variance with the language that the commissioner just recently spoke with regards to the fence being along the sidewalk and blunted eight feet from the corner.

530
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:30,638
We'll get specific language for that decision from the recording.

531
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:56,535
And again, owing to circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, topography of the land or structure, whereas little enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance of Bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance of a Bylaw.

532
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,871
We'll take that vote.

533
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:03,812
Jim Torani?

534
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:04,912
So moved.

535
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:05,452
Aye.

536
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:09,014
Yvette Velez?

537
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:11,755
Aye.

538
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:13,876
Oh, I apologize.

539
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:15,216
You're correct.

540
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:16,617
I'm rushing.

541
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:17,457
Do we have a motion?

542
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:19,718
So moved.

543
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:21,219
Thank you.

544
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,880
And do we have a second?

545
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:26,881
Second.

546
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:28,222
Thank you.

547
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:29,862
And roll call vote.

548
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:30,683
Jim Torani?

549
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:31,343
Aye.

550
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,058
And that was.

551
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,841
Mary Lee.

552
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:46,932
And Jerry Thompson I. Thank you very much for your patience you have a fence.

553
00:51:46,972 --> 00:51:48,213
Thank you folks appreciate it.

554
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:53,098
Thank you just as a heads up so I'll be writing the decision.

555
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:05,088
Turnovers, it's variable, but I'm actually, I'm not gonna be around, I'm going away for like a few days, so I won't be able to even start it until next week.

556
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:16,056
So just as a heads up, I'll get it, once it's approved and filed, then I'll send it to you, and then from there, it's 20 days appeals period after that, and then you can get your permit.

557
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:19,219
So it's a little bit of a, it's not like you're approved, you can start right away.

558
00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:21,080
So just letting you know.

559
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:31,378
Thank you folks.

560
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:36,141
Dennis, could you read the next case?

561
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,963
38 Harvard Avenue, case number 8-2024-03.

562
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:41,946
Applicant and owner, 38 Harvard A.V.

563
00:52:41,986 --> 00:52:45,188
Nominee Trust is petitioning for variance in Chapter 94, City Method Zoning.

564
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:54,540
So class to use motor vehicles at 38 Harvard Avenue, which is not allowed in the commercial one zoning district for the city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter, 94 table, a table of use and parking regulations.

565
00:52:58,464 --> 00:52:58,784
Thank you.

566
00:52:58,804 --> 00:52:59,905
Do we ever represent.

567
00:53:00,848 --> 00:53:02,769
Good evening, Acting Chairman Thompson.

568
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:05,410
Kathleen Desmond here for the petitioner.

569
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:13,855
I'm here this evening with Orbelin Abazi, manager and principal of Obie's Auto Service Collision, located at 38 Harvard Avenue.

570
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:18,978
His wife and manager is also here, Barbara Bochich, they're both on the call.

571
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:29,163
Petition before you is a request for an extension and or change of a pre-existing non-conforming use in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Zoning Ordinance.

572
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:38,354
alternatively I did also petition for use variance but that would not be necessary if section 5.2 applies.

573
00:53:39,335 --> 00:53:49,920
I did also send to the board Titcom versus the Board of Sandwich, Zoning Board of Sandwich for purposes of just outlining what the board's authority is and the fact that

574
00:53:50,891 --> 00:54:04,176
They are authorized to make a change in use because our ordinance allows for it under 5.2 and specifically indicates that a use variance is not required if a finding is made.

575
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:14,120
The property itself is situated in a C1 zoning district where the sale of new vehicles is permitted by special permit by the CD board.

576
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,102
The sale of used vehicles is not permitted.

577
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:19,483
And this is looking for a class two

578
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:22,306
auto sales license use.

579
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:33,061
The petitioner, just to make a note, will also need to obtain the license from city council, but that's the use has to first be established as as permitted.

580
00:54:34,884 --> 00:54:45,374
The property itself is 31,101 square feet on which an 8,380 square foot single story building that houses a repair and auto body shop is situated.

581
00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:49,097
The property conforms to the dimensional requirements of the ordinance.

582
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:54,842
I provided the board with my initial materials with a memorandum dated February 9th, 2022.

583
00:54:57,471 --> 00:55:04,763
from then building commissioner Paul Mokey which confirms the status of the property as a pre-existing non-conforming use.

584
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:20,413
I also provided some historical context by providing a lease that was provided to North Ford Inc., which showed that in the 60s, this was actually a dealership which had a repair and also had vehicles that were sold.

585
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:25,195
The petitioner's proposal is very minimal.

586
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:29,897
He proposes to provide a limited number of used cars for sale on site.

587
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:33,099
The vehicles will be located in the rear yard

588
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:37,399
Let me see, Dennis, can I share my screen and hope that this goes well?

589
00:55:48,505 --> 00:55:48,825
Okay.

590
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,406
Sorry, I'm waiting.

591
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:52,267
Okay.

592
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,067
Can you see that?

593
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:53,768
No?

594
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:57,690
Share screen.

595
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:01,112
Okay.

596
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:03,353
So this is the presentation slides that I'll show you.

597
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:13,575
So this is the actual, let me see if I can, yeah, it's always caught in behind here.

598
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:16,514
the survey which was provided.

599
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:20,137
This is the front of the building, which is on Harvard Ave.

600
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:25,602
There is parking located at the front, but it's not the owner's intention.

601
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:30,526
He's fine with the restriction that the for sale cars are not located in the front of the building.

602
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:40,755
To the side on Bower Street, as you enter, these are the nine spaces that were proposed to be provided for the used vehicles.

603
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:44,939
Again, we're not tied to a location in the back.

604
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:54,290
He anticipates actually that there's probably going to be generally six vehicles for sale at any given time, but the plan provided indicates nine.

605
00:56:57,403 --> 00:57:04,965
In terms of signage, there's no intent to have signage with regard to the sale of the vehicles.

606
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:11,286
This is essentially, he runs a business that's an auto collision repair shop.

607
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:16,808
So he frequently has customers, which unfortunately their cars have been totaled.

608
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:21,809
And in terms of the insurance settlement, they're kind of at a loss as to what to do.

609
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:26,712
So this would provide his existing customers with reasonably priced cars.

610
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:30,414
The price point on these cars is between

611
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:40,942
you know, $8,000 and $12,000 so that it's more reasonably priced for, you know, I think we've all been through this with our kids.

612
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:46,825
If you have kids that you're looking for a vehicle that is safe and reliable, but isn't, you know, $20,000.

613
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:57,732
So this is, you know, from a community standpoint, this fills a need for his customers and also people in the community that are looking for less expensive

614
00:57:58,452 --> 00:57:59,974
used vehicles that are reliable.

615
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:08,481
He has a repair shop, which is required under Chapter 40, Section 58 of the general laws.

616
00:58:08,641 --> 00:58:19,231
If you have a Class 2 license, you have to have, and I provided the statute to the board, you have to have place or an availability of a repair shop, which he obviously has.

617
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:25,655
He intends to advertise only by internet and to customers.

618
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:30,438
So in terms of the disruption to the neighborhood, it would be minimal.

619
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:35,642
This isn't a situation where you're going to have lights or you're going to have signage.

620
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:42,706
In addition, the repair shop at this point is open from eight to five Monday through Friday.

621
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:47,870
Those hours aren't going to change and there's not going to be any increase in hours based on

622
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:52,403
based on the vehicles that he intends to sell.

623
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:55,926
And just take a look.

624
00:58:56,306 --> 00:59:02,651
There was one other item that I wanted to raise, but I don't, it escapes me at this point.

625
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:10,297
But in terms of the overall package, it's not an extensive change or extension of use.

626
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:14,400
You know, this is only so that he can service his customers.

627
00:59:15,321 --> 00:59:16,642
And certainly there were, I think,

628
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:21,305
four or five letters of support that were provided to the board.

629
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:26,829
And it allows customers to buy a vehicle from a mechanic that they trust.

630
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:38,698
I mean, when anyone buys a used vehicle, you know, the first thing you're told to do is before you buy it, to take it to your mechanic, which, you know, in the process of things kind of gets left out often.

631
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,062
But in this instance, which is another benefit to the community, they're buying it from

632
00:59:43,662 --> 00:59:48,768
I would like to make sure that we have the trust of the mechanic who has purchased the vehicle and gone through it already.

633
00:59:59,648 --> 01:00:01,009
his letters of support.

634
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:08,553
If you look on Google and Google his business, he's probably the only mechanic I've ever seen who has five stars with more than 10 reviews.

635
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:15,276
So there's about 40 reviews when you look at Google and it all comes out to five stars and they all say he's wonderful.

636
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:18,778
So this is just trying to add to his business.

637
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:36,119
to support his customer base, and also, you know, it provides to the community a vehicle that's less expensive, that, you know, is available for kids, for elderly people who are just looking for something to get them around.

638
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,283
So I think 5.2 governs that.

639
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:46,188
If you want me to go through the variance standard, I can certainly do that.

640
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:51,893
But I think under 5.2, it would be an expansion of non-conforming years.

641
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:59,020
Commissioner.

642
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:08,729
I would be of the opinion you cannot entertain this as an extension of a use under 5.2 because it's clearly advertising the agenda as a variance.

643
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:11,431
You can't do both.

644
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:14,252
You got to do what the agenda says you have to do.

645
01:01:17,754 --> 01:01:20,916
The variant finding was included in the application.

646
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:22,796
I don't know if

647
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:29,356
Well, the application says you're appealing to the decision of the building inspector, but it's advertised as a variance.

648
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:33,379
There's no reference, neither one of those to 5.2 looking for a special permit.

649
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:37,722
So I would hate to have this turned back because it was heard incorrectly.

650
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:42,125
The ultimate to go with what's advertised in the agenda.

651
01:01:44,583 --> 01:02:08,859
if that if that's the case if that's the board's decision because the worksheet included the the reference under under 5.2 for what I was looking for for relief that was supplied if that's the case I know in instances I've always led alternate alternate forms of relief and that hasn't been an issue but if you find it to be an issue and if the board finds it to be an issue

652
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,554
because I think this is more of a finding case than a variance case.

653
01:02:14,274 --> 01:02:20,398
And I'd ask that we continue it and re-advertise as a finding.

654
01:02:20,418 --> 01:02:31,525
Commissioner, do you still have additional or?

655
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,962
Well, I've got to look at the application.

656
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:36,246
They checked off application for a special permit.

657
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,150
They checked off petition for variance.

658
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:42,618
And then he stated this is an appeal from the order of decision of the building commission, which is another section.

659
01:02:43,354 --> 01:02:43,954
within Chapter 48.

660
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,756
So I'm kind of confused as to what they're actually asking for.

661
01:02:47,136 --> 01:02:49,917
Ultimately, I go for the agenda, which is the published issue.

662
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,399
Agenda is very clear to the variance.

663
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:59,963
So you really can't entertain another form of release outside of the agenda without re-advertising this under the correct setup.

664
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:10,128
So I think there's enough confusion here to put this into play for a conversation, perhaps consult with KB Law on this, or ask them to correct the language for the next hearing.

665
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:22,005
If that's the board's decision on that, I don't have an issue with that.

666
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:35,812
In terms of what was cited, in terms of the violation at the bottom, that was a violation that was cited on the building permanent refusal, I believe itself, which is what I was asking for the variance from the table A use.

667
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:47,310
I do have a refusal to take away.

668
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,571
But I do, it is documented as a variance.

669
01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:58,754
In addition, so I guess, I do have one question, Attorney Desmond.

670
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:02,656
You mentioned that you need to go before the City Council for a license as well?

671
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:04,377
Correct.

672
01:04:04,597 --> 01:04:09,439
So if the use were approved, and I think Mr.

673
01:04:10,857 --> 01:04:12,017
I'm sorry, I call him OB.

674
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:20,401
So that kind of struggling here, but I, he originally went before the city council on this for a class two license for the property.

675
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:24,182
Um, and the licenses to the, the individual.

676
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:36,667
So he was told that he would have to go to the zoning board of appeals first or to whoever who could grant the use of the property for the sale of, of class two, um, vehicles.

677
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:39,228
Um, and then if that's granted,

678
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:49,423
then he's able to go and ask for a license from the city council for him to sell the class two vehicles.

679
01:04:51,325 --> 01:05:01,994
Is one of the difficulties I know that the record you provided from the other case, but that board was the special permit provider.

680
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:04,697
We are not the special permit provider for car sales.

681
01:05:06,662 --> 01:05:12,004
Although this is an additional use, we are not that permitting board for it as a primary use.

682
01:05:13,484 --> 01:05:15,265
Right, so.

683
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:18,346
So, this is a pre existing non conforming.

684
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:22,647
Use and under the ordinance under 5.2.

685
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:26,968
Any extension or change in that use the zoning board of appeals.

686
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:31,550
Is the is the special permit graining authority.

687
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,671
In terms of the use in.

688
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:38,365
as a primary use where it's allowed as a use.

689
01:05:39,705 --> 01:05:44,667
The CD board is the granting authority and that would be in the C2 district.

690
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:55,410
So you're allowed to issue special permits as to pre-existing non-conforming uses which are changing or being extended.

691
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:01,752
But if under the table of uses, which under the table of uses in this district,

692
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:17,346
is no for class two licenses, then that is before the ZBA based on a non-conforming change to pre-existing non-conforming use.

693
01:06:18,706 --> 01:06:27,228
It used to be a substitution of use under the... Building Commission,

694
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:28,797
Do you have additional?

695
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:32,899
Yeah, with all the confusion, I would recommend that they withdraw at this time.

696
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:37,501
And we go through with the correct language and get everything lined up accordingly.

697
01:06:37,881 --> 01:06:38,941
So that it's clear.

698
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:51,166
I'd hate to have you guys make a decision when we're not sure what you're making a decision on here, and what the order of it should be and who should be doing what we could use the time to do a little bit of research.

699
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:54,788
I can certainly bring it back when they we've got it all sorted out.

700
01:06:59,457 --> 01:07:03,240
I'm willing to withdraw at this point if necessary.

701
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:15,589
I think in terms of this application, I think it's really just the advertising piece of it because the application asked for alternative relief as between a variance or a finding.

702
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:21,774
If the board determined that a finding wasn't appropriate, then I had also requested relief per variance.

703
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,657
So that if for some reason it was not

704
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:30,963
within the purview of a finding that the board could then consider a variance.

705
01:07:30,983 --> 01:07:34,985
Director Hunt.

706
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:40,947
I was just gonna suggest, is there a reason why it would need to be a withdrawal and not a continuance?

707
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:57,072
I just don't wanna drag things out extra long so that you can, we may need to re-notice it, but I just am a little nervous that if it gets withdrawn that things seem to take a very long time when they're new applications.

708
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,478
I'm suggesting withdrawal with a chance to do that.

709
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:13,781
If we simply continue it, then we have to be worried of the time frames and constructive approval.

710
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:16,142
So they would have to sign a waiver of the time frames.

711
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:18,983
And then we can come back.

712
01:08:19,243 --> 01:08:22,145
If continuance, you can't change the language.

713
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:27,507
Withdrawal and reapply, we can change and alter the language of the application and the agenda.

714
01:08:27,547 --> 01:08:30,489
You're just continuing an agenda that's already missed

715
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:37,126
leading in a sense, which all allows us to reapply under the correct language and redo the agenda correctly.

716
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:45,289
In terms of the application itself, um, what exactly is the issue that you see?

717
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:53,251
Um, I believe I it's advertised as a variance, the advertisement, but not not the application itself.

718
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,211
I think we need to figure that out.

719
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:57,892
If you're going to continue

720
01:08:58,924 --> 01:09:01,665
You can't correct the agenda because you've already advertised it.

721
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:03,666
The case is opened as a variance.

722
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:07,007
Continues to say, we're going to come back and look at it as a variance.

723
01:09:07,427 --> 01:09:15,070
Withdrawal allows us to re-advertise it correctly as a special permit here.

724
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:20,132
So you're either going to continue something that's incorrect, or you're going to withdraw and correct it and then re-advertise it.

725
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:27,975
I mean, we would only be adding the finding as an additional relief under the advertisement.

726
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:35,821
The advertising has been set to the voters within 300 feet and everybody else.

727
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:42,004
So in a sense, they would be misled if it was to include new language for a different form of relief.

728
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,568
I think council would suggest that you withdraw.

729
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:57,112
City council would suggest that you withdraw, correct all your mistakes, and then re-advertise and re-notify.

730
01:10:14,574 --> 01:10:16,835
It's kind of an interim solution to that.

731
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:42,343
If we were to continue and if KP law were to indicate that we needed to withdraw for purposes of refiling to include the special permit, then I could submit to the board a withdrawal just so that it's still on the agenda if KP determines that you can re-advertise where the application call for both a variance and a special permit.

732
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:50,854
And if they don't, if they believe that we need to withdraw, then I can certainly do that.

733
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:58,097
I mean, the application is documented as a variance.

734
01:10:58,137 --> 01:10:59,438
This is a use variance.

735
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:12,445
I think the application has both the special permit, the application itself, if I'm not

736
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:19,993
Yeah application for a finding special permit.

737
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:23,815
They were both.

738
01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:28,118
Forges advertises what is advertised and that's a conflict there.

739
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:38,924
Right I mean that's the title of the form and in item 2 petition seeking to use variance to include will be an accessory used to sell class 2 automobiles on premise that used to not permitted C1.

740
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:41,606
So it is documented as a variance in the application.

741
01:11:42,013 --> 01:11:49,179
Yeah, the agenda has to clearly state all of the relief thoughts that those who are notified have a full understanding of what relief is.

742
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:51,881
If you misdo it, then it's faulted.

743
01:11:57,226 --> 01:12:01,069
So reading the worksheet, it is documented in the worksheet as a variance.

744
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,190
I see it on the application.

745
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,311
You can check both items there.

746
01:12:04,132 --> 01:12:05,613
It's also the binding language.

747
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:11,676
Chairman Thompson also had is included number seven.

748
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:15,200
So the worksheet included alternative relief.

749
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:31,616
Because if the board didn't agree with me that the finding applied, then it also allows me to move forward on the variance application and not have to file a second time under the same set of facts for under a different, same set of facts for the same relief.

750
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:59,791
So, if we were to continue it and get a determination as to KP law, whether the finding language could be added for the next hearing or whether it needed.

751
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:05,914
In fact, to be withdrawn and refiled, then I would submit a withdrawal at that point.

752
01:13:06,254 --> 01:13:07,894
If KP law determines that.

753
01:13:08,595 --> 01:13:14,997
That's what's needed to be done and I just want to.

754
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,171
So I read that the, I just want to go back out.

755
01:13:19,631 --> 01:13:23,151
So that is acceptable to continue in my mind.

756
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:38,774
The one item that I had concern on is the, I know this is a additional use on a non-conforming, but you mentioned a use of the CD board was a permitting authority for car.

757
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,435
So I thought I would say yes on 5.2.

758
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:58,963
The board of appeals may award a special permit to change or extend a non-conforming use in accordance with this section, then only if it determines if such change or extension is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing conforming use.

759
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:00,724
Yep.

760
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:10,026
But the city council is responsible for licensing and also for use for car sales.

761
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:13,778
And you've got to go to them for the license anyways.

762
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:14,699
Okay, I see where we're going.

763
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:15,539
The license, right.

764
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,002
And that runs not with the land, but with the individual.

765
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:21,985
So that's why he would need that licensing.

766
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:26,309
And as I said, he kind of started this in reverse and started with City Council.

767
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,012
And then was told that he would have to go to the Board of Appeals first.

768
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:31,253
Correct.

769
01:14:31,293 --> 01:14:36,698
The City Council issues your Class 1, 2, and 3 licenses under a different ordinance than the zoning ordinance.

770
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:39,120
And they have a whole different set of criteria to follow.

771
01:14:39,983 --> 01:14:41,945
It conforms with state regulations for that stuff.

772
01:14:44,768 --> 01:14:48,011
Okay, so I guess we have two options at the moment.

773
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:51,714
We can move forward tonight as a use variance.

774
01:14:55,418 --> 01:15:01,483
Or if you want to continue to determine if we can do a finding for a special permit under 5.2.

775
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:04,226
I would prefer to continue.

776
01:15:05,825 --> 01:15:13,666
you know, move forward, at least with the finding, if the board determines that a finding isn't proper in this instance, then move to the use variance argument.

777
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:26,329
And I certainly will assign an extension of the time within which to, for a decision to be rendered under Chapter 48, Section 9.

778
01:15:31,889 --> 01:15:34,490
Then do I have a motion to continue

779
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:42,824
38 Harvard Avenue to the next scheduled Zoning Board of Appeals.

780
01:15:42,864 --> 01:15:44,865
Do I need a date and time?

781
01:15:48,325 --> 01:15:49,285
I have a question.

782
01:15:49,305 --> 01:15:57,947
If the application, it seems like there's a discrepancy between the application and the published notice.

783
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,267
Am I correct?

784
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:01,928
I don't know.

785
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:02,788
I think that's what I heard.

786
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:08,335
That's the disturbance we've got right now.

787
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:26,324
Okay, so I think that the notice, it's really critical that it conforms to what really is because that impacts the public as well as the governing body.

788
01:16:26,404 --> 01:16:31,387
So I think even though it could be interpreted as not

789
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:39,485
as important, but I think it's really important that the notice itself conforms to the application.

790
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:46,768
That's just my thought, and also the notice should be consistent with the application.

791
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:58,275
So if we continue this, then the notice will not necessarily comply with the application's requests.

792
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,490
That's correct.

793
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:12,021
And Tony Desmond has indicated that if after discussion with KP law that the finding cannot be ruled on based on the notice that would withdraw and reapply.

794
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,662
Is that correct attorney Desmond?

795
01:17:14,202 --> 01:17:23,907
Yeah, I mean, I think the question and the issue is, is can the notice be amended for the next hearing to reflect that it is also for a variance because you're going to republish?

796
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:28,129
You'd have to republish, but can that be done on a continuance basis?

797
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:29,530
Does it have to be withdrawn?

798
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:36,153
Where the application was correct, but the notice was not fully correct.

799
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:42,376
OK, so you're proposing to amend the notice that was issued for today, correct?

800
01:17:42,476 --> 01:17:43,257
OK, thank you.

801
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:59,608
Okay, so the direction I have at the moment is to move for continuance with discussion with KP Law for an amendment to the notice.

802
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,050
Or is that correct?

803
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:05,731
Attorney Desmond?

804
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:06,531
Yes.

805
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:08,852
Okay.

806
01:18:09,072 --> 01:18:13,053
So the chair awaits a motion to continue 38 Harvard Ave to

807
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,283
Next, Jamie, sorry, it's America.

808
01:18:20,103 --> 01:18:26,109
I, I would say, maybe I missed, I would say that the continues will be condition.

809
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:30,954
Upon the part that the amendment to the notice.

810
01:18:33,316 --> 01:18:36,299
So, so we won't if we can't amend the notice.

811
01:18:37,098 --> 01:18:43,582
That would be actually yeah, so it will be conditioned so that it continues will be conditioned.

812
01:18:44,663 --> 01:18:47,084
Upon the amendment to the notice.

813
01:18:52,368 --> 01:19:00,173
I'd only say to that, and I haven't researched it myself, but, you know, looking at the notice provisions, I'm not so sure that.

814
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:07,164
That the relief specifically has to be there has to be really, but there has to be sufficient facts to understand what it is.

815
01:19:07,204 --> 01:19:07,906
I'm not so sure that.

816
01:19:08,825 --> 01:19:18,629
The special permit isn't kind of a lesser included in that, so I wouldn't want it to be conditioned because KP law may say that that the notice was sufficient and certainly if it needs to be changed.

817
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:23,331
And and I can't change it with a continued hearing, then I'd withdraw.

818
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,053
But I don't the condition of the continuance because you're granting the continuance, so it can't really be conditioned.

819
01:19:31,654 --> 01:19:33,815
You know, I'm going to withdraw in the event that.

820
01:19:34,723 --> 01:19:41,248
that they don't approve the change in the notice and allowing it to move forward on that.

821
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:52,055
But how will we reflect the withdrawal part if we don't place a condition on the notice?

822
01:19:52,816 --> 01:19:56,078
I'd file a withdrawal, which I would have to do.

823
01:19:58,068 --> 01:20:04,014
And if I showed up at the hearing, then we just go forward with what there is if they can't change the notice.

824
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:07,057
And that would be at my own risk, which is not something that I want to do.

825
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:15,506
I think the board should just continue this with the idea of sending it to KP law for guidance and clarification.

826
01:20:15,806 --> 01:20:17,588
Whatever that turns out to be, they'll follow it.

827
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:22,820
And I'll just add this.

828
01:20:23,481 --> 01:20:25,763
I've worked with KP Law and Zillion for over 10 years.

829
01:20:25,783 --> 01:20:28,025
We've had this exact condition happen before.

830
01:20:28,665 --> 01:20:32,889
And their answer was, if there's any misclarification, correct it and re-advertise.

831
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:36,172
It's the safest way to get through the process without having an objection.

832
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:39,795
So I anticipate it'll go somewhere down that line with them again.

833
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,878
I don't disagree.

834
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,263
It's just a question of whether it can be rectified, amended, and then brought forward.

835
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:57,833
OK, does the board have any other questions before I request a motion?

836
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:13,475
All right, chair awaits a motion to continue 38 Harvard Ave to the April 25th, 6.30 PM meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

837
01:21:14,716 --> 01:21:15,156
So moved.

838
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:19,997
Do I have a second?

839
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:21,677
Second.

840
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:26,548
uh, eventful as the world called it a bit less.

841
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:29,310
Hi, Jim Tronny.

842
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,933
Hi, Christina.

843
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:34,375
Hi, Mary Lee.

844
01:21:35,215 --> 01:21:36,997
Hi, Jamie Thompson.

845
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:37,457
Hi.

846
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:39,619
Uh, we are continuing to 38.

847
01:21:39,839 --> 01:21:41,321
Thank you.

848
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,142
Enjoy your Easter.

849
01:21:48,186 --> 01:21:49,988
Uh, Dennis, could you read the next case, please?

850
01:22:00,638 --> 01:22:04,680
Zero Windsor Road, case number A-2024-06.

851
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:23,787
Applicant and owner, Tim Harrington, is petitioning for a variance in Chapter 94, City of Mexico zoning to construct a single-family house on an empty lot at the corner of Windsor Road and Hinsdale Street, and allowed use in a general residence zoning district with insufficient lot area, front yard, setback, and lot width for the City of Mexico zoning order in Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

852
01:22:27,648 --> 01:22:29,069
And we have a representative for the applicant.

853
01:22:30,687 --> 01:22:31,288
Yes, good evening.

854
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:38,734
Hello again I'm Mr. Chair, members of the board, Adam Barnosky, 255 State Street, Boston, attorney for the applicant Timothy Harrington.

855
01:22:39,315 --> 01:22:43,299
We are here regarding the property located at Zero Windsor Road in Medford.

856
01:22:45,953 --> 01:22:58,981
As a way of background, Mr. Harrington, the record owner of the property, seeks to construct a new single-family residence on an empty lot, which is currently improved by a rundown shed on the property in otherwise vacant land.

857
01:22:59,782 --> 01:23:07,667
The property is situated on an empty rectangular corner lot consisting of approximately 3,048 square feet in the general residential zoning district.

858
01:23:08,747 --> 01:23:13,033
on the corner of Windsor Road and Hinsdale Street, immediately north of Alumni Fields.

859
01:23:14,514 --> 01:23:25,127
The proposed single-family dwelling would front on Windsor Road, stand 2.5 stories tall, including a dormer attic, and 24 feet wide by 43 feet deep, running along Hinsdale Street.

860
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:33,188
Mr. Harrington is interested in building this new home with his wife, Andrea, who was born and raised in Medford, graduated from Medford High, class of 87.

861
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:37,152
The family has strong roots in the city with Tim's in-laws.

862
01:23:37,252 --> 01:23:43,277
Andrea's parents have been lifetime residents of the city as well, with four children, including two in high school.

863
01:23:43,337 --> 01:23:50,544
Tim and Andrea are interested in building a home on this vacant parcel so they can continue to enjoy and thrive in the community.

864
01:23:51,557 --> 01:24:02,621
About the home, it will be located on the end of the street on a corner dead-end lot with nice sun exposure, and the structure is designed to maximize these environmental aspects.

865
01:24:03,721 --> 01:24:16,085
Compared to other homes in the neighborhood in immediate vicinity, which are almost exclusively two-family homes of significant bulk footprint and height, this is a modest build consisting of a single-family configuration,

866
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:32,250
2,250 square feet of living space, 2.5 stories with dormers and the roof, unfinished basement for mechanicals and storage, a living room, dining room, and kitchen on the first floor, four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, and a driveway parking and two cars.

867
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:42,713
The home will be constructed and built according to municipal building codes with a pest management plan, and the Harringtons will work with the local builder to ensure the home is

868
01:24:42,853 --> 01:24:48,239
finished with sustainable and appropriate building materials and finishes consistent with the aesthetic of the neighborhood.

869
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:57,390
And Mr. Chair, if I may, I would like to go through first the zoning relief that's required and then some of the facts that support the variance here.

870
01:25:01,298 --> 01:25:09,105
So, pursuant to Chapter 94 of the Medford Zoning Ordinance, the project requires the following relief from the code, all of which are dimensional in nature, under Section 94-4.11, Table B, Item 1.

871
01:25:09,165 --> 01:25:11,507
So, lot area, the regs require lot area of 5,000 square feet.

872
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:15,331
The property has a lot area of 3,048 square feet, requiring a variance of 1,952 square feet.

873
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:26,879
We also require a variance for frontage.

874
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:29,199
The regs require a frontage of 50 feet.

875
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:32,640
The applicant proposes frontage of 40 feet requiring a variance of 10.

876
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,960
Front yard setbacks, regulations require 15 feet front yard setback.

877
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:46,242
The applicant proposes 6 feet along Insdale Street and 14.5, 6 feet setback along Windsor Road.

878
01:25:46,782 --> 01:25:51,963
The applicant therefore requires a variance of 9 feet and 0.44 feet respectively from the front.

879
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,205
and front yard setback requirements.

880
01:25:56,306 --> 01:26:00,369
One clarification regarding rear yard setback and we do have the building commissioner on here tonight.

881
01:26:00,749 --> 01:26:04,572
So rear yard setback was not cited for relief in a refusal letter.

882
01:26:04,852 --> 01:26:11,397
We did want to bring it up just to clarify to ensure that we're getting all the relief that's needed here tonight.

883
01:26:11,477 --> 01:26:16,841
So the building is compliant with rear yard setback, 17 feet from the rear lot line.

884
01:26:18,282 --> 01:26:19,783
Setback requires 15 feet.

885
01:26:20,304 --> 01:26:21,485
There is a porch

886
01:26:22,605 --> 01:26:27,527
that was in the plans that are 7.1 feet from the rear lot line.

887
01:26:28,227 --> 01:26:32,448
I would just recognize this as we were going through some of the dimensional tables today.

888
01:26:32,468 --> 01:26:37,450
And I just wanted to ensure that relief wouldn't be required relative to the deck.

889
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,650
And if it is, it would be 7.9 feet.

890
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:42,211
We want to include that in the discussion tonight.

891
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:46,253
So I don't know if the building commissioner can opine on that on the fly.

892
01:26:46,733 --> 01:26:50,174
But if not, we can just go by the language of the

893
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,422
refusal letter as stated.

894
01:26:53,442 --> 01:27:03,314
Yeah, my opinion is the deck is a part of the structure and it is a structure, so it has to comply as well as anything else.

895
01:27:03,334 --> 01:27:04,436
That's standard practice.

896
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:08,841
If you want to build a deck in the blue or put a front porch on, you have to comply with setbacks.

897
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:09,762
This would be no different.

898
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:13,602
Thank you.

899
01:27:14,222 --> 01:27:32,028
So just to clarify, in addition to the three that I mentioned, lot area, frontage, front yard setback, there is also a requirement for a rear yard setback, which is very much consistent with the same discussions overall we're having this evening.

900
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:39,651
It's also worth noting that due to the shed that's currently on site, this rear

901
01:27:42,622 --> 01:27:47,763
DAC is actually going to make the rear lot line more compliant than it currently is.

902
01:27:47,843 --> 01:28:03,587
Now, I'd like to get briefly into the reasons why this law and proposed project are well within the qualifications for a variance under General Law Section 40A, Chapter 40A, Section 10, and why in addition to the legal reasoning, it's a good project for a good reason.

903
01:28:04,247 --> 01:28:06,749
in just about the most appropriate location.

904
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,691
So first about the property.

905
01:28:09,672 --> 01:28:18,499
The property is a pre-existing non-conforming lot whereby the property cannot be improved without some form of zoning relief.

906
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:35,845
As to the first prong under 40A, this is a corner lot which directly impacts its effective size and buildable shape due to the dimensional requirements treating, as I just mentioned, it treats the side yard as a front yard with increased setback requirements.

907
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:43,288
This results in a narrowing of the property that is in the area of the property in which one could build without the need for dimensional variance.

908
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:46,670
and that is very specific to a corner lot.

909
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:49,891
But the shape of the lot is also unique.

910
01:28:50,431 --> 01:28:59,216
You can see that each property located on Windsor Road has an angular rear lot line that creates a shorter western property line for each lot.

911
01:28:59,996 --> 01:29:13,142
However, as you move down the road from east to west, this angle narrows and tightens each lot line at the rear lot line with the effect of shortening each lot as you move from east to west.

912
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:21,385
So this starts off with each block off of Windsor Road at Charlton, Sterling, Renfrew, Fleming, and Ryncliffe from east to west.

913
01:29:21,825 --> 01:29:25,547
And it creates a situation where zero Windsor has a small

914
01:29:26,368 --> 01:29:30,754
in more squeezed shape and size than other properties along Windsor.

915
01:29:31,174 --> 01:29:40,648
Now historically, from what I can see, this configuration appears to have been created to allow for additional lots on side streets to the south of the neighborhood.

916
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:44,811
as can be seen on the side street homes off of Buzzles Lane to the south.

917
01:29:45,192 --> 01:29:56,461
I did provide a screenshot through Dennis McDougal earlier today that kind of gives you a better sense of what the neighborhood looks like and kind of can give you some reference points as I'm speaking here.

918
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:05,308
But this property is unique because unlike the others that I mentioned to the south, there is no other homes or residential lots to the south.

919
01:30:05,808 --> 01:30:12,954
It's just the athletic fields and yet the construction layout, I'm sorry, the constricting layout still affects this lot.

920
01:30:14,455 --> 01:30:19,500
configuration that can rarely be found elsewhere within the city or the zoning district.

921
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:34,874
So the uniqueness as it relates to shape in conjunction with its features as a corner lot, pre-existing nonconformity, and two front yard requirements presents circumstances that makes the locus unique and affects the locus in a proposed structure.

922
01:30:36,445 --> 01:30:50,011
And this directly relates to prong B, which is a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance when it involves substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner.

923
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:55,213
A literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance would render this property unbuildable, essentially.

924
01:30:55,673 --> 01:30:58,294
It's undersized and without sufficient frontage.

925
01:30:58,814 --> 01:31:03,777
Literally nothing can be built here without some kind of dimensional relief.

926
01:31:05,077 --> 01:31:15,555
And this involves a substantial hardship to the petitioner, both financial and otherwise, as it's wholly unable to use the property for uses allowed by right in zoning districts.

927
01:31:16,615 --> 01:31:21,918
And that's notwithstanding that nearly every single lot in this area is dimensionally non-compliant.

928
01:31:22,298 --> 01:31:32,003
This includes the entirety of Windsor Road and Frederick, Stanley, and Stearns Road to the north, running the entirety of at least four city blocks from College Ave to Main Street.

929
01:31:32,504 --> 01:31:38,327
Dozens upon dozens of properties and homes uniform in their dimensional non-compliance.

930
01:31:38,867 --> 01:31:47,492
That is oversized homes on undersized lots, which relates directly to prong C, no substantial detriment to the public good.

931
01:31:47,972 --> 01:31:49,573
This is currently a vacant lot.

932
01:31:49,993 --> 01:31:51,274
It's on a dead end street.

933
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:53,976
It abuts a public park to its rear.

934
01:31:54,676 --> 01:32:15,452
And given the nature of the neighborhood, including all immediate neighbors, which are two-family homes of significant bulk and footprints, it's difficult to make a good-faith argument that a single-family home of equal or lesser setbacks, lesser bulk, lesser square footage, and lesser use would somehow create a detriment to the public good or to the neighborhood.

935
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:25,058
And finally, to the last prong, subsection D, that relief can be granted here without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance.

936
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:30,582
The circumstances here are unique and would not be found elsewhere in the zoning district or potentially the city.

937
01:32:31,242 --> 01:32:37,647
Granting relief would not nullify the zoning ordinance or derogate from the ordinance, particularly given the nature of this neighborhood.

938
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:47,971
So if you back up and you view this in the light of the general residential district, the neighborhood and Windsor Road, it's a reasonable proposal, entirely consistent with a residential neighborhood.

939
01:32:48,771 --> 01:32:56,234
And stepping away from just the clearly legal criteria under 48 section 10, this is a good project.

940
01:32:57,255 --> 01:33:03,297
It's a modest home on an empty lot in an area of the region of the city that's in dire need of new housing.

941
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:10,483
the applicants are local and what they seek is to build would be a net positive for the community.

942
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:15,385
So I'm happy to walk through any questions you have on the proposal or the criteria.

943
01:33:16,526 --> 01:33:16,826
Thank you.

944
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,391
Thank you, Attorney Banowski.

945
01:33:25,471 --> 01:33:27,452
Any questions from the board for the applicant?

946
01:33:36,965 --> 01:33:44,171
I think it might be helpful if you just pulled up the plans and the situation of like where it's going to be laid out.

947
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:54,479
And, you know, you speak of, you know, the property itself and being narrowed in areas and to be able to actually point that out would be helpful.

948
01:33:54,579 --> 01:34:00,524
And then I know, I mean, even on the Google Maps, right, somebody's parking in that shed and whatnot.

949
01:34:00,584 --> 01:34:02,906
And so does that mean that parking is being lost?

950
01:34:04,387 --> 01:34:09,011
You know, I think it just to get more context, if we could see that.

951
01:34:10,212 --> 01:34:10,532
Sure.

952
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:14,515
Now, Dennis, do you have the ability to share the plans on your screen?

953
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:14,976
I don't.

954
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,658
From my setup right here, I don't have the ability to.

955
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,340
Our architect is unable to attend this evening.

956
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:29,708
So I don't know if you're able to either share the plans or potentially also share the neighborhood layout that was presented there or sent over earlier today.

957
01:34:31,117 --> 01:34:31,617
Yeah, I can do that.

958
01:34:31,677 --> 01:34:33,138
Give me a few seconds.

959
01:34:33,158 --> 01:34:33,538
Thank you.

960
01:34:33,938 --> 01:34:36,399
Which one do you want first, the neighborhood layout or the?

961
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:39,279
Well, I think, I think, you know, I think potentially the plans.

962
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:43,281
I mean, I thought, you know, my, my, my thought was that the, you know, the board would have it in their packet.

963
01:34:43,321 --> 01:34:46,482
And it's a relatively straightforward plan.

964
01:34:46,522 --> 01:34:54,624
But yeah, I mean, if it would help just to kind of, you can just maybe flip through the renderings just so you could see the one family, a single family proposal here.

965
01:35:16,468 --> 01:35:23,309
So that shows, so this first slide is really a site plan here.

966
01:35:23,349 --> 01:35:27,490
So you can see it's the property that's on the top there.

967
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:31,591
That would be the new single family home.

968
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:39,993
You can see the garage in the left hand that's shaded a bit, that's what will be removed.

969
01:35:41,173 --> 01:35:44,134
So you can see the configuration of that single family home is,

970
01:35:47,592 --> 01:35:55,295
and it appears to be more setback than the immediately adjacent neighbor there.

971
01:35:55,896 --> 01:36:02,098
It's funny, though, the way that this is positioned here, it almost makes it seem as though Windsor Road is the angled lot line.

972
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:08,461
But if you look on the overall configuration of the neighborhood, it's actually the rear lot line that is angled there.

973
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:11,202
So you can get a sense that the front

974
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,762
setback is 14.56 feet.

975
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,925
So that is nearly compliant.

976
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,607
It requires a 15 yard setback.

977
01:36:26,067 --> 01:36:30,712
But the side yard setback is really what triggers an issue here.

978
01:36:30,772 --> 01:36:32,694
Because like we said, it's an undersized lot.

979
01:36:32,734 --> 01:36:38,180
So regarding the width of the lot or the undersized nature of the lot, there's really nothing that can be

980
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,902
done there regarding what you build.

981
01:36:40,422 --> 01:36:51,855
But as far as the side yard setback up at the top off of Hinsdale, the zoning code treats a corner lot, they treat the corner and the side yard the same as the front yard.

982
01:36:51,995 --> 01:36:59,403
So that would otherwise be compliant if it was being treated like a standard side yard there.

983
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:04,286
To that extent, it's nearly compliant.

984
01:37:05,427 --> 01:37:13,193
Then the rear yard, like we said, the rear yard, the building itself is compliant, but the deck would jut into the rear yard there.

985
01:37:13,614 --> 01:37:22,100
The setbacks are primarily what the issue is relative to what we're building today, and then the width and the size of the lot are the uncontrollable factors there.

986
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:29,587
being just from a calculations perspective, the deck is 10 ft, correct?

987
01:37:31,088 --> 01:37:31,909
Yes, that is correct.

988
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:40,134
So the rear yard setback, it would be 7.9 ft variance, correct?

989
01:37:40,574 --> 01:37:41,454
Yes, exactly.

990
01:37:41,494 --> 01:37:41,855
Thank you.

991
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:48,859
Commissioner?

992
01:37:50,681 --> 01:38:02,370
I want to ask the applicant if he plans on seeking a side variance for the parking spaces, which should be a minimum of three feet from any side lot.

993
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:18,423
So, Tim, could you, if it's not, it doesn't appear to be clear on that plan, if you're available, could you just describe where the location of the parking would be, whether it be in the front

994
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:20,597
Can you hear me okay?

995
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:21,637
Yeah.

996
01:38:22,217 --> 01:38:32,082
Yeah, so the way it was drawn was the parking was in between the two structures, the existing two-fam and the proposed building.

997
01:38:32,102 --> 01:38:37,185
So would it be the one and the two side yard there?

998
01:38:37,225 --> 01:38:37,505
Yes.

999
01:38:39,405 --> 01:38:50,568
Okay, but the zoning code requires that there be a minimum of three foot setback from the sideline to the parking spaces and you have none and only one foot left to play with on that setback.

1000
01:38:50,608 --> 01:38:53,849
So I'm just asking if you're going to be applying for a variance for that as well.

1001
01:38:54,869 --> 01:38:57,190
Yeah, I guess it was not cited.

1002
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:59,791
So this is a surprise and news to me.

1003
01:38:59,931 --> 01:39:01,431
So it's in the zoning book.

1004
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:02,852
You're still responsible for it.

1005
01:39:03,012 --> 01:39:03,512
Understood.

1006
01:39:03,532 --> 01:39:04,332
Yeah, understood.

1007
01:39:05,792 --> 01:39:07,433
Yeah, thank you.

1008
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:09,813
We appreciate you bringing that to our attention.

1009
01:39:09,873 --> 01:39:23,638
So that would either be one that we would need to reapply for, or in the context of the variances we see today, if the board would be amenable to including those, we could certainly address specifically what's needed there.

1010
01:39:26,642 --> 01:39:39,505
And going off of that, if you're putting spots in that space, does that mean the front lot, the public is losing parking because you're going to be adding a driveway?

1011
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:48,427
And then is the public recuperating the parking on the Hinsdale side of the street where you're removing that shed and garage area?

1012
01:39:49,972 --> 01:40:00,976
Yeah, it would presumably be, yeah, like a net neutral because you would be removing, presumably removing a curve cut on one location adding it to another.

1013
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:14,582
Where are you putting your trash barrels?

1014
01:40:19,948 --> 01:40:21,530
They're in the backyard near the deck.

1015
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,171
There's a bulkhead back there.

1016
01:40:46,431 --> 01:40:47,572
Would you want me to go to another screen?

1017
01:40:48,893 --> 01:40:50,596
Oh, yeah, sure.

1018
01:40:50,656 --> 01:40:51,518
Thank you, Dennis.

1019
01:40:52,119 --> 01:41:01,495
Yeah, I guess if you could go to the actual drawings there of the proposed home.

1020
01:41:19,974 --> 01:41:20,875
Chris, just talk.

1021
01:41:21,015 --> 01:41:23,656
While we bring that up, go ahead, Chris.

1022
01:41:23,676 --> 01:41:24,817
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1023
01:41:24,937 --> 01:41:37,203
Through you to the applicant and his representative, if you don't mind, the history of this undersized lot, how did it come to be?

1024
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:41,946
Was it attached to the adjacent house and subdivided at some point?

1025
01:41:41,966 --> 01:41:42,386
Do you know?

1026
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:45,052
I don't know.

1027
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:48,614
I don't believe there's been any subdivision on the property.

1028
01:41:48,814 --> 01:41:52,757
It has been its own lot.

1029
01:41:53,557 --> 01:41:59,521
I don't unfortunately have a long-standing history of them.

1030
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:04,564
It's my understanding there's never been anything other than the rear structure constructed here.

1031
01:42:05,164 --> 01:42:25,952
But if you look at the layout of this lot, particularly as it relates to all of the other lots on Hinsdale and Windsor and Frederick and Stanley, it's wholly consistent with every other lot.

1032
01:42:26,812 --> 01:42:32,195
So it is kind of curious that there never was a structure or there isn't currently a structure there as

1033
01:42:34,328 --> 01:42:39,933
as it sinks up size-wise with the other undersized lots.

1034
01:42:41,234 --> 01:42:44,436
Who owns the garage at the rear of the property?

1035
01:42:45,397 --> 01:42:51,782
Well, the garage is owned by the applicant owns the property, which the garage is part of the property.

1036
01:42:53,203 --> 01:42:56,306
But who parks there if there's no house?

1037
01:42:56,346 --> 01:42:57,547
Who parks there?

1038
01:42:57,827 --> 01:42:59,368
I'm not sure, Tim.

1039
01:43:00,349 --> 01:43:02,391
Is the structure actively being used?

1040
01:43:02,871 --> 01:43:03,031
No.

1041
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:09,319
I just see Senior Planner Evans had a question.

1042
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:17,742
It looked like when I was looking at Google Street View that there was a car that was using that or parking there.

1043
01:43:18,142 --> 01:43:24,124
So this is the, so Mr. Harrington owns both properties.

1044
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:30,307
It's, I mean, a double lot is not an uncommon occurrence in the city.

1045
01:43:30,327 --> 01:43:33,268
Even my house has two lots.

1046
01:43:34,769 --> 01:43:36,009
One of them has my garage on it.

1047
01:43:36,507 --> 01:43:39,127
I'm not putting a single family house on it.

1048
01:43:41,948 --> 01:43:52,350
So this is a two-family that's on the adjacent lot that you use as a rental for folks.

1049
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,190
Is that correct?

1050
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:54,230
Yes, correct.

1051
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:55,450
So where do they park?

1052
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:57,671
Because there's no driveway for this.

1053
01:43:57,691 --> 01:43:58,611
Yeah, no driveway.

1054
01:43:58,671 --> 01:43:59,831
No driveway parking.

1055
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:02,652
It's effectively one lot.

1056
01:44:05,893 --> 01:44:11,056
because they're both under size and it's being used for the same, for that house.

1057
01:44:11,096 --> 01:44:11,336
So.

1058
01:44:12,397 --> 01:44:13,678
Yeah, there's no second lot here.

1059
01:44:13,858 --> 01:44:18,621
These combine out of merger doctrine.

1060
01:44:18,641 --> 01:44:21,842
Parking for the two families.

1061
01:44:21,902 --> 01:44:29,567
So if you're developing this as a single, so I don't worry, where's the parking going for the two family?

1062
01:44:29,587 --> 01:44:34,570
Well, the parking for the two fam is preexisting nonconforming.

1063
01:44:35,643 --> 01:44:44,085
So parking, you know, it hasn't, you know, there hasn't been parking with the two families.

1064
01:44:44,285 --> 01:44:50,887
Maybe it's a question for legal, but isn't there the whole concept of merger doctrine?

1065
01:44:51,347 --> 01:44:54,787
You're using the two lots for the one property.

1066
01:44:55,168 --> 01:45:00,369
If it's been used for parking for the two family, I don't understand how.

1067
01:45:00,389 --> 01:45:05,230
I don't know whose car was in Google Maps, but

1068
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:10,894
there's no parking with this two-family property.

1069
01:45:11,734 --> 01:45:17,179
But if I may clarify, merger doctrine says any lot that's undersized and common ownership would have combined.

1070
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:21,142
These lots are a GR district, requires a minimum of 5,000 square feet.

1071
01:45:21,182 --> 01:45:22,963
This lot here is what, 3,000?

1072
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:29,508
So technically, these lots long ago combined for zoning purposes under merger doctrine, there is no second lot here.

1073
01:45:38,968 --> 01:45:44,173
Yeah, I don't even understand how this is before your board.

1074
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,855
I don't even see how this would be an act on.

1075
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:52,961
It does have its own map block and number, though, correct?

1076
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:55,263
No, that's how a merger doctor says, though.

1077
01:45:58,165 --> 01:46:00,167
Ask them how often those maps get updated.

1078
01:46:05,898 --> 01:46:08,580
The point of merger doctrine is it's in chapter 48.

1079
01:46:08,941 --> 01:46:12,403
Lots will merge for purposes of greater conformance to the local zoning.

1080
01:46:12,423 --> 01:46:15,546
5,000 square feet is required.

1081
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:32,760
So was there any discussion about creating, like adding to the existing building that they own versus adding a completely separate building?

1082
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:49,185
No, I think the idea here was that, as I understand it, this property has always been separate and distinct from the two family next door.

1083
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:56,713
The thought process was to build a new single family on the property.

1084
01:46:57,694 --> 01:47:13,712
And as far as kind of what brought us from here to there, when the refusal was kicked back, the application that was made was in conjunction with the refusal and the relief that was cited on the refusals.

1085
01:47:13,772 --> 01:47:15,514
That's kind of what brought us here today.

1086
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:18,817
Historically, as the applicant has mentioned, the

1087
01:47:20,195 --> 01:47:33,379
the lot in the parking at that lot has never been used in conjunction with the other pre-existing non-conforming house, which is consistent with the other pre-existing non-conforming properties on the road that may or may not have parking.

1088
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:41,541
So this was being treated as its own project, although I do understand the comments of the building commissioner.

1089
01:47:41,561 --> 01:47:47,683
I think if I may clarify,

1090
01:47:49,314 --> 01:48:13,832
Mr. Chair, through you to the building commissioner, if a structure such as the garage in that, which is on the property in question that we are talking about, someone constructed that at some point, perhaps not compliant with zoning or with the law,

1091
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:22,333
but it is, in theory, attached to the adjacent building.

1092
01:48:23,533 --> 01:48:28,856
Would you clarify that for us?

1093
01:48:29,036 --> 01:48:33,358
Who are you asking?

1094
01:48:33,819 --> 01:48:35,460
I'm asking you, Mr. Commissioner.

1095
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:42,063
Well, again, Chapter 48, I can't remember if it's Section 6 or which, but it says,

1096
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:49,155
non-conforming lots must be viewed in combination for purposes of zoning.

1097
01:48:49,195 --> 01:48:53,498
They must combine under the merger doctrine for purposes of zoning if they're undersized.

1098
01:48:53,698 --> 01:48:58,441
In other words, the original lot is well undersized current zoning of 5,000 square foot.

1099
01:48:59,142 --> 01:49:03,985
When they combine, you basically have four purposes of zoning in a single lot here.

1100
01:49:04,025 --> 01:49:07,308
You cannot treat that as a separate lot building lot.

1101
01:49:09,149 --> 01:49:09,409
Yes.

1102
01:49:09,529 --> 01:49:09,889
Thank you.

1103
01:49:11,485 --> 01:49:31,061
But just to clarify, if the structure was constructed on the lot in question, the lot for which we are discussing right now, does that lend any validity or more validity to the argument that there is a merger between the two?

1104
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:38,063
merger doctrine in chapter 40 doesn't discuss that per se.

1105
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:45,788
If it had a primary principle use as a residence on which is the primary allowed use, there might be a slightly different conversation.

1106
01:49:45,828 --> 01:49:49,350
But this is not a principle use, it's an accessory use at best.

1107
01:49:50,451 --> 01:49:51,372
Certainly not allowed.

1108
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:55,774
It's not an allowed principle use, therefore it has no protection.

1109
01:49:55,814 --> 01:49:57,956
So it really doesn't come into play in the conversation.

1110
01:50:00,722 --> 01:50:10,417
Would we be able to, you know, because there is this issue, you know, that was not, you know, I anticipate that if the review was

1111
01:50:11,934 --> 01:50:25,103
if the refusal letter was made with the understanding of the common ownership between the two parcels, that a different refusal might have been issued.

1112
01:50:25,143 --> 01:50:32,127
I'm wondering if it makes sense to request, if the board were granted a continuance in the matter, to see if

1113
01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:42,207
if we might be able to retool that or simply just seek a different refusal because ultimately the way I see this is that it's going to be

1114
01:50:44,654 --> 01:51:02,206
the same argument will be made, whether it's two properties on an oversized lot, or one new addition, I'm sorry, two buildings on an oversized lot, which is gonna trigger probably a use issue under the general residential, although we'd have to look at the use table.

1115
01:51:02,226 --> 01:51:11,112
But if no evidence was submitted to the commissioner at the time, defining the ownership of these properties, then he wouldn't have been able to opine

1116
01:51:11,792 --> 01:51:13,593
correctly on the merger.

1117
01:51:14,013 --> 01:51:22,676
I'm relying now upon your conversation statements that these are both owned by the same owner, which triggers this merger conversation, perhaps for the first time.

1118
01:51:23,696 --> 01:51:27,457
Oh yeah, of course.

1119
01:51:27,617 --> 01:51:31,778
No harm, no foul on the side of the building department.

1120
01:51:31,878 --> 01:51:33,379
I have to confirm because

1121
01:51:33,859 --> 01:51:39,442
In my review, I would have to confirm that that actually is the same ownership.

1122
01:51:40,343 --> 01:51:54,271
Whether it's owned as a rental property by the applicant in a different entity or if it is in fact the same ownership, which is why I think we might want to review this to determine whether is merger applicable.

1123
01:51:54,331 --> 01:52:03,137
If it is, what are the steps to finding an approval for the project or is it going to be a situation where

1124
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:08,179
There, in fact, is not common ownership and we're back before the board on really on the same issue.

1125
01:52:08,219 --> 01:52:16,422
But I think ultimately, when there's a willingness from the board and the community, I think that there would be a way to define our way forward here.

1126
01:52:16,442 --> 01:52:27,226
I know that we've dealt with this challenging issue before within the past year or two in some other properties before this board.

1127
01:52:27,246 --> 01:52:28,507
We could certainly address that as well.

1128
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:29,347
Right.

1129
01:52:29,367 --> 01:52:38,453
I believe recent zoning passed last year would allow by Daniel can correct me if his variance or special permit will allow two principal structures, therefore two principal uses a lot.

1130
01:52:38,893 --> 01:52:41,475
But that's a different form of relief than you're seeking here.

1131
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:47,138
So yeah, it needs to be clarified as to whether or not these are in common ownership that merge the purposes of zoning.

1132
01:52:47,919 --> 01:52:52,361
And if this is a is no longer a path that you can follow, you need to follow a different path.

1133
01:52:53,182 --> 01:52:53,382
Right.

1134
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:06,947
So with that, Mr. Chair, could we request a continuance and then have, look into this more, we can coordinate through the clerk.

1135
01:53:07,968 --> 01:53:11,771
Yep, seeing if that happens.

1136
01:53:12,212 --> 01:53:17,376
Thank you, yeah, I was just going to say that I was looking at the assessor's database and it's both the same ownership.

1137
01:53:17,456 --> 01:53:24,302
So, as I said, this is a very common format.

1138
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:28,287
format in the city, as I'm sure you're well aware as well.

1139
01:53:30,429 --> 01:53:37,974
And Building Commissioner is correct that the recent zoning changes allow two principal structures on a lot.

1140
01:53:38,034 --> 01:53:46,200
And in the GR zone, I think it might be by right or it might be a special permit, but it would be together.

1141
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:53,866
So you could kind of master plan this and accommodate parking for both of your structures

1142
01:53:56,712 --> 01:54:04,358
But if you're going to hold these as rental properties, as you have the two-family as well.

1143
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:16,006
But unfortunately, I mean, one of the things that we're looking to do in the zoning overhaul is this internal zoning.

1144
01:54:16,807 --> 01:54:17,667
We don't have that yet.

1145
01:54:18,168 --> 01:54:23,111
So I would caution the board against granting variances for undersized lots at this point.

1146
01:54:25,577 --> 01:54:32,360
Because there's other ways in the zoning ordinance to develop this land.

1147
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:33,740
Understood.

1148
01:54:37,742 --> 01:54:46,966
Attorney Bronowski, do you want to proceed with a continuance request?

1149
01:54:48,064 --> 01:54:49,104
Yeah, I think so.

1150
01:54:49,144 --> 01:54:55,367
I just don't want to make any decisions either to proceed or withdraw without prejudice in haste.

1151
01:54:55,427 --> 01:55:03,830
And I just want to look into this a little bit further and have a discussion with Mr. Harrington on a few of the aspects that we've discussed here.

1152
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:06,351
But I certainly appreciate everyone's input, as I always do.

1153
01:55:07,391 --> 01:55:09,032
And we do thank you for your time tonight.

1154
01:55:10,632 --> 01:55:11,893
Thank you.

1155
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:26,858
The board awaits motion for continuance for zero Windsor Road to the April 25th, 6.30 PM meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

1156
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:28,379
Don't move.

1157
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:30,400
Second.

1158
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:31,361
Second.

1159
01:55:32,402 --> 01:55:33,042
Roll call vote.

1160
01:55:33,742 --> 01:55:34,183

Aye.

1162
01:55:36,684 --> 01:55:37,244
Jim Tarani.

1163
01:55:37,965 --> 01:55:38,085
Aye.

1164
01:55:38,885 --> 01:55:39,526
Yvette Valez.

1165
01:55:40,426 --> 01:55:40,546
Aye.

1166
01:55:41,287 --> 01:55:41,907
Christy Yvette.

1167
01:55:42,868 --> 01:55:43,028
Aye.

1168
01:55:43,907 --> 01:55:45,068
And Jamie Thompson, hi.

1169
01:55:50,652 --> 01:55:53,895
I believe that is everything from a case perspective.

1170
01:55:54,295 --> 01:55:55,516
Thank you, Attorney Baranski.

1171
01:55:55,536 --> 01:55:57,298
Thank you for Applicant Harrington.

1172
01:55:58,058 --> 01:56:02,362
And Dennis, do we have any administrative?

1173
01:56:07,906 --> 01:56:09,908
We've got one set of meeting minutes.

1174
01:56:13,519 --> 01:56:14,039
Oh, you're on mute.

1175
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:16,960
Dennis, you're on mute.

1176
01:56:22,963 --> 01:56:23,703
Dennis, you're on mute.

1177
01:56:24,684 --> 01:56:25,704
I know, I know, I know, sorry.

1178
01:56:26,844 --> 01:56:35,548
No, with the eight decisions that were sort of going through me on the last, and among other things, I just never got to the minutes for this month, so I'll get it to you before the next one.

1179
01:56:37,349 --> 01:56:40,170
Oh, I apologize, that was the 40B folder.

1180
01:56:41,022 --> 01:56:46,405
Yes, we got you got a bunch of 40 be able to several 40 be with that's what I thought of that was the 40 B. But.

1181
01:56:49,706 --> 01:56:50,227
And.

1182
01:56:51,768 --> 01:56:55,069
Chair awaits a motion.

1183
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:56,850
Motion.

1184
01:57:00,832 --> 01:57:01,673
Jim raise your hand.

1185
01:57:02,153 --> 01:57:02,533
Second.

1186
01:57:03,033 --> 01:57:03,393
Thank you.

1187
01:57:04,274 --> 01:57:06,755
I will call vote and that the last.

1188
01:57:07,536 --> 01:57:07,976
Mary Lee.

1189
01:57:08,776 --> 01:57:08,796
I.

1190
01:57:11,032 --> 01:57:11,273
Aye.

1191
01:57:11,754 --> 01:57:12,315
Jim Torani.

1192
01:57:12,916 --> 01:57:13,057
Aye.

1193
01:57:13,898 --> 01:57:14,680
And Jamie Thompson.

1194
01:57:14,901 --> 01:57:16,243
Aye.

1195
01:57:16,424 --> 01:57:17,707
Thank you everybody for your time tonight.

1196
01:57:18,869 --> 01:57:19,731
Great job, Jamie.

1197
01:57:20,493 --> 01:57:20,813
Thank you.

1198
01:57:21,134 --> 01:57:21,415
Good night.

1199
01:57:21,755 --> 01:57:21,896
Yes.
