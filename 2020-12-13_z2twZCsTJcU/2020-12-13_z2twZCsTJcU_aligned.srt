00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:04,975
Hi, I am here with Madison Lewis from Mamas Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville.

2
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:06,456
Madison, thank you so much for being here.

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:08,037
Thank you for having me.

4
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:09,238
It's a pleasure to be here today.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:09,959
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:10,580
Pleasure to have you.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,382
So can you tell us a little bit about Mamas?

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,422
and how it got started and your role?

9
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:17,743
Absolutely.

10
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:33,171
So MAMA started at the beginning of the pandemic, but mutual aid has been around for generations and MAMA certainly didn't come up with it, but has adopted the mutual aid framework for operating.

11
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:39,054
And so let's see, my role within it, I'm one of the many, many, many volunteers.

12
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,735
It was started by a couple of community members

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:52,033
back in March and has really grown in leaps and bounds to incorporate many volunteers across many neighborhoods.

14
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:53,753
And what's the purpose?

15
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:54,754
Sure.

16
00:00:54,834 --> 00:01:03,558
So the idea behind Mamas is that it's a collective of neighbors of community members coming together to support one another.

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:11,922
And, you know, another core part of it is that we believe everyone has something that they need and everyone has something to give.

18
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,963
And so the power is really

19
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:23,807
thinking about how can community members come together to identify what the needs are and to support one another with all of the resources that we have when we pool them together.

20
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,889
And so Mamas does many, many things.

21
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,331
If community members are in need of financial resources, we try to fundraise.

22
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,833
If community members need groceries, we deliver them.

23
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:40,815
If community members need diapers for their kids, we try to provide them.

24
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:47,761
And when I say we, it's really the community and it's everyone involved.

25
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:49,963
Yeah.

26
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:53,765
I've, you know, kind of seen a little bit of what's going on.

27
00:01:53,825 --> 00:02:02,590
It's really amazing seeing like you have pods where each neighborhood, like each, you know, three or four blocks has like its own, you know, small network.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,792
And you also have these email lists for different subjects.

29
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,714
Can you talk a little bit about the structure just so people know how they can plug in?

30
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:10,995
Oh, absolutely.

31
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:14,157
So I'll talk about a couple of things.

32
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:18,281
The first is that we really try to keep it as horizontal as possible.

33
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,703
So yes, a couple of people started it.

34
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:29,069
But in terms of the decision making and kind of the structure behind it, it is very horizontal.

35
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:36,436
And what I mean by that is that it's very community participatory in terms of how are we going to do what next.

36
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,758
But in terms of thinking about the pods and the other working groups.

37
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:56,029
So there are one aspect of mamas is these neighborhood pods where you really think about supporting your neighbors at a hyper hyper local level, and so it's working maybe within your block or a couple of blocks to see what people need and what people can give.

38
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:05,457
Then there's also working groups so there's you know the money working group or the delivery working group or the spiritual and emotional working group.

39
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:14,506
And those are groups where people are working on a specific area, such as food or, or other types of resources to

40
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:23,050
to field all the requests that are coming in within that area, and we encourage people to get involved in both ends.

41
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:34,995
Maybe one day you can be someone answering a phone on the hotline, a caller coming in and helping redirect them, and maybe the next day you're the caller on the hotline, and so it's very much bi-directional.

42
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:36,397
Great.

43
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:47,307
So I'm curious what have you heard from the community about the need the changing needs so especially like what's been happening lately as we approach the holidays.

44
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:48,248
Sure.

45
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:54,293
So I would say you know some some needs are new and some needs are unfortunately continuing.

46
00:03:54,753 --> 00:04:01,857
you know, with COVID, the, you know, there's always financial need, but the financial need has really skyrocketed.

47
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:08,480
And the need for food, obviously, you know, is very much tied with the financial challenges these days.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,042
And obviously, that has also been a huge part of Mama's work.

49
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:20,046
I would say another thing that we're specifically responding to now is a lot of people reaching out for winter clothes and warm clothes.

50
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,266
during the season.

51
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:28,130
And so Mamas is currently working on a clothing drive to respond to those calls that are coming in.

52
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:30,771
Yeah.

53
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,773
And how can people either get involved or donate?

54
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:35,773
Like how can people help?

55
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,594
Yeah.

56
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,475
So there's a lot of ways, which is the exciting part.

57
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:44,378
So, you know, if anyone is interested in joining Mamas, welcome.

58
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,859
We would love to have you be part of the community.

59
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,000
You can call the hotline.

60
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:59,264
or you can email us, and I can share the number in just one second, but you can email us at askyourmamas at gmail.com.

61
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:12,150
You also can visit our webpage, which is mutualaidmamas.com, and that page is in English, in Portuguese, in Haitian Creole, and in Spanish, or you can call the hotline, which, and the number is 339-545-1315,

62
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:21,316
And from there, we can help connect you and figure out what are you interested in doing?

63
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,178
Are you interested in shopping for another family?

64
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:35,667
Are you interested in just hearing what the money group is doing and whether you want to think about making a small contribution each month or you want to help fundraise?

65
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:41,052
Or maybe you wanna give people a call every now and again who are looking for someone to talk to.

66
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:45,075
So there's so many ways to get involved, but either reaching out through the hotline

67
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:53,743
Through checking out our web page or reaching out via email, we can certainly help find what works best for you.

68
00:05:54,304 --> 00:06:00,470
And in terms of, you know, any financial contributions in this month as we think about the year and

69
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,472
There are a lot of different ways to do it.

70
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:08,814
We have a Venmo account, a Venmo, PayPal, Cash App or Cash.

71
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,855
We can contact, work with you to pick up cash.

72
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:19,238
There are a number of people in the community who can't receive funds electronically and so cash or check is really essential.

73
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:24,400
Actually today we're having one of our cash days where we coordinate with

74
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,721
with community members to come pick up cash at times that works best for them.

75
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:35,423
And you also can give donations via credit card through our donor box page.

76
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:38,164
Yeah, great.

77
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:49,607
Any more specific information about like, because I saw that you have like an $11 holiday thing, like are there any particular sort of holiday, like what happens to those funds?

78
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:51,587
Sure, yeah, thank you for asking.

79
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:52,328
So,

80
00:06:54,268 --> 00:07:07,955
The wonderful thing about MAMAs is that while a lot of organizations say we will give money for X, Y, and Z, MAMAs really works on trust.

81
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:12,537
If somebody comes into MAMAs and says I need $100, they need $100 and we're going to try to support them.

82
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:24,201
And so through working with many community members, we've learned that a lot of the funds are going to pay for rent, to pay for food, to pay for other basic living expenses.

83
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:33,164
Sometimes we raise, specifically, like we did a diaper derby, our diaper drive, where we had a lot of requests coming in for diapers.

84
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:38,967
And so we had a specific ask, we're going to try to raise this amount of money to pay for diapers for many families.

85
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,391
But you know, so we don't always know exactly what the funds are going to.

86
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:50,739
But from all the conversations, you know, we've had, it's, it's going to basic living expenses, because people are struggling so much these days.

87
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,760
Yeah.

88
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:57,524
It's truly an amazing, amazing organization started at exactly the right time.

89
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:02,466
And I'm so, it's just so great to hear that it's still going strong.

90
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,147
Yeah, they're still doing great work.

91
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:09,309
I know a ton of people who joined recently even, not just at the beginning.

92
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,150
So yeah, thank you so much for the work that you're doing.

93
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,491
Yeah, thank you.

94
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:23,782
And I think, just if I can add one other thing, I think I've talked a lot about the resource distribution and the physical, but there's also a lot of learning that goes on with MAMAs.

95
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:29,568
So, you know, we had a whole many class, community classes that were free for people to participate.

96
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:35,414
And, you know, typically on Monday nights, there are other types of learning and classes that go on.

97
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:35,655
So,

98
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:42,701
Whether you're interested in getting out into the community and actually physically moving resources, that's great.

99
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:46,924
And if you're interested in participating from the comfort of your home, there's also ways for you to do so.

100
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:48,766
But thank you for having me.

101
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:49,627
Amazing.

102
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:50,167
Absolutely.

103
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:51,028
Great to have you.

104
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:51,669
Thank you so much.

105
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,409
Thank you.

106
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,030
Bye bye.
