    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=144.812">So</a>  my name is Joan Cyr, I go by she, her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=148.872">Been</a>  in Medford since 1999 and came by way of Malden and Cambridge, born and raised in Cambridge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=155.694">So</a>  I think I came to the PRIDE committee because I was actually on the PRIDE planning Facebook group before it became the Medford PRIDE committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=167.477">And</a>  we were working with a small group trying to figure out what could we do for PRIDE this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=171.798">So</a>  since I had already been on that team, I threw my hat into the ring for the Medford PRIDE committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=178.6">I'm</a>  also a member of the Medford Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=182.602">So</a>  I have a little bit of information about how to kind of work things through the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=188.926">And</a>  I was happy to see that Medford was going to try to throw their own pride committee plan after, you know, the Boston Pride sort of dissolved over the pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=201.973">So</a>  happy to be here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=203.634">I</a>  think, Lucy, you're next.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=622.784">I</a>  wonder if any of you could speak to that a little bit.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=629.788">I</a>  will happily speak to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=631.569">Joan,</a>  were you going to say something?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=632.79">No,</a>  I was waiting for Michael.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=635.411">Michael,</a>  did you want to start?</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=639.295">Honestly,</a>  I would say, go ahead, Cyan, and I will jump on afterwards.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=645.079">OK,</a>  sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=646.46">So</a>  just to recap for people who don't understand, I had to research it and remember myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=651.124">So</a>  the Boston Pride planning commit, the Boston Pride organization, I forget exactly what they're called, they kind of imploded in 2020 because they had long been getting criticism for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=662.572">not</a>  including trans people in their leadership, not including people of color in their leadership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=667.256">It</a>  was basically a bunch of, I think, white, gay, and lesbian folks, for the most part, who were leading the organization. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=675.884">And</a>  they also got criticism for too much corporate sponsorship. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=680.969">I</a>  noticed from going to the pride parades from 2001 to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=685.233">You</a>  know, 2018 or so that they changed a lot that many of the floats that came through were just a bunch of people in T shirts for whatever bank or corporation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=693.579">And</a>  that was definitely less exciting pride parade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=698.222">So</a>  what happened in 2020 as far as I understood it is that because of the resurgence of Black Lives Matter and the importance of racial equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=707.428">these</a>  calls for change became much stronger. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=710.309">And</a>  rather than change, they just decided to dissolve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=713.409">I</a>  think probably COVID played a part too, because it was very difficult to manage during that time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=717.95">So</a>  I don't know all the full details, but just to recap it quickly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=721.891">So</a>  I think, you know, coming into this, because I have a very strong anti-racist interest and passion for diversity, I wanted to make sure that we were going to be inclusive of people of color, of trans people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=737.154">And</a>  I think that's one way we want to differentiate ourselves and I also wanted us to be very careful about who you're accepting for sponsorship. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=744.401">We</a>  did talk about that a little as as maybe was mentioned before it was kind of a mad rush because we only had six weeks to plan so we didn't really have the time to do a lot of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=754.563">But</a>  we did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=755.645">I'm,</a>  I'm on the same page as what Michael said we didn't want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=759.851">We</a>  didn't want a lot of Michael said this previously to me, we didn't want a lot of corporate floats and stuff like that we didn't want it to be a corporate event where we're primarily promoting corporations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=770.006">I'm</a>  totally for promoting small businesses, to, to a small degree, like, you know, mentioning that they sponsored an event or so on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=778.15">But</a>  I didn't want this to be an advertisement for big corporations for sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=782.552">So</a>  for me that was one that was, those were some of the ways and, and in our drag event that we had. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=788.895">we</a>  specifically made sure that we had drag performers of different kinds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=792.197">We</a>  didn't have just white drag queens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=794.278">We</a>  had drag kings, we had drag things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=798.14">That's</a>  kind of what one of them calls themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=800.422">I'm</a>  not saying that in a derogatory way, but we had people who were kind of gender non-binary in between drag performers, and we had drag queens, and we had people of different colors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=808.646">And</a>  I think it was a great performance and pretty inclusive of how our performances went. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=813.649">So</a>  Michael, I'll hand it to you.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=816.433">Yeah,</a>  and so I guess specifically to talk about kind of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=821.576">the</a>  corporate sponsorship end of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=823.657">I</a>  have a strong belief, and as Sayan said as well, I just don't want to see a big bank float. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=831.939">I</a>  don't want some financial firm to be hucking t-shirts at me at a parade, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=838.301">If</a>  they want to give us money and support our small community, great, but you're not getting representation because you're not queer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=844.882">You're</a>  not, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=847.863">you're</a>  not there to be seen right now, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=851.164">This</a>  is a month for the queer community, not for TD Bank or whomever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=855.485">It's</a>  irrelevant who it is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=857.146">In</a>  terms of small businesses, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=859.927">Yeah,</a>  that's who I want to be supporting our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=864.008">I</a>  would love a bunch of local restaurants, local businesses to be like, yep, you know, this pizza shop and that tax accounting firm in Medford, they've been here for 15 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=874.911">you</a>  know, they paid for this thing, they did that, and we recognize them and say, thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=879.273">You</a>  know, that's what I want to, that's my view of a successful kind of sponsorship thing is, is small groups working with other small groups to, you know, make it happen, basically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=896.102">So</a>  yeah, that's, that's all I got to say on that.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=897.583">I</a>  guess we're not Boston Pride, we're Medford Pride.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=903.907">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=904.924">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=906.465">And</a>  it sounds like there are a lot of great local businesses and small businesses that are involved in some of your events and the library sounds like has a big role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=913.49">I</a>  think too, like what comes to mind when like not just like the advertisement for some of these corporations, but also what's how are they actually supporting queer people? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=923.257">Is</a>  it just like a performance for the month of June? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=925.299">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=926.52">And</a>  I think also a criticism I could be totally wrong of Boston Pride was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=931.383">safety</a>  for BIPOC people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=932.866">So</a>  like the presence of police and things like that, how that created less of a safe space for lots of people that needed to be included in PRIDE. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=941.259">And</a>  so yeah, I guess I wonder if that brings anything else to mind for you all.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=947.619">Yeah,</a>  I wanted to also just add into what Michael said, and what we were saying in terms, this isn't something I had anything to do with but the leadership of the Medford pride planning committee has multiple people of color so it is not simply a matter of just a bunch of white people, even though Medford is probably almost 90% white. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=966.249">I</a>  think it's between 80 and 90 I'm not sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=971.072">We</a>  do have three people of color in our planning committee, and Frances is the one who picked the group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=979.459">So</a>  France, in terms of your safety concern, that's something Frances has been pretty vocal about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=984.623">And</a>  I know she's talked to the police a lot and she understands that for certain events, we may need to have a police presence because of blocking off roads and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=993.03">But</a>  she does want the people who are attending to feel safe and not feel intimidated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1000.026">Michael,</a>  you might remember the term she used, I'm not sure, but she said she wanted to de-emphasize the police or somehow integrate them in a way that was less intimidating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1009.431">Do</a>  you remember the term, or Joan?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1012.153">I</a>  don't remember the term, but I won't forget the chief of police escorting Gigi Gill down the stairway from Medford City Hall to the flag raising, and in his regular street clothes, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1025.838">So</a>  that to me spoke volumes about how they are de-emphasized as a police force, but still there to celebrate.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1036.626">And</a>  for our listeners, Gigi Gill is a six foot five drag queen.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1042.65">Without</a>  heels.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1044.831">And</a>  the police chief was not, I think the police chief was not in uniform for that either, right?</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1048.254">He</a>  was not in uniform, he was in street clothes, yes.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1052.196">Lucy,</a>  did you want to add something?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1055.085">Yeah,</a>  I'm saying you kind of already said this but not only do we have diversity in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1062.329">I</a>  mean the committee, but we also look for diversity in our performers and people who are going to be there and businesses that are supporting the events, and we're very <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1075.115">very</a>  like strict on protection wise because we don't want to risk anything bad, any of the events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1082.197">So</a>  we've already covered safety for the most part, Francis has been on top of that the entire time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1090.34">And</a>  I don't know, I am very excited for these events.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1096.282">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1097.563">Oh,</a>  I guess I'll give my two cents on on safety and police pride as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1102.348">I</a>  will say I was happy with I was comfortable with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1108.728">at</a>  least so far the presence of with, you know, with the chief of police escorting Gigi. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1113.832">I</a>  thought that was cute. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1115.073">That</a>  was nice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1117.554">I</a>  am personally, as a, again, as a person of color, I am wildly uncomfortable around police officers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1125.32">I</a>  strongly believe that police should not be at pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1128.002">I</a>  also, you know, I don't want to see a rainbow cruiser. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1131.464">It's</a>  not, you know, I don't think that's necessary personally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1136.538">maybe</a>  a little bit more aggressive than others in the group, that's fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1139.159">That</a>  is just my view on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1141.36">So,</a>  so far, I like it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1142.841">So</a>  far, it's, you know, I think we're doing a good job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1147.603">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1150.945">I'll</a>  say one thing about the corporations or police. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1155.567">The</a>  one side that I always think about is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1158.035">And</a>  I'm older than all of you here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1160.958">But</a>  I remember a time when I worked in a corporation where it was not okay to be out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1166.222">And</a>  I think that there's space for people that work at a company, for a city, for a store, whatever, to show that they can now be out and be proud about who they are in that corporate space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1180.241">So</a>  I think that there's a little carve out there and to see, you know, a gay police officer or, you know, whatever that to me, I always think about the days that everybody was in the closet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1190.986">So</a>  that's just my interpretation.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1194.868">Yeah,</a>  no, I, a hundred percent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1196.749">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1197.409">And</a>  I guess that's the thing too, is, you know, it isn't just as black and white as that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1201.571">Obviously</a>  there are queer people in, you know, police and fire and everything, all the services like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1206.554">I</a>  think it's more of a, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1210.079">I</a>  would say it's more of a comment on the current tension, right, the current tension between the queer community between the, the black and brown community and and police in general I think is more of the comment, I guess I'm making then, in general. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1227.974">Yeah,</a>  because I'm not, I guess I'm not trying to be exclusive of queer folks in those groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1234.998">But</a>  just wanted to bring a point to, you know, a level of me as a non-white queer person having a certain way, having a certain feeling towards that group, even in a safe space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1251.548">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1254.847">So</a>  I'll just add one thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1256.608">So</a>  everything everyone said is great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1259.168">I</a>  love these perspectives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1260.549">I</a>  just wanted to mention or just remind us that Pride originally was a fight with the police. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1268.011">So</a>  it started because the police in New York City were oppressing gay people kind of based on the pseudo legal thing where they were just going and harassing people at the bars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1278.253">So</a>  I think, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1280.856">In</a>  terms of pride and queer people, police presence is extra charged. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1284.902">And</a>  so I think that's just something to be sensitive about.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1288.648">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1292.202">So</a>  we said it a few times, you know, you all have had six weeks to plan, I'm assuming next time, you'll have more time, you'll start before April. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1300.751">But</a>  I think I'm wondering, like sort of how you hope the celebration, the parties, the sort of visibility of queer people in Medford this month, like how you hope that'll impact the city moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1314.665">So</a>  right now, we're <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1316.895">you</a>  know, six weeks into planning a celebration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1320.321">So</a>  it's more about party planning right now, but we're all thinking, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1326.641">in</a>  the future when the last event in the month of June occurs, how can we take the momentum of what was the pride committee and the discussions that we opened and the communications that we had and relationships that we built and how can we take that and parlay it into talking about the issues that still exist in the city of Medford around LGBTQ plus safety and Black Lives Matter and people of colors failing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1357.389">feeling</a>  safe, you know, what can we do to advance the conversations, how can we use Medford Pride and the momentum that we have to sort of advance those conversations, and, you know, maybe heal some wounds, improve some processes, and that kind of thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1370.078">We</a>  haven't gotten to that point yet, since we're so new, but that is something that we've grappled ourselves in our own pride planning committee meetings, you know, so.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1382.145">I</a>  can go next. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1383.707">I</a>  guess I would like to see a more geographically inclusive Pride next time when we have more time, where we actually cover <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1397.723">I</a>  would like to see us have at least one event in West Medford you know events kind of all around the city, instead of just centered in this the city center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1407.053">I</a>  mean the city center is great and I guess it's centrally located but i'd love to see more events kind of spanning out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1414.34">And,</a>  of course, we would have more we would have more time, so we could really invest more time into researching sponsors and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1419.855">making</a>  sure that the people who are supporting us are people that are, we would like to encourage them to be people who will support us will support the LGBTQ community in general, and not just for the pride events.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1435.929">I</a>  guess I'll go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1439.17">What</a>  I hope to see in the future is like Sayan said, I hope there is events spread out more instead of all congregated in the same region so that more people can attend and easily get there and it won't be such a hassle for people to attend these events so that it can be more friendly to people in the outer areas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1463.145">Um,</a>  I also want to see more kids being proud have pride, because that's what the event is for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1472.488">And</a>  I want them to kind of not be embarrassed because there's a lot of kids in school who are embarrassed to show their pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1482.229">And</a>  it's sad, so I hope that these events encourage them to be proud of who they are and to not be afraid to show it.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1499.459">Again,</a>  echoing wider spread, geographically speaking, I would love that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1506.563">I</a>  would love to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1510.592">in</a>  the non-Pride months, I would love to see businesses reaching out to the community or showing the community somehow that we support, it's a safe place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1525.285">Does</a>  that mean they have a little flyer in the window with a Pride flag? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1528.388">Maybe</a>  it's as simple as that, who knows, but just something to continue the conversation and continue pushing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1536.532">That,</a>  you know, safe spaces are everywhere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1540.173">And,</a>  you know, we don't have to be afraid to walk into a business because there's a particular political sticker in the window, you know, am I going to walk in and get accosted assaulted something, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1553.938">So</a>  yeah, again, kind of echoing what john was saying is we're, we're still mid, you know, mid to the first time we're ever doing this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1561.882">So</a>  we're kind of just taking notes and we'll get to it and hopefully tackle it and do something good with it after we're after we're done this month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1570.726">So</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1572.38">One</a>  of the things that I recall that happened at a place I used to work at was when this question came up, and exactly to your point, Michael, you never knew whose office you were going to walk into and whether or not they were going to be friendly to you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1587.21">And</a>  they created this You Are Welcome Here campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1591.152">And</a>  they had little cards that everybody got to put outside their office, you know, and just to let people know that you were welcome here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1598.895">And</a>  I thought it was a great way to walk around and feel like I am welcome here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1604.437">I'm</a>  not just welcome in my own office, but I'm welcoming yours and I'm welcoming yours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1608.559">And</a>  I think that's a great idea to do at the Medford businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1612.08">So</a>  I'm taking notes.</p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00075_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1617.406">I</a>  will just add a couple things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1618.667">So</a>  I wanted to add on to what Michael said. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1620.267">I</a>  love the idea of having, and Joan, having these stickers that welcome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1624.569">And</a>  on the contrary side, I would love these businesses to take down the stickers that I find kind of somewhat hostile and off-putting, like, for example, the thin blue line flags, which to me feels anti-Black. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1639.956">white</a>  supremacy, and I don't really feel super comfortable with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1643.817">So</a>  that might be another aspect of the campaign would be to get them to take it down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1649.038">And</a>  I also wanted to mention, I went to trans pride event yesterday, which was by the trans emergency fund. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1655.66">And</a>  I would love to see us have one event where we're fundraising for some organization that's going to help people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1662.961">And</a>  I would love to see something like trans emergency, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1667.456">fund</a>  doing an event with us because they are supporting trans people and often trans people of color. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1673.497">And</a>  because of the intersections of racism and anti-queerness, they're some of the most vulnerable people in this whole country. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1681.819">And</a>  I think that's something I think about a lot is trans people of color and how much they suffer under all the oppression of both patriarchy, anti-queerness and racism or white supremacy.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1698.196">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1698.436">It</a>  sounds like we're having a mini planning session right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1701.619">And</a>  not to undercut any of the, you're all doing amazing work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1704.582">And</a>  it was really impressive to be at the events that have happened so far and it makes me excited for what's to come.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1711.408">Anybody</a>  else, any other comments or anything else you want to make sure we mentioned before we wrap up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1719.976">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1720.977">I</a>  look forward to seeing you all at some more of these events.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1734.615">Thanks</a>  so much to Sian, Joan, Lucy, and Michael, as well as the rest of the pride planning committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1740.759">Thanks</a>  so much for listening to today's episode. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1742.68">And</a>  as always, if you have feedback about this episode or ideas for future episodes, you can email medfordpod at gmail.com. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1749.884">You</a>  can also subscribe, rate, and review the podcast on Spotify and Apple podcasts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1754.827">Thanks</a>  so much for listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1762.158">Guys,</a>  what's the name of the podcast? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c83F2VE38zCmBvg3ig97W?t=1763.789">Never</a>  Bites!</p>
