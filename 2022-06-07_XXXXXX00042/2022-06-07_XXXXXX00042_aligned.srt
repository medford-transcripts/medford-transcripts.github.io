00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:05,543

Hope you enjoy.

7
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,977
All right, thank you all for joining me today.

8
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,599
I'm here again with Chelly as my co-host.

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,921
Hi, it's Chelly here.

10
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:51,663
But if you all could introduce yourselves with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:54,597 --> 00:01:01,224
Sure, so I'm cyan my pronouns are they them, I've been on binary identified since I was in my late teens.

12
00:01:02,386 --> 00:01:10,214
I moved to Boston around 2000 and the primary reason I moved to Boston was because I thought it was just a more queer friendly trans friendly place.

13
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:14,638
and have lived in a number of different cities here, Somerville, Arlington.

14
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,039
I moved to Medford in 2007.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,843
I was not excited about moving to Medford, I gotta say.

16
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:24,266
I was a little apprehensive, but I was pleasantly surprised.

17
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:29,590
I did not receive any, I did not really have any problems here.

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,996
I've observed a couple racial things that I've seen, but I haven't seen any anti-LGBTQ issues.

19
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:43,021
incidents, other than of course the Southern Baptist Church signs, which are whatever they're fine.

20
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:51,567
And I was really interested to join the Medford pride planning committee because after spending two years in a pandemic and working from home, the entire time.

21
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,236
Because I work in tech.

22
00:01:54,117 --> 00:02:04,928
I haven't had a lot of as much social interactions that was like, as I would like and I think you know that was just some way to make me feel engaged and hopefully make make Medford a better more welcoming place.

23
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,215
I never found it to be extremely welcoming but I didn't find it to be hostile and for me that was like a good.

24
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:21,768
being not queer hostile was actually very, was nice, you know, like for a place I have to live and I'm walking around carrying parasol and dressed flamboyantly or whatever.

25
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,310
And I'll leave it at that.

26
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,195
So my name is Joan Cyr, I go by she, her.

27
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:35,654
Been in Medford since 1999 and came by way of Malden and Cambridge, born and raised in Cambridge.

28
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:47,017
So I think I came to the PRIDE committee because I was actually on the PRIDE planning Facebook group before it became the Medford PRIDE committee.

29
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:51,758
And we were working with a small group trying to figure out what could we do for PRIDE this year.

30
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:58,120
So since I had already been on that team, I threw my hat into the ring for the Medford PRIDE committee.

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,402
I'm also a member of the Medford Community Preservation Committee.

32
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:08,185
So I have a little bit of information about how to kind of work things through the city.

33
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:21,753
And I was happy to see that Medford was going to try to throw their own pride committee plan after, you know, the Boston Pride sort of dissolved over the pandemic.

34
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,614
So happy to be here.

35
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:26,215
I think, Lucy, you're next.

36
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:35,003
Hi, I'm Lucy Rodriguez, and I go by she her.

37
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:47,952
I joined the pride committee, because I thought that there should be things to do for people in younger generations.

38
00:03:49,906 --> 00:04:04,131
Um, so people who are younger have different interests and I thought it would be good to have someone representing them in the committee with similar interests, because it would be easier to relate to them.

39
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:12,294
And I have identified as bisexual since fourth grade.

40
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,615
And I've lived in Medford for

41
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,074
my entire lifespan, so 14 years.

42
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:26,215
Hey there, so I'm Michael Lowe, they, them pronouns.

43
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:28,956
Grew up in Burlington, Massachusetts.

44
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:35,438
We've been living in Medford for about either six or seven years at this point.

45
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,880
Here in Medford, I run a queer screen printing art collective called Triangle Manor.

46
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,341
with nine other artists around New England.

47
00:04:48,402 --> 00:05:00,326
I also am on the board of directors for a nonprofit organization called Anthro New England, which is currently about a 3,000 person yearly convention in the anthropomorphic community.

48
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:02,767
We raise a bunch of money for local charities.

49
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:10,510
I got interested in the Medford Pride Committee

50
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:23,131
I was actually recommended to me by somebody at the Unitarian Universalist group who thought that I might be a good fit and sent me the way of the, you know, the application.

51
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:37,036
And I thought about it a bit and realized I would like to, you know, as a person of color, I would like to make sure that there is representation for, you know, black and brown people as much as possible.

52
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,756
And, you know, as someone who is,

53
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:48,858
also queer, I, I don't know, I just want to, I want to make sure that we are as open and welcoming as possible as a city.

54
00:05:48,918 --> 00:06:05,041
And, you know, having seen a good handful of local politics, I want to make sure that we as a community move towards inclusiveness in a way from kind of being comfortable and conservative.

55
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:09,182
Yeah, and that's, that's it.

56
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:11,016
Thank you all.

57
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:14,239
You jumped ahead a little bit to answer the why question about the pride committee.

58
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,320
So I appreciate that.

59
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,124
I do always ask the same question though, folks.

60
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:25,512
So if anyone would like to answer their favorite place to eat in Medford and what they like to eat there, Joan, I know you're ready to go.

61
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:26,892
I'm ready to go.

62
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:31,313
I actually my answer to almost every question I'm a Libra is it depends.

63
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:32,893
So here's my list.

64
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:33,494
It depends.

65
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,334
If it's Asian, say bar.

66
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:43,676
If it's a burger, snappy patties, pizza for pizza or real gusto, ice cream, Colleen's sandwich, Colleen's.

67
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,436
They have the best BLT.

68
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:46,696
If you haven't tried it, try it.

69
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:51,717
Entree, semolinas, fish and chips, iris better than legals.

70
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:52,457
Try it.

71
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,818
Baked goods collects, of course.

72
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:56,575
That's my list.

73
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:57,636
Thank you.

74
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:58,457
So comprehensive.

75
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:03,340
And I appreciate that, the variety, because I think everybody has a hard time choosing one place.

76
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:04,961
Anybody else want to share?

77
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,717
I would have to say I have two.

78
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,101
Zamzam in Medford Square, astounding.

79
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:19,865
I just had some lamb biryani for lunch, so very good.

80
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:21,686
Also, Tenoch.

81
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,931
They make amazing tortas.

82
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:30,554
The torta campechana is always the one I go for.

83
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,356
So yeah, those are my recommendations.

84
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:34,937
Thank you.

85
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,599
Anyone else?

86
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:44,568
All right, so I know you haven't had a lot of time to plan the events for Pride.

87
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,131
Last week, we had the flag raising and the drag show.

88
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:53,154
And there was an interfaith service, I think, on the first.

89
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:54,955
Great.

90
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:59,958
So I want to give you some time to talk about what we can expect from the rest of the month, what you all are excited about.

91
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:10,840
Well, um, let's see next week we tried to plan to have at least one event every week during the month of June.

92
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:23,404
So next week on the ninth, which is Thursday we have a queer art show at the UU church 6 to 9pm and transgender 101 that's being put on by the method public library at the library seven to nine.

93
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:32,148
The following week on the 17th, there's an LGBTQ plus story hour hosted by Book Wonder at Four Good Vibes, that's at 11.

94
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:37,712
And then a dance, skate, and mingle party at City Hall in the parking lot in front, 730 to 930.

95
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:44,096
The following week on Tuesday, PrideZine workshop for teens at the Medford Public Library, 3 to 5.

96
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:57,860
On the 24th, Friday Lindsay Monroe sings at the Medford public library that's for young kids at 330 and then the main event will be on Sunday, June 26 the celebration at Andrews field from one to six.

97
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,504
Just to clarify, thank you, Joan, that was a perfect comprehensive list.

98
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:20,099
So we do have, as she kind of mentioned, we do have events for both young children, middle-aged teens, middle-aged children, and we also have some all ages events.

99
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,043
And as you mentioned before, we did have one 18 plus event, which was the drag.

100
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:31,269
and dinner show because we wanted the drag queens to be able to express themselves, the drag performers to be able to express themselves as needed.

101
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:42,518
So the two events for young children are the drag story hour, LGBTQ story hour, Friday the 17th, and the 24th, which is Lindsay Monroe sings, which John already mentioned.

102
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:48,422
And the teen event is really the 18th, which is that dance party that we're having, 7.30 to 9.30.

103
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:51,585
And then the other events, everything else we have is all ages.

104
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:57,291
Oh, and the teen, there's also a teen zine thing at the library too.

105
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:57,971
Sorry, forgot that.

106
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:01,574
Thank you.

107
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,977
That's a, that's a whole bunch of stuff that you guys got, you all got together.

108
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:22,283
Michael, I think you mentioned in your introduction this goal of like thinking about how Medford Pride could sort of separate itself or like distinguish itself from Boston Pride and sort of all the trouble there and the reason that we're not having a Boston Pride this year.

109
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,945
I wonder if any of you could speak to that a little bit.

110
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,089
I will happily speak to it.

111
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,589
Joan, were you going to say something?

112
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,910
No, I was waiting for Michael.

113
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:36,332
Michael, did you want to start?

114
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:44,158
Honestly, I would say, go ahead, Cyan, and I will jump on afterwards.

115
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,300
OK, sure.

116
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,043
So just to recap for people who don't understand, I had to research it and remember myself.

117
00:10:51,124 --> 00:11:01,932
So the Boston Pride planning commit, the Boston Pride organization, I forget exactly what they're called, they kind of imploded in 2020 because they had long been getting criticism for

118
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:07,176
not including trans people in their leadership, not including people of color in their leadership.

119
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:15,064
It was basically a bunch of, I think, white, gay, and lesbian folks, for the most part, who were leading the organization.

120
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,628
And they also got criticism for too much corporate sponsorship.

121
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,391
I noticed from going to the pride parades from 2001 to

122
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:33,559
You know, 2018 or so that they changed a lot that many of the floats that came through were just a bunch of people in T shirts for whatever bank or corporation.

123
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,662
And that was definitely less exciting pride parade.

124
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:46,368
So what happened in 2020 as far as I understood it is that because of the resurgence of Black Lives Matter and the importance of racial equity.

125
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:50,029
these calls for change became much stronger.

126
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,349
And rather than change, they just decided to dissolve.

127
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:57,430
I think probably COVID played a part too, because it was very difficult to manage during that time.

128
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,730
So I don't know all the full details, but just to recap it quickly.

129
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:15,213
So I think, you know, coming into this, because I have a very strong anti-racist interest and passion for diversity, I wanted to make sure that we were going to be inclusive of people of color, of trans people.

130
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:23,700
And I think that's one way we want to differentiate ourselves and I also wanted us to be very careful about who you're accepting for sponsorship.

131
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:32,408
We did talk about that a little as as maybe was mentioned before it was kind of a mad rush because we only had six weeks to plan so we didn't really have the time to do a lot of.

132
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:35,044
But we did.

133
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,329
I'm, I'm on the same page as what Michael said we didn't want.

134
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:49,446
We didn't want a lot of Michael said this previously to me, we didn't want a lot of corporate floats and stuff like that we didn't want it to be a corporate event where we're primarily promoting corporations.

135
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:57,630
I'm totally for promoting small businesses, to, to a small degree, like, you know, mentioning that they sponsored an event or so on.

136
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,052
But I didn't want this to be an advertisement for big corporations for sure.

137
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:08,335
So for me that was one that was, those were some of the ways and, and in our drag event that we had.

138
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:12,157
we specifically made sure that we had drag performers of different kinds.

139
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:13,758
We didn't have just white drag queens.

140
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,900
We had drag kings, we had drag things.

141
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,801
That's kind of what one of them calls themselves.

142
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:28,586
I'm not saying that in a derogatory way, but we had people who were kind of gender non-binary in between drag performers, and we had drag queens, and we had people of different colors.

143
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:33,249
And I think it was a great performance and pretty inclusive of how our performances went.

144
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,110
So Michael, I'll hand it to you.

145
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,877
Yeah, and so I guess specifically to talk about kind of.

146
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:43,557
the corporate sponsorship end of things.

147
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:51,659
I have a strong belief, and as Sayan said as well, I just don't want to see a big bank float.

148
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,240
I don't want some financial firm to be hucking t-shirts at me at a parade, right?

149
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:04,802
If they want to give us money and support our small community, great, but you're not getting representation because you're not queer.

150
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,183
You're not, you know,

151
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,764
you're not there to be seen right now, right?

152
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:15,145
This is a month for the queer community, not for TD Bank or whomever.

153
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:16,386
It's irrelevant who it is.

154
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,907
In terms of small businesses, you know what?

155
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,588
Yeah, that's who I want to be supporting our community.

156
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:33,511
I would love a bunch of local restaurants, local businesses to be like, yep, you know, this pizza shop and that tax accounting firm in Medford, they've been here for 15 years.

157
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:38,733
you know, they paid for this thing, they did that, and we recognize them and say, thank you.

158
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:53,841
You know, that's what I want to, that's my view of a successful kind of sponsorship thing is, is small groups working with other small groups to, you know, make it happen, basically.

159
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,563
So yeah, that's, that's all I got to say on that.

160
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:02,446
I guess we're not Boston Pride, we're Medford Pride.

161
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:04,287
Exactly.

162
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:05,965
Yeah.

163
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:06,305
Yeah.

164
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:13,110
And it sounds like there are a lot of great local businesses and small businesses that are involved in some of your events and the library sounds like has a big role.

165
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:23,197
I think too, like what comes to mind when like not just like the advertisement for some of these corporations, but also what's how are they actually supporting queer people?

166
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,279
Is it just like a performance for the month of June?

167
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,099
Right.

168
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,402
And I think also a criticism I could be totally wrong of Boston Pride was

169
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,826
safety for BIPOC people.

170
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:40,718
So like the presence of police and things like that, how that created less of a safe space for lots of people that needed to be included in PRIDE.

171
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:46,247
And so yeah, I guess I wonder if that brings anything else to mind for you all.

172
00:15:47,619 --> 00:16:06,189
Yeah, I wanted to also just add into what Michael said, and what we were saying in terms, this isn't something I had anything to do with but the leadership of the Medford pride planning committee has multiple people of color so it is not simply a matter of just a bunch of white people, even though Medford is probably almost 90% white.

173
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,310
I think it's between 80 and 90 I'm not sure.

174
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:18,678
We do have three people of color in our planning committee, and Frances is the one who picked the group.

175
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,503
So France, in terms of your safety concern, that's something Frances has been pretty vocal about.

176
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:32,589
And I know she's talked to the police a lot and she understands that for certain events, we may need to have a police presence because of blocking off roads and stuff like that.

177
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,134
But she does want the people who are attending to feel safe and not feel intimidated.

178
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:48,911
Michael, you might remember the term she used, I'm not sure, but she said she wanted to de-emphasize the police or somehow integrate them in a way that was less intimidating.

179
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,592
Do you remember the term, or Joan?

180
00:16:52,153 --> 00:17:05,180
I don't remember the term, but I won't forget the chief of police escorting Gigi Gill down the stairway from Medford City Hall to the flag raising, and in his regular street clothes,

181
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:15,325
So that to me spoke volumes about how they are de-emphasized as a police force, but still there to celebrate.

182
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:21,349
And for our listeners, Gigi Gill is a six foot five drag queen.

183
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,131
Without heels.

184
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:28,234
And the police chief was not, I think the police chief was not in uniform for that either, right?

185
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,355
He was not in uniform, he was in street clothes, yes.

186
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:33,217
Lucy, did you want to add something?

187
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:42,309
Yeah, I'm saying you kind of already said this but not only do we have diversity in the community.

188
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:53,855
I mean the committee, but we also look for diversity in our performers and people who are going to be there and businesses that are supporting the events, and we're very

189
00:17:55,115 --> 00:18:01,617
very like strict on protection wise because we don't want to risk anything bad, any of the events.

190
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:09,000
So we've already covered safety for the most part, Francis has been on top of that the entire time.

191
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,221
And I don't know, I am very excited for these events.

192
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:16,562
Thank you.

193
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,828
Oh, I guess I'll give my two cents on on safety and police pride as well.

194
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:27,334
I will say I was happy with I was comfortable with

195
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:33,732
at least so far the presence of with, you know, with the chief of police escorting Gigi.

196
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,053
I thought that was cute.

197
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:35,633
That was nice.

198
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:45,260
I am personally, as a, again, as a person of color, I am wildly uncomfortable around police officers.

199
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,982
I strongly believe that police should not be at pride.

200
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,244
I also, you know, I don't want to see a rainbow cruiser.

201
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,326
It's not, you know, I don't think that's necessary personally.

202
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,119
maybe a little bit more aggressive than others in the group, that's fine.

203
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,720
That is just my view on it.

204
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,741
So, so far, I like it.

205
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,883
So far, it's, you know, I think we're doing a good job.

206
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:08,444
So, yeah.

207
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:13,906
I'll say one thing about the corporations or police.

208
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,428
The one side that I always think about is

209
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,117
And I'm older than all of you here.

210
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,121
But I remember a time when I worked in a corporation where it was not okay to be out.

211
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:39,774
And I think that there's space for people that work at a company, for a city, for a store, whatever, to show that they can now be out and be proud about who they are in that corporate space.

212
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:50,786
So I think that there's a little carve out there and to see, you know, a gay police officer or, you know, whatever that to me, I always think about the days that everybody was in the closet.

213
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:53,487
So that's just my interpretation.

214
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,329
Yeah, no, I, a hundred percent.

215
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:57,389
I understand that.

216
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:01,531
And I guess that's the thing too, is, you know, it isn't just as black and white as that.

217
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:06,533
Obviously there are queer people in, you know, police and fire and everything, all the services like that.

218
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:08,574
I think it's more of a,

219
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:25,294
I would say it's more of a comment on the current tension, right, the current tension between the queer community between the, the black and brown community and and police in general I think is more of the comment, I guess I'm making then, in general.

220
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:33,197
Yeah, because I'm not, I guess I'm not trying to be exclusive of queer folks in those groups.

221
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:50,648
But just wanted to bring a point to, you know, a level of me as a non-white queer person having a certain way, having a certain feeling towards that group, even in a safe space.

222
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,229
So, yeah.

223
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:56,568
So I'll just add one thing.

224
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,908
So everything everyone said is great.

225
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,148
I love these perspectives.

226
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:07,510
I just wanted to mention or just remind us that Pride originally was a fight with the police.

227
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:17,653
So it started because the police in New York City were oppressing gay people kind of based on the pseudo legal thing where they were just going and harassing people at the bars.

228
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,914
So I think, you know,

229
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:24,882
In terms of pride and queer people, police presence is extra charged.

230
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:28,628
And so I think that's just something to be sensitive about.

231
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:31,052
Thank you.

232
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:40,290
So we said it a few times, you know, you all have had six weeks to plan, I'm assuming next time, you'll have more time, you'll start before April.

233
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:51,942
But I think I'm wondering, like sort of how you hope the celebration, the parties, the sort of visibility of queer people in Medford this month, like how you hope that'll impact the city moving forward.

234
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,986
So right now, we're

235
00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:00,120
you know, six weeks into planning a celebration.

236
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:06,071
So it's more about party planning right now, but we're all thinking, you know,

237
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:36,348
in the future when the last event in the month of June occurs, how can we take the momentum of what was the pride committee and the discussions that we opened and the communications that we had and relationships that we built and how can we take that and parlay it into talking about the issues that still exist in the city of Medford around LGBTQ plus safety and Black Lives Matter and people of colors failing

238
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:49,838
feeling safe, you know, what can we do to advance the conversations, how can we use Medford Pride and the momentum that we have to sort of advance those conversations, and, you know, maybe heal some wounds, improve some processes, and that kind of thing.

239
00:22:50,078 --> 00:23:00,025
We haven't gotten to that point yet, since we're so new, but that is something that we've grappled ourselves in our own pride planning committee meetings, you know, so.

240
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:03,266
I can go next.

241
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:15,783
I guess I would like to see a more geographically inclusive Pride next time when we have more time, where we actually cover

242
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:26,632
I would like to see us have at least one event in West Medford you know events kind of all around the city, instead of just centered in this the city center.

243
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:33,259
I mean the city center is great and I guess it's centrally located but i'd love to see more events kind of spanning out.

244
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,385
And, of course, we would have more we would have more time, so we could really invest more time into researching sponsors and.

245
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:51,770
making sure that the people who are supporting us are people that are, we would like to encourage them to be people who will support us will support the LGBTQ community in general, and not just for the pride events.

246
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,209
I guess I'll go.

247
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:21,840
What I hope to see in the future is like Sayan said, I hope there is events spread out more instead of all congregated in the same region so that more people can attend and easily get there and it won't be such a hassle for people to attend these events so that it can be more friendly to people in the outer areas.

248
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:31,707
Um, I also want to see more kids being proud have pride, because that's what the event is for.

249
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:41,010
And I want them to kind of not be embarrassed because there's a lot of kids in school who are embarrassed to show their pride.

250
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:53,115
And it's sad, so I hope that these events encourage them to be proud of who they are and to not be afraid to show it.

251
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:04,322
Again, echoing wider spread, geographically speaking, I would love that.

252
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:07,404
I would love to

253
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:24,464
in the non-Pride months, I would love to see businesses reaching out to the community or showing the community somehow that we support, it's a safe place.

254
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,907
Does that mean they have a little flyer in the window with a Pride flag?

255
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:34,353
Maybe it's as simple as that, who knows, but just something to continue the conversation and continue pushing

256
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:38,993
That, you know, safe spaces are everywhere.

257
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:51,957
And, you know, we don't have to be afraid to walk into a business because there's a particular political sticker in the window, you know, am I going to walk in and get accosted assaulted something, you know.

258
00:25:53,938 --> 00:26:01,822
So yeah, again, kind of echoing what john was saying is we're, we're still mid, you know, mid to the first time we're ever doing this.

259
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:10,366
So we're kind of just taking notes and we'll get to it and hopefully tackle it and do something good with it after we're after we're done this month.

260
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:10,786
So

261
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:26,449
One of the things that I recall that happened at a place I used to work at was when this question came up, and exactly to your point, Michael, you never knew whose office you were going to walk into and whether or not they were going to be friendly to you.

262
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,252
And they created this You Are Welcome Here campaign.

263
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:38,795
And they had little cards that everybody got to put outside their office, you know, and just to let people know that you were welcome here.

264
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:44,297
And I thought it was a great way to walk around and feel like I am welcome here.

265
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:48,499
I'm not just welcome in my own office, but I'm welcoming yours and I'm welcoming yours.

266
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,060
And I think that's a great idea to do at the Medford businesses.

267
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,101
So I'm taking notes.

268
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:58,647
I will just add a couple things.

269
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,247
So I wanted to add on to what Michael said.

270
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,949
I love the idea of having, and Joan, having these stickers that welcome.

271
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:18,736
And on the contrary side, I would love these businesses to take down the stickers that I find kind of somewhat hostile and off-putting, like, for example, the thin blue line flags, which to me feels anti-Black.

272
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:23,717
white supremacy, and I don't really feel super comfortable with that.

273
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:28,518
So that might be another aspect of the campaign would be to get them to take it down.

274
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:35,079
And I also wanted to mention, I went to trans pride event yesterday, which was by the trans emergency fund.

275
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,861
And I would love to see us have one event where we're fundraising for some organization that's going to help people.

276
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,302
And I would love to see something like trans emergency,

277
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:53,357
fund doing an event with us because they are supporting trans people and often trans people of color.

278
00:27:53,497 --> 00:28:01,699
And because of the intersections of racism and anti-queerness, they're some of the most vulnerable people in this whole country.

279
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:15,161
And I think that's something I think about a lot is trans people of color and how much they suffer under all the oppression of both patriarchy, anti-queerness and racism or white supremacy.

280
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:18,416
Thank you.

281
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:21,379
It sounds like we're having a mini planning session right now.

282
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:24,542
And not to undercut any of the, you're all doing amazing work.

283
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:29,887
And it was really impressive to be at the events that have happened so far and it makes me excited for what's to come.

284
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:35,031
Anybody else, any other comments or anything else you want to make sure we mentioned before we wrap up?

285
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:40,757
Thank you so much.

286
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:44,300
I look forward to seeing you all at some more of these events.

287
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:59,238
Thanks so much to Sian, Joan, Lucy, and Michael, as well as the rest of the pride planning committee.

288
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,540
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
