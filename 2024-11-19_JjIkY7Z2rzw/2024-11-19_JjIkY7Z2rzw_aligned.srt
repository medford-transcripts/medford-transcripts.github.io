I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

16
00:00:42,852 --> 00:01:01,278

This is a public hearing.

32
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,157
I opened this part up.

33
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,778
Are you in favor of this project?

34
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:16,758
Yes, Mr. President.

35
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:17,558
Thank you very much.

36
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,839
Is there anyone else in favor of this?

37
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:22,080
Excuse me, name and address of the record, sir.

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,662
Frank Marinelli, I'm an attorney representing the Herb Chambers Companies.

39
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,923
My office address is 439 Washington Street,

40
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:30,557
Braintree, Massachusetts.

41
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:30,977
Thank you.

42
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,618
Is there anyone else in favor of this?

43
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,119
Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of the hearing.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,922
Is there anyone in opposition to this hearing?

45
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:46,124
Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of the hearing.

46
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:49,106
Good evening, sir.

47
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:53,588
If you could give us a brief synopsis of your plans.

48
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:54,769
Yes, Mr. President.

49
00:03:55,942 --> 00:04:01,063
I'm pleased to appear on behalf of the Herb Chambers Companies and Herb Chambers BMW of Medford.

50
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:07,985
By way of background, Herb Chambers started the company approximately 35 years ago.

51
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,005
The company is privately owned by Mr. Chambers.

52
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:13,326
It has grown to about 60 dealerships.

53
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,726
We employ approximately 2,000 people.

54
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:24,508
The property at 60 Mystic Avenue, as you know, was formerly Yorkia, and then when it was acquired by the Chambers Companies,

55
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,564
It became Herb Chambers Infinity.

56
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:33,546
And now we would like to bring a luxury brand, Herb Chambers BMW pre-owned to Medford.

57
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:41,888
It is an approximate $5 million investment, $4 million approximately in the construction that is ongoing since January.

58
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:46,009
The building is situated on about two and a half acres of land.

59
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,250
It's an over 17,000 square foot building.

60
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,551
We're adding on approximately 5,400

61
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:58,144
which would increase the service capacity of the building and also have pre-owned sales.

62
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:07,589
With me on Zoom is John Welch, who is the Director of Construction and Facilities for the Herb Chambers Companies.

63
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:19,395
The Herb Chambers Companies just don't open dealerships and acquire dealerships, but they assiduously maintain their dealerships, as you know, with the cleanliness and the appearance of all of the dealerships.

64
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,996
is in charge of that aspect from the company, from the corporate offices.

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,817
He's happy to answer any questions you might have.

66
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:33,279
Also on the Zoom is Casey Richenberg, who's the director of fixed operations.

67
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,780
As you know, Mr. President, the building is currently vacant.

68
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:45,282
And when we reopen, there'll be approximately 30 jobs between sales and service.

69
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:47,043
We would like to commend

70
00:05:47,696 --> 00:06:04,890
the officials for the city of Medford that we've been working with from the building department to the DPW to the water and in my own instance with the city clerk's office during COVID attempting to get a hearing scheduled and in particular Jan Grogan who we work with.

71
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,437
So we really appreciate the collaboration of all of the municipal officials and of course the city council.

72
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,183
We're happy to answer any questions.

73
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:24,088
There's a rendering of the way the facility will appear when we finish all of the construction.

74
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:42,298
It meets the BMW manufacturer requirements for branding and for the look of the building that the particular automotive manufacturer wants, in this case, the luxury brand BMW.

75
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:43,219
Thank you.

76
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:44,656
Councilor Felco.

77
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:45,997
Thank you, Mr. President.

78
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,918
Thank you for opening a business here in Medford.

79
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,159
A couple of quick questions.

80
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,500
Do you have the hours of operation?

81
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:55,961
Yes, I do.

82
00:06:56,301 --> 00:07:02,204
The hours of operation are service in part 7 a.m.

83
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,044
to 7 p.m.

84
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,585
Monday through Friday.

85
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,806
Saturday, 7 a.m.

86
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:07,866
to 5 p.m.

87
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,047
Sunday, there'll be no service.

88
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,268
On the sales side,

89
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,559
8.30 to 8 p.m., 8.30 a.m.

90
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,299
to 8 p.m.

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,926
Monday through Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 8.30 to 6 p.m., and Sunday 11 to 5 on sales.

92
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:34,692
And as far as, I'm looking at the paperwork for the next hearing to, will you be servicing vehicles at this facility?

93
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,454
Yes, so that's, I'm glad you asked the question.

94
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:40,837
The applications are for, number one, a class two,

95
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:47,050
which allows the pre-owned motor vehicles to be sold, and then a class four repair shop.

96
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,792
The addition provides a total of about 13 repair bays.

97
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:59,976
And then the storage license that we asked for is for fresh oil and waste oil.

98
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,757
John can explain that, John Welch.

99
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,498
That'll be on the next part.

100
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,599
Yeah, we have a fluids room and so forth.

101
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:16,003
for that, and I think the final thing was a special permit that the building inspector requested because when you issue a special permit, it goes with a particular user of the site.

102
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,223
When do you plan to open for business?

103
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:19,404
Mid-July.

104
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:27,027
And you mentioned it earlier, I missed this, how many employees at this location?

105
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,848
At this location, approximately 30 to start, and that may grow.

106
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:37,334
And as far as I believe, did you say you were adding on to the existing structure?

107
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,734
more efficient service facility for our customers, and obviously increases the capacity as well.

108
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:10,199
We have plenty of parking that you can see on the 2 and 1 1 quarter, 2 and 1 1 1 acre site.

109
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,542
So the section that you're adding on is that phase that you're preparing?

110
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:14,902
Yes.

111
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:15,783
Yes.

112
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:18,965
Thank you very much.

113
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:19,705
Thank you.

114
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:20,586
Councillor Marks.

115
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,407
Thank you, Mr. President.

116
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:26,690
So you're not going to be selling new cars at a moving meeting?

117
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:47,202
So the requirements of the manufacturer to have this location, there is geographical territories of licensees with new car sales.

118
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:51,767
And the business reasons, perhaps John could speak to it more.

119
00:09:53,055 --> 00:10:04,079
This is really a satellite facility for sales where we can refer any new car sales to our existing dealership at Commonwealth Avenue, Boston.

120
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:10,981
We were not able to secure new car class one sales here.

121
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,342
We were only able to get certified pre-owned sales.

122
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:21,604
It's a requirement of BMW NA with the franchisee.

123
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,325
So the other closest BMW is in Somerville, is that correct?

124
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:29,406
That may be true.

125
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:48,978
Well, we have BMW on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, but as far as another BMW franchisee, I think there's one up on Route 1, but I don't know what the other competitor locations are.

126
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:52,502
Okay, so it's strictly going to be certified pre-owned?

127
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:53,502
Yes.

128
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,964
And how long has Herb Chambers owned that particular piece of property?

129
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:10,407
And John can correct me, I was just checking out vision appraisal records for the city, and it says 2018 on the acquisition.

130
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:14,449
And so, you know, that was Herb Chambers' infinity.

131
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,309
than now we're proposing Herb Chambers BMW.

132
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:19,549
Right.

133
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,111
And Herb Chambers Infinity didn't last too long there.

134
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,972
Do you know what the reasoning was behind that?

135
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:36,778
I don't know what the business determination was, but we have clearly, I'm not privileged to that information.

136
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:37,618
Right.

137
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,727
You said we had someone from the corporate office on it.

138
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:49,672
I'd like to know, because honestly, when the Infinity came in, I think a lot of people were happy to see a luxury car establishment go in there.

139
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:53,595
And then I'd say maybe six months, eight months, it wasn't very long.

140
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:56,517
And then it's been vacant for a long period of time.

141
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:00,720
And I'm just hoping that's not going to be the same scenario again.

142
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,743
Yeah, I think BMW is a solid brand.

143
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,703
$3.7 million construction contract.

144
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:19,664
And when you get finished with furniture, equipment, soft costs, it's well over $4.5 million.

145
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:20,084
OK.

146
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:26,745
Can we hear from someone from the corporate office regarding the infinity, Mr. President?

147
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:28,485
Would that be a KC or John?

148
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,026
Either one.

149
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:32,586
This is John Welch.

150
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:34,627
John Welch.

151
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,167
The director of record, please.

152
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:39,384
Yeah, my name is John Welch.

153
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,566
I'm the director of construction for the Herb Chambers companies.

154
00:12:42,527 --> 00:13:02,026
And to answer the question, it was really a business decision to pull out the Infinity brand itself and a business decision to be able to utilize the property to its higher extent, bringing in the BMW dealership.

155
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:08,441
Okay.

156
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:28,628
Um, so, uh, Mr. President, um, I would ask, uh, at this point, um, if, uh, the only plans that they're going to have is to sell pre-owned certified, is that going to be the full intent

157
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:34,505
So BMW has a certification program, but you know, class two allows you to sell.

158
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:42,149
Somebody may come in, buy a certified pre-owned BMW, trade in another car that we would resell.

159
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:47,632
So, you know, it wouldn't be limited to certified pre-owned.

160
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:51,314
It's just basically the sale of pre-owned vehicles.

161
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,076
So pre-owned, it's not going to be strictly BMWs?

162
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:54,876
No.

163
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,338
So it'll be other cars other than that?

164
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:57,698
Yes.

165
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:00,583
So I'll be able to go and afford one of your cars.

166
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:06,447
That was a legit question.

167
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:10,289
So you'll have other cars on the lot as well.

168
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:18,794
Mr. President, Herb Chambers has been a long established as the good attorney stated, in business for 35 years.

169
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:23,077
From what I know of Herb Chambers, a very reputable business.

170
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:27,620
Someone that stands by their cars, I think has a great track record.

171
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:34,860
and I think the Herb Chambers BMW will be a great addition to Mystic F. Thank you, Mr. President.

172
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
Councilor Morocco.

173
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,241
Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:42,705
If I could do the chair, you mentioned three, I'm sorry, 13 service days, that's 13 additional or 13 total?

175
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,788
There are approximately seven that exists.

176
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:49,950
So it's, you know, I thought that,

177
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:58,400
Originally, somebody said 11, going from seven to 11, but I looked at the floor plan and it's 13 that are numbered on there.

178
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,521
Okay, so 13 total.

179
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:00,461
I would say so, yeah.

180
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,502
Okay, thank you.

181
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:11,085
Is there any additional impervious surface or the starting area that is fully paved and you aren't paving any more areas for cars?

182
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:17,508
No, the paving that is out there is the paving that, it's the extent of the paving.

183
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:26,491
mistaken in any way, John can correct me, but I walked the site before I came over here and it looks like what is to be paved.

184
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:36,997
Some areas have already been freshly paved, but there's some considerable improvements and the limits of pavement appear to be established.

185
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:38,998
Are there any landscape improvements?

186
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:39,799
Pardon me?

187
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,840
Are there any landscape improvements to speak of?

188
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:49,132
So we do have a landscape strip at the front on Mystic Ave and then there'll be more landscaping in front of the building.

189
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,135
So there will be, you know, those improvements.

190
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,315
Okay, great.

191
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:54,776
Thank you.

192
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:55,396
Thank you.

193
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:57,377
Councilor Baez.

194
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,138
Thank you, Mr. President.

195
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,659
Thank you for the presentation.

196
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,743
Do you expect any additional or traffic impact from the additional service bays?

197
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:10,285
No, I think that it's,

198
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:25,619
you know, car dealerships historically, because people are coming in in the morning and on Saturdays and evenings, they often run counter to peak hour traffic.

199
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,982
And I've been involved in many facilities over the 25 years that I've represented Mr. Chambers.

200
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:37,004
And we've had various traffic studies and there's really no traffic impact on a modest,

201
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,753
increase in the building size like this.

202
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,394
The building size right now as an existing dealership was over 17,000.

203
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:48,755
I think seven, I have the exact numbers, 17,000.

204
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:55,696
It's currently, it's 17,425 square feet and it's going to 22,917.

205
00:16:56,116 --> 00:17:02,617
So it's, you know, it's about a third, less than a third, 5,492 square feet.

206
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:05,758
We wouldn't expect any noticeable traffic.

207
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:06,578
Okay.

208
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:07,138
Thank you.

209
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,475
Vice President Knight.

210
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,076
Mr. President, thank you very much.

211
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:26,945
Thinking back to when Infinity was before us, I do believe that some neighborhood residents appeared at that meeting and they expressed some concern over the use of an outdoor intercom system that was being used prior to Herb Chambers taking over.

212
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:35,030
And I do believe that this council had placed restrictions on the permit for Infinity, if I'm not mistaken.

213
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:43,714
I'm doing my best to try to dig those up, but I'm hoping that we can apply those same restrictions that were in place that the neighborhood asked for previously.

214
00:17:43,854 --> 00:18:00,339
I know that this lot has been vacant for some period of time, but when it was changing hands, a number of residents did come out expressing some concern over the use of the outdoor intercom system to, you know, call people and say, you know, Joe, you got a phone call, come inside and that type of thing.

215
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,940
It was very disruptive to the neighborhood, number one.

216
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,420
Number two,

217
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:14,233
vehicles stationed on site, or are they stored in another location in Mystic Ave, and are they going to be trucking back and forth to other locations around the possible Mystic Ave, or are they all going to be stored on site?

218
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:26,638
To my knowledge, we have plenty of storage space on the site, and I don't know that any of the intercom, and I remember that restriction because I was here three years ago, and I don't know if that

219
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,624
that certainly wasn't a reflection on the group chambers company that I think may be a prior operator.

220
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:38,628
But yeah, the local residents did want that protection in place when we issued the permit in the past.

221
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:41,610
And I'd ask that those restrictions be applied once again.

222
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,372
But we're gonna have to find them first.

223
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,515
The meeting minutes.

224
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:50,577
Any further questions?

225
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:54,720
A motion for approval.

226
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,752
So I'd like to offer that as a condition.

227
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,113
Are you making that, Council Vice Mayor, are you making that an amendment?

228
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:11,240
I'd like to offer it as a condition that, you know, the same conditions that were applied by this council when the Xfinity dealership received their class two license be applied to the special permit as well.

229
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:17,563
Okay, on the motion by... Mr. President.

230
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,244
I don't know how comfortable people are.

231
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:19,845
We can't see them.

232
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:23,767
Right, I'm not opposed to the condition of the outside mic.

233
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,768
I just don't know the other conditions.

234
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,689
and they may be acceptable as well.

235
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:35,157
But, you know, before I vote on any condition that was only what we had on the last time was just the noise of the intercoms.

236
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:39,421
Is that the only I think I think that was the only one we had last time.

237
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,242
Let's put it this way.

238
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:41,363
I know I sponsored that one.

239
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:41,723
Yeah.

240
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,086
So I know that that was the condition that was the only one I put on it.

241
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:44,947
I don't know if other counts.

242
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,408
I think that was the only one that was on there.

243
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,202
So why don't we do this, Mr. President?

244
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:52,543
Why don't we put that condition on and then do a six month review.

245
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,684
And if there's other conditions, we can put them on after the six month review.

246
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:56,304
So moved.

247
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:00,365
Yes.

248
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:07,007
That one condition that council one night, vice president night, and then we'll do a motion for a six month review.

249
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:16,350
So on the motion by council marks as amended by vice president night, seconded by

250
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:21,939
second seconded by Councilor Falco as amended.

251
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,420
Yes.

252
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,761
Yes.

253
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:27,321
Councilor Falco

254
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:51,262
Thinking back, Mr. President, I do think the other restrictions that we put on it were the license goes with the business and not the address.

255
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:57,146
You know, the usual restriction protections that we usually put in place, but I'm not 100% sure, but I think that that's what it was.

256
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,527
The license goes with the business.

257
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,169
The license goes with the business, not the address.

258
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:05,933
Ready for the roll call?

259
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:06,333
Okay.

260
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:07,394
Councilor Behrs?

261
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:08,435
Yes.

262
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:09,616
Councilor Fevella?

263
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:09,896
Yes.

264
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:10,997
Vice President Knight?

265
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:11,517
Yes.

266
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:12,158
Councilor Marks?

267
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:12,538
Yes.

268
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:13,179
Councilor Morrell?

269
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:13,559
Yes.

270
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,938
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio?

271
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:17,639
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

272
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:18,859
Motion passes.

273
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,119
Thank you, sir.

274
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,101
All right, 2-1.

275
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,461
363, City of Memphis, notice of public hearing.

276
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:34,063
Public hearing will be held by Memphis City Council via Zoom remote video conference on Tuesday evening, June 1st, 2021 at 7 o'clock p.m.

277
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:42,805
on a petition from Herb Chambers, BMW of Memphis, under provisions of Chapter 148, Section 13 of the General Laws of Massachusetts.

278
00:21:43,982 --> 00:22:12,160
for a flammable storage license to store one 1,000 gallon double wall tank of waste oil, two 500 gallon double wall tanks of fresh oil, and one 3,000 gallon poly tank of washer fluid, one 300 gallon poly tank of waste coolant, one 125 cubic foot

279
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:24,883
oxygen tank, and one 80 cubic foot settling tank at 60 Mystic Avenue, Bedford Mass, and a commercial two C2 zoning district.

280
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:28,804
A Zoom link for this meeting will be posted on May 27th, 2021.

281
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:35,748
Petitions and plans may be seen in the office of the city clerk, City Hall, Bedford Mass.

282
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,930
Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodation of the dates.

283
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,132
Okay, with this public hearing, we open this part.

284
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:52,076
All those in favor of this petition, name and address of the record, please.

285
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:52,836
439 Washington Street.

286
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,716
And you are in favor.

287
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:55,376
Thank you.

288
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,237
Is there anyone else in favor of this?

289
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,537
Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of the meeting.

290
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,698
Is there anyone that is opposition to this?

291
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:07,519
Anyone in opposition?

292
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,700
Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the hearing.

293
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,220
All right.

294
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:18,799
if you'd give us a synopsis of this petition.

295
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,940
Sure, Mr. President.

296
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:43,816
In connection with everything I've described in the previous application for the operation of the pre-owned sales and also for the service, we have obviously above ground tanks for these self-explanatory fluids, the waste oil, the fresh oil, and washer fluid.

297
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:50,428
They're in a fluids storage room, which is shown on the plans that have been filed with the building department.

298
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:57,950
John Welch has been involved intimately in the construction of this facility.

299
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,492
So if there's anything to add on the storage of these, I would just ask John to elaborate.

300
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:12,135
But what the president has described in red is exactly what we're storing in the fluids room

301
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:19,286
appropriate tanks, all state-of-the-art tanks above ground.

302
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:21,708
Thank you.

303
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,109
Do we have any questions for the gentleman?

304
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,190
Councilor Morocco.

305
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,392
Thank you, Mr. President.

306
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:28,833
So these are all new tanks.

307
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:30,074
Some of these were previously here.

308
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:31,795
Yes, they're new tanks.

309
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:36,639
John, correct me if anything, but I'm sure it's all new.

310
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:37,960
Okay.

311
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,363
Mr. Walters, these are new tanks, correct?

312
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:43,890
Yes, that's correct.

313
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:48,813
And how often are they serviced, the ones that need to be serviced?

314
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:53,377
John, would you be able to answer the councilor's question, how often?

315
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:54,638
John, can you answer the question?

316
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:59,161
I cannot, but Casey Richenberg might be able to.

317
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:08,088
The case- I'm sorry, Casey Richenberg from the Herb Chambers Companies?

318
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:15,628
The waste oil tank will be serviced once every two weeks to have the waste oil removed.

319
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:23,290
And the other two fresh oil tanks will be serviced once every two weeks, have a new oil pumped into there.

320
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,431
They get maintained once a year to be checked over, but they get checked every two weeks.

321
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,992
And when are they, like what hours?

322
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:33,833
Is it during business hours?

323
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:36,353
Is it early in the morning that this typically happens?

324
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:38,154
All during business hours.

325
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,014
Okay, thank you.

326
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:42,083
President.

327
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,044
Council Max.

328
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,125
Thank you, Mr President.

329
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:56,029
In the report from the chief of fire, it states that no obvious violations observed and it's pending final inspection.

330
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:10,254
We've had this come up in the past, Mr President, that I, as one member of the council, would, uh, like to see the final approval signed off prior to any issuance by this council.

331
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:13,625
And we've discussed that in the past, Mr. President.

332
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:17,207
I'm not sure why this is still the process that we're going through.

333
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:24,571
And also under the Board of Health, it said it needs final approval from fire and the building department.

334
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:32,495
So is there a reason why we're approving this prior to final approvals from department heads?

335
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:35,316
I see Mary Ann O'Connor on here.

336
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,758
I can get her opinion.

337
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:38,358
Mary Ann?

338
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:47,113
I mean, this isn't something that has been brought to my attention at this point.

339
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:56,435
So I think I was, I think last time this came up, it was because they had to build it.

340
00:26:57,175 --> 00:27:00,235
They hadn't built it yet because they wanted to get the permits to move forward.

341
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,176
And then they were going to build it.

342
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:03,136
Then they were going to come and inspect it after it was built.

343
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:04,516
Correct.

344
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,497
Maybe John can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's minus thing.

345
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:08,617
There's going to be new construction.

346
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:11,273
it hasn't been constructed yet because we need the permits to build it.

347
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:23,077
Mr. President, if I might address it under Chapter 148, I think it is the storage permit runs with the land.

348
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:31,940
And yes, the fire department is always in the judgment of the fire department as to whether or not things are appropriate.

349
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:33,681
But, um,

350
00:27:34,597 --> 00:27:42,902
I don't know what the report says, but I would imagine that they find everything that is shown on the plan to be appropriate for the storage of these fluids.

351
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:46,144
Well, it doesn't state that.

352
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:55,369
Could we have, perhaps, an approval subject to sign off or verification by the fire department?

353
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,793
John, when will the, Mr. President, if I could ask John Welch, when the tanks will be installed?

354
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,102
Our plan is to open by the middle of July.

355
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:11,644
The tanks will be installed early July.

356
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:28,654
So could we, Mr. President, possibly have an approval subject to the fire department confirming the compliance of the tanks when they're installed?

357
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:33,337
Mr. President, I have no problem with this particular one moving forward.

358
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:40,667
contingent upon approval from the police, I mean the fire department and the building department.

359
00:28:41,067 --> 00:29:03,003
However, Mr. President, moving forward, I would ask that we have a meeting with the chief of fire and the building commissioner to find out what process would better fit us so that we're not approving items that haven't been signed off or at least fully signed off by and fully vetted by

360
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,990
the departments that should be.

361
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,871
Thank you.

362
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:07,751
Any further discussion?

363
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:10,253
Chair with the motion.

364
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:12,774
Vice President Knight.

365
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:17,797
It seems like these are necessary and incidental licenses for the business license that we just issued.

366
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:18,978
And I would move for approval to pay.

367
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,659
No, on the motion by Vice President Knight.

368
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,760
Second.

369
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:33,366
Yes, the motion is contingent on all the proper departments standing on this.

370
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,783
seconded by second by Councilor Morrell.

371
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:39,864
Mr. Clerk, let's call the roll.

372
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:43,426
Councilor Behrs?

373
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:43,866
Yes.

374
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:44,946
Councilor Falco?

375
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:45,207
Yes.

376
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:46,627
Vice President Knight?

377
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,027
Yes.

378
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:47,788
Councilor Marks?

379
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:48,608
Yes.

380
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:49,388
Councilor Morrell?

381
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:49,889
Yes.

382
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,229
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

383
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,030
President Kerrio?

384
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,870
Yes.

385
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,391
Seeing affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

386
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,252
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules.

387
00:29:58,973 --> 00:29:59,433
Councilor Marks?

388
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:03,875
So the report we received from the Chief of Staff

389
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,921
2021 states no obvious violations observed.

390
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,282
And it says pending final inspection.

391
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:19,863
So if these tanks haven't been put in yet, then how would no obvious violations observed?

392
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,104
What is the chief observing?

393
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:30,206
Maybe the threat was already there other than the tanks.

394
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,827
I think that's why we need to meet on this to find out.

395
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:37,389
what's going on, but not, not this particular one.

396
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,150
I'll move.

397
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,551
You know, we're moving forward with this one, but I think we have to find out the language of these reports.

398
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:44,111
Thank you.

399
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:44,551
Thank you.

400
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:45,652
Thank you, sir.

401
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,132
Thank you, Mr. President.

402
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:55,054
Move to suspend the rules to take up papers 21 dash two zero two and 21 dash three eight eight.

403
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:57,374
Hold on a second.

404
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:59,475
21 dash Mary.

405
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:05,952
Okay.

406
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:11,175
On the motion by Councilor Mihevc.

407
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:12,916
Thank you, sir.

408
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:13,276
Yes, sir.

409
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,359
for repair license, the class- No, you're all set with that one.

410
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:35,900
The first one's all set.

411
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,162
Okay, and the class two, and the pre-owned, the flamboyant- Yeah, that's all set.

412
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:39,783
You're all set with that.

413
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:42,906
And the special permit that the building- Yeah, the first one's all set.

414
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:43,606
Thank you.

415
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,129
Other than the conditions that were on there.

416
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:47,149
Thank you.

417
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,030
Thank you.

418
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:49,331
Yeah.

419
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:59,040
I think before we change- Council member, what was the other paper you were looking for?

420
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:00,564
21 dash 388.

421
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:03,526
It's Councilors Kelly's first motion.

422
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:05,748
We have folks in the audience tonight.

423
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:10,753
Okay, all the motion by Councilor bears seconded by the rules.

424
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:13,595
Second, second by Councilor Falco Mr please call the roll.

425
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:17,178
Council bears.

426
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,479
Yes, Councilor Falco.

427
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,540
Yes, Vice President night.

428
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:23,403
Council marks.

429
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:23,863
Yes.

430
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:25,084
Council Morrell.

431
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:39,814
help, because it's going to be one of the opposition, and one absent motion passes to one or two weekly updates from Director of Public Health Mariana.

432
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:44,158
Hi, I'm here.

433
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:47,721
Good evening, Mr President and members of the council.

434
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:49,683
I think as you know if.

435
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,821
hit a milestone this week.

436
00:32:51,881 --> 00:33:01,767
So my update tonight, I kind of like to reflect on where we were 15 months ago and how far we've come.

437
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:03,688
And I hope you will indulge me.

438
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,009
I will try to keep my comments brief.

439
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:17,736
I remember in March of 2020, I was actually in the mayor's office discussing our response and emergency plans when I got the call.

440
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:38,040
It was our first positive case who happened to be a student who had, we'd learned, just returned from Europe, had four plus roommates, had attended classes, visited other local universities and meetings, had attended a party, and had taken numerous Lyft and Uber rides.

441
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,883
Over a hundred contacts had to be identified and notified.

442
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:54,130
They spent the weekend reaching out to numerous health departments across country as many of the contacts had already left for home as the campus shut down.

443
00:33:56,111 --> 00:34:03,074
Then the Biogen conference hit and Medford had more positive cases and began to build from that event.

444
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:11,418
This administration took action quickly and decisively to issue emergency orders weeks ahead of the state

445
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:18,209
moving on what was to quickly become our pandemic crisis.

446
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:25,733
April hit, and then our nursing home cases began to rise.

447
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:36,579
I had many late night calls with our nursing home administrators in desperate need of PPE and staffing.

448
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,123
I remember one call in particular when the administrator told me because of the strict requirements

449
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,042
for those allowed to feed patients.

450
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,585
She couldn't even feed patients as the administrator.

451
00:34:52,046 --> 00:35:02,555
And she was more worried about patients starving to death at that point due to the lack of qualified staff as they were either out from COVID or just not coming to work anymore.

452
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:06,017
I relayed this information to the mayor.

453
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,663
She quickly got the entire state delegation on a Zoom call.

454
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:16,964
and also alerted the secretary of health and human services.

455
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,248
We were able to scramble and secure PPE as they needed.

456
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:32,596
And because of our mayor's efforts, restrictions on a statewide basis for personnel allowed to feed nursing home patients were revamped.

457
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:37,800
And I don't think anyone knows that we did that, our mayor did that.

458
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,562
We continue to fight for our nursing homes.

459
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,425
And again, I remember walking into the mayor's office

460
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:55,067
I'm physically and emotionally breaking down after calling ER doctors to find out why patients were being sent to the ER and then sent back to the nursing home.

461
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,808
And hearing the words, there's nothing they could do.

462
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:11,293
Again, the mayor showed incredible strength and resilience and put me back to work and refocused through support and compassion.

463
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:16,430
and then picked up the phone and demanded assistance from the state.

464
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:25,237
In May, we secured 5,000 masks and distributed them to the community at an event on Mother's Day weekend, and some of you were there.

465
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:36,446
We received incredible help from our school nurses on contact tracing, but eventually had to hire additional help to keep up with the caseload.

466
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,890
I also had to make the call to cancel graduation last year.

467
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,806
And as the mother of a high school student, that was hard.

468
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:55,391
But we were faced with cases and information that, in my opinion, made it impossible to know or not know if this could be a super spreader event.

469
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,052
So I made the call.

470
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:10,918
We fought, and when I say we, I don't just mean myself or my department, but this administration and this mayor, for increased testing availability.

471
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:12,539
And with the help of Tufts,

472
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:17,593
secured for our teachers and eventually our students as well.

473
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:24,095
We were leaders in the state on that effort, leaders in the state.

474
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:29,337
The summer of 2020 was better until restrictions on the state level were loosened.

475
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:41,761
And in the fall, we had to make tough decisions regarding trick-or-treating and Thanksgiving, and that was not easy, but necessary due to public health data.

476
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:42,661
And again,

477
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,136
This administration supported public health.

478
00:37:47,097 --> 00:38:00,024
And when again, cases were climbing and information difficult, this administration made a difficult but right choice to go public and ask for the community's assistance to self-identify if at a particular event.

479
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:05,847
This again was not easy decision, all popular, but necessary.

480
00:38:08,098 --> 00:38:14,341
Then the Christmas and New Year's holidays again, put us back and cases went to the roof.

481
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:18,422
As again, we fought to keep up in contact trace and enforce restrictions.

482
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:32,068
I know my department tried to educate as opposed to enforce, but at times we had at the risk of being not liked or popular had to enforce.

483
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:42,788
This has been an incredibly trying time for myself, my department, and my family.

484
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:47,431
And last year, I remember being on a zoom call.

485
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:52,054
My daughter had her virtual zoom prom.

486
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:56,357
And I wasn't there to help her older sister did.

487
00:38:57,297 --> 00:39:03,561
And when Emily walked down the stairs, I was literally on a zoom call with the mayor and the administration and gasp because she looks so gorgeous.

488
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,937
Last Tuesday, I was at her senior prom.

489
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:12,859
So I'm sorry I wasn't here, but I wasn't gonna miss that.

490
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:24,943
So 5,000 plus cases later, I am so pleased to announce that over the last three days, we've had zero cases.

491
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,104
We've come a long way.

492
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:30,605
Restrictions have been lifted.

493
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,806
Gathering orders have been lifted.

494
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,267
Mask orders have been lifted.

495
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:38,155
But vaccinations are so important.

496
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:42,298
We did our first Real Talk series last week.

497
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:44,319
I hope people watch it.

498
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:48,922
It's on our local cable access channel.

499
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:50,523
It's on our website.

500
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:56,247
If you are hesitant, if you have questions about the vaccine, please watch that.

501
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:58,008
We will be doing more.

502
00:39:58,488 --> 00:39:59,669
Please call our office.

503
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:02,491
We do still have vaccines available.

504
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:04,492
You know,

505
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:10,758
Vaccines are what we know are going to get us through this.

506
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:13,499
And I know some people are still hesitant.

507
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:21,160
So I just hope that folks take advantage of getting the vaccine.

508
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,061
If you're not vaccinated, you still need to wear a mask.

509
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:30,202
If you're unvaccinated, you need to wear a mask.

510
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:34,863
If you're under 12 years old, you're not vaccinated, you need to wear a mask.

511
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:39,387
So I know people have questions about the mattering.

512
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,571
Outdoors, the restrictions are a little bit looser, but indoors, absolutely.

513
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:51,876
If you're in large gatherings, even if you are vaccinated, the advice would be to wear a mask.

514
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,659
The vaccine's a 95% effective, we know.

515
00:40:56,959 --> 00:41:00,402
So to protect yourself and others, I would suggest still wearing a mask.

516
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:04,364
Thank you for indulging me and happy to take any questions.

517
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:06,360
Councilor Best.

518
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,122
Thank you, Mr President.

519
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:18,392
Um, and Marion, I just want to thank you for running us through, um, the incredible, difficult work that you've been tasked with doing over the past year.

520
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:24,377
Um, and the toll that it's taken on people who work for the city, uh, volunteers and your family.

521
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:30,023
Um, you were able to keep us safe under incredibly difficult conditions without

522
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:35,440
the support that you needed from the federal and state government, constantly having to advocate for the basics.

523
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,441
And you did a great job.

524
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,162
We owe you personally a deep debt of gratitude and thanks for what you've done.

525
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:45,303
And we are deepest respect.

526
00:41:46,043 --> 00:42:00,188
So I just wanna thank you very much again, and for all the work you're going to continue to do over the next months to keep us safe as we continue, hopefully to wrap up and wind down with this pandemic.

527
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:02,763
I have two questions for you.

528
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:08,487
Could you just quickly go over what the current guidance is for public buildings?

529
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:10,028
And then I'll ask my second question.

530
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:13,510
So right now we're following the state guidance.

531
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:16,593
We haven't put any additional restrictions on.

532
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:23,697
What we're saying is that we strongly recommend that folks who visit municipal buildings continue to wear masks.

533
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,999
Again, if you're vaccinated,

534
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:29,044
that restriction is lifted.

535
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:32,187
You don't have to, but we still strongly recommend that you do.

536
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:42,676
If you're unvaccinated, which of course is really hard to enforce, oh no, but if you are unvaccinated, you must wear a mask.

537
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,160
Thanks, Marianne.

538
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:51,624
And that's one of the reasons I'm wearing a mask tonight, even though I'm fully vaccinated.

539
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,266
My second question is on next steps.

540
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,087
I know there's, you know, we've done a really great job getting vaccines rolled out to our community.

541
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:09,991
And I'm just wondering, in addition to the real talk, are there any other efforts that the city is undertaking to folks get vaccinated who have not gotten a vaccine already?

542
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:22,016
So, yeah, we are gonna be holding our second dose vaccine on June 8th for the 12 plus that we did at the Andrews.

543
00:43:22,718 --> 00:43:23,519
So that was great.

544
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,142
That was like 260 plus folks, 12 plus.

545
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:28,403
So that's terrific.

546
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:37,750
We are holding an event at the West Medford Community Center on June 19th in conjunction with their activities that day.

547
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,232
We hope people come out to get vaccinated.

548
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:47,977
We are just really pushing and promoting.

549
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:49,639
We have social media posts.

550
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:54,500
website posts, we're asking people to contact us if they have questions.

551
00:43:56,561 --> 00:44:01,702
You know, it's we're continuing and like I said, we still do have vaccine available.

552
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:06,404
So if folks are interested, please, please reach out.

553
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:09,605
Thank you, Marianne.

554
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:15,187
I just want to thank you again, and glad that you were able to take time with your family last week.

555
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:18,408
And I look forward to the continued work that you're doing.

556
00:44:18,668 --> 00:44:18,948
Thank you.

557
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:20,719
Thank you.

558
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:27,883
They changed my name from Mary Ann to Wary Man, so that's where we're at.

559
00:44:28,003 --> 00:44:28,743
Thank you, Mr. President.

560
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:42,771
And thank you, Mary Ann, for being here and for your continued and ongoing leadership and just taking the time to share the hiring experience that you went through and really we all went through, but as is human nature, we're just quick to forget.

561
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:48,114
So again, I want to thank you and your team for really leading us through kind of really the darkest

562
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,472
15 months that I think most of us have been through.

563
00:44:51,492 --> 00:45:04,722
And I think sometimes it doesn't get said enough, just the agility of your team to go from, in the early days, it's looking for PPE, and then it's contact tracers, and then it's testing, and then it's how to get vaccines.

564
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,184
So it's really tremendous work.

565
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:11,106
So I just have two questions to follow up about the,

566
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:16,059
Juneteenth event at the West Denver Community Center.

567
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:17,681
I know they previously had a vaccine event.

568
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:22,426
Is this a second dose event on the 19th or people can go for their first dose that day as well?

569
00:45:22,906 --> 00:45:24,808
It's gonna be both, exactly.

570
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:33,958
So yeah, folks who had come for their first dose previously can come for their second, but we will also have first doses that day as well.

571
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,480
Great, thank you.

572
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:41,224
And what is our, remind me, what's our city, what's our vaccination rate in the city right now?

573
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:47,547
We're looking at around 60% with at least one dose, which is great, but it's not where we want to be.

574
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:50,089
We want more.

575
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:51,850
So above 60% right now.

576
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:53,331
Okay, great.

577
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:54,211
Thanks so much, Marianne.

578
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:55,552
Thanks for taking the time to be here tonight.

579
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:57,833
Councilor Belco.

580
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:02,516
Thank you, President Cabello, and thank you, Marianne.

581
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:04,428
have a quick question now.

582
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:07,710
So we're going to are we still doing contact tracing?

583
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:16,533
Yes, right now through the end of the month, we are asking people to sign in with their names and contact information.

584
00:46:16,953 --> 00:46:30,478
And we will reevaluate my my reasoning and the administration supported for doing that is just loosened up right all of the restrictions and I'm

585
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:37,345
Concerned or curious to know what's going to happen a couple of weeks from now.

586
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:42,206
I'm hoping that the vaccines are going to keep us where we want to be.

587
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:46,026
But within a couple of weeks, we'll see what happens.

588
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,747
By the end of the month, we'll see where we're at for case-wise.

589
00:46:49,247 --> 00:46:53,087
So for right now, people will still be required to sign in through June 30th.

590
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:58,108
And then we will re-evaluate at that point based on our public health data.

591
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,669
Do we do any type of contact tracing at the library?

592
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:18,907
Right now, I don't think they are at this point, you know, because they had not had that instituted, because they hadn't really been operating, but they are having stricter requirements around masks, particularly for children.

593
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:24,409
Again, if you're under 12, you're obviously not vaccinated, so you should be wearing a mask.

594
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,292
And I know the library's instituting some stricter requirements around children and masks.

595
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:34,782
So, I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of an inconsistency.

596
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:38,143
I mean, wouldn't we have the contact tracing at the library as well as city hall?

597
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:41,704
I mean, there's people coming and going on a pretty frequent basis.

598
00:47:41,764 --> 00:47:44,485
I would think there would be a consistent policy with regards to that.

599
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:53,328
Well, I know at the senior center, they're still gonna be registering for classes and for programming going forward again through the end of the month.

600
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:59,290
But again, with the library, I'm,

601
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,190
I'm blanking at this point, I'm sorry.

602
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,691
But at this point, I don't believe they are.

603
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:07,712
So it is inconsistent.

604
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:09,673
They could be, I'm sorry, I'm blanking.

605
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:11,353
I don't know, they might be.

606
00:48:11,914 --> 00:48:14,495
So we don't know if there's contact tracing at the library?

607
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:17,316
The administration does not know.

608
00:48:17,336 --> 00:48:19,657
Right now, it's me, I don't know.

609
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:22,098
You don't know, okay.

610
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:26,059
So we have contact tracing at City Hall, the administration knows that.

611
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,621
We've had that in place, right, because we've had that in place.

612
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,022
going forward.

613
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:35,283
The administration does not know if there is contact tracing at the Metropolitan Public Library.

614
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:36,803
Not the administration.

615
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:39,904
Me right now at this point, don't know.

616
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,804
I'll get you the answer tomorrow, I promise.

617
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:45,805
I'll find out.

618
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:48,105
Thank you, Mr. President.

619
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,405
I'd like to thank Marianne and her office.

620
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:53,826
I'd like to thank the administration for the past 15 months.

621
00:48:54,846 --> 00:48:57,947
I would also like to thank Mr. President, the 58,000 residents of this community.

622
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:02,575
over the past 15 months.

623
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:22,790
Because if it wasn't for the residents, Mr. President, who stayed home when asked, who wore masks, who social distanced, who stayed away from loved ones for 15 months, what we're experiencing right now with these reduced numbers would not have been possible.

624
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:29,555
If it wasn't for our first responders, Mr. President, that showed up to work on day one

625
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:31,595
and never missed a beat.

626
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:38,683
Day one, police, fire, EMS, teachers, and we're on the front lines.

627
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:46,712
If it wasn't for the workers in the local stores, the restaurants that stayed open and had to change their businesses,

628
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,054
in order to accommodate takeout orders and try to make ends meet, Mr. President.

629
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:55,416
This is the cog in the wheel that made things happen.

630
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,098
It was the people that made things happen.

631
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:07,105
Because if you raise a city government, whether it was this government, the federal government or the state government, you'd be worse off, Mr. President.

632
00:50:07,426 --> 00:50:09,427
It was the people that made this happen.

633
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:13,030
And I want to thank the people of this community

634
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:23,458
I want to thank the first responders, the teachers, and every resident of this community that band together and did the right thing for 15 months, although it was very difficult.

635
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:29,022
I want to thank the high school students last year that didn't get a graduation, Mr. President.

636
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:36,248
One of the most important days of your life, graduating from high school, and they didn't get a formal graduation, Mr. President.

637
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:39,491
I want to thank those students for bearing with us.

638
00:50:42,478 --> 00:50:47,600
This wasn't done by one particular person, one particular group, Mr. President.

639
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,101
This was an effort by everyone.

640
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:52,021
We're united.

641
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:57,263
And I think everyone deserves a pat on the back and a thank you, Mr. President.

642
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:11,748
So I want to make sure that that thank you goes out to the 58,000 residents in this community and all the first responders and every business owner in this community during trying times, Mr. President, when they were trying to make ends meet.

643
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:18,186
And sometimes they felt like city government was against them, these small businesses.

644
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:23,730
And sometimes the government was against the small businesses, Mr. President.

645
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:27,072
But they made it through.

646
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:29,694
And I wanna thank them as well.

647
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:30,634
Thank you, Mr. President.

648
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:34,077
Thank you.

649
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:37,279
Thank you, Councilor Moxley.

650
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:43,750
And Miriam, for myself, I want to thank you and the administration.

651
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,011
I want to thank Councilor Marks for that.

652
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:51,374
He's spot on again, as usual, thanking everyone in the community and everywhere around.

653
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:52,795
Thank you, Councilor Marks, for that.

654
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:56,377
Who's next to speak?

655
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:02,821
Mr. Cassidy, where are you?

656
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:04,142
Okay.

657
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:07,404
The gentleman from East Medford.

658
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:09,937
Would you like to speak?

659
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:10,797
Thank you, Council President.

660
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:11,458
Can you hear me?

661
00:52:11,478 --> 00:52:12,979
I can hear you.

662
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,160
Name and address of the record, sir.

663
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:20,185
Andrew Castaneda, Cooking Street, East Method, Massachusetts.

664
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:28,491
If I may, through the Chair, I have one two-part question for the Health Director.

665
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:38,259
The question is, in the City of Method 02155, how many total corona deaths are there?

666
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,250
Yeah.

667
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,493
How many were there in the nursing home?

668
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:55,643
Sorry, I couldn't really understand.

669
00:52:55,663 --> 00:53:01,648
I think the question was how many COVID deaths were there and how many were in the nursing homes?

670
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:02,969
Correct.

671
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:04,089
Oh, okay.

672
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,450
Thank you.

673
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:14,874
Just over 200 deaths here in Medford and approximately 110 were nursing home deaths.

674
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:22,139
Second.

675
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:38,842
Councilor Behrs.

676
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:39,323
Yes.

677
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:40,744
Councilor Fevella.

678
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:40,984
Yes.

679
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:41,945
Vice President Knight.

680
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:42,465
Yes.

681
00:53:42,605 --> 00:53:43,165
Councilor Marks.

682
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:43,686
Yes.

683
00:53:44,026 --> 00:53:44,646
Councilor Morrell.

684
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:45,027
Yes.

685
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:46,628
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

686
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:47,368
President Kerrio.

687
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:47,949
Yes.

688
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:47,949
2, 1, 3, 8, 8.

689
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:54,713
Offered by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Marks.

690
00:53:55,314 --> 00:54:05,641
We resolve that the City Council invite Derek Julio to our next schedule meeting to present him with a citation recognition of his accomplishment of being elevated to an Eagle Skeleton.

691
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:08,905
Thank you, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly.

692
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:21,332
for offering this resolution.

693
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:36,159
Mr. President, you know, this doesn't happen often before the city council that, you know, we have residents in this community that rise to such a level that deserves recognition and honor.

694
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,562
And truly becoming an Eagle Scout deserves that honor, Mr. President.

695
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:45,944
We have Derek in the audience tonight with his family.

696
00:54:45,964 --> 00:54:47,905
We're gonna ask him to come to the podium.

697
00:54:48,698 --> 00:54:50,462
You're not gonna get off that easy, Derek.

698
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:56,478
If we could turn on his mic too, Mr. President.

699
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:57,380
Thank you.

700
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:03,926
You know, it truly is an honor, Mr. President, to rise to a level of Eagle Scout.

701
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:27,323
The amount of effort, time that is put in, Mr. President, not just by Eagle Scout, but the family, because the family is involved in a lot of aspects of becoming an Eagle Scout, whether it's trips into the woods, Mr. President, or doing projects or public service and community projects, there's much involved that involves the whole family.

702
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:39,552
And I think that's what being Eagle Scout is all about, is to have the camaraderie and the family unit together.

703
00:55:40,112 --> 00:55:42,594
And being Eagle Scout is truly a family unit.

704
00:55:43,294 --> 00:55:43,935
I would just ask

705
00:55:44,766 --> 00:55:56,930
Derek, if you can give us a little brief synopsis of your time and working up to the Eagle Scout, what your community project was, because I know that's a requirement of the Eagle Scout badge.

706
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:04,152
And if you could just give us a little tidbit about the involvement, I know your parents are here and I believe you might have a sibling here as well.

707
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,933
If you can just give us a little synopsis.

708
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:14,738
It was over a six-year process from when I actually joined the scouts to get an eagle.

709
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:21,502
Through that, there were many camping trips, pretty much two nights in the woods almost every month.

710
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:29,467
Some of the highlights were Mount Katahdin, which is one of the highest mountains in the, it's the tallest mountain in Maine.

711
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,730
We climbed that, it was a six-hour total hike.

712
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:36,583
And you asked about the project.

713
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:41,926
So my project was in Otis Street, there was a tree that was dying.

714
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,568
It was becoming a hazard to the structures around it.

715
00:56:46,428 --> 00:56:49,970
So part of the project was to actually remove that tree.

716
00:56:50,951 --> 00:57:04,598
And also in the hole where the stump was, we put a drywall because in the winter, all the water from the roof of the church on Otis Street would start to melt and then freeze on the pathway.

717
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:07,044
So we made a separate way for the water to go.

718
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:12,086
So the, especially the, a lot of the elderly people attending the church would not deal with the ice.

719
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:25,512
It was over three weeks of actual work, like three weekends of actual work with over a hundred, like combined hours from scouts and parents.

720
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:30,555
Yeah, it was, it was a lot of work.

721
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:40,662
months of work just going into preparation, having to get approved by the Eagle Scout administration.

722
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:42,722
It's a lot of paperwork.

723
00:57:44,303 --> 00:57:51,406
Can you tell us a little personal about yourself, schooling or anything that interests, what other interests do you have, Derek?

724
00:57:51,746 --> 00:57:55,588
So I'm more of a hands-on guy.

725
00:57:55,628 --> 00:57:57,669
I'm not really a classroom guy.

726
00:57:57,749 --> 00:58:01,851
So I joined the medical vocational program.

727
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:02,491
Excellent.

728
00:58:02,888 --> 00:58:10,430
And actually, Scouts was part of it, because in Scouting, there's merit badges you can take, which teach you about specific things.

729
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:21,613
One of them is the electrical merit badge, and I enjoyed it so much, I joined the electrical program in the vocational school, and I'm an electrician now, part of 103 IBEW.

730
00:58:22,113 --> 00:58:23,314
Congratulations, excellent.

731
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:23,834
Thank you.

732
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:24,974
Excellent.

733
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:30,596
That's great.

734
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,278
I'm a proud graduate of the method vocational school as well.

735
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,959
And your parents should be very proud.

736
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,940
You seem like a great young gentleman.

737
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,201
And I see great things in your future.

738
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,663
And I know my colleagues have other things to add as well.

739
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:47,205
Thank you, Mr. President.

740
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:49,026
Derek, I just want to say congratulations.

741
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:55,650
I know that earning the rank of Eagle is quite, quite a remarkable accomplishment.

742
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,991
If you take a look at just Google,

743
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:04,650
Eagle Scouts, you'll see it's a very, very impressive list of people that have earned that rank.

744
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,951
And you're one of them now.

745
00:59:05,971 --> 00:59:06,491
You're part of that.

746
00:59:06,651 --> 00:59:08,152
It's an exclusive group.

747
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:10,915
And I'm very proud of you.

748
00:59:10,955 --> 00:59:12,756
I know that your parents are very proud of you.

749
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:16,199
And of course, it takes a lot of support from your parents and your family.

750
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:23,605
And I just wanted to just congratulate you on all the time, the commitment, the dedication.

751
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:26,427
It takes a lot of hard work and great job.

752
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:27,768
Good luck in the future.

753
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:28,899
Thank you.

754
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,640
Thank you.

755
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,881
Mr. President, thank you very much.

756
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,242
Congratulations.

757
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:36,063
This is certainly a commendation you've earned.

758
00:59:36,544 --> 00:59:46,830
And I was speaking with your father earlier, and he said that if you ever want to go for a second Eagle Scout badge, that he'd like you to fix the Winthrop Street situation.

759
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,051
That's part of your project.

760
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:52,593
That'll go a long way at the house.

761
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:53,293
Congratulations.

762
00:59:53,353 --> 00:59:55,034
I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

763
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,415
I think it's great that you've

764
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:59,370
decided to join local 103 and be a part of our union life.

765
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:09,796
I too am a union member and I can just tell you this, be stronger together and the benefits will certainly be there for you in the long run and your brothers and sisters will be there for you too.

766
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,097
So congratulations on your work.

767
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:12,818
You've entered a new family now.

768
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:14,579
You've moved on from your Boy Scout family.

769
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:15,980
You've entered the family of organized labor.

770
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,601
So congratulations and I wish you the best of luck.

771
01:00:17,941 --> 01:00:18,501
Thank you so much.

772
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:19,702
Councilor Mayes.

773
01:00:20,122 --> 01:00:20,943
Thank you, Mr. President.

774
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:24,165
Derek, I just want to echo my colleagues and say congratulations.

775
01:00:24,773 --> 01:00:29,236
I was able to work on two of my friends Eagle Scout service projects when we were all in high school together.

776
01:00:29,276 --> 01:00:31,238
And I know how much work goes into that.

777
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:34,860
And I also know the area you're talking about on Otis street.

778
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,082
So that's a great project for our community.

779
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:42,126
And exactly what councilor Knight said, I think this is great for your future.

780
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:46,689
And I really wish you the best and your family the best as you become an electrician.

781
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:47,830
So congratulations.

782
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,590
Thank you.

783
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,380
Thank you, Mr. President.

784
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:57,683
I'm less full of our Seagull Scouts than some of my colleagues, but I did have some friends who reached the level growing up.

785
01:00:57,743 --> 01:01:02,786
And I know it's something that you don't reach without dedication and stick-to-itiveness, which are really great qualities.

786
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:03,946
So you definitely have those.

787
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:08,889
And I just want to share it with my fellow counselors and say congratulations on such a tremendous achievement.

788
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:10,290
Thank you.

789
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,170
Thank you, Azra.

790
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,491
And Derek, you should be proud of yourself and your family.

791
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:15,352
She's very, very proud of you.

792
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:19,114
Something in the Miffy water where we produce Seagull Scouts.

793
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:20,535
We've done a lot of these.

794
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,967
Again, you should be very proud of doing this.

795
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:26,288
It's a great accomplishment for you and your family.

796
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:32,290
We have a citation for you this evening, but the sponsor was Councilor Scott Kelly is not here to sign it.

797
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,692
We will, if you want to take it, we'll take a picture with you with it.

798
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:42,374
And the clerk will have Councilor Scott Kelly sign it and we'll send it to your house.

799
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:44,195
That sounds great, thank you.

800
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:51,058
Yes, motion by Vice President to recess, seconded by Councilor Marks.

801
01:01:51,562 --> 01:01:52,263
So quickly scroll.

802
01:01:52,283 --> 01:01:52,703
Yes.

803
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:55,726
Yes.

804
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:55,866
Yes.

805
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:56,166
Yes.

806
01:01:56,306 --> 01:01:56,506
Yes.

807
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:02,048
To reconvene, seconded by Councilor Falcone.

808
01:04:02,068 --> 01:04:03,288
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

809
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:08,890
To reconvene, Councilor Bears.

810
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:12,691
Yeah, you don't need it.

811
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:14,552
Never mind, you don't need to reconvene.

812
01:04:16,492 --> 01:04:17,773
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

813
01:04:17,873 --> 01:04:20,535
My name is Bob Penta, former member of the Saugus body.

814
01:04:20,935 --> 01:04:33,245
And I would be remiss not to come up here because as a prior member of the Smith City Council, I think it was only on three separate occasions that I had the honor of recognizing a young gentleman who became an Eagle Scout.

815
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:39,009
Tonight, it's a distinct pleasure because in today's day and age, you don't even hear of the term of an Eagle Scout.

816
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:42,292
You don't hear about the dedication that a young man would put

817
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:52,020
into doing something positive, not only for the community, but for himself, recognizing he needs to be a success for the future because that's what this is all about.

818
01:04:53,046 --> 01:04:57,447
being self-made and going forward, being a graduate of the vocational school, that's great.

819
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,008
Going into the electrical department, that's great.

820
01:05:00,048 --> 01:05:01,648
Being an electrician, that's great.

821
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:13,792
But the one thing that everyone seems to be missing today about youngsters, whether they're male or females, is the fact that they have this self-worth of wanting to do something that benefits the community.

822
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:20,194
And just by looking at him and looking at the six years that it took him and his family that's here, it's a proud moment.

823
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:24,222
And not only is it a proud moment, it speaks well for the city of Medford.

824
01:05:25,311 --> 01:05:27,893
You don't hear too much about scouts today in the news.

825
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:30,415
If anything, you may hear some more negative than positive.

826
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:35,239
But this gentleman represents the positive part of what our city is all about.

827
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:49,210
It represents why Medford is what it is, because they have the ingredients, the intelligence, and the drive of a good, young, honest man who wants to make not only his life better, but our city of Medford better.

828
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:54,034
So like I said, I would be remiss not to come up here and say that because I think this is

829
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:58,956
a distinct honor, not only for this gentleman, but also for the city of Medford.

830
01:05:59,317 --> 01:05:59,677
Thank you.

831
01:06:23,853 --> 01:06:26,776
Yeah, we're gonna revert back to it.

832
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:28,038
21389 offered by Councilor Scott Pele.

833
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:33,204
If we can table that till next week when Councilor Scott Pele will be back.

834
01:06:34,045 --> 01:06:34,685
Move to table.

835
01:06:35,947 --> 01:06:36,548
Second.

836
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:39,391
The motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Vice President Knight.

837
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:41,213
Mr. Clerk, please call the motion to the table.

838
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:45,119
Councilor Behrs.

839
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:45,459
Yes.

840
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:46,400
Councilor Falco.

841
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:46,640
Yes.

842
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:47,860
Vice President Knight.

843
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,220
Yes.

844
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,220
Councilor Marks.

845
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:49,660
Yes.

846
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,421
Councilor Morrell.

847
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:50,781
Yes.

848
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:52,081
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

849
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:52,841
President Kerrio.

850
01:06:53,061 --> 01:06:54,302
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

851
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:54,982
Motion passes.

852
01:06:55,582 --> 01:07:07,545
21390 offered by Councilor Falco, being resolved that the administration provide a full list of entities that the sealer of weights and measure monitors the date of last inspection and an expiration of seal.

853
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,246
Councilor Falco.

854
01:07:09,786 --> 01:07:10,606
Thank you, Mr. President.

855
01:07:11,557 --> 01:07:18,399
During my past four visits to get gas for my car, I've looked at the seal on the gas pump.

856
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:24,361
It indicates the date when the pump was last inspected by the city's sealer of weights and measures.

857
01:07:25,562 --> 01:07:32,144
Frankly, I've been shocked by how long it has been since these pumps were looked at by the city sealer of weights and measures.

858
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,825
In some cases, it has been as long as three, four years.

859
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:53,772
For people who don't know, the City Stealer of Weights and Measures is the city employee appointed by the mayor who checks the accuracy of pumps at the gas station, scales at food stores, in the deli or produce departments, or anything that a merchant uses to measure goods that are being sold to the public.

860
01:07:55,173 --> 01:08:03,055
If these pumps or scales are not accurate, the customer will pay more for the gas that they buy for their car or the fruit or cold cuts that they buy for their family.

861
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:12,305
Pumps and scales that have been unchecked or not properly calibrated by the city ends up with people paying more than they should pay.

862
01:08:12,485 --> 01:08:14,606
And what is worse, they will never know it.

863
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,908
Anytime this happens, it is obviously unfair.

864
01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:28,232
But if it happens because the city has not done its job, it shows a callous disregard for a hardworking residents.

865
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:33,495
So Mr. President, in addition to the requesting a full list for entities that zero

866
01:08:34,925 --> 01:08:43,312
In addition to requesting a full list for entities that sealer of weights and measures monitors in the date of last inspection and expiration of seal.

867
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:51,358
I also ask that the mayor advise this council who the sealer of weights and measures is, and when he or she began in that position.

868
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:56,382
This is something that, you know, even with COVID could have been done.

869
01:08:57,803 --> 01:09:02,207
And as far as I can tell, and I've traveled to numerous gas stations throughout the city,

870
01:09:03,994 --> 01:09:09,299
just to do my own research, I went to probably six to eight gas stations and they're all expired.

871
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,921
This needs to be looked at.

872
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:16,565
And I also believe that this is a revenue source for the city that they're not taking in.

873
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:25,893
So this is lost revenue to the city, but it is completely just unfair to the taxpayer that actually buys gas on a regular basis.

874
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:26,593
And we all do that.

875
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,375
So on that, I'd like to move approval.

876
01:09:29,736 --> 01:09:30,076
Thank you.

877
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,222
Secondly, by Council based vice president night, Mr. President, thank you very much.

878
01:09:37,203 --> 01:09:42,145
When I saw this on the agenda, it sparked my interest and I did a little bit of snooping around.

879
01:09:42,165 --> 01:09:47,348
And what I've been able to determine is the president is that this position been vacant since March of 2020.

880
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:50,549
That's 15 months that this position been vacant.

881
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,670
Now let's think back to my last year.

882
01:09:54,095 --> 01:09:55,376
O'Connor might be able to do it for us.

883
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,997
She gave us a great rundown of what's happened since March of last year.

884
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:11,882
So since March of last year, we have not had a sealer of weights and measures in this community to protect consumers from price gouging, to protect consumers from greed, to protect consumers from operators that aren't doing the right thing.

885
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:19,025
And when you think about what the sealer of weights and measures does, it's not only at the gas station, it's when you put your food on the scale at the supermarket, Mr. President.

886
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:20,933
So this is a serious issue here.

887
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:22,273
This is a very serious issue.

888
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,414
This position should have been filled.

889
01:10:23,474 --> 01:10:23,954
It's budgeted.

890
01:10:24,614 --> 01:10:25,014
It's budgeted.

891
01:10:25,034 --> 01:10:25,695
It should have been filled.

892
01:10:25,795 --> 01:10:28,756
We have an ordinance for it, but it's being paid by a stipend.

893
01:10:30,577 --> 01:10:30,957
To who?

894
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:32,257
Does anybody know?

895
01:10:33,118 --> 01:10:34,218
Nobody knows, Mr. President.

896
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,340
It's another example of transparency at its finest.

897
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:42,762
Thank you, Vice President May.

898
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:44,219
Councilor Marks.

899
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:47,501
I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

900
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:49,502
This is a very important subject.

901
01:10:50,242 --> 01:11:07,193
And when it comes to the residents of this community, I think everyone should at least rest assured that if they are getting gas or using one of our measurement devices in any stores, that at least they're paying what they should be paying, Mr. President.

902
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:10,575
So I think this is a worthy thing to track.

903
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:18,521
I would also ask, Mr. President, I believe as part of the weights and measures position, that they also check the octane of the gas.

904
01:11:19,162 --> 01:11:21,123
And they have the ability to check the octane.

905
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:23,625
And that's also another issue, Mr. President.

906
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:30,591
I'm not saying it's happening currently, but when you're paying a higher premium for a higher octane gas and you're not getting that,

907
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:40,019
That's another thing that the city is supposed to be checking to make sure that you're receiving what you're paying for, Mr. President.

908
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:42,421
So this is a job that's little known.

909
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:47,125
You don't hear much about it, but it's a very important role in our community, Mr. President.

910
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:56,513
And I think it's something that we should get an update immediately on in the interest of not only the consumers, but in the interest of

911
01:11:57,307 --> 01:12:03,112
knowing Mr. President that all our department heads are working and everyone's doing their job, Mr. President.

912
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:03,973
Thank you.

913
01:12:03,993 --> 01:12:04,653
Mr. President, on that.

914
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:09,077
Thank you, Councilor Moxon.

915
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,259
Vice President Knight.

916
01:12:11,419 --> 01:12:13,060
Councilor Knox is exactly right.

917
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,341
This is a very important position.

918
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:18,324
It's such an important position that there's actually a state agency that oversees it, the Division of Standards.

919
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:22,728
It's such an important position that sealers of weights and measures are mandated in communities, Mr. President.

920
01:12:23,187 --> 01:12:30,109
So this isn't just the job that, you know, the council wants and we can't have, this is something that we need to keep our residents safe and to keep our consumers protected.

921
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:33,851
Thank you vice president.

922
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:51,357
Mr. President, I forgot to mention also too, that the oil trucks that are located for many oil businesses in the city of method, they have to go to the city of Somerville to get their trucks checked as the president, which is usually done by weights and measures.

923
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:52,930
in every community.

924
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,631
So that's another thing that we're sending outside of the community.

925
01:12:56,971 --> 01:13:01,593
And as Councilor Falco mentioned, rightfully so, revenue is going outside of the community.

926
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:04,493
And that's something that we should be mindful of.

927
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:05,053
Thank you.

928
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,594
Councilor Falco.

929
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:18,597
To find out what the fee is for each of the inspections.

930
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,828
to gas inspections, scale inspections at the supermarket.

931
01:13:25,149 --> 01:13:26,269
If I can amend to include that.

932
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:28,610
Thank you.

933
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:40,835
So on the motion by Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Falco and seconded by Vice President Knight and two amendments by Councilor Falco.

934
01:13:41,655 --> 01:13:42,756
Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

935
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:48,518
Councilor Bears.

936
01:13:49,786 --> 01:13:50,506
Councilor Falco.

937
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:50,947
Yes.

938
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:51,867
Vice President Knight.

939
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:52,267
Yes.

940
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:52,987
Councilor Marks.

941
01:13:53,088 --> 01:13:53,448
Yes.

942
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:54,548
Councilor Morrell.

943
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:54,968
Yes.

944
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:57,650
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio.

945
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,511
Six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

946
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:14,057
21391 offered by President Kerrio, it's so resolved that the administration reach out to the town of Boston while putting a small dock that's located at the Condon Shell as mitigation as the city of Bedford receives no fees from them.

947
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:17,439
I don't know, but during the summer,

948
01:14:18,909 --> 01:14:24,654
Kayaking and canoeing and paddling has gotten very, very popular down on the river there.

949
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:26,115
A lot of people are doing it now.

950
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:29,657
Paddle Boston has been there, I think, three to four years now.

951
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:34,321
And it's a shame that when you get out of there, people gotta walk a little cutthroat in the bushes.

952
01:14:36,142 --> 01:14:42,847
I don't understand why Paddle Boston doesn't put a small dock down there so people don't have to, so they can at least

953
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:49,089
walk up to a dock and get on the boat without having to walk through the mud and just walk through bushes.

954
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:56,375
If the administration could reach out to them and say, they pay no fees.

955
01:14:56,415 --> 01:14:58,036
So some sort of mitigation.

956
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:07,203
So at least the people that do the kayaks and the canoes and boats can actually get on their boats correctly.

957
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:09,625
I think it's a safety issue too, Mr. President.

958
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:10,725
And probably a safety issue.

959
01:15:11,786 --> 01:15:12,647
So on the motion.

960
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:14,858

Councilor Falco?

988
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:08,465

Yes.

994
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:13,359
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

995
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:14,039
President Kerrio.

996
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:15,000
Yes.

997
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,203
Do we have somebody from Verizon online yet?

998
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:20,805
Yes.

999
01:16:20,845 --> 01:16:21,245
Good evening.

1000
01:16:21,265 --> 01:16:21,725
Can you hear me?

1001
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:23,387
Yes.

1002
01:16:23,487 --> 01:16:24,087
Richard Foreman.

1003
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:24,788
Yes.

1004
01:16:24,868 --> 01:16:26,749
Richard Foreman representing Verizon New England.

1005
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:27,730
Yes.

1006
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,131
Richard name and address of the record please.

1007
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:32,634
Yes.

1008
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:36,637
So this is a good location for two new four inch conduits.

1009
01:16:37,518 --> 01:16:38,979
Richard name and address of the record please.

1010
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:41,364
Yes, Richard Foreman, Verizon New England.

1011
01:16:41,384 --> 01:16:42,806
Do you have an address?

1012
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:45,709
Oh, yes.

1013
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,734
21 Oxford Road, Mansfield, Massachusetts.

1014
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:49,635
Thank you.

1015
01:16:49,655 --> 01:16:52,599
If you can give us a brief synopsis, please.

1016
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:53,220
Yes.

1017
01:16:53,996 --> 01:17:09,406
This is placement of two new four-inch conduits from existing utility pole 3311 Boston Road, extending 54 feet in a northeasterly direction to the property line of the Boston Main Railroad Terminal Division.

1018
01:17:09,486 --> 01:17:16,610
This is to provide underground communication services to the Green Line Extension Project.

1019
01:17:21,193 --> 01:17:21,433
Okay.

1020
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:24,169
And that's it.

1021
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,251
That's it.

1022
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:27,872
Mr. President.

1023
01:17:27,912 --> 01:17:28,813
Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:17:29,774 --> 01:17:30,795
A couple of quick questions.

1025
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:31,915
When will the work take place?

1026
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:44,625
If the petition is granted, generally the construction is scheduled between two and four weeks out after the petition has been secured.

1027
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:47,467
So, I mean, then,

1028
01:17:49,288 --> 01:17:57,252
the Verizon contractor would have to get out in the field and, you know, so within probably the next month or so after the petition is granted.

1029
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:02,815
And how long will the work take to complete once you're on site?

1030
01:18:03,415 --> 01:18:05,876
This would probably be a one to two day project.

1031
01:18:06,517 --> 01:18:08,618
It's a very short run of conduit.

1032
01:18:11,972 --> 01:18:13,353
It may even be just a day.

1033
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:27,360
If the road ever had to have any sort of closure, obviously there would be, I mean, closure, meaning if there needed to be like one lane during work, steel plates would be utilized, et cetera.

1034
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,681
But this is, again, this is a very short run of conduit.

1035
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:38,865
I can see that this work being completed in a day's time, maybe two days maximum.

1036
01:18:38,905 --> 01:18:40,226
Are the poles permanent?

1037
01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:44,475
Yes, this is a permanent telephone pole.

1038
01:18:44,656 --> 01:18:46,377
It's a utility pole.

1039
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,581
Thank you.

1040
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:53,983
Thank you, Mr. President.

1041
01:18:55,204 --> 01:19:04,011
And one of the conditions it mentions that there will be an interim period between the trench patch and the final restoration of the road surface of the sidewalk.

1042
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:06,093
How long do you expect that will be?

1043
01:19:11,965 --> 01:19:13,666
I'm not sure.

1044
01:19:13,886 --> 01:19:22,868
Is this project supposed to receive an entire sidewalk and roadway restoration as part of the Green Line Extension project?

1045
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,590
That is what the condition says.

1046
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,990
I was just wondering if you had any idea.

1047
01:19:30,618 --> 01:19:31,439
Um, I'm not.

1048
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:32,239
I'm not sure.

1049
01:19:32,259 --> 01:19:38,223
But, um, anytime that the road or sidewalk is disturbed, there is a complete restoration that is done.

1050
01:19:38,923 --> 01:19:41,524
It won't be a temporary cold patch or anything.

1051
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:46,868
It will be completely restored to its best possible specification.

1052
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:57,494
Well, this condition says that there will be temporary markings painted during the interim period between trench patch and final restoration.

1053
01:19:57,514 --> 01:19:57,554
So

1054
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:02,386
There will be clearly some sort of gap where we will have a temporary patch.

1055
01:20:03,526 --> 01:20:05,107
Yes, there will be a temporary patch.

1056
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:11,952
I just don't know the exact time frame of the temporary patch to when a final road restoration would be.

1057
01:20:14,073 --> 01:20:23,459
If I had to guess, this is probably part of the roadway restoration is probably part of the new station being built.

1058
01:20:25,918 --> 01:20:45,552
So the utility work with the conduits going in would strictly be to get the conduits in the ground into their specifications for having vehicles travel over the conduit and obviously having an asphalt cold patch put in so that it wasn't dirt or plates or anything in the road.

1059
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:53,738
But I do not have an accurate construction schedule for roadway refinishing or anything like that.

1060
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:55,883
Okay, thank you.

1061
01:20:56,843 --> 01:20:57,764
Thank you, Councilor Bailão.

1062
01:20:57,924 --> 01:20:58,465
Thank you, Mr. President.

1063
01:20:58,485 --> 01:20:59,586
I have one additional question.

1064
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:04,510
Do we know if there are any plans to put 5G on those telephones?

1065
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:05,771
That I am not sure of.

1066
01:21:06,711 --> 01:21:10,414
I do know that Verizon is actively working on building 5G.

1067
01:21:10,494 --> 01:21:13,537
I'm not quite sure about Medford in particular.

1068
01:21:14,177 --> 01:21:19,482
I personally am not working on the 5G project in Medford or in that area, but,

1069
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,902
Is this a question of whether the pole is safe to have 5G on it, or if it needs to be replaced?

1070
01:21:28,703 --> 01:21:36,489
I just wanted to know if there are any plans to put 5G on that telephone pole, and if you could get back to us with that if you do not have the answer.

1071
01:21:38,531 --> 01:21:40,633
Yes, I could certainly look into that.

1072
01:21:41,653 --> 01:21:46,197
It's not information I have right now at my fingertips, but I can inquire about that.

1073
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:47,478
Thank you.

1074
01:21:48,098 --> 01:21:48,399
Thank you.

1075
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:49,159
Any further questions?

1076
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:50,120
Vice President Knight.

1077
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:59,905
Um, Mr. President, um, March 1st, I reached out to, uh, my superintendent of lights and lines, Mr. Steven Randazzo.

1078
01:22:00,145 --> 01:22:10,310
And I made a request of him to remove the double pole located at three, five, seven, uh, double pole number three, five, seven, seven located at the corner of Greenleaf Avenue in Burgett Avenue.

1079
01:22:11,271 --> 01:22:19,635
And, uh, after reviewing the location, Mr. Randazzo reported back to me, there was no city owned utilities that are on that pole that need to be removed.

1080
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:29,419
As such, it will be on the utility companies to get this double pole removed, and he referred to both Verizon and National Grid, and he put a request in for that work to be done.

1081
01:22:30,139 --> 01:22:32,260
To date, this work has not been performed, Mr. President.

1082
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:38,923
I would ask that this paper be tabled until such time as the double pole, located on the corner of Burgin Ave and Greenleaf Ave, be removed and replaced.

1083
01:22:39,423 --> 01:22:39,723
Second.

1084
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:49,787
On the motion by Vice President Maye, seconded by Councilor Palco,

1085
01:22:51,720 --> 01:23:02,126
If we could also ask Verizon, how many metal poles are they on currently?

1086
01:23:03,147 --> 01:23:03,727
So moved.

1087
01:23:06,009 --> 01:23:11,332
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Powell, as amended by Councilor Mox.

1088
01:23:12,812 --> 01:23:14,053
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1089
01:23:17,435 --> 01:23:18,436
The table as amended.

1090
01:23:19,476 --> 01:23:20,037
Councilor Bears.

1091
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:21,427
Councilor Felco?

1092
01:23:21,467 --> 01:23:21,687
Yes.

1093
01:23:22,128 --> 01:23:22,828
Vice President Knight?

1094
01:23:22,908 --> 01:23:23,188
Yes.

1095
01:23:23,388 --> 01:23:23,929
Councilor Marks?

1096
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:24,449
Yes.

1097
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:25,109
Councilor Morrell?

1098
01:23:25,309 --> 01:23:25,510
Yes.

1099
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:26,970
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1100
01:23:27,571 --> 01:23:28,331
President Kerrio?

1101
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:30,092
Yes, 60 affirmative.

1102
01:23:30,492 --> 01:23:31,713
Motion passes for the table.

1103
01:23:35,415 --> 01:23:38,917
Communications from the Mayor.

1104
01:23:38,937 --> 01:23:40,338
287, May 26th, 2021.

1105
01:23:49,777 --> 01:23:56,103
Dear Mr. President, City Councilors, I respectfully request to recommend that your own body approve the following loan order.

1106
01:23:56,563 --> 01:24:02,729
City of Edmonton loan order, water bonds.

1107
01:24:02,749 --> 01:24:15,100
Be it ordered that $1,222,000 is appropriate for the purpose of making improvements to the city's water system, including constructing and reconstructing water mains and other costs incidentally related there to meet this appropriation.

1108
01:24:16,996 --> 01:24:44,517
with the approval of the mayor has authorized to borrow a set amount pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 8, Number 5 of the Mass General Laws, or pursuant to any other enabling authority, and to issue bonds or notes of the city thereafter that the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow all or a portion of such amount from the Massachusetts Water Authority pursuant to MWRA's Local Water Systems Assistance Program, and in connection therewith

1109
01:24:44,873 --> 01:25:00,921
to enter into a loan agreement and or financial assistance agreement with the MWRA, and to accept any grants for the project from the MWRA, provided that the amount of the authorized borrowing shall be reduced by the amount of any such grants received from the MWRA.

1110
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:14,747
And furthermore, that any premium received by the city upon the sale of any bonds or notes approved by this order, lest any such premium applied to the payment of costs of issuance of such bonds or notes,

1111
01:25:15,218 --> 01:25:28,847
may be applied to the payment of costs approved by this audit in accordance with Chapter 44, Section 20 of the General Laws, thereby reducing the amount authorized to be borrowed to pay such costs by a like amount.

1112
01:25:31,188 --> 01:25:45,057
And be it further resolved that the treasurer is authorized to file an application with the appropriate official of the Commonwealth of Mass to qualify under Chapter 44A of the General Laws, any and all bonds that the city is authorized to

1113
01:25:45,377 --> 01:25:54,780
to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection therewith.

1114
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:57,681
Very truly yours, Mayor Brianna Longo-Grant.

1115
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:01,223
Vice President Knight.

1116
01:26:01,563 --> 01:26:10,926
Mr. President, I would like to offer a motion to refer this matter to a committee of the whole so that the council can be able to properly vet the neighborhood infrastructure and financial impacts and aspects of this loan order.

1117
01:26:11,627 --> 01:26:11,987
Thank you.

1118
01:26:12,307 --> 01:26:12,787
Councilor Powell.

1119
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:15,114
Is there anyone off of the administration to answer questions?

1120
01:26:15,174 --> 01:26:17,395
Is there anyone from the administration here to answer some questions?

1121
01:26:18,655 --> 01:26:19,075
Tim McGiven.

1122
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:19,155
Tim?

1123
01:26:22,757 --> 01:26:26,658
Do we have any questions for Tim?

1124
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:26,999
Hi, Tim.

1125
01:26:27,259 --> 01:26:27,759
Yep, I'm here.

1126
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:28,499
I have a question.

1127
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:30,360
Tim, where is this located?

1128
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:35,182
So this is, the plan would be to do six water mains.

1129
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:44,148
with this money, Union Street, Metcalf Street, Brookings, Golden Avenue, Vista, and Guild.

1130
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:53,795
So those are undersized old six inch pipes that are leaky, unlined, and they are scheduled to be replaced.

1131
01:26:54,055 --> 01:26:56,337
So these would be upgrades to those lines.

1132
01:26:57,538 --> 01:26:57,818
Thank you.

1133
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,319
Mr. President, thank you.

1134
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,000
Mr. McKibbin, thank you very much.

1135
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:05,503
And I would second Councilor Nights motion to table.

1136
01:27:06,157 --> 01:27:08,238
to move to a committee in the whole meeting.

1137
01:27:08,859 --> 01:27:09,399
Thank you.

1138
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,381
Thank you, Mr. President.

1139
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:22,328
And I'm not sure if a city engineer can answer some of these questions, but I would ask that when we do meet that these questions be answered prior to that, Mr. President.

1140
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:29,113
One is how much do we have in the retained earnings for water and sewer enterprise accounts?

1141
01:27:30,634 --> 01:27:33,956
Last time I believe there was over 5 million in those accounts.

1142
01:27:34,593 --> 01:27:39,115
And those accounts are used, Mr. President, for infrastructure improvements.

1143
01:27:40,015 --> 01:27:42,256
And this would be an infrastructure improvement.

1144
01:27:42,577 --> 01:27:50,480
So I'm not sure why we would borrow when we have $5 million in raised money currently sitting in an account for such purposes.

1145
01:27:51,481 --> 01:28:03,406
My other question, Mr. President, is the MWRA program, assistance program, used to provide 0% finance loans to low cities and towns.

1146
01:28:03,963 --> 01:28:07,044
I believe that is still ongoing.

1147
01:28:07,544 --> 01:28:19,747
And I would ask for the last three years, if Method has utilized the allocation that we would be given for 0% finance loans for infrastructure improvements.

1148
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:23,028
And if so, how much has been used and for what projects?

1149
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:28,489
And the city administration is also referring to grants.

1150
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:33,250
Is there an active grant that the city is pursuing now

1151
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:38,101
in which they perceive will pay for this particular loan order.

1152
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:44,883
And if so, I'd like to know what the grant is that's out there, Mr. President, and if the city plans on applying.

1153
01:28:45,983 --> 01:28:46,343
Thank you.

1154
01:28:49,344 --> 01:28:50,105
Any further questions?

1155
01:28:50,685 --> 01:29:02,368
No, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Marks.

1156
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:07,752
Yes.

1157
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:07,933
Yes.

1158
01:29:07,993 --> 01:29:08,333
Yes.

1159
01:29:08,773 --> 01:29:08,974
Yes.

1160
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:09,074
Yes.

1161
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:09,414
Yes.

1162
01:29:09,534 --> 01:29:09,814
Yes.

1163
01:29:10,235 --> 01:29:10,415
Yes.

1164
01:29:10,435 --> 01:29:10,675
Yes.

1165
01:29:10,695 --> 01:29:10,856
Yes.

1166
01:29:10,956 --> 01:29:11,156
Yes.

1167
01:29:31,342 --> 01:29:43,907
If you could, I'm sorry, the council does have a section of the budget where we discussed that service and we could also probably do this in that at the same time with a council to one stone as they say.

1168
01:29:44,627 --> 01:29:47,868
So if you could have the appropriate questions answered, we appreciate it.

1169
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:50,769
Yep, I'll get those answers for you.

1170
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:52,990
Thank you.

1171
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:57,952
It was a Tuesday evening correct was a time.

1172
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:02,044
Communication with the mayor again.

1173
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:07,946
Mr. Clerk, I think that's it.

1174
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:09,927
Reports of committees.

1175
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:13,208
Reports of the committees.

1176
01:30:13,228 --> 01:30:17,629
21, I'm sorry, 2058, May 27th, 2021, Committee of the Whole.

1177
01:30:18,169 --> 01:30:25,392
This was an ongoing report regarding zoning and we'll be meeting again on Thursday in regards to this.

1178
01:30:26,272 --> 01:30:27,592
The motion to approve?

1179
01:30:28,693 --> 01:30:29,193
Move approval.

1180
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:32,754
Motion by Councilor Bears to approve, seconded by, so moved.

1181
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:34,915
Seconded by Vice President Knight.

1182
01:30:34,955 --> 01:30:36,076
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1183
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:37,577
Councilor Bears?

1184
01:30:37,617 --> 01:30:37,877
Yes.

1185
01:30:38,257 --> 01:30:38,817
Councilor Falcone?

1186
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:39,118
Yes.

1187
01:30:39,438 --> 01:30:40,118
Vice President Knight?

1188
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:40,759
Yes.

1189
01:30:40,999 --> 01:30:41,539
Councilor Marks?

1190
01:30:41,699 --> 01:30:41,979
Yes.

1191
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:42,720
Councilor Morrell?

1192
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,160
Yes.

1193
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,501
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1194
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:45,321
President Kerrio?

1195
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:45,942
Yes.

1196
01:30:46,582 --> 01:30:47,322
Motion passes.

1197
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:52,966
Before we go to public participation, just a little bit of cleanup.

1198
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:54,927
On 21388, we never actually took a roll call vote.

1199
01:30:55,517 --> 01:31:03,979
on for the Eagle Scout for the thing that, so on the motion by 213 by Councilor Mark seconded by.

1200
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:04,559
Second.

1201
01:31:04,999 --> 01:31:07,139
Second by Councilor Beers, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1202
01:31:08,979 --> 01:31:09,560
Councilor Beers.

1203
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:09,920
Yes.

1204
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,000
Councilor Falco.

1205
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,240
Yes.

1206
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,160
Vice President Knight.

1207
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:12,480
Yes.

1208
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,200
Councilor Marks.

1209
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:13,600
Yes.

1210
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,360
Councilor Morrell.

1211
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:14,760
Yes.

1212
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,001
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1213
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:16,821
President Caravaglia.

1214
01:31:17,301 --> 01:31:17,541
Yes.

1215
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:18,961
Six in front of the motion passes.

1216
01:31:20,261 --> 01:31:20,821
Mr. President.

1217
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:22,342
Councilor Falco.

1218
01:31:22,802 --> 01:31:23,202
If I may,

1219
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:30,649
Can we have received a response from the administration with regard to KP law and the 40B projects?

1220
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:34,470
I know we've- I have not seen it, Councilor Popo.

1221
01:31:34,511 --> 01:31:36,011
I know we've asked for it on multiple occasions.

1222
01:31:36,051 --> 01:31:37,572
We have packets this evening, Mr. President.

1223
01:31:37,732 --> 01:31:39,012
Is it the packet?

1224
01:31:40,573 --> 01:31:41,273
Did you get it, sir?

1225
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:44,234
On the one that was here?

1226
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:46,875
It says referred to KP law.

1227
01:31:51,247 --> 01:31:51,787
Is there a number?

1228
01:31:51,807 --> 01:31:53,729
So apparently they don't know, we have to talk to KP Law.

1229
01:31:53,769 --> 01:31:58,152
Yeah, so if I'm correct, that's the latest resolution has been referred to KP Law.

1230
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:00,813
So we don't have a number?

1231
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,655
There's no figure?

1232
01:32:03,775 --> 01:32:08,058
There's no figure, but I mean, the other resolutions, we haven't received any response back, am I correct?

1233
01:32:08,118 --> 01:32:12,921
That's correct, unless I haven't seen it, unless I've missed it.

1234
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,222
It's been months, if I'm correct.

1235
01:32:14,322 --> 01:32:16,984
I'll ask my other counselors if they've missed that, but I haven't seen it myself.

1236
01:32:19,888 --> 01:32:22,691
I don't know where it is.

1237
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:26,254
So the, the counselor asked about the 40, the 40 B projects.

1238
01:32:26,294 --> 01:32:29,257
And we did get a response this evening for that.

1239
01:32:29,297 --> 01:32:32,459
It says that it's referred to KP law for an update to the city council.

1240
01:32:32,499 --> 01:32:37,043
So we asked the administration to give us an update and they sent it to outside council.

1241
01:32:37,784 --> 01:32:44,870
Um, but then I think there's another paper that was also out there and it was how much money we pay an outside council to do the type of work.

1242
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:45,399
Correct.

1243
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:48,000
And I don't think we've gotten that response either.

1244
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,761
I think I was confused when you talked about the 40 Bs.

1245
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:59,984
I thought you were talking about the 40 Bs, not the other four or five papers that the council had passed requesting how much money that we've been spending.

1246
01:33:00,044 --> 01:33:03,305
And I think we also asked for the cost of legal on Boston Avenue also.

1247
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:06,546
Correct.

1248
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:09,187
This has been going on for months now.

1249
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:09,567
For months.

1250
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:12,428
We've asked numerous times and we've got nothing back.

1251
01:33:14,752 --> 01:33:17,573
I mean, we've asked the administration at least, I think, four times.

1252
01:33:19,955 --> 01:33:21,355
Yes.

1253
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:27,939
We've asked them at least four, I think five- Does they get to pick which tent?

1254
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:29,140
There's 365 to choose from.

1255
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:29,640
Yeah.

1256
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:42,727
Well, we've asked at least four times to provide the council with a breakdown of how much the administration has spent with KP Law regarding 40B projects, other projects,

1257
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,141
I know that other councillors have done.

1258
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,062
I mean, I've made a number of resolutions myself.

1259
01:33:47,142 --> 01:33:49,063
I know we had a joint resolution, I believe.

1260
01:33:50,304 --> 01:33:51,725
Councilor Morrell has had resolutions.

1261
01:33:51,785 --> 01:33:56,028
I think everyone behind this rail has had resolutions with regard to this same matter.

1262
01:33:57,949 --> 01:34:00,731
We've been told that the budget will be coming to us next week.

1263
01:34:03,713 --> 01:34:05,094
It'll be coming to us in a few days.

1264
01:34:05,194 --> 01:34:08,816
My concern is that how can the mayor expect this council to act on a budget

1265
01:34:11,114 --> 01:34:20,777
which is her plan for the anticipated expenditures for the next fiscal year if she cannot inform the council of the actual expenditures that she has made during the past fiscal year.

1266
01:34:22,477 --> 01:34:24,398
This has been ongoing, we've asked numerous times.

1267
01:34:25,018 --> 01:34:27,599
It makes no sense for the council to wait for a response.

1268
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:30,040
That experience tells us we'll never come.

1269
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:35,041
This council and our taxpaying residents deserve more.

1270
01:34:36,487 --> 01:34:43,810
Since our request for simple financial information is being ignored, it's my intention to file a public records request for this information.

1271
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:46,771
And it's sad, it's absolutely sad that we have to do this.

1272
01:34:48,212 --> 01:34:50,153
Because we should have had the information by now.

1273
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:55,635
You've given them ample opportunity to provide the information and they have refused.

1274
01:34:58,376 --> 01:35:04,399
I will also request a breakdown of the amount of money that the administration expended to have KP Raw represent us in land court.

1275
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:08,364
to take the position that use variances are not allowed in the city of Medford.

1276
01:35:10,386 --> 01:35:18,232
The mayor is well aware of the 2016 opinion of former city solicitor that use variances are permitted in the city of Medford.

1277
01:35:20,653 --> 01:35:27,018
I'd like to know how much the administration spent in court in its field attempt to defend a clearly baseless position.

1278
01:35:30,477 --> 01:35:37,583
By using the public records law, I will either finally receive a response, or we will all receive a response to the resolutions that we have filed.

1279
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:42,006
And if not, I will seek the intervention of Secretary of State's office.

1280
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:43,308
It's come to that point.

1281
01:35:43,728 --> 01:35:48,292
We have a budget coming to us, but yet we're getting absolutely no data when asked.

1282
01:35:51,274 --> 01:35:51,995
We deserve more.

1283
01:35:52,075 --> 01:35:53,196
The community deserves more.

1284
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:54,277
Thank you.

1285
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:55,117
Thank you, Council Member.

1286
01:35:55,658 --> 01:35:56,939
On that point, Mr. President.

1287
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:57,839
Vice President Knight,

1288
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:06,494
This isn't the first time that the councils had to use the tools of the Freedom of Information Act in order to obtain information from the administration.

1289
01:36:07,154 --> 01:36:14,397
And I find it curious that every time the information that we're looking for surrounds the Kopelman and Page law firm, that we have to go down this road.

1290
01:36:16,218 --> 01:36:22,821
Just maybe a year or so ago, I put a resolution on asking for copies of the Warren articles each month.

1291
01:36:23,422 --> 01:36:26,223
We have a big financial responsibility here in this community to approve a budget.

1292
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:28,606
Once we approve the budget, are we done with it?

1293
01:36:28,646 --> 01:36:29,407
No, absolutely not.

1294
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:30,948
We should know where that money's being spent.

1295
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:32,329
And that's what the Warren article says.

1296
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,672
It's an actual document that shows us where the money's being spent.

1297
01:36:37,433 --> 01:36:39,435
We had to fight for that document, Mr. President.

1298
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:42,297
And we didn't get it until, I think, January of this year.

1299
01:36:42,377 --> 01:36:44,158
We got eight months worth of Warren articles.

1300
01:36:44,659 --> 01:36:46,880
After begging and pleading and crying for it, we didn't get it.

1301
01:36:47,361 --> 01:36:49,782
We filed the freedom of information request and we got it.

1302
01:36:52,317 --> 01:36:59,539
I believe then we had some questions concerning payment of claims over $2,500 out of the legal department.

1303
01:36:59,559 --> 01:37:02,260
And we couldn't get any answers surrounding those questions.

1304
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:12,682
So I'm a little confused as to why there's so much secrecy and such a veil of secrecy surrounding KP law and their operations here in the city and the role that they play here in the city.

1305
01:37:12,722 --> 01:37:13,843
Cause I'm very confused by it.

1306
01:37:14,223 --> 01:37:17,144
When we asked the city solicitor for opinion, they said they sent it to KP law.

1307
01:37:17,224 --> 01:37:18,224
That's not what we asked you to do.

1308
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:20,385
A city ordinance is very clear.

1309
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:22,045
The city solicitor gives the opinion.

1310
01:37:22,783 --> 01:37:23,963
That's what controls and dictates.

1311
01:37:24,244 --> 01:37:27,505
She's the only one that has the legal authority to do such, not KP Law.

1312
01:37:28,145 --> 01:37:33,487
So when KP Law offers an opinion, it's not even worth the paper it's written on because they don't have the statutory authority to write it.

1313
01:37:34,308 --> 01:37:42,551
So I'm very confused as to what's going on, Mr. President, with the administration in terms of this lack of transparency when it comes to spending and fiscal accountability.

1314
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:44,031
Thank you.

1315
01:37:44,852 --> 01:37:45,092
Thank you.

1316
01:37:46,572 --> 01:37:46,953
Good evening.

1317
01:37:46,993 --> 01:37:47,953
Name and address of the record, please.

1318
01:37:51,603 --> 01:37:52,484
My name's Jean Nuzzo.

1319
01:37:52,504 --> 01:37:53,844
I live at 35 Parris Street.

1320
01:37:55,065 --> 01:38:19,341
Again, I just would like to remind everybody, as well as those watching, the use variance claim was come about by the Locust Street project that was oversized, that residents fought to get more realistically sized, which comes with its own loopholes in the agreement and settlement that you all came to.

1321
01:38:20,947 --> 01:38:31,951
We were in court over a use variance because it was up for discussion because particular council members.

1322
01:38:32,751 --> 01:38:38,833
The use variance that the council is talking about to do with the Titan gas station property, not 61 Locust Street Inn.

1323
01:38:39,834 --> 01:38:45,016
The speaker keeps saying we, we, we, and I'm wondering if who's we, is she an employee of the administration?

1324
01:38:45,096 --> 01:38:46,816
Is she on a board or a commission for the administration?

1325
01:38:46,876 --> 01:38:48,817
Or does she practice some sort of official government role?

1326
01:38:49,837 --> 01:39:07,810
We as in we the people, the residents of Medford asked for that to be done, because there was some discussion about whether use variance was allowed, because there is a conflict that was in the codified document that was on file.

1327
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:09,952
That is what occurred.

1328
01:39:10,772 --> 01:39:12,033
It was brought forward.

1329
01:39:12,433 --> 01:39:16,096
And that was the initial just you can shake your head no, but

1330
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:22,260
The court, if I'm not mistaken, the court said that we had no status in the case.

1331
01:39:22,881 --> 01:39:24,964
Yes, recently that was the ruling.

1332
01:39:25,024 --> 01:39:28,990
But the reason it went to court is because there was some discussion about it.

1333
01:39:29,647 --> 01:39:32,090
And an opinion is just that, an opinion.

1334
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:33,731
Vice President Knight, that's not accurate.

1335
01:39:33,771 --> 01:39:36,634
This council remedied that misclarification.

1336
01:39:36,774 --> 01:39:41,759
The city solicitor put out an opinion saying that it was a Scribner's error, that these variances were allowed.

1337
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,103
And then this council went and took a vote and adopted the city solicitor's opinion and corrected the Scribner's error.

1338
01:39:46,363 --> 01:39:54,551
And that was well before this administration took place and well before this administration appointed the alternate that made the decision as chairman on the Titans gas station project.

1339
01:39:54,993 --> 01:39:58,155
Point of information.

1340
01:39:58,195 --> 01:39:59,396
None of this is on the agenda.

1341
01:40:00,237 --> 01:40:01,758
I think we should stop discussion there.

1342
01:40:01,918 --> 01:40:02,258
Thank you.

1343
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:08,922
Could I request a copy of that information to be sent because that is not my recollection and I don't have a date of that occurring.

1344
01:40:09,102 --> 01:40:11,164
I was following very closely.

1345
01:40:11,224 --> 01:40:12,565
How would I go about doing?

1346
01:40:12,845 --> 01:40:14,486
You could ask the law department.

1347
01:40:15,066 --> 01:40:18,149
So I have to go through the law department for you to get that information.

1348
01:40:18,249 --> 01:40:19,469
It's incorrect, but I'll do it.

1349
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:20,010
Thank you.

1350
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:20,970
2016 June.

1351
01:40:24,949 --> 01:40:25,890
Public participation.

1352
01:40:28,311 --> 01:40:29,972
Public participation.

1353
01:40:29,992 --> 01:40:33,075
Joseph A. Bignone, 444, 446 Charles Street, Mall of the Mass.

1354
01:40:33,595 --> 01:40:38,718
Joseph A. Bignone would like a discussion of public participation about public accommodation.

1355
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:48,525
A place of public accommodation as defined in Mass General Law, Chapter 272, Section 892A includes any place open to and serving the public.

1356
01:40:49,317 --> 01:40:51,398
Good evening, gentlemen and ladies.

1357
01:40:51,738 --> 01:40:55,759
Yes, Joe Villalon, 446 Charles Street, Malden, Massachusetts 148.

1358
01:40:56,099 --> 01:41:03,722
I'll be sending a proposal to the mayor to open a public accommodation television station in the center of town.

1359
01:41:04,482 --> 01:41:07,783
Now, this is something Mayor McGlynn's tribunal offered up.

1360
01:41:07,843 --> 01:41:17,747
And the reason I do this is it's great that there's a station at the high school, and that's good for the students, and it's good for the city council, but it's critical

1361
01:41:18,385 --> 01:41:22,908
with 154 days to the election, that candidates get their own programs.

1362
01:41:24,129 --> 01:41:30,874
Without this, it's tilted towards the incumbents on the school committee, on the city council, and even the mayor.

1363
01:41:31,454 --> 01:41:47,365
So I think it's very important that since the students kind of get first dibs on the TV station, and the city council gets a lot of attention from the station manager, I think it's really important and it can be done very quickly, quick buildup because

1364
01:41:47,994 --> 01:41:53,237
We can now put cameras out there that travel over the cell phone liners.

1365
01:41:55,078 --> 01:42:06,325
It's not a deal anymore, but a little shop somewhere in Medford where people can go in and there's no quarry check for candidates for public office, because I think that's a little crazy too.

1366
01:42:06,365 --> 01:42:10,167
It should be suspended for candidates for public office because

1367
01:42:10,697 --> 01:42:18,780
It's intrusive, and if someone's gonna run for office, I don't think there should be an advantage that someone might see a quarry and tell someone, oh, that person running for office.

1368
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:29,644
You know, I mean, we know there's a situation with one of the other bodies here in Medford that no one knew someone was, you know, not on the up and not never told.

1369
01:42:29,684 --> 01:42:33,805
He did his time, but the problem was he never told the public.

1370
01:42:34,325 --> 01:42:38,967
So the public was not informed of this individual, and I voted for that person when I lived in Medford.

1371
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:43,381
So the other thing, and there's only three issues, I'll be rather brief.

1372
01:42:45,462 --> 01:42:51,124
Like we don't have a city charter that's renewed, the policies and procedures are antiquated.

1373
01:42:51,685 --> 01:42:52,845
They need to be updated.

1374
01:42:52,945 --> 01:42:54,326
I'd be happy to help the mayor.

1375
01:42:55,206 --> 01:42:57,147
I got a little bit of experience starting in 1979.

1376
01:42:57,267 --> 01:43:06,131
It would be good to update, just as we need to update the city charter, we need to have updated policies and procedures.

1377
01:43:06,171 --> 01:43:06,971
They're antiquated.

1378
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:09,871
They're wrong for public accommodation.

1379
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:11,431
And that's why I put the law down.

1380
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:13,311
I thank you, council president for reading it.

1381
01:43:14,372 --> 01:43:16,792
But it's, this is a democracy.

1382
01:43:16,852 --> 01:43:17,653
This is America.

1383
01:43:17,713 --> 01:43:20,693
I don't want to feel like I'm in Texas and voter rights being stripped.

1384
01:43:21,434 --> 01:43:26,655
And I believe public access TV is something pivotal to an election.

1385
01:43:28,656 --> 01:43:31,316
It clears up the council chambers and you don't have to listen to me.

1386
01:43:31,376 --> 01:43:33,697
I could be on the access station saying the same thing.

1387
01:43:34,115 --> 01:43:37,996
But here we are and I would rather be there guys and gals than here.

1388
01:43:39,157 --> 01:43:40,397
So it's just logical.

1389
01:43:41,597 --> 01:43:43,338
We really need to do this for an election.

1390
01:43:43,478 --> 01:43:50,980
It is, it's somehow, it keeps the voters and the candidates from having access.

1391
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:56,342
So I'm not asking the council to vote because the mayor is the issuing authority.

1392
01:43:56,382 --> 01:43:57,482
So this is going to the mayor.

1393
01:43:58,582 --> 01:44:00,543
It's a proposal and I thank you for letting me

1394
01:44:02,181 --> 01:44:04,243
put this idea out there in the general public.

1395
01:44:04,463 --> 01:44:04,823
Thank you.

1396
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:06,044
Thank you.

1397
01:44:08,726 --> 01:44:10,168
Any further public participation?

1398
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:12,970
Good evening.

1399
01:44:12,990 --> 01:44:14,051
Name and address of the record, please.

1400
01:44:14,491 --> 01:44:19,235
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.

1401
01:44:19,976 --> 01:44:31,365
Last week, we had an interesting conversation that you started, Mr. President, regarding this little bit of an island that supposedly has found its way at the corner of Woburn and High Street and Hastings Lane.

1402
01:44:31,898 --> 01:44:44,782
I spent some time during this past week, once again, speaking to bus drivers, members of our fire department, as it relates to the question that I believe the council asked, and I don't think any of you ever got the answer.

1403
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:49,764
Whose idea was it to authorize, to put that file in there, in the middle of the street?

1404
01:44:50,924 --> 01:45:00,107
And if you can just anticipate as bus drivers do, and as a fire truck would do, in an emergency, snowstorm, whatever it might be, just take one of those big,

1405
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:02,335
tankers to deliver gas.

1406
01:45:03,175 --> 01:45:13,880
And in the wintertime, if in fact they happen to be coming down the street and there's some ice or whatever it might be, what about the bike people where the bike lane no longer exists anymore and it's not to be found?

1407
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:22,804
And if they ever decide to put that bike lane in the middle of the street in between the two islands that are there, not the single one, the two islands there, you've got a real serious problem.

1408
01:45:23,344 --> 01:45:28,226
So my question to you, Mr. President, is the city engineers still online?

1409
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:36,674
Um, I had, we had, that was my, it was, that was my motion to, uh, request a, obviously it's how the city, uh, engineer let that happen.

1410
01:45:36,954 --> 01:45:37,354
Right.

1411
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:38,575
And that's me.

1412
01:45:38,655 --> 01:45:40,757
Uh, do we get an answer?

1413
01:45:41,037 --> 01:45:42,518
I did not see a response to my package.

1414
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:43,939
Is he still online?

1415
01:45:43,959 --> 01:45:44,740
Can we ask the question?

1416
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,422
Um, the traffic engineer is not online.

1417
01:45:47,562 --> 01:45:48,703
What about the city engineer?

1418
01:45:48,863 --> 01:45:53,266
I'm quite sure an engineering plan has to take place to put that in.

1419
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:55,808
Unfortunately, he's not online.

1420
01:45:56,580 --> 01:46:00,202
So with that being said, Mr. President, they continue to keep going on and doing work.

1421
01:46:00,702 --> 01:46:11,808
If you just take a look at the idea, if in case there's an emergency and a fire truck has to make it down that street and make that left-handed turn in a snowstorm, you have a problem just facing you.

1422
01:46:12,008 --> 01:46:15,970
You've got a bump out coming out there on the corner of Woolman and High Street.

1423
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:19,992
And it's just, how do you allow things like this to happen?

1424
01:46:20,012 --> 01:46:20,993
I'm not saying the council.

1425
01:46:21,484 --> 01:46:30,972
I would hope that the council would make a concerted effort to have the city stop that process and actually go out there and look at it, okay?

1426
01:46:31,513 --> 01:46:36,397
That path coming down on the corner of Hastings, you've seen it, we've talked about this.

1427
01:46:37,939 --> 01:46:40,862
That thing is so narrow, it's an accident waiting to happen.

1428
01:46:41,323 --> 01:46:44,186
And is that what the city has to do, wait for the accident to happen.

1429
01:46:44,706 --> 01:46:49,933
Correct it before that even happens, and the island should be as a matter of fact they're keeping both islands there.

1430
01:46:52,235 --> 01:47:00,060
Whoever comes up with bad enough going down high street toward West Midland right near opposite the Brooks School, there's a bumper right in front of somebody's house.

1431
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,881
It makes no sense.

1432
01:47:02,621 --> 01:47:03,982
Who comes up with these ideas?

1433
01:47:04,523 --> 01:47:07,044
I mean, it would be nice if you want to talk about public safety.

1434
01:47:07,324 --> 01:47:07,945
That's okay.

1435
01:47:07,965 --> 01:47:12,367
It would be nice to maybe have the council think about it or have them involved with it.

1436
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:14,088
And I don't know if these are state people.

1437
01:47:14,389 --> 01:47:17,931
I don't know if these are city contractors or if this is the city itself that's doing it.

1438
01:47:18,531 --> 01:47:27,675
But between the bump outs and that section right there, right there on the corner of High Street, Hastings Lane and Rubin Street, that is a disaster waiting to happen.

1439
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:35,659
And I would hope this council takes an aggressive action and holds the city accountable and not continue further with that and get rid of that island.

1440
01:47:35,719 --> 01:47:37,059
It just makes no sense at all.

1441
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:43,562
You'd have to be a complete moron not to understand coming down High Street, that road is so narrow,

1442
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:45,999
Just think of it.

1443
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:48,380
Both ways, both ways, Mr. President.

1444
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,560
Both ways.

1445
01:47:49,901 --> 01:47:54,002
And it's a shame that none of you have gotten an answer back and you asked for that a week ago.

1446
01:47:54,442 --> 01:47:56,423
Public safety and not even an answer.

1447
01:47:57,544 --> 01:48:03,386
For those who don't live in that neighborhood, Route 60 is a major truck route.

1448
01:48:03,446 --> 01:48:09,209
If you go by there, you see oil tankers delivering gasoline oil all day and night.

1449
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:11,670
You see tractor trailers coming down there.

1450
01:48:13,103 --> 01:48:20,450
are we going to wait till like a similar thing happened at the other end of Route 60 where the truck tipped over and all the oil went into the river?

1451
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:26,194
Again, I've talked to some people from waste management, they're saying they're having a hard time being by there.

1452
01:48:26,635 --> 01:48:31,138
I talked to the fire department, they're saying that's going to be a tough turn and we haven't even got to the winter.

1453
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:35,222
When you traverse that road coming up in the dark,

1454
01:48:35,818 --> 01:48:37,780
That island comes right on top of you with no light on it.

1455
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,521
And you've got the bumper right over there as well.

1456
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:40,582
You've got the bumper right there.

1457
01:48:40,882 --> 01:48:41,923
Very, very dangerous.

1458
01:48:41,983 --> 01:48:51,570
I'm picking up one other point that Council Marks alluded to, because apparently there's been no updating as to the streets, as the sidewalks being a little bit wider in the bike lane.

1459
01:48:51,650 --> 01:49:00,037
So since none of that has taken place, and you have people coming down High Street in that bike lane, they're going to traverse right into that middle of maybe 8 to 10 feet wide.

1460
01:49:01,402 --> 01:49:06,246
It's just, it's just, I don't know where the bike safety people are in this either.

1461
01:49:06,586 --> 01:49:13,651
I would hope one of you on this council would make a motion to just put a stop in that project to fully have a complete public safety review.

1462
01:49:13,951 --> 01:49:16,133
So unfortunately, Councilman, it's already up.

1463
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:18,395
It's up and it can also be taken down.

1464
01:49:18,415 --> 01:49:19,916
It has to be taken down I think.

1465
01:49:20,176 --> 01:49:20,436
Yes.

1466
01:49:20,976 --> 01:49:23,238
We have somebody with the hands up.

1467
01:49:23,518 --> 01:49:24,759
Pascal Sias.

1468
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:26,961
Pascal?

1469
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:30,908
Do you have your hand up?

1470
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:31,789
Yeah, I do.

1471
01:49:31,809 --> 01:49:38,150
All right, Pascal, name and address of the record, please.

1472
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:41,751
All right, Pascal, 231 Riverside Avenue.

1473
01:49:43,331 --> 01:49:43,711
Okay.

1474
01:49:46,232 --> 01:49:47,852
Did you want to speak on the high street project?

1475
01:49:52,494 --> 01:50:03,717
So no, I was looking for a chance to speak on some other like civic topics that we could probably talk about.

1476
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:09,499
If you could hold on a second, and let the gentleman at the rail finish, and we'll call on you next.

1477
01:50:10,339 --> 01:50:10,820
All right.

1478
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,180
I thank you for listening.

1479
01:50:12,543 --> 01:50:14,284
I know you've seen it, we've had this discussion.

1480
01:50:15,225 --> 01:50:19,387
And again, I would something, hopefully, you know, things are made to be corrected.

1481
01:50:19,407 --> 01:50:20,928
That's why there's a racist on pencils.

1482
01:50:20,968 --> 01:50:26,511
And that's why sometimes having something like this really be taken a look at in the interest of public safety.

1483
01:50:27,111 --> 01:50:28,412
I think it makes a lot of sense.

1484
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:28,932
Thank you.

1485
01:50:29,172 --> 01:50:29,513
Thank you.

1486
01:50:30,733 --> 01:50:36,076
Okay, uh, Pascal says, let's go.

1487
01:50:44,766 --> 01:50:45,066
and the

1488
01:50:59,391 --> 01:51:05,776
I'm from the Medford public high school and just as a Little thing that we're doing there.

1489
01:51:05,876 --> 01:51:07,537
I'm trying to speak on civic issues.

1490
01:51:08,378 --> 01:51:25,832
So I'm also trying to like go over stuff from or stuff about like Policing and stuff, you know some important issues that are a big issue in like throughout the United States I'm also trying to see how what we're doing about it in Medford and

1491
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:30,567
What is your question?

1492
01:51:35,982 --> 01:52:03,362
you recognize how a lot of issues right with like stuff problems that happen to i guess mainly like black or minority groups when it comes to police happens because you're mainly calling police who don't necessarily need to be called for certain situations so like something like traffic stops right police are meant to be armed and it's necessary because they need to be prepared for certain situations but

1493
01:52:04,183 --> 01:52:15,248
At the same time, though, for something like a traffic stop, it's not entirely reasonable for someone who's reasonably armed to be taking care of situations like that.

1494
01:52:16,089 --> 01:52:24,693
So I'm wondering if, like, if you guys or just people at Medford, right, are taking actions to go towards

1495
01:52:25,473 --> 01:52:37,557
other possibilities like getting other people in public services so that the police aren't usually just this one catch-all answer to anything you need to call when it comes to 9-1-1 or calling 9-1-1.

1496
01:52:37,597 --> 01:52:45,480
Well when you call 9-1-1 you need to get a police or a fire response or an ambulance.

1497
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:47,721
But because

1498
01:52:49,656 --> 01:52:52,918
especially when it comes to like escalation of situations, right?

1499
01:52:53,618 --> 01:53:01,622
It's not always necessary to have someone who, you know, who may potentially like bring a situation farther than it needs to go.

1500
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:15,428
You know, you wouldn't want a case like in Louisville or in other places, right, where police end up bringing a situation too far where they end up feeling like they need to use their firearms or stuff like that.

1501
01:53:16,069 --> 01:53:18,810
So having other things you can call, like,

1502
01:53:19,318 --> 01:53:30,364
other, uh, other like, uh, service workers besides like police people who could specialize in certain situations so that you don't have to call them.

1503
01:53:31,665 --> 01:53:41,651
Um, well, I would suggest, um, you contact the police chief and, uh, and ask him for his guidance because the only emergency numbers we have are the, uh, the police, fire and ambulance.

1504
01:53:42,371 --> 01:53:43,632
And they're the ones that respond to

1505
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:45,441
those calls.

1506
01:53:45,581 --> 01:53:54,367
So my suggestion would be that you should contact the chief and speak to him about how you think these calls should be responded to.

1507
01:53:54,787 --> 01:53:55,928
Mr. President, if I may.

1508
01:53:55,948 --> 01:53:56,508
Councilor Bez.

1509
01:53:57,529 --> 01:54:00,091
I definitely agree with President Caraviello.

1510
01:54:00,131 --> 01:54:07,496
I think reaching out to the police department directly, as well as reaching out to the mayor's office who supervises the police would be a good venue for this question.

1511
01:54:08,116 --> 01:54:09,457
And I also just want to thank you.

1512
01:54:10,398 --> 01:54:13,140
As a student at Medford High School, I know it takes a lot of courage to

1513
01:54:13,998 --> 01:54:14,999
speak in front of the public.

1514
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:21,083
And I want to thank you for taking some time to learn about civics and ask a question of your city council.

1515
01:54:21,544 --> 01:54:21,924
Thank you.

1516
01:54:23,125 --> 01:54:23,765
Thank you, Mr. President.

1517
01:54:23,785 --> 01:54:24,746
I just want to echo councilor bears.

1518
01:54:24,766 --> 01:54:31,071
I want to thank you Pascal for taking the time to attend the whole meeting and wait to the end and speak on something you're passionate about.

1519
01:54:31,151 --> 01:54:33,633
And yeah, it takes a lot of bravery to speak in front of a crowd.

1520
01:54:33,653 --> 01:54:34,553
So thank you.

1521
01:54:34,613 --> 01:54:35,514
And I commend you for doing it.

1522
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:38,596
Thank you.

1523
01:54:46,343 --> 01:54:46,823
Okay.

1524
01:54:49,124 --> 01:54:49,765
Thank you, Pastor.

1525
01:54:49,925 --> 01:54:50,385
Thank you.

1526
01:54:52,086 --> 01:54:54,647
Do we have anything else for public participation this evening?

1527
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:57,288
Okay.

1528
01:54:59,429 --> 01:55:01,951
The records of May 25th, 2021.

1529
01:55:02,071 --> 01:55:05,612
The past the Council of Beds.

1530
01:55:05,913 --> 01:55:07,053
I found the records.

1531
01:55:07,193 --> 01:55:09,774
I found the records precise and I move approval.

1532
01:55:11,395 --> 01:55:12,796
The motion by Council Beds.

1533
01:55:13,427 --> 01:55:16,872
Seconded by Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1534
01:55:17,573 --> 01:55:18,154

1535

Yes.

1536
01:55:18,815 --> 01:55:19,476
Councilor Falcone?

1537
01:55:19,696 --> 01:55:19,957
Yes.

1538
01:55:19,977 --> 01:55:20,658
Vice President Knight?

1539
01:55:20,798 --> 01:55:21,078
Yes.

1540
01:55:21,179 --> 01:55:21,739
Councilor Marks?

1541
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:22,420
Yes.

1542
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,081
Councilor Morrell?

1543
01:55:23,282 --> 01:55:23,502
Yes.

1544
01:55:23,702 --> 01:55:24,764
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1545
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:25,545
President Kerrio?

1546
01:55:25,645 --> 01:55:25,885
Yes.

1547
01:55:26,426 --> 01:55:28,089
The affirmative, motion passes.

1548
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:28,810
Mr. President.

1549
01:55:29,635 --> 01:55:30,336
Councilor Mox.

1550
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:46,709
Mr. President, I would just ask that where we have an increase in public participation here at the chamber, that the chairs be set up, Mr. President, formally to conduct business here and accommodate the increase of public participation here.

1551
01:55:46,769 --> 01:55:49,652
I'll take care of that this week, William.

1552
01:55:49,732 --> 01:55:50,352
Councilor Mox.

1553
01:55:52,174 --> 01:55:53,275
On a motion to adjourn.

1554
01:55:53,615 --> 01:55:56,097
Mr. President.

1555
01:55:56,537 --> 01:55:56,938
Councilor Mox.

1556
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:01,433
Mr. President, we had a loss of a longtime Method resident.

1557
01:56:01,453 --> 01:56:09,439
I just found out about Richard Sullivan, better known as Dick Sullivan, Dickie Sullivan, from the West Method area.

1558
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:13,522
Many of us knew Dick Sullivan, Mr. President.

1559
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:17,725
He was a longtime resident of the West Method area.

1560
01:56:18,125 --> 01:56:24,510
You'd always see him frequent the businesses and stores at the West Method Spa and a number of stores there, Mr. President.

1561
01:56:25,054 --> 01:56:30,878
and we recently lost Richard Dickey Sullivan, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1562
01:56:31,378 --> 01:56:31,738
Thank you.

1563
01:56:32,038 --> 01:56:46,287
If we could take a moment of silence.

1564
01:56:46,307 --> 01:56:47,087
Motion to adjourn.

1565
01:56:48,528 --> 01:56:48,768
Bye.

1566
01:56:49,789 --> 01:56:49,869
Bye.

1567

seconded by Councilor Perks.

1568
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:57,911
