1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:00,811
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,559
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.

3
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:21,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad Terry's still doing this.

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it one year ago.

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know why I'm doing it.

8
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:31,666
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the same venture, you know, considering what happened in Newport.

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

11
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

12
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I've been so disturbed by the media for so many years.

13
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:41,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I wanted to create a situation where I go on YouTube, and I'm constantly getting hate comments from people.

14
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,683
And I get nervous.

15
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:43,284
I watch them.

16
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:47,890
Okay, hold and drop.

17
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,032
It happens very quickly.

18
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:49,953
It's very pleasant.

19
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

20
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

21
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

22
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:21,976
I mean, I have to laugh at myself.

23
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,778
I'm watching dirty water come out of the rug.

24
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We're down to Wednesday.

25
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:53,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to the day.

26
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,431
It does distract me, yeah.

27
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:18,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel my brain lighting up.

28
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,284
Oh yeah, yeah, it's a theater crowd.

29
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Mic check, check, one, two, three, one, two, three.

30
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:36,984
[SPEAKER_01]: or 5 6 7 8 9

31
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

32
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:16,449
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is... Oh, that call-and-response.

33
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my gosh.

34
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,312
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

35
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:37,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to another live monthly presentation of Fresh Fridays, words and music rebranded, painted, and sanded for March, Women's History Month.

36
00:05:42,522 --> 00:06:03,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We are happy to be with you tonight following up a special edition of the program for Black History Month that featured a dynamic conversation with the Royal House and Slave Quarters, Dr. Kiara Singleton, and an epic set of music with Athene Wilson and Rawlins Ross, both great friends of the program here at 111 Arlington Street.

37
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:11,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks as always to the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council,

38
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: for supporting us.

39
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:28,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So even as spring begins to tease us with warmer temperatures and longer days, we want to remind you that COVID and RSV and a bunch of other new flus are still out there.

40
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:33,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

41
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,347
[SPEAKER_08]: So masking is welcome, but not required.

42
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:43,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And as always, we're just happy to be sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC.

43
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:56,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Given all of the craziness in the environment, we want to be a safe place and a refuge where folks can come and unburden themselves just a little bit from the daily newsreel.

44
00:06:56,758 --> 00:07:02,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're glad to see you, our friends, our neighbors, and our supporters coming through the door.

45
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for being here.

46
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:13,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks also to our other event sponsor, Kevin Harrington back there with Medford Community Media.

47
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:30,102
[SPEAKER_08]: They consistently guide us as we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media, channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon, as well as on the MCM YouTube channel.

48
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:37,930
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're out there watching the show on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show.

49
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been hosting this program for over eight years now.

50
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:47,553
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably have 70 plus shows in the can, as they say.

51
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:57,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been privileged to talk and chat with some tremendous teachers, leaders, and storytellers, and historians at this small table.

52
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:03,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Words and Music has given me the great opportunity to bring a lot of those folks to your attention.

53
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight is no exception, so I hope you're ready for something, all things in fact, insightful and delightful.

54
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:17,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So our guest, delightful, our guest for this portion

55
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:20,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, catch up now.

56
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:20,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

57
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody catch up.

58
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:35,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Our guest for this portion of the evening's program is an eminent historian in Medford and has been telling this fine city's ages-old stories for more years than she might be willing to admit.

59
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:44,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Please allow me to introduce to some and reacquaint with others my friend, the esteemed Dee Morris.

60
00:08:50,427 --> 00:09:01,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Dee Morris is a local historian, consultant, and author who specializes in 19th and 20th century history of greater Boston and, of course, the city of Medford.

61
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:06,258
[SPEAKER_08]: She presents programs at libraries, schools, and historical societies.

62
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:16,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Her walking tours include explorations of cemeteries and neighborhoods with an emphasis on connecting people to their civic ancestors.

63
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:22,910
[SPEAKER_08]: audience then have the opportunity to appreciate some of the men and women who have shaped our communities.

64
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:42,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Dee has been sensitive to and showed a great fondness to the historical prominence of West Medford, showing a very high regard for the work and wisdom of Doc Counts and the Medford Historical Society in keeping the accomplishments of the many local history makers top of mind.

65
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:52,218
[SPEAKER_08]: She has authored concise, accessible histories of both Medford and Somerville, as well as a primer on Boston's golden age of spiritualism.

66
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good if you like to live on the edge with seances and mediums and the moderately spooky.

67
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:08,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I like to share a bit of verse to help shape the evening.

68
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:19,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're going to crisscross a number of social dynamics in local women's history, I picked one to highlight, the American women's suffrage movement.

69
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:24,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So this piece is called Hearth and Home, a Suffrage Poem.

70
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if I can find it here.

71
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

72
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:35,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here we go.

73
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:38,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

74
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:42,081
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was a snake, it would have bit me in my eye.

75
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,063
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

76
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearth and Home, a suffrage poem.

77
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave your suffrage in the kitchen.

78
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not give you such permission.

79
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,813
[SPEAKER_08]: For all your hoping and ambition, all your thoughts of this sedition.

80
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the time nor the place for you to show a twisted face.

81
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Save your passion for our nights and stop thinking about your rights.

82
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:12,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me explain the way things are, so you'll not seek to raise the blah.

83
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,425
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a man's world, straight and true.

84
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Men are the red, the white, and the blue.

85
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you raising such a stink?

86
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to push up to the brink?

87
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Demanding the franchise and the voice?

88
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Demanding new freedoms and a choice?

89
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Abolition did not pry loose this liberty you now produce.

90
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,422
[SPEAKER_08]: The slaver's yoke is barely cold.

91
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't allow a move so bold.

92
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:43,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Barefoot and pregnant, that's the lot that suits you best, our forebears taught.

93
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Manage the home and the hearth and stay removed from the politics of the day.

94
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:58,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, there'll be Negroes standing before us, raising the roof in an angry chorus, suing for more and itching to try, seizing this mandate you'd apply.

95
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,382
[SPEAKER_08]: How is your gender suited to lead, aside from babies you suckle and feed?

96
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you suddenly so hell-bent?

97
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,645
[SPEAKER_08]: This ballot for you was never meant.

98
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You will upset the apple cart, taking such causes to your heart.

99
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:19,983
[SPEAKER_08]: No, rather roll within your lane, and from such privilege, please abstain.

100
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,585
[SPEAKER_08]: We will fight you tooth and nail, all your zeal to no avail.

101
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:28,789
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no road to blaze a trail.

102
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,111
[SPEAKER_08]: To leave your mark, you won't prevail.

103
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:36,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't abide you suffragettes marching on us like army cadets.

104
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:41,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Your flags and banners all ablaze will never change our manly ways.

105
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,165
[SPEAKER_08]: History's course will prove our mettle.

106
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:47,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Please go back to the sink and settle.

107
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Put some water in the kettle.

108
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:52,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Arrange pink roses by each petal.

109
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:54,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep the children quiet and neat.

110
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,460
[SPEAKER_08]: My paper and pipe next to my seat.

111
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps I'll let you rub my feet.

112
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,805
[SPEAKER_08]: That will make my day complete.

113
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me recount for the dim of wit.

114
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,959
[SPEAKER_08]: The voter's booth is closed.

115
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,040
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

116
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,423
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a man's world, straight and true.

117
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:18,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Men are the red, the white, and the blue.

118
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so now that I got everybody mad at me,

119
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:34,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to go back in and clean things up.

120
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:39,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have a friendly chat with Dee Morris.

121
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:49,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So Dee, if I can prevail upon you, will you talk a little bit about your educational background and what attracted you to the study of history?

122
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:55,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was in college, BC, and then went on for my master's degree.

123
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was majoring in English.

124
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it, because it's words.

125
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I love words.

126
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, what words do.

127
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.

128
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm nosy.

129
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say curious, but nosy is probably much more accurate.

130
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:20,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I would talk to people, and I'd say, OK, where are you from?

131
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,133
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like?

132
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:24,714
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your fears?

133
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:29,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started saying to myself, that's history.

134
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't want to get into history because it seemed to me it was just stories about rich white guys.

135
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really, ugh, enough with money.

136
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:48,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a lot of that today, I think.

137
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:58,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so much of, you know, and this one did that, and then he invented this, and he made a zillion dollars and lived sort of happily ever after.

138
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he really?

139
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:07,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about women in his life and kids and other things?

140
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would never be much written about that.

141
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:14,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, OK, I'm nosy.

142
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:19,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to Mount Auburn.

143
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to save a community garden.

144
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:33,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew the guy whose land it was on was a Cambridge horticulturist, and he was buried at Mount Auburn, so I said, cool.

145
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went over, no monument, zip, an empty lot.

146
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went back to the office and said, so what's going on here?

147
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, he went bankrupt.

148
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:49,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

149
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:54,771
[SPEAKER_01]: He lost his money, and nobody knows who he is today.

150
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:07,639
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just starting out the Friends of Mount Auburn, so I approached them and said, I would like to do a walking tour about Charles Mason Hovey.

151
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:09,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, who the hell is he?

152
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, because you don't know about him.

153
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: He was huge, not only in Cambridge, but across the United States.

154
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:19,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK.

155
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got 25 people, and off we went.

156
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:37,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to learn about his family, his friends, his triumphs, his tragedies, the fact his son helped found the Rose Parade in California.

157
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:41,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, whoa, I love this.

158
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So that started me off.

159
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:46,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it's a great story, it's a great story.

160
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:55,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So, why these days in particular do you feel so compelled to research and talk about the local history?

161
00:16:56,945 --> 00:17:03,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've got some damn great people in Medford and surrounding towns.

162
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:09,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these people, maybe in their day they were known, maybe not.

163
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,112
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, it's just, oh yeah, they're a footnote, if that.

164
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:22,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm convinced, I talk about civic ancestors a lot.

165
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you reach back in history,

166
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:29,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you were born, you went to high school, you know, that whole speech that you get.

167
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,854
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who came before us, they're related to us.

168
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll help.

169
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:44,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can learn from their triumphs, their mistakes, what they thought of, what they were afraid of.

170
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:48,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a comfort to me.

171
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it becomes a comfort to others.

172
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:59,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we, dare I say, get inspired to go forward and maybe do something cool.

173
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:01,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because of them.

174
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:18,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was my sense in deciding that I wanted to have this conversation with you that you would touch on that whole notion of we'll sink or swim together and if we're not,

175
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:24,889
[SPEAKER_08]: cognizant of what's going on with each other, it's going to be really hard for us to... We're not going to make it.

176
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:34,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have to be not only connected to the past, but then connected with each other, because that's the only way we're going to do it.

177
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:35,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, absolutely.

178
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you know, some of it's easy, you know, and obviously... Says you.

179
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:50,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm... See, if I knew you were going to be trouble, you know... But that's all right, that's all right.

180
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm up for the challenge.

181
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm up for the challenge.

182
00:18:53,367 --> 00:19:01,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I wanted to ask you about is what challenges you may have come up against in doing historical research.

183
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,131
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people I get interested in,

184
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,382
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have much written about them.

185
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't call them up and say, by the way, can I come over?

186
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have coffee and we'll talk.

187
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:18,193
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not going to happen.

188
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to be very creative.

189
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank God for the internet in a lot of ways.

190
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:26,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Many times I curse it.

191
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:31,201
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, like Ancestry.com, and that's a start.

192
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:38,305
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are little obscure things or sentences that will come up.

193
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, OK, OK, it's a lead.

194
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,107
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lead.

195
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does it give you the whole story?

196
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

197
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,971
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gives enough.

198
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:51,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So the folks then, they're flesh and blood.

199
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:57,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to then talk about them because I think we can benefit.

200
00:19:58,585 --> 00:19:59,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, absolutely.

201
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:04,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is more than a little bit of the detective in you.

202
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:04,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

203
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I want one of the hats.

204
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:10,813
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

205
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the elephant in the room, obviously, and we can't get around it easily.

206
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:34,769
[SPEAKER_08]: What does the current state of racial upheaval and a growing retreat from a healthy dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion mean for the study of history both in our community and beyond?

207
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:43,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I cry every night when I look at the news because I think all of this work that has been so

208
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: zealously and painfully put together, are we going to lose it?

209
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:51,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a challenge.

210
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even like that word challenge.

211
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:55,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stop.

212
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:56,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't swear.

213
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:57,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't swear.

214
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:06,250
[SPEAKER_01]: But finding out, again, it's more important than ever to see who our civic ancestors were.

215
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And to take, well, the troubles, the conflicts they faced, and go, you know what?

216
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do this.

217
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it with the help of everybody around me.

218
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll help other people too.

219
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:28,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's just being too rosy, but I do think that's a partial way out of this.

220
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:31,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm convinced, as are you, that

221
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:40,870
[SPEAKER_08]: the big institutions, at least for a little while, may lose their grip on a lot of this.

222
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

223
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:53,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be incumbent upon the smaller institutions, and I number us as individuals as institutions of preservation of culture and history and so forth.

224
00:21:53,335 --> 00:22:01,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be incumbent upon us to do some of the things that the bigger institutions are, in some instances, afraid to do.

225
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:02,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

226
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they have no resources.

227
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:08,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has either quit and pushed out or whatever.

228
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:16,278
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't have the ability in many ways right now.

229
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, very important for us

230
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,187
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep our heads on and figure out what to do.

231
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, Tip O'Neill said it best, I think.

232
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,690
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, all politics is local.

233
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:42,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really, really important as local societies, local cities and towns and so forth, to maintain a strong grip on our own histories so that they can't be erased by the larger powers that be.

234
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,083
[SPEAKER_01]: And telling kids about the stories, too.

235
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:47,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

236
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:48,965
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes incredibly important.

237
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, absolutely.

238
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:56,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Telling them and getting them interested once they figure out, well, this is about me too.

239
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, exactly.

240
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

241
00:22:58,442 --> 00:22:58,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

242
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:13,109
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of answered the question, you said you cry sometimes in watching the news, but I want to ask it again so that you can go exactly where you want to go.

243
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:22,034
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been a seeming retreat from the truth and retention of black, Native American, and immigrant history.

244
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:29,318
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel like that's impacted you personally as a writer, a researcher, and a historian?

245
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes now people are afraid to talk.

246
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,604
[SPEAKER_01]: They're afraid of conversation, like, what are you going to do with that?

247
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,908
[SPEAKER_01]: If I tell you something, how are you going to cheat me?

248
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:42,690
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do something bad.

249
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:46,074
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to be overcome.

250
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:56,091
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough deception out there, so sometimes you're just not sure what to say or how to say it or to whom to say it.

251
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,152
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

252
00:23:58,494 --> 00:24:00,196
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can't stop us.

253
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:10,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another, I get a grip on some of these women from the past, and I go, how did you do it?

254
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:16,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're there for us to learn and to appreciate.

255
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:17,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, absolutely.

256
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:19,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to get into that.

257
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:30,493
[SPEAKER_08]: So you and I, in preparing for this evening, have talked about several prominent women that we wanted to highlight from Medford's history.

258
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:40,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to name each, and I'd really like for you to extemporize, for you to just share a brief synopsis of the history that they made.

259
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:42,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't interrupt.

260
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:42,900
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

261
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:46,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

262
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

263
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless I feel like I have something to say.

264
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll fit you in.

265
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you will.

266
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:55,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

267
00:24:55,708 --> 00:25:02,114
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so let's start with, and I hope I'm gonna pronounce her name right, Keziah Revellion.

268
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:09,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I would make book that she's the name that for most of us, including me, is the least familiar.

269
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:10,121
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

270
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I say, because you can say, because that sounds like a song.

271
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:20,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I came across her by accident.

272
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:29,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to snoop around cemeteries, and especially, I'm a cemetery trustee, which is great.

273
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:31,684
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of official.

274
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not out of place.

275
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:40,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Cross Street Cemetery, which was on Cross Street, right near City Hall.

276
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:49,017
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that delightful 93 overpass thing, and rotary thing, that's where the cemetery was.

277
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:51,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Aha, no longer there?

278
00:25:52,159 --> 00:26:00,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately, in the late 1950s, the city, in its wisdom, decided that that's where that whole mess had to go.

279
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:02,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do you do with the cemetery?

280
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:17,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DPW people and others, pretty carefully, I would have to say, removed the people from Cross Street and brought them over to their own special section at Oak Grove.

281
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is now, like, it's surrounded by stone wall not far from the Brooks Estate.

282
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:27,092
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the Cross Street Cemetery, thank God.

283
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise, like, you figure.

284
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:31,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Because who's going to say?

285
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:33,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's bones.

286
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:35,814
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bones.

287
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:38,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here and there.

288
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:39,956
[SPEAKER_01]: They were careful.

289
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:41,216
[SPEAKER_01]: They were pretty careful.

290
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:45,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was wandering around in there one time.

291
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:53,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was struck by a row of tombstones that had a beautiful weeping willow on them.

292
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:57,351
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, wow, that is really well done.

293
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, some poor guy walking his dog.

294
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,403
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not supposed to do that.

295
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,225
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was there.

296
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:06,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, come on over here.

297
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:07,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you something.

298
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And I showed him the tombstones.

299
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:15,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was very struck by this one Keziah Revalian.

300
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, have you ever heard that name?

301
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:18,317
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, no.

302
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:21,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, I'd better find out.

303
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:23,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd better find out.

304
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:29,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So fortunately, there's a great textbook of 20 families of color.

305
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:34,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And one whole chapter is on the Revalians of Medford.

306
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:36,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did?

307
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,360
[SPEAKER_01]: My god.

308
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:44,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found out, OK, Thomas Revalian, a free black,

309
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:48,392
[SPEAKER_01]: had been born, maybe France, they're not sure, they don't know.

310
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:50,732
[SPEAKER_01]: But he came to the United States.

311
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,693
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a barber.

312
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:59,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, holy horses, a barber in that day was not just clip, clip, clip.

313
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:02,575
[SPEAKER_01]: A barber, a tonsorial artist.

314
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:03,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonsorial, yeah.

315
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:04,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonsorial.

316
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:06,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, did he do women?

317
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:06,896
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

318
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,177
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was very gifted.

319
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:20,419
[SPEAKER_01]: He and his wife, and they had some kids growing up, of course, they settled around the shipbuilding area.

320
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:28,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he ended up with a shop right on Main Street, 14 Main.

321
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:33,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, if you go by that shop, there's a black barber there.

322
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that's deep.

323
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:37,108
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

324
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:46,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had his tonsorial parlor attracted all the high guys of Medford, because here you go.

325
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,299
[SPEAKER_01]: You go in.

326
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,923
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what women, you know what you do when you go in.

327
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,865
[SPEAKER_01]: You sit and talk and compare and you strike deals and you ask for things and you converse.

328
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:59,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they did in the shop.

329
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:01,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

330
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So a very different type of guy and very artistic.

331
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,655
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the stones of his family are gorgeous.

332
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:14,880
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a son named Robert who wanted sort of to follow in daddy's footsteps.

333
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert was born in the 1820s.

334
00:29:18,863 --> 00:29:28,568
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up meeting, marrying Kezia Hill Gould, a Native American woman who was living in Boston.

335
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:36,733
[SPEAKER_01]: She had been married to a very ancient guy who had actually been a soldier in the Revolutionary War.

336
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:37,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, whoa.

337
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like decades older.

338
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got married.

339
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,037
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not last that long.

340
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in came Robert.

341
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to call it the love story, because I think they weren't married terribly long.

342
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:58,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But she moved then, of course, to Medford, and they had a couple of kids.

343
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:05,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second child, three months after he was born, she passed away.

344
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,094
[SPEAKER_01]: She was only 25.

345
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:16,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I got all, you know, upset about that, I said, you know what?

346
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:18,078
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool.

347
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Here she is in Medford.

348
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a Native American woman.

349
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:29,463
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a descendant of Massasoit, you know, really up there.

350
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:32,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So she'd go shopping Medford Square.

351
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,682
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe drop into her father-in-law's shop.

352
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:39,362
[SPEAKER_01]: She got to know people.

353
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:42,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knew she was Native American?

354
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:46,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody she told knew.

355
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:48,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And how was she received?

356
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:52,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, oh, you're a Rebellion.

357
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Thomas's shop, yes.

358
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And she and Robert had a wonderful relationship.

359
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:02,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I know that for sure?

360
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:02,983
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

361
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:04,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be.

362
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:07,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And why wouldn't they?

363
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:12,389
[SPEAKER_01]: They had two kids in a very short period of time.

364
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They married about 1842.

365
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:15,691
[SPEAKER_01]: She died 1845.

366
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:30,836
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you go see their stones in Oak Grove at the Cross Street section, wow.

367
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:32,717
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to touch, but touch.

368
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,440
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beautiful.

369
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,901
[SPEAKER_01]: They're artistic.

370
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:45,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, I'm very proud to say, was a happily married Native American woman

371
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:47,266
[SPEAKER_01]: living in Medford Square.

372
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yippee.

373
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:49,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was great.

374
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And it said something about our community.

375
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:59,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you for that education, because that's all new information.

376
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:04,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Cross Street and so forth, I had no idea.

377
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:10,707
[SPEAKER_08]: My folks are in, but they're Cherry Lane, so they probably know nothing about it.

378
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the major park.

379
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:17,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross Street, it's set off with a fieldstone wall.

380
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite attractive.

381
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And just go in there and walk around.

382
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,693
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have you walking around with us.

383
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure, sure.

384
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:33,935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Sarah Bradley Fulton is certainly a name that resonates with a lot of Medfordites.

385
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:38,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Her buzz is definitely kept alive by the reenactment of another friend of the program.

386
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,617
[SPEAKER_08]: She's here with us tonight, Laura Dugan.

387
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that.

388
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:48,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But talk a little bit about Sarah Bradley Fulton.

389
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:49,373
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

390
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:52,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different type of woman from Kezia.

391
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:54,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Her dates are 1740 to 1835.

392
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,336
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's so back a ways.

393
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:05,679
[SPEAKER_01]: She got very much involved with her husband in the Revolution.

394
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:11,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And a woman in the Revolution, well, from your poem.

395
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,306
[SPEAKER_01]: But she had married John Fulton, 1760.

396
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:22,931
[SPEAKER_01]: She became a member of the Daughters of Liberty.

397
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:27,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's not proactive towards Britain.

398
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:27,977
[SPEAKER_01]: OK. 1773.

399
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,639
[SPEAKER_01]: the Boston Tea Party.

400
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:44,992
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was managing a store in Boston, I had every British tourist you could think of come into the store and say, I'd like to get a cup and saucer like they used at the Boston Tea Party.

401
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to illuminate what this real, it wasn't a sit down.

402
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,096
[SPEAKER_15]: By no means.

403
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:59,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, we sort of pitched the tea into the harbor.

404
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:01,681
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

405
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:10,688
[SPEAKER_01]: What she did, she and some friends, they helped disguise the guys who were going to do the pitching and dress them up.

406
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:12,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

407
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:14,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then they wouldn't be caught, hopefully.

408
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:17,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she did that.

409
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:21,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the guys came back, she secured everything.

410
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:26,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And some British guys dropped by and said, is anything going on?

411
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

412
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,980
[SPEAKER_01]: How would anything?

413
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,601
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, doing the usual.

414
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was very good.

415
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:34,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Then came Battle of Bunker Hill.

416
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:40,948
[SPEAKER_01]: She and her husband are living down by the Mystic, near where the police station is now.

417
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:48,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soldiers coming back from Bunker Hill, we didn't do well.

418
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the guys were wounded.

419
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:56,171
[SPEAKER_01]: She took a bullet out of a guy's cheek because he asked her to.

420
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many times you want to ask me to take a bullet out of your cheek.

421
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so sure I could do it, but she did.

422
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:05,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

423
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:10,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also, there were some messages that had to go to George Washington.

424
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:12,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Her husband was supposed to do it.

425
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,360
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't.

426
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So who does it?

427
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,322
[SPEAKER_01]: She rose across the trail.

428
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:20,843
[SPEAKER_01]: She delivers messages.

429
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, don't tell me she wasn't scared.

430
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:35,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after everything, she and John purchased a farm up in North Medford, near where I live.

431
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,289
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Fulton Street, guess what?

432
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:54,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Fulton okay and it starts down and then goes way up to his very winding turning and that's where they had their farm and John passed and Sarah kept going she had daughters and all

433
00:35:56,067 --> 00:36:02,410
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a hit with John Brooks, the governor, who was a hero living down here in Medford Square.

434
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:03,891
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd go to his house.

435
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:10,755
[SPEAKER_01]: In her 90s, she was walking down the hill to go to church services.

436
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:12,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why shouldn't I?

437
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:14,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I can walk.

438
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:17,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to church.

439
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,760
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want?

440
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,782
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't a rough woman at all.

441
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I call her ready.

442
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:37,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And freedom was huge for her, not only individually, but of course, the community and the nation.

443
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:42,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's buried at Salem Street Burying Ground.

444
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:46,616
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a beautiful, well, it looks like a boulder, but it's not.

445
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the door stop thing that would have been up in her house that she'd walk across to go outside.

446
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:59,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was considered, let's put that as her marker.

447
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:01,904
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.

448
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:08,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you touch it, she walked on that in and out of her house.

449
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:09,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

450
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

451
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:15,240
[SPEAKER_08]: One, it's a phenomenal story.

452
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,002
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wonderful history.

453
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:37,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I love it even more based on, you know, kind of what Laura's been doing to keep it alive because between the work she's been doing on getting the statue built and the reenactments at virtually every Medford historical thingamajig that happens, you know, it's great.

454
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, really great to be retaining so much history through Sarah Bradley Fulton.

455
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:46,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we move on.

456
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:49,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That, obviously fascinating.

457
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:52,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit about Belinda Sutton.

458
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:59,465
[SPEAKER_01]: She was sort of new to me, even though she's the most distant woman in the whole group.

459
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:04,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Belinda Sutton, her dates, 1712 to 1793.

460
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

461
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:12,035
[SPEAKER_01]: She was born in the Gold Coast of West Africa.

462
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she was about 12 years old,

463
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:37,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Some slave hunters came to her village and took her and other kids and captured them and brought them over to the Isle of Antigua where dear Isaac Royal had his plantation and all.

464
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:49,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was also, this is now 1732 approximately, she was working for him, yeah, like she wanted to, but there she was, doing what she needed to do.

465
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:58,958
[SPEAKER_01]: He decided rightfully that he needed to gather up his family and come over to America.

466
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And Medford, as you know, royal house, et cetera.

467
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:06,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Time passes.

468
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:08,799
[SPEAKER_01]: She's working so hard.

469
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:13,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, she's totally cut off from everything she has ever known.

470
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:14,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.

471
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:24,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of freedom for her, it was a fond hope, perhaps, but that's where it was.

472
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,051
[SPEAKER_01]: 1775, time of the revolution.

473
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:37,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shall I say, unfortunately, Isaac Royal was a great supporter of the crown.

474
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:42,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh gosh, I got this big, wonderful mansion.

475
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,941
[SPEAKER_01]: What could happen to me?

476
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so selfless.

477
00:39:50,082 --> 00:39:54,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But he fled, because he figured he better.

478
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:55,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what would happen?

479
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:58,446
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to be dragged out.

480
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:01,307
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough with slave people dragging other people.

481
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:03,087
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's not in that crowd.

482
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:04,267
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

483
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:11,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So he leaves, goes to Canada, then eventually back to England.

484
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:16,250
[SPEAKER_01]: She's there with many other slaves.

485
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,431
[SPEAKER_01]: What to do?

486
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:18,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.

487
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:24,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts took over his property.

488
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So now she's belonging to Massachusetts, if you will.

489
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:34,307
[SPEAKER_01]: She apparently married, has two kids.

490
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,390
[SPEAKER_01]: By 1778, she's living in Boston.

491
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:41,413
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a son and daughter.

492
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:42,915
[SPEAKER_01]: 1783, huge date.

493
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Slavery was declared unconstitutional.

494
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:50,641
[SPEAKER_01]: She's free.

495
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:53,544
[SPEAKER_01]: To do what?

496
00:40:56,366 --> 00:41:00,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything she knows is, she has no income.

497
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:00,970
[SPEAKER_01]: What could she do?

498
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:07,236
[SPEAKER_01]: She, of course, as you might know, can't read or write.

499
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,038
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a handicap.

500
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But she does have friends.

501
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe, I think she was connected with Prince Hall.

502
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:15,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Prince Hall, yes.

503
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:24,877
[SPEAKER_01]: In February of 1783, through his efforts, she petitioned the legislature for reparations.

504
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:27,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a word we're starting to use today.

505
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:35,443
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's 1783, and Belinda says, I don't have a dime to my name.

506
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:41,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature should do something for me, and very justifiably so.

507
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:48,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So she says she's, and I think she may have helped, and then he, of course, dressed it up.

508
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:54,077
[SPEAKER_01]: She was marked with the furrows of time, because now she's a much older woman.

509
00:41:54,818 --> 00:42:00,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Her daughter is ill, and she's hoping, beyond hope, that this will happen.

510
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:04,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Her request for compensation actually was granted.

511
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:10,465
[SPEAKER_01]: She was granted 15 pounds and 12 shillings annually.

512
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:15,589
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a lot to us, but to her it was manna.

513
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:25,916
[SPEAKER_01]: However, almost on a yearly basis, she had to reapply because the payments stopped.

514
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you know?

515
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:34,900
[SPEAKER_01]: But her petition is now on the Royal House website that you can read it.

516
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:51,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely heart-wrenching because she talks about how for years and decades she gave freely of her time and labor, would never recompense in any form or shape.

517
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:57,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And now she was, in essence, penniless.

518
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:03,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So she needed to be repaid and supported.

519
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:07,179
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely, I started crying when I read it.

520
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:13,124
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so, it was, I want to say dramatic, but not overly so.

521
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:25,333
[SPEAKER_01]: But to imagine the courage of a woman, an older woman, can't read or write, but petitioning the legislature.

522
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:33,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Which just goes to show, to me, if a woman is bound and determined, she'll find a way.

523
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:35,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say so.

524
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say so.

525
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:37,488
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

526
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next place I want to go is Lydia Maria Child.

527
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:43,892
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

528
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:50,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And that gets us back to at least somewhat to the suffragist piece.

529
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,810
[SPEAKER_01]: 1802 to 1880, much more in our own time.

530
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:52,870
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

531
00:43:56,013 --> 00:44:00,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know where, what's it, Blue Fuji, is that the name of the restaurant?

532
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:02,517
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where her house was.

533
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:02,957
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

534
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:04,118
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

535
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got to like, OK, there.

536
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:15,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Her parents, Converse and Susanna Francis, they had six kids, which was not unusual.

537
00:44:15,395 --> 00:44:15,656
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

538
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:18,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother died when Lydia was 12.

539
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:21,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Father was overly stern.

540
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:32,806
[SPEAKER_01]: She then lived with her sister in Maine, where that community in Maine was very sympathetic to Native Americans.

541
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:37,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lydia was able to appreciate that, you know, it's a different place.

542
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're okay, aren't they?

543
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:40,111
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

544
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,894
[SPEAKER_01]: She comes back to Boston, 1824.

545
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,056
[SPEAKER_01]: She decides she's going to write a novel.

546
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:52,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't, I said, oh yeah, one of these lady novel things.

547
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,801
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

548
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:57,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Habermack, a tale of early times.

549
00:44:57,804 --> 00:44:58,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a romance.

550
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:05,272
[SPEAKER_01]: with an upper class white woman and a Native American guy.

551
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:06,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.

552
00:45:08,715 --> 00:45:15,663
[SPEAKER_01]: This interracial marriage, Medford was not quite ready for that.

553
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:19,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we had had, hey, hello, that's why I brought her in.

554
00:45:20,648 --> 00:45:27,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Kezia Revalian had already, you know, she was coming into that town soon, and they accepted her.

555
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:30,894
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the thing is, you have to know the people, and then you accept.

556
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:37,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, can I say earth-shaking?

557
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:40,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really, you can imagine.

558
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this written by?

559
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a white woman writing about an interracial marriage.

560
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:53,426
[SPEAKER_01]: 1824, yes, yes, okay.

561
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:56,408
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't really comfortable with that.

562
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:57,729
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to write and write.

563
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,671
[SPEAKER_01]: She got into children's books.

564
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:00,652
[SPEAKER_01]: They were successful.

565
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:03,253
[SPEAKER_01]: She made money, okay.

566
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,058
[SPEAKER_01]: She wrote a book on the revolution through the eyes of two women.

567
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that good?

568
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,023
[SPEAKER_01]: She worked on magazines, okay.

569
00:46:16,768 --> 00:46:18,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, love.

570
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,831
[SPEAKER_01]: She married David Lee Child.

571
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, who's he?

572
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:30,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was a rabble-rouser, intelligent, brilliant, and a lousy businessman.

573
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:37,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So throughout their whole marriage, he was forever running them into debt.

574
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,508
[SPEAKER_01]: she would make the money off her writing.

575
00:46:42,108 --> 00:46:43,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would take the money.

576
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:48,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say squander, but poorly invest.

577
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had a bad time.

578
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:57,633
[SPEAKER_01]: One aspect of her writings I really like, the frugal housewife.

579
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:00,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you had the frugal housewife.

580
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:04,335
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who are not ashamed of economy,

581
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:07,778
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1829.

582
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:09,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your eye on the 1829.

583
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:17,601
[SPEAKER_01]: She was trying to raise domesticity to the level of competence you would find in a profession.

584
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.

585
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:29,965
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean women, when they're doing all this stuff like in your poem, getting stuff ready for the man, they're actually doing something important?

586
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:34,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my.

587
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:44,822
[SPEAKER_01]: 1833, she got hooked up with William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, and wrote an appeal in favor of that class of Americans called Africans.

588
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:48,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Lousy titles, but a good, good book.

589
00:47:49,825 --> 00:48:00,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she was incredible for, considering she'd come from Medford,

590
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:15,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Her reaching out to different races, stressing the importance of the work women do, saying women and men should work together, interracial harmony.

591
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,747
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like she's from New York or something.

592
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:23,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like this little place.

593
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:29,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And she learned a lot of those lessons around here.

594
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:38,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might know her best for Over the River and Through the Woods.

595
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:42,838
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's much deeper.

596
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:51,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And so coming out, I love the fact that her first novel was an interracial romance.

597
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:52,963
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool is that?

598
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's grand.

599
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's pretty far Over the River and Through the Woods.

600
00:48:56,205 --> 00:48:56,505
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over.

601
00:48:56,545 --> 00:48:57,846
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very far.

602
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:13,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, so let's let's let's depart from from Lydia and We got we got two more to get to and we got to do it pretty quick we'll do it fast okay, so Amelia Earhart

603
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:20,514
[SPEAKER_01]: 1897 to 1937, okay, she's in a pretty much her own time.

604
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:32,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Born in Kansas, she, her sister and mother after her mother got divorced, they came here to Medford.

605
00:49:34,644 --> 00:49:35,826
[SPEAKER_01]: living on Brooks Street.

606
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:36,647
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a nice house.

607
00:49:36,668 --> 00:49:41,055
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big boulder out front with a newly designed plaque.

608
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really good.

609
00:49:43,098 --> 00:49:45,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, her interest was in air flight.

610
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:45,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Aviation.

611
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:46,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, aviation.

612
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:47,686
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

613
00:49:49,596 --> 00:50:10,415
[SPEAKER_01]: uh she made all kinds of records you know this is of course a very unusual uh occupation interest whatever for a woman but she was good at it and she also did fashion design and luggage don't stop a woman if she's doing okay

614
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:21,149
[SPEAKER_01]: 1928, after she'd been a social worker at Denison House in Boston, she met George Putnam, a publisher.

615
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got money, smarts, and he wasn't bad looking.

616
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:30,391
[SPEAKER_01]: She became the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane, though she was just a passenger.

617
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:32,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, yeah, right.

618
00:50:32,651 --> 00:50:34,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, that was huge.

619
00:50:36,112 --> 00:50:37,192
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a sensation.

620
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:39,553
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked her to marry him.

621
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:41,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I think, the big thing.

622
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,251
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't want to change her name.

623
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:48,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking 1920s.

624
00:50:49,572 --> 00:50:50,873
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't want to change.

625
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:54,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, if I have to change my name, we're not getting married.

626
00:50:56,255 --> 00:50:58,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, that'll be fine.

627
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:02,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she wrote him a letter right before the wedding.

628
00:51:03,678 --> 00:51:08,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, I love you, but I want you to know

629
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,089
[SPEAKER_01]: that if either one of us is unhappy after a year, we're calling it quits.

630
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a prenup.

631
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,614
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you really think?

632
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so she was a woman who

633
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,214
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to say what she thought.

634
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:31,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, clearly.

635
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:33,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't divorce.

636
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:34,639
[SPEAKER_01]: They were happy.

637
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,521
[SPEAKER_01]: But he must have been extraordinary.

638
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would say so.

639
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:38,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

640
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:38,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

641
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:39,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

642
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:40,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

643
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:46,851
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the last stop that we're going to make on our tour is our own Madeline Duggar Kelly.

644
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:47,852
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

645
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:50,915
[SPEAKER_01]: She's born exactly the same year as Amelia Earhart, 1897.

646
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:56,958
[SPEAKER_01]: But Amelia was only 40 when she disappeared.

647
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:05,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Madeline died in 1995, so she definitely is into our time of life.

648
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:10,426
[SPEAKER_01]: She was very athletic in high school.

649
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:12,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's what you expect to hear about a woman, right?

650
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:32,760
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy well on the news, you know this whole thing with March Madden, you know And you get interviews of high school guys, you know, all right Very athletic specialized in the high jump and Eventually got inducted into the Medford Hall of Fame.

651
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm

652
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:40,071
[SPEAKER_01]: She went to Sargent College for Physical Education, which is now part of BU.

653
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:40,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

654
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:48,139
[SPEAKER_01]: She went there a couple of years and then sort of, but eventually she went to the Portia Law School and became a lawyer.

655
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,181
[SPEAKER_01]: She must have been brilliant.

656
00:52:50,261 --> 00:52:51,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, smart woman.

657
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:56,005
[SPEAKER_01]: She married, in 1918, married Lieutenant Colonel Edward Duggar.

658
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:02,707
[SPEAKER_01]: He was active in the 372nd Infantry.

659
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:04,828
[SPEAKER_01]: They had six kids together.

660
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:07,249
[SPEAKER_01]: All the kids went to college.

661
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is phenomenal.

662
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

663
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,072
[SPEAKER_01]: But she had a hard time finding a job.

664
00:53:17,242 --> 00:53:20,625
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, oh, you know, she wanted to work in school.

665
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:21,086
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to work.

666
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:25,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're very qualified, but you're a woman and you're black.

667
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:27,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad, huh?

668
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:30,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was terrible finding a job.

669
00:53:32,722 --> 00:53:35,203
[SPEAKER_01]: 1939, her beloved Edward died.

670
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:43,647
[SPEAKER_01]: She worked then for the Works Progress Administration, and finally was a director of service clubs at Fort Devens.

671
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:53,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of her proudest moments, 1952, she was the Massachusetts Mother of the Year, which was a huge benefit to her.

672
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:58,314
[SPEAKER_01]: She served on a school committee, and that's her portrait over there.

673
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:02,516
[SPEAKER_01]: She, did you know her?

674
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:11,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we lived on 158 Jerome Street and right next door across the lot was her home.

675
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:12,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

676
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:18,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was, she was a boss.

677
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:19,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

678
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:20,735
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a boss.

679
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:21,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

680
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:24,559
[SPEAKER_08]: The tale is told that Mike McGlynn,

681
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:30,089
[SPEAKER_08]: when he wanted to run for mayor, he had to get her, basically get her a blessing.

682
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So he went and he sat in her room and had her conversations.

683
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:38,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And she made him make some promises that he kept.

684
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:39,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

685
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Particularly in the African-American community here in West Medford.

686
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:46,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we knew her.

687
00:54:46,946 --> 00:54:52,490
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a member of our church, and she ran a lot of stuff, right?

688
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Without official title, she knew how to get stuff done.

689
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if something needs to be done, she'd do it.

690
00:54:58,855 --> 00:55:04,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and she passed that trait on to the children and all of them.

691
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:07,821
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of distinction in that family.

692
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:08,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

693
00:55:08,962 --> 00:55:10,583
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of distinction in that family.

694
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me ask you one last question.

695
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:22,602
[SPEAKER_08]: What would people who are just meeting you for the first time be surprised to find out about you?

696
00:55:28,547 --> 00:55:30,148
[SPEAKER_01]: What would they be surprised?

697
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:32,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to read.

698
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,602
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not it.

699
00:55:37,662 --> 00:55:38,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not it.

700
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:41,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not it.

701
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I love animals.

702
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:43,988
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

703
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:45,350
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

704
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, what do you mean sometimes?

705
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:51,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I often think they're a lot better to be with than people.

706
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:54,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're straight shooters.

707
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:58,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get to know, you ask a question and they'll let you know.

708
00:56:00,784 --> 00:56:05,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some very great relationships with cats, dogs.

709
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

710
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:08,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a preference?

711
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't dare say yes.

712
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:14,148
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have a preference.

713
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:19,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

714
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:19,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

715
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:23,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cats are more intricate, I find.

716
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're intricate.

717
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:24,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

718
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:32,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had, well, and my email address is Kitty Hawk.

719
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was my soul cat.

720
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: S-O-U-L, cat.

721
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:43,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she always thought she could fly.

722
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:48,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And because she'd get on top of a plant and woo.

723
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had her for 21 years.

724
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:55,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought she was invincible.

725
00:56:56,556 --> 00:56:57,076
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't.

726
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,241
[SPEAKER_01]: But she taught me so much.

727
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:02,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine.

728
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:06,887
[SPEAKER_01]: She taught me how to deal with things.

729
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something doesn't work, figure out another way to do it.

730
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:13,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was invaluable.

731
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:18,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, well I dare say you are invaluable.

732
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:20,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well that's.

733
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:33,157
[SPEAKER_08]: To the city of Medford of course, but also to the whole notion of kind of a cultural legacy that kind of transcends eras, decades.

734
00:57:33,637 --> 00:57:46,942
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, because if we're just stuck in our own little space, because that's my chief grievance with developers, because I'll go up to some guy who's, oh, we'll take all this down.

735
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:52,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say, you know, history didn't begin with you, believe it or not.

736
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:54,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you mean?

737
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, is there something worth saving here?

738
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't want to start with a blank slate all the time.

739
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:08,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get us started about developers.

740
00:58:10,805 --> 00:58:18,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to say thank you so very much for bringing your historical insights and your

741
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:21,844

00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really important work that you've been engaged in.

00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, may I interrupt?

748
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:46,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please.

749
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:46,601
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

750
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,784
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, in June,

751
00:58:50,544 --> 00:58:54,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the library's 150th birthday.

752
00:58:54,648 --> 00:58:55,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is great.

753
00:58:55,869 --> 00:59:00,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to deal with the Magoon Mansion that became the library.

754
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:01,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all wonderful.

755
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:09,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in October, I will expand a bit on Thatcher Magoon, Jr.'

756
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:10,764
[SPEAKER_01]: 's life story.

757
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:19,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Daddy came to the library, and son lived across the street in another beautiful mansion.

758
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:25,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And son adopted his housekeeper.

759
00:59:29,368 --> 00:59:38,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So the program in October is simply titled, Emotional Turmoil on High Street.

760
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,001
[SPEAKER_08]: That's rich.

761
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

762
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:42,581

773
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:58,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The stories of women, you know, my husband and I lived in, after all, it was kind of a border wall.

[SPEAKER_02]: We were brought up in a rural area.

775
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:33,802

[SPEAKER_02]: Revolutionary soldiers.

777
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,453

[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you know, obviously, my father was also a member of the Black Nation, as well as the Congress.

779
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:08,825

[SPEAKER_08]: All right, folks.

822
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:45,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to deal with some technical difficulties directing some folks that are trying to get here to participate in the program.

823
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:48,242
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think we got it licked.

01:09:48,302 --> 01:09:48,962
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

825
01:09:50,757 --> 01:09:51,157
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

826

[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks to everyone who joined us for all of our 2025 winter events so far.

827
01:09:59,019 --> 01:10:05,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, for being here tonight, we really have lots of work to do as a community.

828
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:12,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to continue to need your growing participation and partnerships to make this thing work.

829
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:19,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang in there with us, because we'll all hang together, or we'll all hang apart.

830
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:22,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't want to do that.

831
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:30,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So seniors, elders, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship.

837
01:10:57,471 --> 01:11:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some things going on right now, ourselves and also some other organizations that we're friends with that I just want to call your attention to.

838
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:15,148
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have here at the community center on May 16th at 11 a.m.

839
01:11:15,848 --> 01:11:20,750
[SPEAKER_08]: a fraud protection workshop that's being done by AARP.

840
01:11:22,851 --> 01:11:31,115
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to explore common scams, how to spot them and avoid them, tactics that scammers are using to target individuals.

841
01:11:31,715 --> 01:11:34,757
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of stuff out there right now, as you all probably know.

842
01:11:36,098 --> 01:11:38,841
[SPEAKER_08]: What to do if you're asked for personal information.

843
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:52,712
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this one scam where they try to get you to say yes, so that they can record your voice and then apply that response to things that you never agreed to do.

844
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:57,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, this workshop will tell you how to address

845
01:11:58,476 --> 01:12:03,318
[SPEAKER_08]: these types of scammers when they call on the phone, and what information not to give them.

846
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:09,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And the resources can help to protect you, and you can pass along the information to your family.

847
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:16,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll have a post out there on our bulletin board, and if you have any questions, you can call us.

848
01:12:16,322 --> 01:12:18,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We can give you the number that you can write down.

849
01:12:18,763 --> 01:12:23,085
[SPEAKER_08]: We can also give you the registration link that you might need.

850
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:25,347
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one thing.

851
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:37,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the Medford Community Chorale and Youth Young Adult Chorus is having their annual spring concert on Friday, May 2nd.

852
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:47,284
[SPEAKER_08]: which is not a fresh Friday, so you don't have to worry about the conflict, at 7 p.m., and that's at the Karen Theater at Medford High School.

853
01:12:47,824 --> 01:12:48,985
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a free admission.

854
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,786
[SPEAKER_08]: They welcome donations.

855
01:12:50,806 --> 01:12:51,887
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have raffles.

856
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's always a benefit for a local charity.

857
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:03,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And Elizabeth, or Betsy Pesci, she really, really does a great job with that chorus.

858
01:13:03,235 --> 01:13:08,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have a chance to go hear them sing, that would be fantastic.

859
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:22,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then our friends over in Lexington have been hosting a series on the Black Patriots of Lexington.

860
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:26,872
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a nine-episode series produced with Lex Media and Tricons 2.

861
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:42,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And it invites audience on a journey through the lives of 11 black men and women who were part of the economic, political, and military revolution that came to a head at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts on April 19, 1775.

862
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:48,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of additional information that goes along with that.

863
01:13:49,431 --> 01:13:53,135
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're interested, again, we'll have the information posted.

864
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:56,819
[SPEAKER_08]: and hope to be able to add it to our website.

865
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:06,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Your tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC.

871
01:14:31,595 --> 01:14:32,296
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, okay.

872
01:14:33,357 --> 01:14:43,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it's time, as is our custom, to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical side of the ledger.

873
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get to go around, you get to see people, meet people, do things.

874
01:14:49,841 --> 01:15:03,048
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend, friend of the program as well, Stacy Clayton, has been doing this wonderful concert over at Somerville Community Baptist Church for who knows how long now.

875
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, and we have folks who both participate as singers that are members of the community center and Stacey always invites everybody out and we go and we have a wonderful time.

876
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:23,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been privileged to be both, you know, her resident poet as well as, you know, her emcee for the last couple of years.

877
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:29,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But she's introduced me to some wonderful folks who have come and sang for us.

878
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:38,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of those people who comes and sings with Stacey is Jenny Bonham Carter.

879
01:15:38,972 --> 01:15:46,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's from Sweden.

880
01:15:49,502 --> 01:15:51,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's a delight.

881
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:54,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And her last name is Cotter, and that doesn't hurt her at all.

882
01:15:56,408 --> 01:16:03,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're happy to always to entertain her and have her entertain us.

890
01:16:52,818 --> 01:17:05,913
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cooper brothers back in the day, alright, you know, they came through, you know, because that's what the brothers do, you know, they come through because we have women over here in West Medford, you know.

891
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:12,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just going to say it the way that we said it.

892
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:15,456
[SPEAKER_08]: We had them fine sisters over here in West Medford.

893
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:17,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So the brothers would come through.

894

[SPEAKER_08]: We had some of the Boston fellas come through.

896
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:24,404
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of chased them away, right?

897
01:17:24,864 --> 01:17:26,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they could be troublemakers.

898
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:29,186
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what I'm saying?

899
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a couple of the Somerville boys come through.

900
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had a few of the West Newton boys come through.

901
01:17:35,509 --> 01:17:36,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we had Shiloh.

902
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,690

903
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:41,892

01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:45,938
[SPEAKER_12]: All we need is love, love, love.

1046
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:52,097
[SPEAKER_12]: All we need is love, love, love.

1047
01:28:52,737 --> 01:28:58,443
[SPEAKER_12]: All we need is love.

1048
01:28:58,883 --> 01:29:05,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Beatles said it like this, love, love, love.

1049
01:29:06,162 --> 01:29:09,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Love, love, love.

1050
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:13,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Love, love, love.

1051
01:29:13,786 --> 01:29:15,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can do that one more time.

1052
01:29:15,527 --> 01:29:21,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Love, love, love.

1053
01:29:22,091 --> 01:29:28,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Love, love, love.

1054
01:29:29,274 --> 01:29:32,296
Love, love, love.

1055
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:35,078
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing you can do that can't be done.

1056
01:29:36,408 --> 01:29:39,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.

1057
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:43,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game.

1058
01:29:43,474 --> 01:29:46,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy.

1059
01:29:47,777 --> 01:29:50,479
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is love.

1060
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:54,162
[SPEAKER_13]: All you need is love.

1061
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:58,085
[SPEAKER_13]: All you need is love, love.

1062
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all you need.

1063
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:04,610
[SPEAKER_14]: All you need is love.

1064
01:30:06,357 --> 01:30:09,758
[SPEAKER_14]: All you need is love.

1065
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,340
[SPEAKER_13]: All you need is love, love.

1066
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all you need.

1067
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:17,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1068
01:30:17,902 --> 01:30:18,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1069
01:30:18,902 --> 01:30:19,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1070
01:30:19,903 --> 01:30:20,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1071
01:30:20,943 --> 01:30:21,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1072
01:30:21,943 --> 01:30:22,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1073
01:30:22,964 --> 01:30:23,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1074
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:25,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1075
01:30:25,145 --> 01:30:26,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1076
01:30:27,326 --> 01:30:29,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1077
01:30:29,707 --> 01:30:31,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Love is all we need.

1078
01:30:37,044 --> 01:30:38,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, thank you so much.

1079
01:30:40,207 --> 01:30:47,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, as you know by now, we are what the world, we call ourselves, what the world needs now, Interfaith Coalition Singers.

1080
01:30:48,355 --> 01:30:52,819
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are a group of performing artists in our own right.

1081
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:57,163
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother and I, the Cooper brothers, as we refer to them, my brother Stephen,

1082
01:30:57,623 --> 01:31:00,966
[SPEAKER_13]: on Walter, we have been singing for over five decades.

1083
01:31:01,406 --> 01:31:02,948
[SPEAKER_13]: We started out, yeah, that's a long time.

1084
01:31:03,828 --> 01:31:08,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So we started out in the 60s and 70s singing R&B and all that stuff.

1085
01:31:08,532 --> 01:31:10,594
[SPEAKER_13]: In the 80s, we turned to gospel.

1086
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:17,720
[SPEAKER_13]: And ever since the 1980s, we've been singing in a quartet known as the Love Tones, the Gospel Love Tones.

1087
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:23,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we were fortunate enough to, a few years ago, to meet these ladies.

1088
01:31:23,985 --> 01:31:27,027
[SPEAKER_13]: and they have allowed us to continue, really, in ministry.

1089
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:31,829
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are, we call ourselves, as we say, what the world needs now, Interfaith Coalition Singers.

1090
01:31:32,549 --> 01:31:44,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And that name, it's important, as we've talked about the people and we talk about history, particularly black people, it's important to understand the role that faith played.

1091
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:48,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And the thing about that faith piece is that

1092
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:51,514
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to get a lot of that in history.

1093
01:31:52,275 --> 01:31:57,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Because things like the Underground Railroad, they relied on stealth.

1094
01:31:58,762 --> 01:31:59,883
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting.

1095
01:31:59,903 --> 01:32:01,205
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about the Underground Railroad.

1096
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:04,628
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about Harriet Tubman, which is right.

1097
01:32:05,129 --> 01:32:10,134
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know people who talked about the way they moved those escaped slaves.

1098
01:32:10,895 --> 01:32:15,240
[SPEAKER_13]: through from one household to another, moving them away.

1099
01:32:15,841 --> 01:32:16,782
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a culture.

1100
01:32:17,023 --> 01:32:19,866
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a culture of that Underground Railroad.

1101
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:25,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, the thing about it is there's no historical record of it.

1102
01:32:26,887 --> 01:32:27,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they couldn't be.

1103
01:32:28,888 --> 01:32:31,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they couldn't be successful if they had done that.

1104
01:32:31,809 --> 01:32:33,129
[SPEAKER_13]: But they were successful.

1105
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,110
[SPEAKER_13]: They were successful.

1106
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:41,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And the thing of it is, you can't really kind of tell the story, but we can tell the story by looking.

1107
01:32:42,032 --> 01:32:47,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for telling the story about these women and these people who affected us.

1108
01:32:48,274 --> 01:32:53,839
[SPEAKER_13]: In our community, particularly when you think about the history, slaves were kidnapped in their countries.

1109
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,342
[SPEAKER_13]: They were put on ships and taken to the wilderness.

1110
01:32:57,763 --> 01:33:06,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the reality is if you made that trip on that ship, you were physically select to make that trip under those circumstances.

1111
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:07,772
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them didn't.

1112
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,974
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you made it, you were physically select.

1113
01:33:11,155 --> 01:33:14,798
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when they brought the slaves here, what did they do?

1114
01:33:16,206 --> 01:33:17,267
[SPEAKER_13]: They evangelized them.

1115
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:17,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1116
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:19,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they thought they could control them.

1117
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:24,292
[SPEAKER_13]: They said, we're going to make them Christians, and then we'll control them and be able to manipulate them.

1118
01:33:24,692 --> 01:33:25,553
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know something?

1119
01:33:27,314 --> 01:33:30,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, there's no history, but go to the spiritual.

1120
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:40,971
[SPEAKER_13]: The spiritual is what made those people who were put on those boats, and when they came over here, they were not a people.

1121
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:42,273
[SPEAKER_13]: They had no common culture.

1122
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:43,515
[SPEAKER_13]: They had no common language.

1123
01:33:44,857 --> 01:33:47,441
[SPEAKER_13]: But the spiritual made them a people.

1124
01:33:50,587 --> 01:33:55,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to the spirituals if you want to find out the story of slaves in America.

1125
01:33:56,392 --> 01:33:57,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't look at white people.

1126
01:33:58,214 --> 01:34:00,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't look at segregation and all that stuff.

1127
01:34:00,356 --> 01:34:01,477
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to look at the people.

1128
01:34:01,917 --> 01:34:03,138
[SPEAKER_13]: It's important to tell the story.

1129
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,420
[SPEAKER_13]: But nobody talks to the people.

1130
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And my point is this.

1131
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:08,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to talk about that now.

1132
01:34:09,124 --> 01:34:10,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully it will be reflected in the museum.

1133
01:34:10,785 --> 01:34:15,870
[SPEAKER_13]: If you talk to the people, they'll say, Jesus.

1134
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:19,993
[SPEAKER_13]: You ever hear a historian talk about Jesus, about that?

1135
01:34:20,854 --> 01:34:24,797
[SPEAKER_13]: You talk to any of us, you're like, I see some smiles, and you know, you know what you heard growing up.

1136
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:30,681
[SPEAKER_13]: In Shiloh, in other places, you know what we heard growing up.

1137
01:34:30,961 --> 01:34:32,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And who do we hear that from?

1138
01:34:33,123 --> 01:34:33,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Women.

1139
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:46,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Women, our mothers made sure, my brother and I, I could testify and I'll stop talking after this, but my mother made sure, we had to go to church till we were 14, you had no choice.

1140
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:49,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And then at 14, you can make your own decisions.

1141
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,762
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, why did they do that?

1142
01:34:52,824 --> 01:34:54,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they loved us and they knew.

1143
01:34:54,967 --> 01:34:57,550
[SPEAKER_13]: They knew that life was going to come against us.

1144
01:34:58,091 --> 01:35:03,979
[SPEAKER_13]: And to deal with the things that life was going to bring against us was going to require the power of faith.

1145
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,461
[SPEAKER_13]: We are the interfaith coalition singers.

1146
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:12,243
[SPEAKER_13]: We support interfaith coalitions through music and through the arts.

1147
01:35:13,144 --> 01:35:20,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if you look at things like the civil rights movement, we talk about Dr. Martin Luther King, and rightfully so, he was the leader, but he was the leader of a

1148
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:23,048
[SPEAKER_13]: of an interfaith coalition.

1149
01:35:23,068 --> 01:35:26,409
[SPEAKER_13]: That was an interfaith coalition movement that made those things happen.

1150
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:39,893
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the same thing that's required today, and we're hoping that we can kind of incite you all to come into that, because that's what is required today, for us to continue to coalesce, allow our faith to inform our responses to the things in the world.

1151
01:35:40,713 --> 01:35:42,294
[SPEAKER_13]: So, enough of my talking.

1152
01:35:43,835 --> 01:35:47,759
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I want to introduce you to Bell, Linda Halperin is going to lead us.

1153
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:48,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Walter.

1154
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also grew up in a family where I had to go to synagogue.

1155
01:35:53,986 --> 01:35:55,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is Friday night.

1156
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:58,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a time of blessing in Jewish homes.

1157
01:35:58,831 --> 01:36:02,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And my favorite blessing in Judaism is called Shechecheyanu.

1158
01:36:02,935 --> 01:36:07,117
[SPEAKER_06]: and shehecheyanu means we are blessing each moment.

1159
01:36:07,477 --> 01:36:10,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are thanking God for each moment, for each blessing that we have.

1160
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of it as the Jew-boo prayer, the Buddhist Jewish prayer, because it's blessing every moment as it happens.

1161
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:19,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a lot to bless tonight.

1162
01:36:20,103 --> 01:36:20,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.

1163
01:36:20,883 --> 01:36:22,064
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are going to sing it with me.

1164
01:36:22,404 --> 01:36:25,445
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do it as a blues, and we're going to do it in call and response.

1165
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:31,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Baruch atah.

1166
01:36:31,979 --> 01:37:00,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Baruch atah Adonai Adonai Eloheinu Eloheinu Melech ha'olam Melech ha'olam Baruch atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech ha'olam Melech ha'olam T'shecheyanu T'shecheyanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu V'kiyamanu

[SPEAKER_13]: We're here in West Medford.

1173

[SPEAKER_06]: We're blessing our women.

[SPEAKER_13]: We're blessing our women.

01:38:26,765 --> 01:38:27,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha-ho!

1184
01:38:58,385 --> 01:39:02,068
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we are so happy to have Merle with us.

1185
01:39:02,108 --> 01:39:04,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy to be here.

01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:05,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:19,307

1330
01:54:32,297 --> 01:54:35,219
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna do one more song, and I think we need to do this.

1331
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:36,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1332
01:54:39,342 --> 01:54:40,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one more, because, yeah.

1333
01:54:40,563 --> 01:54:40,764
[SPEAKER_07]: One more.

1334
01:54:40,824 --> 01:54:41,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, okay.

1335
01:54:41,144 --> 01:54:43,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we're gonna do this a little later.

1336
01:54:43,346 --> 01:54:45,868
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll let you write down into this.

1337
01:54:47,392 --> 01:54:52,493
[SPEAKER_13]: But before we do that, we just want to say, we're getting ready to close now.

1338
01:54:52,914 --> 01:55:02,096
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, we said we are the Interfaith Coalition Singers, but there's one very important thing about faith that is really required.

1339
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:04,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is what we're told.

1340
01:55:06,057 --> 01:55:09,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Faith without works is dead.

1341
01:55:12,054 --> 01:55:12,875
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to have the faith.

1342
01:55:12,895 --> 01:55:14,997
[SPEAKER_13]: The faith is important, but it just starts there.

1343
01:55:16,398 --> 01:55:17,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it's about the work.

1344
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:19,962
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we're here to do.

1345
01:55:20,002 --> 01:55:21,443
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're here to focus on.

1346
01:55:21,683 --> 01:55:22,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's work that we know.

1347
01:55:22,865 --> 01:55:24,406
[SPEAKER_13]: We know there's work to be done.

1348
01:55:24,787 --> 01:55:30,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And the question we ask ourselves with all the problems, the trouble in the world, we look at the world, what difference can I make?

1349
01:55:30,973 --> 01:55:31,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm one person.

1350
01:55:31,773 --> 01:55:32,915
[SPEAKER_13]: What difference can I make?

1351
01:55:34,366 --> 01:55:38,169
[SPEAKER_13]: But this song talks about this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.

1352
01:55:38,189 --> 01:55:39,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a little light.

1353
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:41,351
[SPEAKER_13]: But think about it.

1354
01:55:42,492 --> 01:55:54,801
[SPEAKER_13]: If I take my little light and put it with Merle's little light, Jenny's little light, Belle's little light, Stephen's little light.

1355
01:55:55,747 --> 01:55:57,868
[SPEAKER_06]: D. Morris' little light, big light.

1356
01:55:58,489 --> 01:56:00,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Your little light, your little light.

1357
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,532
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens when all those little lights get together?

1358
01:56:04,532 --> 01:56:07,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty soon we have enough light to dispel the darkness.

1359
01:56:08,134 --> 01:56:09,115
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the work of faith.

1360
01:56:09,155 --> 01:56:10,175
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the work of faith?

1361
01:56:10,395 --> 01:56:11,696
[SPEAKER_13]: The work of faith is love.

1362
01:56:13,317 --> 01:56:16,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So our challenge is to let that love light shine.

1363
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:23,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though we're in a world that doesn't necessarily reflect that, that's what we're called to.

1364
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:30,344
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what our faith guides us toward, to stay on that right path with all the other stuff that's swirling around us.

1365
01:56:31,945 --> 01:56:33,046
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have that light.

1366
01:56:34,807 --> 01:56:36,028
[SPEAKER_13]: That light is what we can trust.

1367
01:56:36,068 --> 01:56:39,451
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what my mama said, you're going to stay in church until you're 14 years old.

1368
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:41,212
[SPEAKER_13]: So you get that light.

1369
01:56:41,712 --> 01:56:42,433
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1370
01:56:42,533 --> 01:56:42,573
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1371
01:56:42,593 --> 01:56:43,113
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, three.

1372
01:56:45,315 --> 01:56:46,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody sing it with us.

1373
01:56:46,436 --> 01:56:48,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Sing it with us.

1374
01:56:48,637 --> 01:56:49,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on now.

1375
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:56,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna let it shine, this little light of mine.

1376
01:56:56,782 --> 01:57:02,924
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna let it shine, this little light of mine.

1377
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:10,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

1378
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:20,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine.

1379
01:57:20,933 --> 01:57:26,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine.

1380
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:30,225
[SPEAKER_12]: everywhere I go.

1381
01:57:31,045 --> 01:57:40,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

1382
01:57:40,955 --> 01:57:43,357
[SPEAKER_06]: All the women who came before

1383
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna let it shine for them, all the women who came before.

1384
01:57:50,682 --> 01:57:54,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna let it shine.

1385
01:57:54,385 --> 01:57:57,467
[SPEAKER_06]: All the women who came before.

1386
01:57:57,487 --> 01:58:00,509

01:58:00,689 --> 01:58:02,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it shine.

1388
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:03,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it shine.

1389
01:58:04,131 --> 01:58:07,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it shine.

[SPEAKER_06]: Right here in West Medford, we're gonna let it shine.

01:58:29,906 --> 01:58:31,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it shine.

1395

[SPEAKER_13]: Sing that verse one more time.

1396
01:58:33,068 --> 01:58:34,209

[SPEAKER_13]: All together.

1416
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:32,370
[SPEAKER_13]: You can stand if you want.

1417
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:34,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Walking in love, living in hope.

01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:38,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna let it shine.

1420
01:59:38,531 --> 01:59:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1421
01:59:38,711 --> 01:59:38,931
Oh, yeah.

1422
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:39,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Say it to somebody.

1423
01:59:39,971 --> 01:59:43,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Walking in love, living in hope.

1424
01:59:43,752 --> 01:59:45,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna let it shine.

1425
01:59:47,153 --> 01:59:50,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking in love, living in hope.

01:59:50,675 --> 01:59:52,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna let it shine.

1427
01:59:52,116 --> 01:59:53,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it shine.

1428
01:59:53,457 --> 01:59:57,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Let it shine.

1429
01:59:57,879 --> 02:00:02,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Let it shine.

1430
02:00:14,905 --> 02:00:15,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1431
02:00:15,827 --> 02:00:16,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1432
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:17,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1433
02:00:18,033 --> 02:00:18,654
[SPEAKER_13]: God bless you.

1434
02:00:33,506 --> 02:00:36,408
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so that is what's known as a pick-me-up.

1435
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:37,709
[SPEAKER_08]: All right?

1436
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:45,156
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so if you didn't get lifted, I don't really know what to do about it.

1437
02:00:46,317 --> 02:00:47,558
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know I did.

1438
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:55,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to thank D. Morris for starting us out on the path to liberation.

1439
02:01:00,606 --> 02:01:08,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank you, What the World Needs Now Interfaith Coalition Singers, for blessing us abundantly.

1440
02:01:08,592 --> 02:01:10,314
[SPEAKER_08]: What an inspirational evening.

1441
02:01:11,434 --> 02:01:18,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to Walter and Stephen Cooper, Belinda Halperin, Meryl Perkins.

1442
02:01:20,361 --> 02:01:21,282
[SPEAKER_08]: She did get here.

1443
02:01:21,923 --> 02:01:23,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jenny Barnum-Cotter.

1444
02:01:24,184 --> 02:01:26,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Give them a nice round of applause, everybody.

1445
02:01:29,388 --> 02:01:29,829
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1446
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:38,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a wrap for this live new edition of WMCC's monthly words and music program.

1447
02:01:39,618 --> 02:01:45,264
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so happy to be back here at the center and visiting with you in your living rooms and other household places.

1448
02:01:45,845 --> 02:01:49,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank all of our guests for allowing us to invade their spaces.

1449
02:01:50,249 --> 02:01:53,291
[SPEAKER_08]: showing their faces and sharing their graces.

1450
02:01:53,772 --> 02:01:56,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Special thanks to historian and educator Dee Morris.

1451
02:01:57,855 --> 02:02:01,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, what the world needs now interfaith coalition singers.

1452
02:02:02,198 --> 02:02:02,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Just beautiful.

1453
02:02:02,979 --> 02:02:10,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Air high five to my man Kevin Harrington and Mark Davidson back there from Medford Community Media.

1454
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:13,511
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

1455
02:02:14,592 --> 02:02:19,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for spending another evening enjoying what the WMCC has to offer.

1456
02:02:20,073 --> 02:02:33,056
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in April with our, check it out, annual poetry edition of Fresh Friday's Words and Music as we celebrate National Poetry Month and dive heavily into the spring season.

1457
02:02:33,716 --> 02:02:35,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's it.

1458
02:02:36,037 --> 02:02:36,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I quit.

1459
02:02:38,477 --> 02:02:40,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some other rhymes, but I can't say them.

1460
02:02:43,638 --> 02:02:46,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you all, and thank you for being here tonight.

1461
02:02:46,419 --> 02:02:48,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a safe trip home.

1462
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:51,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful, and keep coming back.

1463
02:02:52,062 --> 02:02:52,462
[SPEAKER_08]: All right?

1464
02:02:53,223 --> 02:02:53,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
