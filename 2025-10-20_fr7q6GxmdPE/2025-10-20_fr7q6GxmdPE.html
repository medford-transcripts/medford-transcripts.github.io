    <p>[Mike Mastrobuoni]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=5.768s">Hello,</a>  my name is Michael Mastromoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=8.189s">I'm</a>  a parent of two, a public servant, and I'm running for the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=13.292s">My</a>  family and I love Medford because it's a community that values public schools, civic life, and neighbors who look out for one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=20.016s">My</a>  seven-year-old son, Lincoln, and my four-year-old daughter, Violet, are both Robert's school kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=24.619s">My</a>  wife and I have built friendships here with families and educators who care deeply about Medford's future, and that's so energizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=31.914s">Running</a>  for school committee is my way of giving back to a community that's given so much to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=37.098s">Professionally,</a>  I serve as the budget director for the city of Somerville, where I help develop and manage a $400 million annual budget and lead our long-term financial strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=46.084s">My</a>  job is to make sure public dollars serve the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=49.467s">That</a>  means protecting resources and core programs, connecting spending with community priorities, and keeping services strong no matter what's happening at the state or federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=58.998s">I</a>  was also part of the finance team that delivered a new Somerville High School in 2021, from early planning through construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=65.6s">I</a>  know what it takes to manage a once-in-a-generation investment like that, balancing fiscal responsibility with the real needs of students and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=73.723s">My</a>  experience will help Medford as we move forward with our own high school reconstruction, an enormous opportunity to build something lasting and community-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=82.567s">But</a>  my 20-year local government career isn't just about numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=85.808s">It's</a>  about communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=87.389s">In</a>  my role, I take complex financial decisions and make them clear and accessible so residents understand not just what we're doing, but why. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=95.151s">It's</a>  the kind of honest communication we'll need here in Medford as we make big decisions about budgets, programs, and that high school project. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=102.643s">Leading</a>  our school district requires planning, consistency, and follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=107.044s">And</a>  that's what I do best. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=108.345s">The</a>  school committee is not just a policy group. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=110.386s">It's</a>  an executive body. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=111.766s">It</a>  hires and evaluates the superintendent, ensures the district's budget reflects our values, and sets measurable goals through strategic planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=118.948s">I'm</a>  ready to do that work on day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=121.729s">I</a>  bring experience, leadership, and a steady hand to preserve what works and invest in what needs improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=128.513s">If</a>  I'm elected, I'll focus on three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=131.094s">First,</a>  supporting our school through strong curriculum, special education, athletics, and afterschool programs that give every student a place to belong and a chance to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=141.078s">Second,</a>  budgeting for values and stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=143.579s">That</a>  means making sure our spending is transparent, sustainable, and focused on what matters most. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=148.701s">Third,</a>  delivering a successful Medford High School project, a school we can be proud of that's fiscally responsible and built to meet the needs of today's students, their children, and generations to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=159.867s">I</a>  believe in collaboration, not confrontation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=162.369s">I</a>  believe in clear communication and honest explanations, especially when decisions get complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=168.253s">I've</a>  spent my career helping folks understand how government works and how to make it work better for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=173.296s">I'm</a>  proud to be a parent and a public servant here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=177.579s">Medford</a>  deserves a school committee that's focused, informed, and grounded in values. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=182.062s">A</a>  team that can plan for the future while protecting what makes our school special today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=186.125s">I'd</a>  be honored to earn your vote on Tuesday, November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fr7q6GxmdPE&t=188.886s">Thank</a>  you for listening, and thank you so much for caring about our public schools.</p>
