00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:07,629
Hello, my name is Michael Mastromoni.

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,551
I'm a parent of two, a public servant, and I'm running for the Medford School Committee.

3
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:19,196
My family and I love Medford because it's a community that values public schools, civic life, and neighbors who look out for one another.

4
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:23,999
My seven-year-old son, Lincoln, and my four-year-old daughter, Violet, are both Robert's school kids.

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,643
My wife and I have built friendships here with families and educators who care deeply about Medford's future, and that's so energizing.

6
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:35,837
Running for school committee is my way of giving back to a community that's given so much to us.

7
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:45,384
Professionally, I serve as the budget director for the city of Somerville, where I help develop and manage a $400 million annual budget and lead our long-term financial strategy.

8
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,906
My job is to make sure public dollars serve the public.

9
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:57,713
That means protecting resources and core programs, connecting spending with community priorities, and keeping services strong no matter what's happening at the state or federal level.

10
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:04,900
I was also part of the finance team that delivered a new Somerville High School in 2021, from early planning through construction.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,603
I know what it takes to manage a once-in-a-generation investment like that, balancing fiscal responsibility with the real needs of students and educators.

12
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:21,026
My experience will help Medford as we move forward with our own high school reconstruction, an enormous opportunity to build something lasting and community-driven.

13
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,668
But my 20-year local government career isn't just about numbers.

14
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:26,728
It's about communication.

15
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:34,331
In my role, I take complex financial decisions and make them clear and accessible so residents understand not just what we're doing, but why.

16
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:40,993
It's the kind of honest communication we'll need here in Medford as we make big decisions about budgets, programs, and that high school project.

17
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:46,724
Leading our school district requires planning, consistency, and follow through.

18
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:47,865
And that's what I do best.

19
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,206
The school committee is not just a policy group.

20
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,306
It's an executive body.

21
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:58,508
It hires and evaluates the superintendent, ensures the district's budget reflects our values, and sets measurable goals through strategic planning.

22
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,549
I'm ready to do that work on day one.

23
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,811
I bring experience, leadership, and a steady hand to preserve what works and invest in what needs improvement.

24
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:10,334
If I'm elected, I'll focus on three things.

25
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:20,017
First, supporting our school through strong curriculum, special education, athletics, and afterschool programs that give every student a place to belong and a chance to thrive.

26
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:23,138
Second, budgeting for values and stability.

27
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:27,720
That means making sure our spending is transparent, sustainable, and focused on what matters most.

28
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:37,764
Third, delivering a successful Medford High School project, a school we can be proud of that's fiscally responsible and built to meet the needs of today's students, their children, and generations to come.

29
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,149
I believe in collaboration, not confrontation.

30
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:47,152
I believe in clear communication and honest explanations, especially when decisions get complicated.

31
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:52,475
I've spent my career helping folks understand how government works and how to make it work better for them.

32
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:56,158
I'm proud to be a parent and a public servant here in Massachusetts.

33
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,542
Medford deserves a school committee that's focused, informed, and grounded in values.

34
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,664
A team that can plan for the future while protecting what makes our school special today.

35
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,326
I'd be honored to earn your vote on Tuesday, November 4th.

36
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:11,388
Thank you for listening, and thank you so much for caring about our public schools.
