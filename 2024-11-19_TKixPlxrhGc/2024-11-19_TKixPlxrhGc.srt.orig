61
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:31,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President, this was a paper that the council had kicked around for some time during our budget debates.

62
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:42,863
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about how it would be a good idea for us to get quarterly updates as to where we were in terms of our financial stability, our projections, and whether or not we're meeting, exceeding, and the like, Mr. President.

63
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:55,292
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had the opportunity to speak with our finance director this afternoon, and she is prepared to join us this evening and present us with a presentation where we stand three months into the fiscal year after the passage of our budget at the close of the month of June.

64
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:56,875

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here tonight to present Q1.

69
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,684

70
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:10,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

71
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:11,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The Chief of Staff.

72
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:24,096
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could please allow me to share my screen to show a presentation to the Council and the public.

73
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:27,269
[SPEAKER_14]: One minute, we're gonna take care of that.

74
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you should be able to share your screen.

75
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:34,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

76
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Can everyone see my screen?

77
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

78
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:06,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

79
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:11,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So for Q1, the city is meeting its target revenue estimates.

80
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:13,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

81
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:16,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep hearing some kind of ruffling when I'm speaking.

82
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:22,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear it now?

83
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:24,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

84
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:25,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

85
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:42,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I just go through it, even if it's doing that?

86
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:52,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so the city's meeting its target revenue estimates for the year, just minimize that.

87
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:58,298
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, there's a graph of the Q1 local receipts, budget versus actual.

88
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:06,245
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the motor vehicle excise tax, which is the blue column for my estimate and the fiscal year 21 actuals in the orange column.

89
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Penalties and interest is actually up.

90
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Pilots are where we expect them to be.

91
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotel excise is up.

92
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Local meals tax is up.

93
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,592
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time we've gotten a community impact fee.

94
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It's extremely small.

95
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:24,373
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't budget for that.

96
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the very first payment we have.

97
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:27,774
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be on the next screen.

98
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:34,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Rentals, departmental revenue, license and permits is up.

99
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Medicaid doesn't come in until Q2.

100
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:42,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Fines, investment income, and miscellaneous are the last categories.

101
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:51,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to note that for Q1 CARES Act funds couldn't be used as a revenue offset, and no more federal stimulus is at this point.

102
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:58,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And the city conservatively estimated a 10% cut to locally, but fortunately the governor committed to level fund.

103
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:06,407
[SPEAKER_09]: On this slide, you're going to see what we budgeted for Q1 for motor vehicle excise.

104
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:16,050
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all our local receipts, penalties and interest, pilots, hotel excise, local meals tax, community impact fee, which was really small, which is the only $224.25.

105
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:25,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Our fees budgeted at a million for this quarter 250,000 rentals, departmental revenue, license and permits.

106
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Medicaid, which doesn't come in yet until Q2, fines, investment income, and miscellaneous revenue.

107
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:38,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So the 31st one budgeted, the Q1 budgeted estimate for motor vehicle is 667,826.

108
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:41,054
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got in 637,713.

109
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:47,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the far right, I also included a column for fiscal year 20 Q1 actual.

110
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:55,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could actually see what we collected the year before just so you can have a comparison between last year and this year.

111
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Boat excise, we estimate 153.

112
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,605
[SPEAKER_09]: We got 153 penalties and interest.

113
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:03,634
[SPEAKER_09]: 875, we got 118, 313.

114
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Pilots, 450.

115
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:04,574
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the 450.

116
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:08,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotel excise tax, we cut down to 75,000 for our estimate.

117
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:09,939
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually got in 89,638.95.

118
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Local meals tax, we estimated 183, 375.

119
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We got in 194, 875.

120
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Skip over community impact fees.

121
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:28,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the fees, we estimated 250,000.

122
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually got in 370,221.

123
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:30,028
[SPEAKER_09]: For rentals, 1,500.

124
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:30,509
[SPEAKER_09]: We got 1,615.

125
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,949
[SPEAKER_09]: For departmental revenue, we budgeted 156,890.

126
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:32,770
[SPEAKER_09]: We received 153,545.

127
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,371
[SPEAKER_09]: For license and permits, 565,862.

128
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:34,811
[SPEAKER_09]: We received 568,491.

129
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:35,171
[SPEAKER_09]: For fines, 31,250.

130
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,377
[SPEAKER_09]: We got $8,416, so that is down.

131
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Investment income, we estimated $96,250.

132
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We received $6577, so that was actually down.

133
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And miscellaneous revenue, $50,000.

134
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,923
[SPEAKER_09]: We only have $8,000, so that was down.

135
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:04,144
[SPEAKER_09]: But overall, our estimate for Q1 was $2,615,606.

136
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:04,484
[SPEAKER_09]: We received $2,662,642.

137
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,000
[SPEAKER_09]: On this slide, we're just showing you the preliminary 2021 cherry sheet receipts.

138
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,181
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what has passed through the House Way and Means Proposal so far.

139
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:39,583
[SPEAKER_09]: We had estimated a 10% cut to chapter 70, but as I stated previously, the governor decided to commit to local fund of what we had in fiscal year 2020.

140
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can see that 12,000,143,306.

141
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:41,023
[SPEAKER_09]: A charter tuition, 1,000,195,940.

145
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:53,246
[SPEAKER_09]: State only, 52,728.

146
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:53,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Public libraries, 69,107.

147
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So total estimated receipts at 26,581,445.

148
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:20,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Here are the assessments to those local receipts, local aid.

149
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,321
[SPEAKER_09]: $20,303 for air pollution.

150
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,263
[SPEAKER_09]: $31,008 for the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.

151
00:10:23,283 --> 00:10:24,544
[SPEAKER_09]: $53,660 for the RMV non-renewal sue charge.

152
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:25,304
[SPEAKER_09]: $3,081,497 for MBTA assessment.

153
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,626
[SPEAKER_09]: $723 for the Boston Metro Transit District.

154
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:27,206
[SPEAKER_09]: $19,055 for special education.

155
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:48,902
[SPEAKER_09]: $84,917 for school choice sending tuition and charter school sending tuition of $7,714,611 for a total assessment of $11,805,774.

156
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:07,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's just a quick summary of what I just went over so you could see it quickly, what we budgeted versus our preliminary local aid summary.

157
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So the difference in chapter 70, that 1,000,089,537, you're on a little lottery program back to the schools.

158
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,195
[SPEAKER_09]: UGA, we budgeted $11,000,916,986.

159
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,515
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually going to get $12,880,443, a difference of $963,457.

160
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, we have a paper that's reprogramming $740,000 back to the city.

161
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:20,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And in other receipts, $1,031,317 budgeted.

162
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Preliminary, we see $1,557,696, but that's subject to change.

163
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:52,213
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go over the CARES Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.

164
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:57,597
[SPEAKER_09]: So citizens across the United States receive stimulus checks to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic.

165
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:01,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, cities and towns were not given a revenue stimulus.

166
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, the city was awarded funds that must be expended only on COVID-19 eligible expenses.

167
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Cities and towns have revenue issues and no stimulus package has been announced nor an extension on the CARES funding.

168
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:19,155
[SPEAKER_09]: The CARES Act was awarded May 14th, 2020, and will end on December 30th.

169
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:26,319
[SPEAKER_09]: The city has charged 75% of COVID related expenses to FEMA and 25% to CARES.

170
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,241
[SPEAKER_09]: The city is awaiting from FEMA what expenses were deemed ineligible.

171
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be 100% CARES Act funded.

172
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:35,223
[SPEAKER_09]: The CARES Act, 5,093,008 in fiscal 20.

173
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:35,503
[SPEAKER_09]: The city,

174
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:47,137
[SPEAKER_09]: We had encumbered 65,756.22 and expended 132,155.03.

175
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:50,139
[SPEAKER_09]: This number is reflective of 25% of the COVID-19 FEMA eligible expenses.

176
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,520
[SPEAKER_09]: In fiscal year 21, the city has encumbered 1,00,507,939.05 and expended 496,271.89.

177
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The schools in the city will be using the remaining 2.5 to 2.9 million

178
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: for HVAC, PPE, additional personnel and backfill, and various other COVID-19 related expenses until December 31st.

179
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:31,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of those other related expenses include food pantry expenses, additional voting expenses that were allowable.

180
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:37,045
[SPEAKER_09]: FEMA doesn't have an expiration or an award total.

181
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,768
[SPEAKER_09]: The program is open for all eligible COVID-19 expenses.

182
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,254
[SPEAKER_09]: In fiscal 20, the city had encumbered $47,384.03 and expended $288,388.36.

183
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:57,721
[SPEAKER_09]: In fiscal 21, the city has encumbered $102,493.55 and expended $74,497.

184
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:10,751
[SPEAKER_09]: The FEMA funds were drawn down on October 15th, and we haven't heard back from the Fed yet, and there's additional amounts of money that I still need to reclass, but I'm in the middle of the close, that's actually gonna go to FEMA and CARES for back.

185
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:18,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Enterprise fund fiscal year 21 revenues.

186
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:19,466
[SPEAKER_09]: For fiscal year 21, we budgeted $26,351,329.

187
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the Q1, we budgeted $5,616,207.

188
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:21,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal year 20 budget was $26,232,490.

189
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:37,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And last year, we received $5,115,441.39.

190
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:46,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look at the percentages between the two, we're actually right on target for Q1 for our revenues for the Enterprise Fund.

191
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you want me to go down category by category.

192
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:54,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to if you want me to, or if you're OK with just an overall summary.

193
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:58,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I defer to you, Mr. President.

194
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:01,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Either way, I'm satisfied with that.

195
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very happy with what I'm hearing, Mr. President.

196
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,047
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe we can move on.

197
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So for free cash and retained earnings, free cash as of June 30th, we ended with $5,022,079.90.

198
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:17,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight we have a paper reprogramming back $703,000 back to the free cash to increase the free cash ending to $5,725,279.90.

199
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:34,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have estimated preliminary retained earnings at $5,946,094.

200
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:41,774
[SPEAKER_09]: None of these have been certified by DOR.

201
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still in the middle of the close, so these numbers will change.

202
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:54,261
[SPEAKER_09]: In conclusion, the city's Q1 revenues are on target, but the city is closely monitoring revenues throughout the pandemic.

203
00:15:54,702 --> 00:16:00,065
[SPEAKER_09]: The city's CARAC stimulus is set to expire December 30th, even though COVID-19 numbers are currently spiking.

204
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:05,934
[SPEAKER_09]: The city is prepared to assess upon the new year revenues in place a spending freeze if necessary.

205
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:14,876
[SPEAKER_09]: The city hopes your Honorable body will vote to extend 703,000 of the 5,000,496 510 back to free cash to bolster reserves for the next year.

206
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:23,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the governor level funded local aid, the city able to program funds back to the schools and city to stabilize operations.

207
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:30,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

208
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

209
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And through you to Ms.

210
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley, that was an excellent presentation.

211
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:39,724
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very encouraging to hear what we're hearing in terms of the financial picture.

212
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:47,628
[SPEAKER_15]: So this year's fiscal year budget relies on about a $5.5 million free cash appropriation to balance the budget.

213
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:59,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And based upon what I'm seeing now, we are achieving about, what, $2.5 million of an increase in state aid from what we budgeted for, if that's correct, Ms.

214
00:16:59,775 --> 00:16:59,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Nunley?

215
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:01,145
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

216
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:08,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So that takes up about half of that structural deficit that we budgeted with the $5.5 million for free cash appropriation?

217
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:10,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

218
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why we wanted to reprogram some of that back to stabilize operations because we had to cut so much on the school and the city side.

219
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:16,632
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

220
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:27,236
[SPEAKER_15]: And looking at moving forward based upon these projections, do you think that we're going to be on pace to eliminate that structural deficit with our receipts?

221
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:34,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on how Q2 plays out, yes, I mean, so far, Q1 is very encouraging.

222
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,743
[SPEAKER_09]: We're meeting and exceeding actually what we estimated.

223
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So Q1 looks really well.

224
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:42,626
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now, let's see how Q2 through Q4 look, but yes.

225
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:48,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

226
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:48,710
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

227
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

228
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

229
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:51,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs.

230
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:53,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

231
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the presentation, Alicia.

232
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:56,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly,

233
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we had a structural deficit and used free cash to address it, but there were significant cuts to the budget.

234
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:11,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just wondering what percentage of those cuts has been restored so far on the school side and on the city side.

235
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:16,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, well, for tonight, we're asking to program funds.

236
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:23,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So we haven't restored any funds on the city side yet, but on the school side we have, I don't know exactly what the percentage would be.

237
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:26,243
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be something to ask the school finance director.

238
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:27,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

239
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:33,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, then on, if we were to approve the, uh, appropriations tonight, how much would that restore on the city side?

240
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:44,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That would restore $740,000, uh, back to the city side for some positions that we need to stabilize operations.

241
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:50,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't have a percentage, but I certainly can give you that after the meeting.

242
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,981
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be helpful.

243
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:55,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess just, um, this might be for you or for, uh, chief of staff Rodriguez, but, um,

244
00:18:56,805 --> 00:19:02,873
[SPEAKER_08]: How much of this appropriation would go to restoring positions that were cut versus creating new positions?

245
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The position of Facilities Director was previously in the budget was cut.

246
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,401
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a funded but unfilled position that was there.

247
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:29,403
[SPEAKER_05]: The 9-1-1 supervisor is a new position, but that is something that we feel is very important to stabilize operations down at 9-1-1 Dispatch.

248
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:33,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Lieutenant Rudolph from the PSAP is here to answer questions in that regard.

249
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:36,745
[SPEAKER_05]: We took a very thoughtful approach when we looked to add in

250
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:41,166
[SPEAKER_05]: any of this, reprogram any of this money to what we needed at the time.

251
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:53,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can take a look at, do the apples to apples comparison as to what was cut and what was being restored, but we kind of looked at it with fresh eyes when we were drafting the paper as to what we needed now and going forward.

252
00:19:54,408 --> 00:20:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to note also, and Alicia can shed some light on this as well, that the appropriation that's gonna be discussed later is for full year appropriations.

253
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to give the public and the council

254
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:12,385
[SPEAKER_05]: a full picture of what this will be a year-over-year cost, not just what we're actually going to need for FY21.

255
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But it should be about half of that.

256
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:23,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as we do ramp up the hiring process for those positions, it should be a month or two until we get everybody on board and start drawing down money like that.

257
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:29,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to give a full picture of what this would be, but not what it's actually going to be for FY21.

258
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that gets to kind of the heart of my question on the thoughtful approach, which is where

259
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:42,358
[SPEAKER_08]: where does this fit into your, to the plans for long-term plans that the administration has?

260
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:53,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if we're prioritizing the positions listed here, does that mean that there are positions that were cut that we're no longer prioritizing or may not be prioritized going forward?

261
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:58,197
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it's, I don't think it's, these are certainly priorities.

262
00:20:58,277 --> 00:21:00,340
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean that these are our only priorities.

263
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:08,633
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the ones that we, that the mayor felt very strongly about re-appropriating back into the budget to help stabilize operations.

264
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:10,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking over it again.

265
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:13,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The facilities manager and the maintenance lines.

266
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:18,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We are expecting a final capital improvement plan to be released in December.

267
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:27,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the preliminary finding of the Collins Center, working with our staff, that the number one thing that we needed to do was get a facilities manager on board as soon as possible.

268
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be a long-term savings for us in terms of facility maintenance costs and addressing some of these long-term needs.

269
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding this has been a long-term priority of the council.

270
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:40,148
[SPEAKER_05]: as well, so we want to make sure that that was in there.

271
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Ellen Bordeaux is also on board.

272
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,092
[SPEAKER_05]: The call, or she will be, yep, there she is, to talk about the assessing position that's adding in her office.

273
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:58,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always been my role, the way that I looked at it, is investments in the assessing department are investments in the long-term financial health of the community.

274
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more money that we invest there, the more money is returned back to the community based on being able to fulfill the goals of the assessing department and bring money back to the community to make sure that what we're assessing is accurate and up to date.

275
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I'm just, and I appreciate this presentation very much.

276
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:40,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not nothing about this presentation, but I think what might be helpful if we're going to continue kind of going through this quarter by quarter process going forward is an understanding of how much these appropriations are restoring funds and programs and positions that were cut in the initial FY 21 budget, how much of them are going to new positions and kind of

277
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:44,827
[SPEAKER_08]: how much of that budget we expect to be able to restore going forward.

278
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just something that would be helpful for me.

279
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:48,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

280
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

281
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:58,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for following up on this.

282
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:06,782
[SPEAKER_03]: These type of presentations, in my opinion, are extremely important and aren't done frequently enough to this council.

283
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:09,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate Councilor Knight following up on this.

284
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:11,945
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is twofold.

285
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: First, what

286
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding the capital plan is part of this current budget now.

287
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:27,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that's in the capital plan, what would be expended out of the current budget?

288
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do we anticipate bonding for everything?

289
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: The capital plan will outline, it'll be a five-year plan, potentially a six-year plan, depending on how things are structured, and it will identify different funding sources for each different project.

290
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Capital improvement plans are generally guidance roadmaps.

291
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,512
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not necessarily budgets per se.

292
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:51,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Spending would be included within the budget and be subject to appropriation from the city council.

293
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:56,378
[SPEAKER_05]: But a CIP is just to give the council, the administration, and the community

294
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,406
[SPEAKER_05]: a good sense of what the needs are so that we can plan for in the long term.

295
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:10,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be, as part of the analysis that was done by the Collins Center, it's not only just identifying the projects, but working with Alicia and her team as to identify potential funding sources.

296
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:11,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not always

297
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always bonding.

298
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:18,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's using proceeds from the sale of real estate, for example, is a good one.

299
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, grant funding.

300
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's some 9-1-1 funding that's in there.

301
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:30,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Using our money as intelligently and as resourcefully as we possibly can to address the capital needs.

302
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So they took a deep dive of all that.

303
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been working closely with Alicia.

304
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:46,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so online to what Councilor Beers mentioned, do we have any idea what percent of this $740,000 would be actually items that would be part of the capital plan?

305
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:54,141
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a $200,000 line item that's in there to address maintenance for the remainder of FY21.

306
00:24:54,241 --> 00:25:03,383
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of the FY22 budget development process, we'll start to take a look at what those needs are and start to fold in some things from the capital improvement plan as it's finalized in December.

307
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:12,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So this $740,000 would be an integral part of moving forward with a five- or six-year capital plan?

308
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:25,548
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of folding in the facilities manager and this small $200,000 nest egg for facilities maintenance is going to be a huge part in making sure that we get some momentum as part of that long-term plan, that's correct.

309
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:36,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are we taking this approach that we haven't seen a capital plan but we're moving forward with items that may or may not be part of the capital plan?

310
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:43,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the facilities and the maintenance has been a huge thing that the city council has been talking about.

311
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:51,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the mayor's office has been talking about it with looking at the different fire stations, looking at the different buildings and the different needs within the school system.

312
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,342
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just the first step towards taking care of that need.

313
00:25:55,462 --> 00:26:02,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not, I mean, it's in the capital plan, but this is definitely a need that I think both the mayor and the city council will agree upon.

314
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:20,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we're moving forward now, although we just did the budget four months ago, is that this newfound money is giving us the ability to progress on some of the issues that the city needs to move forward on.

315
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why we're looking at this?

316
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:22,805
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

317
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:33,033
[SPEAKER_09]: We took a 10% cut assumption with our local aid, and we were very thankful the governor level funded to fiscal year 20 levels, which gave us some flexibility to take care of those needs.

318
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So my other point, and I think you're right with some of these concerns, and I do support many of the items in here.

319
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:48,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get to this paper, I have other questions on this paper itself.

320
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:57,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But regarding some of these positions, there's been long discussion, not just this particular year with the election.

321
00:26:58,554 --> 00:27:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: that the elections department just went through, but for the past several years, this city has requested an election coordinator.

322
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:11,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently don't have someone that coordinates our elections.

323
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:18,962
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a city clerk that wears multiple hats, but he is not an elections coordinator.

324
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:23,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the surrounding cities and towns that I looked into have that position.

325
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:36,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason, the city of Method, with a city of almost 60,000 people and 41,000 registered voters, we don't have someone that coordinates our elections.

326
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:39,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a shortfall in this community.

327
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:45,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And with everything going on nationally, that it's very important that

328
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:54,657
[SPEAKER_03]: We have someone that can make sure the integrity of our election is what everyone would come to expect.

329
00:27:55,237 --> 00:28:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So have we looked into, I know this council has put forward several, and I know I've put forward a couple, and I know my colleagues have, several requests for the city administration to hire an elections coordinator.

330
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:12,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the mayor has sat down and has discussed the issue.

331
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:14,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give us an update?

332
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:19,855
[SPEAKER_03]: where we stand with an election coordinator, and why it's not part of this list here.

333
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:26,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thankfully this year, the CARES Act has allowed additional funding towards the election.

334
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:33,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been allowing this CARES Act funding to help with election costs that are unbudgeted.

335
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will let Dave speak on the mayor's behalf.

336
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:42,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But for right now, the best use of the fund was to use our grant funds at this point.

337
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:53,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but those are one-time funds, and I'm talking about a long-term plan in the community to have oversight within a very important department.

338
00:28:54,589 --> 00:29:03,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when this list that we're going to go over soon that was presented to us, this is to help the city move forward on some shortfalls that we have.

339
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:09,120
[SPEAKER_03]: or shortcomings, I should say, in how we operate city government.

340
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my opinion, election coordinators should be at the top of the list, to be quite frank.

341
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:18,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that we can get some answers tonight on this.

342
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,978
[SPEAKER_05]: During these were conversations.

343
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:22,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So the council, you're a hundred percent correct.

344
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:36,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a conversation with, with clerk Herbies and some of his team shortly after the September election to kind of do an after action to try to debrief a little bit on what we could, what we, what we could do better and some improvements that we can make for November.

345
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:37,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did work together.

346
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:42,242
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor's office attempted to provide as much support as we possibly could to clerk Herbies.

347
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:43,142
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that it was helpful.

348
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kind of regrouped at that point and said,

349
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:54,905
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get through the 18th of November when the election is certified, do the same thing again, and evaluate what that position could look like.

350
00:29:54,965 --> 00:30:11,149
[SPEAKER_05]: What they would do in a 12-month cycle, the duties that they would have to perform, the type of compensation, and really be thoughtful about how we're going to approach it instead of creating something in the heat of the election that might not be in the long-term best interest to do things.

351
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:16,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are certainly evaluating it, and we're hopefully going to have a good conversation with Adam and his team.

352
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,995
[SPEAKER_05]: shortly after the election is certified on the 18th to assess just that.

353
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:25,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so and I appreciate that response, Dave.

354
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:35,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that a fair amount of work over the past two years has already gone into what this petition position would

355
00:30:37,978 --> 00:30:50,325
[SPEAKER_03]: be created for what purpose, the duties and responsibilities, the actual job title, who they would oversee, the responsibilities, the salary and the position.

356
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:54,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of the legwork that you just mentioned has been done.

357
00:30:54,367 --> 00:31:03,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So to hear that this is something that we're going to look at once again after the election seems to be, with all due respect, more lip service.

358
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:17,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to get my support for this particular paper, and I don't know where my colleagues stand, but I can tell you we've all reiterated this over and over and over again ad nauseum.

359
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:22,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not support a paper that doesn't include an election coordinator position.

360
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can work out the details.

361
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:32,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The facilities manager, I haven't seen the job description other than the title and the salary.

362
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything else about that position.

363
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,860
[SPEAKER_03]: But it found its way in this paper.

364
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:46,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would think, in my opinion, that there's been more homework and due diligence done already for the election coordinator position.

365
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:53,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The need's there, the demand is there, and the integrity of our elections is extremely important in this day and age.

366
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:56,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have someone facilitate and pull this together.

367
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:00,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is vital in this community, extremely vital.

368
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:04,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to put that out there.

369
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:16,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not support this paper unless the paper includes the election coordinator position that this council has voted on, I believe unanimously, a half a dozen times in the last two years.

370
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:18,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll let my colleagues speak for themselves.

371
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to let you know where I stand on this.

372
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:24,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not personally seen a job description or

373
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:28,512
[SPEAKER_05]: a compensation study or any of the duties and responsibilities.

374
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen anything detailing that sort of thing.

375
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:38,336
[SPEAKER_05]: If that exists, I'm happy to take a look at it and elevate that to the mayor as soon as possible so that we can further evaluate and take those things into consideration.

376
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to note, we have not seen that information.

377
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:46,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's out there, so we will get you a copy of that.

378
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

379
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

380
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

381
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:53,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions from the council?

382
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:56,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs.

383
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:58,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,382
[SPEAKER_08]: For one, I agree with Councilor Marks on the elections coordinator position.

385
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's essential.

386
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:08,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had one more question and I didn't want to, I was trying not to mix topics too much.

387
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:17,290
[SPEAKER_08]: In the presentation, Alicia, you mentioned that 2.5 to 2.9 million in CARES will be spent on HVAC PPE and additional personnel.

388
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we know what additional personnel would be covered under that?

389
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:22,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

390
00:33:22,828 --> 00:33:28,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the school side, they asked if they could have some additional aides to help with the hybrid model.

391
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the school side, they'll have some additional aides.

392
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,495
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as personnel, also any backfill.

393
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:41,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if anybody gets sick and we need to hire somebody to cover their position, that would be the additional personnel.

394
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:46,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the HVAC, is that just school HVAC or city HVAC?

395
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,325
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the school's HVAC.

396
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:49,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

397
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:50,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

398
00:33:51,031 --> 00:34:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna add on the personnel side, that the personnel costs for, that are being used for CARES also covers the cost of greeters at City Hall, contact tracers, food security folks, as well as a number of other individuals supporting our COVID relief efforts.

399
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:06,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

400
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:08,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council.

401
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caviello, then Councilor Morrell, Vice President Caviello.

402
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

403
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, do we have a summary of where we are with our HVAC stuff at schools as of today?

404
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:26,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have that information prepared for this evening.

405
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:31,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We can circle back to the school department and see if we can get that for you.

406
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:38,062
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could, I'd be appreciative because I don't know where we're at and I think the people would like to know where we're at.

407
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:42,045
[SPEAKER_11]: But having that ready to go moving forward.

408
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:53,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caviello, if I may, do you want to add that as an amendment to the paper that we receive an update with regard to the HVAC situation at Medford High School or- Yes, if you could add that as an amendment to the paper.

409
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:54,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

410
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:56,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Mr. President.

411
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:59,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Kelly.

412
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can add to that amendment, I know that in the update of who's going back to school, I think that we've asked that at the last meeting, and parents have been calling us that I believe juniors and seniors are going back in the vocational school, and they're very confused.

413
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:20,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can get an update with that, if that's okay as well.

414
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:22,510
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have an amendment by- Second the motion.

415
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli as well.

416
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caviello.

417
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:27,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can get one more, Mr. President, amendment to the paper.

418
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:34,510
[SPEAKER_11]: A report on where our staffing levels are with both the police and the fire departments.

419
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we were short some people on both the pen.

420
00:35:39,732 --> 00:35:41,853
[SPEAKER_11]: And there'll be some retirements coming up next year.

421
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a plan to put people in classes?

422
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:47,714
[SPEAKER_11]: because I know it takes about a year to get a policeman out to the floor.

423
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:55,597
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can get an update on where we are staffing with both the police and the fire, and if we have anybody in classes at the moment.

424
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,511
[SPEAKER_14]: We have that amendment.

425
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:58,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

426
00:35:58,733 --> 00:35:59,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

427
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:00,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Vice President Caviello.

428
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:01,658
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Council Morrell.

429
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:03,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

430
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:08,784
[SPEAKER_10]: If, through the chair, I could just ask Alicia just a few questions just to offer, I'm sorry, for clarity.

431
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind me of the deadlines as far as the CARES Act funding.

432
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:16,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it that services need to be rendered by that December date?

433
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:17,146
[SPEAKER_10]: It's billed.

434
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:26,948
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that, I'm just trying to understand how that 2.5 to 2.9 applies as far as regarding, would that only be staff for before the break?

435
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:31,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you could just offer clarity on how that money and the timing of how it has to be spent.

436
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:36,688
[SPEAKER_09]: services have to be rendered by December 30th.

437
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:44,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so it would only cover personnel for the remainder, I guess, this term until the Christmas break?

438
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:50,394
[SPEAKER_09]: It would cover until December 30th, so they could charge up to December 30th and after that they could not.

439
00:36:50,975 --> 00:37:02,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so just to make sure I'm clear on this, so that could not cover staff, that would not support any staff from January through the spring?

440
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:03,463
[SPEAKER_09]: You are correct.

441
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,045
[SPEAKER_09]: You are absolutely correct.

442
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:11,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though COVID is soaring, there's no extension right now, no further stimulus, and it's set to expire December 30th.

443
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

444
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, and do you believe you will, you're able to spend all 2.5 to 2.9 or will, might you come back and say, just due to what was accepted and what was available, we spent X number of dollars out of this?

445
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,175
[SPEAKER_09]: As of right now, I estimate we will fully spend.

446
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,035
[SPEAKER_09]: My big concern more is with FEMA.

447
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:39,237
[SPEAKER_09]: FEMA takes a long time to tell us what's accepted and not accepted.

448
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:41,057
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we,

449
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:47,079
[SPEAKER_09]: charged it to FEMA, that 75%, and then FEMA comes back and says, no, I got to move that to CARES.

450
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So they kind of move in tandem.

451
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:57,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that we will hear something from FEMA soon on our first drawdown, so we know what items are rejected versus what items are accepted.

452
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,363
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

453
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:02,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

454
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:03,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

455
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

456
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:05,345
[SPEAKER_07]: President.

457
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: My question was, I know that you were in sort of a hot seat last time.

458
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:20,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be clear, all of our funding will be spent with the CARES Act, correct?

459
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

460
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:26,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so there's not going to be the biggest things, how are we leaving money on the table?

461
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:27,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not happening, correct?

462
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:28,996
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't, no.

463
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:32,499
[SPEAKER_09]: We estimate we're going to fully expend it by December 30th.

464
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:33,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

465
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:42,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I know I too have a couple of questions with when Council Marks brought up with the facilities and a little bit more detail.

466
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:51,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was a mistake, but I thought, or maybe my mistake, that when you were talking about the facilities position.

467
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:56,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That person's only working on city buildings, correct?

468
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny McLaughlin's still in charge of the school buildings.

469
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:03,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that person now going to be overseeing all the buildings in the city?

470
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:18,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be some crossover on the building and school side, but in terms of, this is more of a facilities, a strategic facilities position in lieu of, in addition to what Mr. McLaughlin does on the school side.

471
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is designed to complement the work that John does, not to replace it, and look at strategic facilities maintenance in a more comprehensive way across the board, both city and school side.

472
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:38,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I don't want to keep jumping around.

473
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:51,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that this is different topics, but again, I appreciate all the work we're doing, and I know this is getting difficult, so I'll leave more questions to our other resolutions, so thank you.

474
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:53,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

475
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:53,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott Kelly.

476
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:54,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Talk all night.

477
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you.

478
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:03,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to just amend the paper and request that we receive a copy of the Warren Articles from January to date and monthly thereafter.

479
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:07,463
[SPEAKER_15]: The Warren Articles are where we spend our money, the bills, and how we paid for them.

480
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:13,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment, Mr. President, or a motion to amend the paper if we want to move forward on it.

481
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:23,382
[SPEAKER_15]: But it sounds like we have an update on the HVAC system and a copy of the Warren articles from January to date and monthly thereafter as amendments to paper 20559.

482
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:29,328
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of discussion, a lot of talk about the other two papers that are on the table, and those are the money papers, Mr. President.

483
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:38,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very satisfied with the presentation that we got this evening, so I'm going to be bold and suggest that we take this paper to a vote and we move on to the money papers.

484
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,141
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have the amendment, the amendment would be to get year-to-date, that's calendar year, January 1st.

485
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:52,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect, okay, great.

486
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:54,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, if you wouldn't mind, if I ask a quick question.

487
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:56,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

488
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:02,068
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's see, so Alicia, thank you very much for your report, appreciate it.

489
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:05,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be possible that the council gets a copy of that report?

490
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:07,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, I'll send it to the clerk.

491
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:08,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

492
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:12,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And with regard to, you talked about your month being closed.

493
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,393
[SPEAKER_14]: You're closing the month of October still, am I correct?

494
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:17,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm closing the fiscal year.

495
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're closing the fiscal year.

496
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay.

497
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:21,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

498
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:30,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of, I guess, have a more specific question because I know we had a lot of discussion in our prior meetings about KP Law.

499
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: How did those numbers look so far with regard to Q1, what was budgeted versus what was actually spent?

500
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a lot of projects going on.

501
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've had a number of meetings for different ordinances.

502
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:47,832
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had different attorneys from KP Law helping us with each of those projects.

503
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:50,993
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe they're also helping out on the 40B front as well.

504
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:55,099
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was wondering if you could just kind of comment on that as to where we are.

505
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we in line with what we have budgeted for that specific expense to KP Law?

506
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:05,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a purchase order for KP Law, but I haven't processed any invoice payments yet.

507
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:08,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can speak to that, Mr. President.

508
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:15,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the appearances from attorneys from KPA at council meetings and other, those are all covered under the retainer agreement.

509
00:42:15,842 --> 00:42:17,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not an hourly fee.

510
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Any adversarial matters are based on that.

511
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,108
[SPEAKER_05]: that hourly fee that was inside the proposal.

512
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that we are in line with what we were budgeted.

513
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,070
[SPEAKER_05]: They are separate.

514
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Board of Appeals manages that litigation process of 40 Bs.

515
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:42,438
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get a breakdown of what they've done so far on that, but it's my indication that everything's been in line with what we've budgeted so far.

516
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:45,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I'm correct, 40 Bs are outside of the $60,000 contract?

517
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,621
[SPEAKER_14]: The $5,000 a month retainer, yes.

518
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Any adversarial, anything adversarial, any litigation or anything like that would be outside of that room too.

519
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:59,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so can we get a breakdown of that if someone else wants to offer that?

520
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:02,309
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I, on the motion of...

521
00:43:03,512 --> 00:43:20,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Carviello to seconded by Councilor Knight to get a breakdown of the fees so far paid to KP Law under the $5,000 a month contract and with regard to any work that's done, for example, like 40 Bs outside of that.

522
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:28,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have that Councilor?

523
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:44,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I may, more specifically, Alicia, have we paid any claims in excess of $5,000 this calendar year that did not come before the council for approval?

524
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we paid any what?

525
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I apologize.

526
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:49,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

527
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:53,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Any claims against the city in excess of $5,000?

528
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:01,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have to get back to the council and look for that.

529
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have that off the top of my head.

530
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:04,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to research.

531
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:05,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

532
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:08,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you please actually vice-president.

533
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:21,656
[SPEAKER_14]: If vice-president Caviello, if you wouldn't mind, if we could have an amendment to the paper to get a breakdown of all claims that have been paid over $5,000 since January 1st, 2020.

534
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:27,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything pending?

535
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilman.

536
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:46,518
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all amendments.

537
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,941
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I may, last but not least, and this is for

538
00:44:54,769 --> 00:44:56,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff.

539
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:03,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe Council Knight has asked repeatedly since January 1st for a breakdown of consultants that the administration has hired.

540
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:12,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we gonna get that breakdown of the consultants, who's been hired, what they're doing, how much they're paid?

541
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,107
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to have fallen upon deaf ears.

542
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:21,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's a request that's been made numerous times by this council and we have yet to receive any type of documentation.

543
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you please?

544
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I will actually correct you.

545
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:27,710
[SPEAKER_05]: We did send something over the summer after it was requested.

546
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can look back at my records.

547
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that it was sent via email so I can send it over.

548
00:45:31,652 --> 00:45:35,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in a memo that we included regarding the budget process.

549
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:38,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy to send that out, to resend that along.

550
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,997
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a breakdown of consultants that were hired?

551
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:40,718
Yep.

552
00:45:41,618 --> 00:45:42,219
[SPEAKER_14]: In what they're doing?

553
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:43,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

554
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And how much they're being paid?

555
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

556
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,942
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could resend that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

557
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:47,382
[SPEAKER_05]: As requested.

558
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:51,593
[SPEAKER_14]: A number of my colleagues don't remember seeing that.

559
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:52,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I haven't seen it, so.

560
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,766
[SPEAKER_15]: I do believe that document does exist and then recently we also asked for

561
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:08,216
[SPEAKER_15]: a report on whether or not we're using outside council to negotiate salaries, negotiate contracts.

562
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,257
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a response to that as well, I believe.

563
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:11,618
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've gotten a couple of responses.

564
00:46:11,658 --> 00:46:16,541
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think it might even warrant a committee of the home, Mr. President, if that's the case, you know what I mean?

565
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:17,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can all get on the same page.

566
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd certainly be willing to entertain that as well.

567
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

568
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other council, any other questions from the council?

569
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:26,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Alicia, thank you for your presentation.

570
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:28,487
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of council and I,

571
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:39,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Vice President Caviello, as amended by Vice President Caviello, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caviello, Councilor Night, Vice President Caviello, and Vice President Caviello.

572

[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, Clerk, please call the roll.

573
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,620

574

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

575
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,081
Vice President Caviello?

576
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:47,801
Yes.

578
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:48,641

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

587
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,544
[SPEAKER_14]: 70 affirmatives, zero negatives.

588
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:56,465
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

589
00:46:58,045 --> 00:46:59,026
[SPEAKER_14]: We're under suspension.

590
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:21,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We have 20-634, communications from the mayor, November 5th, 2020, to the honorable president and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves to partially rescind

591
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:36,599
[SPEAKER_14]: the appropriation of free cash per council paper 20-464 in the amount of $703,000 that was used to subsidize the fiscal 2021 general fund budget due to the health pandemic and current economic conditions.

592
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,823
[SPEAKER_14]: The balance of free cash before this vote is 5,022,279.90.

593
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:49,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Finance director Alicia Nunley-Benjamin is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

594
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval, Mr. President.

595
00:47:50,788 --> 00:47:52,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo-Kernbeck.

596
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Mr. President, move approval.

597
00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:58,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that... Are there any questions on this?

598
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:00,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure that nobody wants to speak.

599
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

600
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:03,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

601
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,167
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Scarapelli.

602
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:07,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Speak to that.

603
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:09,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Beers, Councilor Knight.

604
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:16,355
[SPEAKER_15]: An item of this much severity, I just would like a brief presentation from the finance director, Mr. President.

605
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,076
[SPEAKER_15]: We're taking a vote.

606
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:23,360
[SPEAKER_15]: We took a $5.5 million vote some months back and we're taking a vote now for 700K.

607
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it would make sense to get at least a presentation to bring us full circle.

608
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:31,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, if you could please give us a free synopsis of the paper.

609
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:35,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so we're asking to rescind $703,000 back.

610
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:40,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, our new growth number actually came in higher than we expected.

611
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We had budgeted $1 million, but we actually got $1.7 million.

612
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:47,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's allowing us to re-appropriate back to the free cash $703,000.

613
00:48:51,302 --> 00:49:03,610
[SPEAKER_15]: So this 703,000 represents the $703,000 in new growth that is above and beyond the forecasted estimate at the close of the last fiscal year?

614
00:49:04,371 --> 00:49:04,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

615
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:05,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

616
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:08,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

617
00:49:08,754 --> 00:49:09,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Peers.

618
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll ask you a question too.

619
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:20,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there any consideration to using this money to address budget cuts that were made in fiscal 21?

620
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:27,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we used our local aid cuts to address the budget cuts in 21.

621
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:33,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also knew that we had to use our free cash to balance the budget.

622
00:49:34,124 --> 00:49:36,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't need to use as much as we took.

623
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:37,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that we're going red.

624
00:49:37,925 --> 00:49:40,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not sure how next year's going to look.

625
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:45,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So we think the most prudent financial thing to do right now is to reprogram and bolster reserves for next year.

626
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:47,548
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thank you.

627
00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:49,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

628
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:50,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Carviello.

629
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:51,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

630
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:57,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia, the union contracts that were negotiated, which union is that with?

631
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:59,567
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the wrong one.

632
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:10,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe we can discuss those right now, what we're discussing in negotiations, but I'll turn it over to Chief Rodriguez.

633
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:23,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we have any other brief email sent over to Council a couple months ago regarding the outstanding contracts, which including the police superiors, the newly formed dispatchers,

634
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:32,870
[SPEAKER_05]: form of inspectors, RAC, and TDW form of the superintendents, as well as the newly formed dispatchers union.

635
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:39,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So all three of those are still pending negotiation in varying stages of that.

636
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:42,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Dave, you said those are pending?

637
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are currently in negotiation.

638
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:45,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are currently pending.

639
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:51,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And the yearly retirement incentive, how many employees took up the yearly retirement incentive?

640
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:58,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was a program that was discussed during the budget process that we took a closer look at after the budget was passed.

641
00:50:58,398 --> 00:51:01,239
[SPEAKER_05]: We got together with Alicia and we wanted to get the mayor's thoughts on this.

642
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have an exact number.

643
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:16,066
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a placeholder number that we're putting in place for now in order to determine exactly how much money we might be able to offer for an early retirement incentive in varying degrees as we figure out part of our net losses.

644
00:51:16,627 --> 00:51:19,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something that we plan to use going forward as a placeholder.

645
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not 100% sure it's exactly the incentive that we're going to be offering, but we do plan on offering an incentive of some varying degree at some point in time.

646
00:51:30,439 --> 00:51:34,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And the $200,000 for facility maintenance, is that going to be spread out amongst all the buildings?

647
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:35,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

648
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:36,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

649
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:39,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

650
00:51:41,586 --> 00:51:42,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions?

651
00:51:42,506 --> 00:51:43,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Counselor Knight.

652
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:45,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

653
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:46,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you to the Chief of Staff.

654
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:48,030
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I'm understanding this correctly,

655
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:53,040
[SPEAKER_15]: We're asking for a $200,000 appropriation to go into the negotiated salaries account.

656
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confused.

657
00:51:57,162 --> 00:52:03,865
[SPEAKER_15]: That funding would or would not be subject to further appropriation after the contract is settled?

658
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be subject to transfer.

659
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:14,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So once it's appropriated, we would transfer it out of the negotiated salaries to appropriate buy-in to address the obligations of the community.

660
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:22,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the past practice has always been that the administration negotiates the contract.

661
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:30,109
[SPEAKER_15]: They provide us with the opportunity to vote on the compensation package and fund the contract at that time.

662
00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:33,572
[SPEAKER_15]: So this seems to be a little bit different than that.

663
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:34,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that safe to say?

664
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different.

665
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:43,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if that's more style than substance, I don't think there will be the opportunity to discuss all those matters with the council prior to any further transportation.

666
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:52,110
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I may, a lot of the questions that are being asked, I think right now are pertaining to the next paper, which is 635.

667
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,171
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is 634, which is for the 703,000.

668
00:52:56,211 --> 00:53:06,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so on the motion of councilor Scott Peli to approve the paper seconded by councilor Behrs.

669
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:08,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk Cunaby, please call the roll.

670
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:09,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

671
00:53:16,888 --> 00:53:17,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

672
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:18,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

673
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:20,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

674
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:20,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

675
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:22,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

676
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:23,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

677
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven.

678
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,350
[SPEAKER_14]: The affirmative zero in the negative.

679
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,250
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

680
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,330
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

681
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:39,013
[SPEAKER_14]: A suspension to zero dash six, three, five communications from the mayor, November 5th, 2020 to the honorable president and members of the Memphis city council, city hall, Medford, Massachusetts, zero two one five five.

682
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:53,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear Mr. President and City Council, as I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body amends the fiscal 2021 budget to appropriate $740,000 in zero cents in available funds to the following departments as follows.

683
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:59,742
[SPEAKER_14]: 200,000 for union contracts, $100,000 for early retirement incentive,

684
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:09,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So 200,000 union contracts, the account description is negotiated salaries.

685
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:13,999
[SPEAKER_14]: 100,000 early retirement incentives, account description is negotiated salaries.

686
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,320
[SPEAKER_14]: $10,000 for translation services.

687
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:21,039
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the description of the accounts translation services.

688
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,142
[SPEAKER_14]: $95,000 for facilities, salary expense facility managers, full-time salaries.

689
00:54:27,502 --> 00:54:30,464
[SPEAKER_14]: $200,000 facilities maintenance, that's for maintenance.

690
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:36,427
[SPEAKER_14]: The assessor, $65,000 for administrative assessor, that's full-time salaries.

691
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the police, 70,000 for the 911 supervisor, and that is full-time salaries.

692
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, would you like to comment on this paper?

693
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:56,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so I know that the citizens and the council and the mayor, we were all talking about translation services, that that's important.

694
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:59,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was added to be part of amending the budget.

695
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:10,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Also part of this paper that 295,000 for the facilities manager and the facilities maintenance would create a new facilities department, which is greatly needed within the city.

696
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The assessors, 65,000 administrative assessor position.

697
00:55:14,863 --> 00:55:26,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spoken to the assessor and the assessor really needs that position to help out with going out, assessing properties, in addition to helping with other administrative tasks.

698
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:32,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And the union contracts, the 200,000 would be put into the budget.

699
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:38,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would come back before you once contracts are settled for us to fund those and accept those contracts.

700
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President?

701
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, actually, I'm sorry, Councilor Scott Peli, that is for Councilor Marks.

702
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:48,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Peli.

703
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:49,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

704
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:50,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alicia.

705
00:55:50,686 --> 00:55:57,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I know the administration tried to reach out, and I just didn't have time to circle back with them.

706
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:06,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a tough time tonight without, these are some initiatives that we have talked about and waiting on.

707
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of vagueness to it in the sense that the job description of facilities manager, the facilities for $200,000, what that would entail.

708
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we took a tour of all the fire stations and it's going to be a lot more than 200,000.

709
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to know more detail what

710
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,683
[SPEAKER_04]: what that would look like, what we're focusing on $200,000 for.

711
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that Mr. Rodriguez talked about having the assessor, getting more information and understanding the administrative assessor that how are we going to, we see more tenfold in hiring that position.

712
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:56,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know more about the 911 supervisor and what role they're playing and how that's working out so far before we commit to a supervisor position.

713
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:10,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of variables here that I don't know if I'm comfortable to vote on this money until I know more about that.

714
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:13,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that can be done in today's meeting.

715
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:18,271
[SPEAKER_04]: put a lot of work to this, but at the same time, I do have questions.

716
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:23,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't, um, that's where I stand.

717
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the fire department task force.

718
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:29,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have toured all the fire stations and I absolutely do agree with you.

719
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:29,878
[SPEAKER_09]: $200,000 is not going to fix them all.

720
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:29,998
[SPEAKER_09]: But

721
00:57:33,573 --> 00:57:36,135
[SPEAKER_09]: facilities department, that's a step in the right direction.

722
00:57:36,516 --> 00:57:43,061
[SPEAKER_09]: They need somebody that has that skillset to come in and look at those facilities and say, this is what needs to be done.

723
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:44,623
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we need to do.

724
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:45,884
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how we should do it.

725
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:48,866
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have anybody on staff with that kind of expertise.

726
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:54,471
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, as far as any kind of maintenance that needs to be done, we don't have a maintenance budget.

727
00:57:58,393 --> 00:58:11,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the concept but again it when I'm voting on something I want to know more details of what this person is doing and where if this person just focus on just doing the fire stations there's a lot of the questions that we're talking about

728
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:18,418
[SPEAKER_04]: a building facility here, what we're doing with outside buildings, what are they going to be working with the school system?

729
00:58:18,758 --> 00:58:22,059
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the roles that they're going to be doing combined?

730
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be too daunting for one facilities manager that if they are working as part of the total facilities, being with the working, giving time to the schools, considering that that's a daunting task.

731
00:58:35,942 --> 00:58:41,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of questions that, and I appreciate what you're saying, but again, the job itself.

732
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:47,549
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it just needs more of an understanding what it's for, so I can wrap myself around and understand this.

733
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:52,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is something we've all pushed, and this is something that we all want.

734
00:58:52,413 --> 00:59:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, to look at the big picture, this just looks like, in a sense, another round of budgets.

735
00:59:03,638 --> 00:59:08,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And because these are the changes we have, the additional money that we have, so it'll be nice to work on it.

736
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd like to talk about it and get more details on it.

737
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

738
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:15,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you being on the task force.

739
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:20,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all know that we can spend $200,000 on one of the stations.

740
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:25,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, I know we need the facilities manager to outline that.

741
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:31,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that I need more information for what we're trying to do with that position and where we're going with it.

742
00:59:31,847 --> 00:59:32,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

743
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:35,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

744
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:44,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, through the chair, I think that that's always been a real, that's always been kind of a large question when it comes to facilities maintenance is what are the absolute needs?

745
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:45,696
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the must haves?

746
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the wants and what are the wishes?

747
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:49,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you categorize those?

748
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you prioritize those?

749
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:54,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you make sure that what needs to get done absolutely has to get done?

750
00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:56,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And what can wait, can wait?

751
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:58,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you budget for that in a strategic, comprehensive way?

752
00:59:58,855 --> 01:00:03,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's what this knowledgeable subject matter expert is going to be doing largely.

753
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a large discussion internally about how that would work.

754
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:11,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this person somebody who's going to roll up their sleeves and actually work on facilities maintenance?

755
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this somebody who's going to be more

756
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: of a higher level strategic facilities manager.

757
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:33,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still discussing that and how we think it's going to be a little bit of that hybrid, at least at first, in order to get the work done and think about how these things have to get done in a long-term way and not just hop from one project to the next based upon questionable criteria.

758
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that there's a lot of needs.

759
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:39,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand that there's a lot of asks and a lot of needs and a lot of must-haves,

760
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:44,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure that we get this done thoughtfully and that we're spending the money in the best possible way.

761
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

762
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:46,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

763
01:00:46,634 --> 01:00:47,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

764
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:48,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

765
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelli.

766
01:00:50,877 --> 01:00:52,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he hit the nail on the head.

767
01:00:53,499 --> 01:01:07,548
[SPEAKER_03]: As a member of this council, I would like to see Mr. President for any newly created position, which this request has several, that we receive a full job description on the position itself.

768
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:15,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize that the city administration probably put a lot of time and effort into this, but they have to realize we weren't privy to these conversations.

769
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:23,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, Mr. President, I would ask that when my colleagues are done speaking, that I would like to evoke rule 20.

770
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:25,771
[SPEAKER_03]: for this particular paper.

771
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:38,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first time it has appeared on the council agenda and it's a financial paper and any request of a member of this council for a financial paper appearing for the first time gets automatically laid on the table for one week.

772
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:44,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say when my colleagues are done speaking, I would like to evoke rule 20 Mr. President.

773
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:49,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also ask that within this week that the city administration

774
01:01:50,240 --> 01:02:10,867
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the chief of staff, along with the mayor, sit down with the city clerk, come up with a job description for the election coordinator, a salary for the election coordinator, and what their responsibilities would be, and come back to us within a week with that title added to this particular list.

775
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:23,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's no money for the appropriation, I would ask that it be taken from the facilities, line item of 200,000 minus whatever the salary for the election coordinator position would be.

776
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:35,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we receive the job description for these other positions, that we also receive a new job description for the election coordinator, Mr. President, as well.

777
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:36,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

778
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:51,237
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to repeat Councilor Marks, we'd like to invoke rule 20, which rule 20, section four states, any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor.

779
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:57,901
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caviello, Councilor Morrell.

780
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:00,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

781
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:00,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

782
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:11,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to echo my fellow council colleagues in that I, I understand the acute and immediate need for these items listed here, but there's, there are a lot of items with acute and immediate need.

783
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:16,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think just there's more information that this body requires before we can make a decision on this.

784
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:23,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I think as other colleagues have pointed out, just the understanding of which positions are new positions, which positions are,

785
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:28,727
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, replacing something that was cut, which I think there's just a real lack of information here.

786
01:03:28,787 --> 01:03:29,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have a question.

787
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:44,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, if through the chair for Miss Emily Benjamin, if there was consideration for any of this 700,000 to be put towards the schools and any of that budget, I know they had a bit of a larger hit than the city as far as cut.

788
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:45,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm curious.

789
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:54,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious what the thought process was there as far as applying this entirely city side as opposed to looking at the schools as they're obviously due to the pandemic.

790
01:03:55,290 --> 01:04:01,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand there's a lot of money through CARES and everything else going to the schools, but there's a serious need there for support as well.

791
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:07,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm curious the thought process behind that, why the funding is all on the city side versus considering the schools as well.

792
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:17,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so when we did the local aid, when we looked at that, we did the 10% cut to the chapter 70, we gave the million dollars back to the schools to leave them unharmed as we had promised.

793
01:04:18,263 --> 01:04:21,625
[SPEAKER_09]: With the unrestricted general government aid, we had deeply cut the city.

794
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:25,347
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the city, where it looked like it increased, it really didn't.

795
01:04:25,587 --> 01:04:32,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because the fixed costs are so high in the city side, which encompasses the schools, that it get that view of, oh, the city's went up.

796
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:33,452
[SPEAKER_09]: It really hasn't.

797
01:04:35,347 --> 01:04:57,103
[SPEAKER_09]: When we looked at the positions, because we had cut the city so slim, we wanted to make sure to add things back that we thought were really, really important, such as the maintenance, the facilities manager, the 911, assessor position that's needed in the assessor's office, translation services that were requested by the citizens, was a really thoughtful, thoughtful process of what our needs were.

798
01:04:57,543 --> 01:05:00,105
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't just a wishlist, but what's needed.

799
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:04,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, still keeping conservative, because we don't know

800
01:05:05,179 --> 01:05:06,100
[SPEAKER_09]: we're not going to be able to do that.

801
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,641
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

802
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:08,882
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

803
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:09,743
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

804
01:05:09,763 --> 01:05:10,624
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

805
01:05:10,644 --> 01:05:11,545
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

806
01:05:11,565 --> 01:05:13,226
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

807
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:14,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

808
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:15,028
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

809
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:16,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be able to do that.

810
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:18,011
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

811
01:05:18,031 --> 01:05:18,892
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

812
01:05:18,932 --> 01:05:20,353
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

813
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:21,234
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

814
01:05:21,274 --> 01:05:22,535
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

815
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:24,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

816
01:05:24,437 --> 01:05:25,718
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

817
01:05:25,738 --> 01:05:27,239
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

818
01:05:27,259 --> 01:05:28,420
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

819
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,681
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to do that.

820
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:31,043
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going

821
01:05:33,165 --> 01:05:37,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morrell, could you please repeat the amendment just so the clerk can get that?

822
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:48,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, if we could get a list of the city side positions that were requested in the previous budget and not funded exclusive of, you know, separate from the ones that are listed on this request.

823
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:51,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

824
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:52,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was seconded by Councilor Knight.

825
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,682
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have Vice President Caviello, Councilor Knight, Councilor Behrs.

826
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:56,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caviello.

827
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:58,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

828
01:05:58,524 --> 01:06:05,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to support Councilor Marks on his issue with the election coordinator.

829
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:14,415
[SPEAKER_11]: As we see as we just got through an election throughout the country, elections have become more complex than they've ever been.

830
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:19,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And the longer we wait to fund this position, the harder it's going to be.

831
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:30,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Because again, not only are we going to need a coordinator, but the rules and the way we've done the elections over the years have vastly changed over the last four or five years.

832
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:36,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's time that we bring our election department up to the standard that it needs to be.

833
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:41,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's say, if we're going to wait until after this election, and then before you know it, it'll be after January, and before you know it,

834
01:06:42,835 --> 01:06:47,037
[SPEAKER_11]: The new election is going to be around the corner, and we're going to be still arguing about this.

835
01:06:47,057 --> 01:06:53,420
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not going to support anything that doesn't have the election coordinator in this package here, Mr. President.

836
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

837
01:06:56,121 --> 01:06:56,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Counsel night.

838
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:01,099
[SPEAKER_15]: In looking at this, I certainly agree with my colleagues in their positions.

839
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:06,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I have concerns over the $300,000 in union contracts and only retirement incentives.

840
01:07:06,425 --> 01:07:08,166
[SPEAKER_15]: I also have a concern over the $200,000 in facility maintenance budget.

841
01:07:08,186 --> 01:07:08,647
[SPEAKER_15]: That's $500,000 of a $740,000 paper.

842
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:11,830
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is one item that I look at, Mr. President, on this list, and that's the 911 supervisor.

843
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:27,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a position that's my understanding was created out of need and necessity.

844
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:35,972
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm wondering if there's anybody available from the administration to talk a little bit about this expense, if a job description does exist for it, so on and so forth.

845
01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:42,259
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that as we've been transitioning from professional to civilian dispatches, we've had some bumps in the road.

846
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,301
[SPEAKER_15]: a need for us to revisit this, then we should.

847
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:51,426
[SPEAKER_15]: When this council moved to support a move to civilian dispatching, we did so as a cost savings measure.

848
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:54,688
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't want those cost savings measures to get in the way of public safety.

849
01:07:55,569 --> 01:08:05,356
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, for a $70,000 appropriation salary expense on this, I'm hoping that the administration has a type of job description.

850
01:08:05,896 --> 01:08:09,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason I say that is because there was somebody that was already doing this work before.

851
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,240
[SPEAKER_15]: It went to civilian dispatch.

852
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:16,724
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there's anybody available that could speak to this, I think that that might be very helpful for us in preparing.

853
01:08:16,984 --> 01:08:19,066
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the paper is going to get laid on the table no matter what.

854
01:08:19,446 --> 01:08:21,087
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not going to be voted on this evening.

855
01:08:21,127 --> 01:08:24,090
[SPEAKER_15]: But if there's someone here that can provide us with some of that information, I think that'd be very helpful.

856
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:27,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Lieutenant Rudolph, I'm from the Medford Police.

857
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:31,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the head of the Peace Office here to answer your questions about the 9-1-1 supervisors.

858
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:31,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

859
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:35,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

860
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:38,032
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Lieutenant Mark Rudolph of the Memphis Police Department.

861
01:08:38,132 --> 01:08:41,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the PSAP Director, meaning I'm in charge of the 911 Center.

862
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:46,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dispatching for both police, fire, and our EMS partner, Armstrong Ambulance.

863
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:59,450
[SPEAKER_00]: The reasoning behind looking to hire a supervisor at this time, we've been operating the center now since June of last year with originally 13 dispatchers.

864
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,912
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at a level right now of 10.

865
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:10,301
[SPEAKER_00]: due to some individuals that left for better paying positions at other locations once they had been trained, unfortunately.

866
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:16,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the purpose of hiring a dispatch supervisor is multifaceted.

867
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:26,431
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of work done inside a 9-1-1 center of approximately 85 to 9,500 of them across the country is extremely critical.

868
01:09:27,071 --> 01:09:30,153
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time driven simply by

869
01:09:30,822 --> 01:09:41,266
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that these are the very first first responders who initiate receipt of the calls, they dispatch police, fire and EMS appropriately.

870
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:59,653
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispatch supervisors role simply is a shift supervisor is also a working dispatcher, but has a much higher level of certifications and training from the association from professional communications officers, which is a nationwide professional organization that certifies these individuals

871
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:05,259
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other individuals that work as police, fire, and EMS dispatchers.

872
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:12,402
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal behind hiring a dispatch supervisor obviously requires some of it, a lot more experience.

873
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:24,667
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a job description that was created with input from my chief, my administrative captain, my operations captain, and I, in fact, wrote that dispatch supervisor job description.

874
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:28,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided it over to the personnel department,

875
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Wasbon has that as well.

876
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:52,917
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also trimmed it a little bit to go out as a, if we do in fact get the positions, monetary appropriation, he's already set up a slightly shortened version to send out to outlets that would be hosting it for potential hirees looking for that job.

877
01:10:53,637 --> 01:10:54,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently there are about 9,500

878
01:10:55,878 --> 01:11:10,743
[SPEAKER_00]: dispatch centers in the country, so having a dispatch supervisor at most locations, including in most of the PSAP 9-1-1 centers currently in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, typically have a shift supervisor on every shift.

879
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:25,288
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for one dispatch supervisor that can basically handle that same workload, rotating schedules, so that he or she can actually interface with all of the dispatchers, continue their in-service training programs, as you all know,

880
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:30,135
[SPEAKER_00]: The State 9-1-1 Center Training Academy has been shut down since the beginning of COVID.

881
01:11:30,175 --> 01:11:31,575
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hit across the country.

882
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:38,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are at a disadvantage, along with every other peace app across the country, in trying to hire people who are currently trained.

883
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:54,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiring someone who is an APCO certified training officer, as well as a dispatch supervisor with experience, provides us the ability to be able to train our own personnel without having to send them through an in-house program.

884
01:11:56,277 --> 01:12:06,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Most all of the supervisory people that are working in 911 centers have currently APCO certifications for police dispatch, fire dispatch, and EMS dispatching.

885
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:20,775
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose is multifaceted to have a dispatch supervisor that can not only handle day-to-day routine situations, but also conduct training as a certified training officer under APCO certifications as well as state certification.

886
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:27,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives us the opportunity again to hire personnel that are currently not trained.

887
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of applicants who have submitted applications to us over the past five months, but unfortunately we have not been able to hire anybody that has training because the vast majority of them, about 98% had no training or experience as a dispatcher in any 911 settings.

888
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:49,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing those people in is impossible at this time without having a certified training officer.

889
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:51,669
[SPEAKER_00]: who is also a dispatch supervisor.

890
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:55,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not just a single shift job.

891
01:12:55,513 --> 01:13:16,551
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be rotating throughout all three shifts, seven days a week, on a rotating schedule, so that they could interface with every dispatcher on each shift, find out who continues to need additional training, if anything, offer a new training, continue annual certification in the different dispatch center

892
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:21,046
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs which are basically police, fire, and EMS on the other side.

893
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:25,107
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving into a new dispatch center in probably about a week or two.

894
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:33,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose of having a dispatch supervisor at that point allows us to professionalize our dispatch center even more.

895
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,510
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some really good dispatchers.

896
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:39,111
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already completed state training.

897
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,892
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing this now for over a year.

898
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,435
[SPEAKER_00]: in most cases over a year and a half.

899
01:13:44,515 --> 01:13:50,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, for a couple of them that came in later in October, November, uh, close to a year now.

900
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:52,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are doing a very good job.

901
01:13:52,437 --> 01:13:54,838
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still work to be done to continue their training.

902
01:13:54,878 --> 01:13:56,358
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't learn this job overnight.

903
01:13:56,558 --> 01:14:00,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the most difficult training programs going.

904
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:02,619
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pressure driven.

905
01:14:03,459 --> 01:14:07,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, individually, each of these individuals has been doing a very good job.

906
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,221
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue our training program in house.

907
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:26,876
[SPEAKER_00]: but without the ability to hire a dispatch supervisor that can maintain training programs, that can help with the budget process, can help with any disciplinary issues that may arise, that can help with continued training of all of these individuals.

908
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:39,643
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings about the ability for us to create a better environment, a better working environment, a better training environment, and an environment of professional dispatchers that are here to do their job,

909
01:14:40,178 --> 01:14:41,238
[SPEAKER_00]: to the citizens of Medford.

910
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,900
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

911
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to listen and answer what I can.

912
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:50,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to thank you, Lieutenant, for that presentation.

913
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:53,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that made me feel very confident and comfortable.

914
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:57,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving forward, when I do take a vote on this paper, that that's something that I will be supporting.

915
01:14:57,245 --> 01:14:57,926
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

916
01:14:58,386 --> 01:14:59,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counsel Knight.

917
01:14:59,186 --> 01:14:59,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Counsel Beers.

918
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:07,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Question for, I believe, Mr. Rodriguez.

920
01:15:09,698 --> 01:15:13,401
[SPEAKER_08]: When could we expect another supplemental appropriation to come before the council?

921
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:15,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a timeline for that?

922
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:22,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Supplemental appropriation would be dependent on supplemental revenue.

923
01:15:22,408 --> 01:15:29,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So outside of that happening, I don't see another supplemental appropriation happening before the continuation of the budget process in the spring.

924
01:15:30,474 --> 01:15:30,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

925
01:15:31,174 --> 01:15:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

926
01:15:31,675 --> 01:15:34,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just like to join with my colleagues and say that I think

927
01:15:36,344 --> 01:15:39,307
[SPEAKER_08]: this supplemental appropriation should include the elections coordinator.

928
01:15:39,427 --> 01:15:46,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would not be voting to appropriate additional funds until such appropriation includes the elections coordinator.

929
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:46,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

930
01:15:47,896 --> 01:15:48,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

931
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:48,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Council appears.

932
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:50,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the council?

933
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,946
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may really quick, um, uh, I get a question regarding, um,

934
01:15:58,275 --> 01:16:02,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first of all, I want to say support Councilor Marks, you mentioned the election coordinator.

935
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everyone has through the last few months.

936
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:06,499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's definitely something that is needed.

937
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:27,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think at one point there was maybe a recommendation that had come from maybe the facilities expense, but Alicia and Chief of Staff Rodriguez, with regard to the billboard agreement and the extra $250,000 that was not included in the budget, has that been allocated yet?

938
01:16:28,822 --> 01:16:29,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any plans for that money?

939
01:16:29,843 --> 01:16:46,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I have recommended that it goes to the schools, but if not, I mean, is that something where we could allocate some of that money or some of that facilities money to the election coordinator and then backfill the facilities maintenance with some of the money from the billboard agreement?

940
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:53,542
[SPEAKER_09]: As of right now, as Chief Rodriguez had spoken to before, we're working on finalizing the capital improvement plan.

941
01:16:54,483 --> 01:17:00,207
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not finished yet, but there are some items I know that the mayor was looking to use that money to fund.

942
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:03,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you elaborate on those?

943
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:06,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody?

944
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:11,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be part of the final CIP report, which we're expecting in December.

945
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:12,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, what's the expectation?

946
01:17:14,637 --> 01:17:18,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be part of the final CIP report, which we presented to the council sometime in December.

947
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,060
[SPEAKER_05]: December, okay.

948
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:23,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the council?

949
01:17:26,656 --> 01:17:27,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

950
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:33,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So rule 20 has been invoked and this will lay on the table until next week.

951
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:34,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

952
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:38,982
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of council tonight to revert back to the regular order of business.

953
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:39,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

954
01:17:39,782 --> 01:17:40,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

955
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

956
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:53,749
Councilor Behrs.

957
01:17:58,375 --> 01:17:58,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

958
01:17:59,517 --> 01:17:59,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

959
01:18:00,838 --> 01:18:01,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

960
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

961
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:03,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

962
01:18:03,823 --> 01:18:04,203
[SPEAKER_14]: 70 affirmative.

963
01:18:04,223 --> 01:18:04,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Janet, the negative.

964
01:18:04,744 --> 01:18:05,685
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

965
01:18:06,747 --> 01:18:10,191
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've worked to the regular order business, we will go to hearings.

966
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:19,286
[SPEAKER_14]: This is actually a hearing, 2-0-6-0-0, petition for grant of location, National Grid, gas main locations, Meffin, Massachusetts, City Clerk's Office.

967
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:34,233
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a continuation of a public hearing that we had two weeks ago, and I believe at that time there were a number of questions that the council had, and let's see, National Grid was going to come back to us to answer those questions.

968
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:36,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to waive the reading and reconvene the hearing.

969
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:40,977
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Council of nine to read and reconvene the hearing seconded by Councilor Behrs.

970
01:18:41,037 --> 01:18:44,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

971
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:44,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

972
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:46,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

973
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

974
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:49,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

975
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

976
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:54,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

977
01:18:55,423 --> 01:18:56,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

978
01:18:56,863 --> 01:18:57,984
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

979
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:02,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see, we have, do we have a representative from National Good on the line?

980
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:05,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, yes, good evening.

981
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:09,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Diana Cutty from National Grid, 70 Sylvan Road, Waltham, Massachusetts.

982
01:19:10,974 --> 01:19:12,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for being with us tonight.

983
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

984
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:16,441
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a number of questions last time, I believe.

985
01:19:17,767 --> 01:19:18,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

986
01:19:19,328 --> 01:19:20,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

987
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:22,549
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, there was a number of questions.

988
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The major question I believe was by many of the council members was why this work was taking place.

989
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:36,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Gas work, first of all, during the holidays and secondly, during cold winter months.

990
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:40,454
[SPEAKER_03]: where it potentially could impact residents of this community.

991
01:19:40,974 --> 01:19:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked what the nature of the emergency was to do it at this particular time.

992
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to hear a response from National Grid.

993
01:19:50,737 --> 01:20:03,521
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know the urgency with MWRA, but the staff engineer that did the design of the project reached out to the consultant that's doing the project management for this project for MWRA.

994
01:20:05,255 --> 01:20:08,896
[SPEAKER_12]: and they are willing to wait until the spring.

995
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:13,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I can give you the exact words.

996
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,637
[SPEAKER_12]: They're waiting until April to start the work.

997
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:28,760
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no immediate need to have this be winter work, but we would like to get all our ducks in a row, as they say, so that we're not holding them up when they're ready to go.

998
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:37,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, that's good news as far as I'm concerned.

999
01:20:38,392 --> 01:20:57,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Another issue that I brought up, I believe it was last week or the week before, not week before because of the election, was the fact that item bullet point number 12 was the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes the resurfacing and striping this portion of Riverside Ave.

1000
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city.

1001
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:22,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got a commitment from our city engineer at the time that the restoration and other paving will indeed take place on Riverside Ave to make sure the curbing is brought up to standards, Mr. President.

1002
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:35,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, much of the curbing on Riverside Ave, in this particular project span, the curbing is level with the street, which poses a safety concern and a public safety risk for area residents that are walking.

1003
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:42,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that language wasn't changed, but I want to make sure that that indeed is what's going to happen.

1004
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if we formally need to change this scope.

1005
01:21:47,009 --> 01:21:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: of service, bullet point 12, if there's a need, or if the city engineer feels that that's not necessary.

1006
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's on the call, I thought I saw him earlier.

1007
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he did actually, let's see, so.

1008
01:22:00,856 --> 01:22:05,879
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of the things that was raising the curve

1009
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:15,651
[SPEAKER_12]: then gives you a trip hazard between the sidewalk and the new curb, even though the curb to the street is DOT compliant.

1010
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:20,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So it opened up more cans of worms type of thing.

1011
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:21,834
[SPEAKER_12]: But I thought I saw.

1012
01:22:22,694 --> 01:22:24,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, Tim's on the line.

1013
01:22:24,395 --> 01:22:26,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim McGiven, our city engineer is on the line.

1014
01:22:26,515 --> 01:22:26,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim.

1015
01:22:28,356 --> 01:22:32,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, good evening, honorable council.

1016
01:22:32,398 --> 01:22:35,259
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe my response is the same.

1017
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:35,959
[SPEAKER_13]: So the,

1018
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:49,217
[SPEAKER_13]: The scope of work for adding curbing to Riverside Avenue is a separate type of scope than what MWRA has committed to resurfacing.

1019
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:54,641
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm committing to is reviewing the condition of Riverside Avenue, which I have started.

1020
01:22:55,467 --> 01:22:59,308
[SPEAKER_13]: and putting together a scope of improvements on Riverside Avenue.

1021
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:03,230
[SPEAKER_13]: How that gets done, I don't know the answer to that question yet.

1022
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:10,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it needs to get done, but the utility work that is happening, they're obligated to

1023
01:23:10,672 --> 01:23:11,893
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've looked into this.

1024
01:23:11,913 --> 01:23:30,381
[SPEAKER_13]: They're obligated to put it back the way it was or better, but adding design scope that could involve shifting entire sections of the roadway elevation-wise, curbing-wise, that requires a review by the professional engineering, probably a firm.

1025
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:34,703
[SPEAKER_13]: We could probably do it in-house, but it's even a little...

1026
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:39,465
[SPEAKER_13]: something that we'd probably want one of our on-call designers to look at.

1027
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:44,608
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, in my opinion, it's outside of the scope of what

1028
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:46,650
[SPEAKER_13]: they're obligated to do.

1029
01:23:46,991 --> 01:24:08,420
[SPEAKER_13]: My idea of saying, well, they're obligated to restore it back to the condition it was or better, that obligation, my idea in item 12 was to say, well, MWR is doing that already, so can we take that obligated money and use it elsewhere or contribute to improvements on Riverside Avenue?

1030
01:24:09,123 --> 01:24:12,005
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have since received correspondence from Ms.

1031
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:19,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuddy that the opinion of National Grid, and she can obviously speak to that, is that that wouldn't be possible from a legal standpoint.

1032
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:34,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did reply with similar language to what I just made as far as what they're obligated to do when they open the street and to try to figure out a way to use that obligation somewhere else.

1033
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:37,659
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're pushing back on that, and I'll let Ms.

1034
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:38,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuddy speak to that.

1035
01:24:39,605 --> 01:24:40,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, if I could.

1036
01:24:42,387 --> 01:24:44,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate the city engineer.

1037
01:24:45,009 --> 01:24:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's my understanding that the MWRA is going to pay for the resurfacing and the striping of the portion of Riverside Ave that's going to be torn up.

1038
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:04,063
[SPEAKER_03]: This also states that National Grid is supposed to contribute to the final restoration project.

1039
01:25:04,889 --> 01:25:13,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the MWRA is paying for it, that money that the national grid would be kicking in goes into, just say, a different pot now.

1040
01:25:14,499 --> 01:25:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city engineer said, okay, we'll take that different pot and we'll use it for other paving in the city.

1041
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:27,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So my request two weeks ago was rather than looking at other paving areas in the city, that's put it towards Riverside Ave.

1042
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:31,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We know there's work that needs to be done on the curbing and so forth.

1043
01:25:32,115 --> 01:25:38,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can appreciate the fact that this is not part of the scope of the overall project.

1044
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:46,086
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm asking is as a city that that money be dedicated to the curbing on Riverside Ave.

1045
01:25:47,307 --> 01:25:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the actual final restoration cost is.

1046
01:25:53,651 --> 01:26:00,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there any indication what this would cost National Grid or what money they'd be giving to the city?

1047
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:04,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if that work has been.

1048
01:26:04,783 --> 01:26:14,694
[SPEAKER_13]: has been done, it would, you know, if you were to calculate it based off of square footage of asphalt based off of the length of a trench they're doing.

1049
01:26:15,835 --> 01:26:25,045
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I think last week when we talked about that, I thought that seemed like a reasonable approach to have a contribution to the curbing redesign effort, basically.

1050
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:26,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that was reasonable.

1051
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:31,784
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I received correspondence, legal type correspondence from Ms.

1052
01:26:31,844 --> 01:26:33,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuddy, pushing back on that.

1053
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:41,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've since replied, saying that, you know, that's a cast iron line in Riverside Avenue.

1054
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:42,848
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gotta be replaced anyway.

1055
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:48,770
[SPEAKER_13]: There isn't only a sole reason that they're doing this project.

1056
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:51,931
[SPEAKER_13]: The Riverside Avenue gas line needs to be replaced at some point.

1057
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:53,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been leaking for,

1058
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:57,633
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that was a reasonable approach.

1059
01:26:57,774 --> 01:26:59,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I still believe it's a reasonable approach.

1060
01:26:59,434 --> 01:27:18,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question to you, Mr. Engineer, is that if we were to allow the resurfacing and striping take place at this particular juncture, that would preclude us down the line for raising our curbing.

1061
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:20,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would it make it more difficult?

1062
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:25,974
[SPEAKER_03]: at that particular point to do maybe curbing and sidewalking at a later date?

1063
01:27:27,696 --> 01:27:28,897
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it wouldn't preclude it.

1064
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:36,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a question of creep when you talk about pavement and slopes and how you tie things in.

1065
01:27:37,245 --> 01:27:43,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's always a shame to put down new work and then have to dig it up.

1066
01:27:45,122 --> 01:27:53,145
[SPEAKER_13]: a whole bunch of utility work happens, and then they put it back to the way it was, better condition, obviously, than it is today.

1067
01:27:53,765 --> 01:27:54,826
[SPEAKER_13]: MWI, I'm talking about.

1068
01:27:55,106 --> 01:28:01,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if we come in with a curbing and sidewalk design, we're doing something very, very similar on Winthrop Street, actually.

1069
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:08,191
[SPEAKER_13]: The timing of things is such we would prefer to coordinate those two efforts so we're not duplicating work.

1070
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,892
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be ideal, and that's what I would strive for.

1071
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,513
[SPEAKER_13]: But does it preclude it?

1072
01:28:13,653 --> 01:28:13,753
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1073
01:28:15,094 --> 01:28:37,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So just so I understand, National Grid's exception to this is not the fact that we want to do curbing, it's the fact that they don't want to be involved in curbing, but the money that they give towards the project, we can put towards curbing or whatever we want to do as a community, correct?

1074
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Not exactly.

1075
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:41,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was going to let Ms.

1076
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:42,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuddy respond to that.

1077
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:54,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been asked by MWRA to move our gas main because it's above their main and they need to access it to do the infrastructure work that they want to do.

1078
01:28:55,282 --> 01:28:57,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So this isn't a planned project for us.

1079
01:28:57,764 --> 01:29:06,112
[SPEAKER_12]: So MWRA will reimburse us to move our gas main to this other location, which I'm here requesting the grant location for.

1080
01:29:07,754 --> 01:29:18,106
[SPEAKER_12]: But any additional costs, this is a different type of grant allocation because it's a main replacement versus a new main where we pass additional costs to the customer.

1081
01:29:18,627 --> 01:29:25,475
[SPEAKER_12]: This type of added cost goes into our rate case, which then is paid by the customers.

1082
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:36,732
[SPEAKER_12]: It's inequitable to have gas customers paying for road improvements and non-gas customers not, or people in other communities paying for road improvements in Medford.

1083
01:29:37,593 --> 01:29:44,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So our legal department is really starting to scrutinize this type of stuff and push back.

1084
01:29:44,156 --> 01:29:46,056
[SPEAKER_12]: This got their attention because 1,500 feet times

1085
01:29:47,843 --> 01:30:01,047
[SPEAKER_12]: 30, 40 feet wide times $7 a square foot, which includes the police details of, you know, $400,000 that we would have had to incur and pass through the rate case for a project that we didn't initiate on our own.

1086
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:08,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, so this funding for the paving isn't really something we're,

1087
01:30:10,064 --> 01:30:11,306
[SPEAKER_12]: we can do at this point.

1088
01:30:13,048 --> 01:30:17,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, I'll be back next week with another one for a customer who is willing to pay for these

1089
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:22,837
[SPEAKER_12]: these other charges because it's to service them and their need.

1090
01:30:23,657 --> 01:30:26,218
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we as National Grid will pass that cost on to the customer.

1091
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:31,741
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't go into the rate case and it is an effect, you know, people trying to make ends meet with their utility bills.

1092
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:32,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

1093
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:41,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we're well aware of projects like we're going through right now with 3.2 miles of Eversource coming through the community that gives

1094
01:30:41,765 --> 01:30:50,469
[SPEAKER_03]: zero benefit to this community other than ripping up our streets, 3.2 miles of our street, and we get zero benefit.

1095
01:30:50,489 --> 01:30:58,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can appreciate the fact that National Grid is doing this on behalf of the MWRA.

1096
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,714
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is then the way this is worded.

1097
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:09,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It says the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping.

1098
01:31:10,493 --> 01:31:15,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So from what I understand is the MWRA is going to pay for resurfacing and striping.

1099
01:31:15,437 --> 01:31:16,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct with that?

1100
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:18,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because they're the last ones in.

1101
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,121
[SPEAKER_12]: We're moving our gas main.

1102
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:27,027
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, just so the MWRA is paying for resurfacing and striping the portion of Riverside Ave.

1103
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:39,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes on to say the engineering division requests that National Grid, not the MWRA, National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city.

1104
01:31:39,997 --> 01:31:53,606
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's our engineering department requesting not just MWRA do their surfacing and striping, but also now that National Grid pay something towards other paving projects in the community.

1105
01:31:53,886 --> 01:31:54,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that not correct?

1106
01:31:56,742 --> 01:31:58,483
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the wording, yeah, you got the wording correct.

1107
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:07,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And since last week, I said that your approach sounded reasonable as well, and I'd be open to changing.

1108
01:32:07,706 --> 01:32:25,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but from what I'm hearing now is that the other project can't be us putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Not National Grid, us as a community going off on our own and putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Is that what I just not heard?

1109
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:30,396
[SPEAKER_12]: from Tim or from me?

1110
01:32:31,036 --> 01:32:31,476
[SPEAKER_12]: From Tim?

1111
01:32:31,836 --> 01:32:41,021
[SPEAKER_12]: You were saying that it involves, to bring the curbing up to, I mean, you can correct me, Tim, but then now the sidewalk's too low.

1112
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,282
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a trip hazard.

1113
01:32:42,442 --> 01:32:43,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're creating.

1114
01:32:44,003 --> 01:32:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We would replace the sidewalk as well.

1115
01:32:45,864 --> 01:32:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't just raise curbing and leave the sidewalk.

1116
01:32:48,285 --> 01:32:49,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

1117
01:32:50,346 --> 01:32:51,867
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to make sure.

1118
01:32:51,887 --> 01:32:52,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

1119
01:32:52,887 --> 01:32:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Council of Peers.

1120
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:55,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to clarify.

1121
01:32:58,603 --> 01:33:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: are you saying that no payment will be made at all regardless of the purpose?

1122
01:33:04,088 --> 01:33:04,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1123
01:33:05,128 --> 01:33:07,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1124
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:12,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what Councilor Beers said.

1125
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:14,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beers, can you repeat your question, please?

1126
01:33:14,376 --> 01:33:21,001
[SPEAKER_08]: My question was National Grid is saying that no payment will be made regardless of the purpose, and I believe Ms.

1127
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:23,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuddy's answer was yes, no payment would be made.

1128
01:33:23,923 --> 01:33:26,385
[SPEAKER_12]: An arbitrary amount, like, you know, just some

1129
01:33:27,015 --> 01:33:35,543
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so the request from the engineer that would be voting on tonight that states that National Grid would contribute to the final cost is now different.

1130
01:33:41,688 --> 01:33:42,289
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for Tim.

1131
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone that wants to answer it.

1132
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:47,794
[SPEAKER_13]: National Grid is pushing back on that.

1133
01:33:47,894 --> 01:33:50,916
[SPEAKER_13]: National Grid does not want to have

1134
01:33:52,072 --> 01:34:00,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if we were gonna vote on this tonight, we're voting on this language that's in front of us, and we're hearing that they're not gonna honor this language.

1135
01:34:02,318 --> 01:34:03,039
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what you're hearing.

1136
01:34:04,499 --> 01:34:15,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because the scope of the work, 1,500 linear feet times whatever, whether it's curbing on both sides, it's 3,000 linear feet, or the paving of the street curb-to-curb.

1137
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:17,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, that comes to about $400,000,

1138
01:34:21,396 --> 01:34:22,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1139
01:34:22,938 --> 01:34:29,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think anybody behind this rail cares how much it costs because once you guys pack up your trucks and put your shovels in your car and you drive away, we're stuck with the mess.

1140
01:34:31,086 --> 01:34:34,069
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't really, I don't think anybody back here cares what it's going to cost National Grid.

1141
01:34:34,889 --> 01:34:41,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's costing the rate payers and legally, there's a legal obligation through our rate case.

1142
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so let me, just so I understand.

1143
01:34:48,963 --> 01:34:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we made it as a condition, this says the engineering division recommends that the grant location be approved with the following conditions.

1144
01:35:00,387 --> 01:35:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, he doesn't recommend it unless it has these conditions.

1145
01:35:03,868 --> 01:35:05,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct, Mr. Engineer?

1146
01:35:07,273 --> 01:35:15,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it becomes a legal question because National Grid is pushing back and saying, we don't think item 12, we can do that legally.

1147
01:35:16,215 --> 01:35:34,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And from my understanding of the research I have done since we spoke last and what the legal obligations are, according to my understanding of it, the legal obligations when street opening permits happen to utilities would be to repair the surface,

1148
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:38,799
[SPEAKER_13]: to the condition it was or better.

1149
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,002
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're putting it back to the way it was or better.

1150
01:35:43,023 --> 01:35:44,404
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a cost associated with that.

1151
01:35:44,584 --> 01:35:47,547
[SPEAKER_13]: That national grid is not paying for this project.

1152
01:35:48,107 --> 01:35:55,634
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm recommending that that value be still put into Riverside Avenue.

1153
01:35:56,354 --> 01:35:56,755
[SPEAKER_03]: From who?

1154
01:35:58,698 --> 01:36:09,003
[SPEAKER_13]: So if this was only National Grid doing this work, then National Grid would be obligated to repair Riverside Ave to existing condition or better.

1155
01:36:10,263 --> 01:36:11,264
[SPEAKER_13]: So back to the way it was.

1156
01:36:12,384 --> 01:36:17,747
[SPEAKER_13]: But they don't have to... Right now, MWI already has that scope, so MWI would be paying for that.

1157
01:36:18,985 --> 01:36:22,428
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't need to do that.

1158
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:31,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So why can't National Grid go back to the MWRA and say, you know what, we applied for a permit and the city's requesting these conditions.

1159
01:36:31,674 --> 01:36:34,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want the work done, these are the conditions they're requesting.

1160
01:36:36,438 --> 01:36:37,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't that be done?

1161
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:43,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand National Grid's the middle man, but they're the ones applying for the permit.

1162
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:58,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're saying that we want X, Y, and Z done, these are the conditions, and National Grid says we can't do that because legally we can't obligate ourselves to fix that that way for whatever reason, they can't do it.

1163
01:36:58,583 --> 01:37:02,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they need to go back to the MWRA and say, this is the pushback from the city.

1164
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:07,205
[SPEAKER_03]: The city wants X, Y, and Z done in order for you to get this project moved forward.

1165
01:37:08,185 --> 01:37:10,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why we have to back off as a community.

1166
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:12,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1167
01:37:12,611 --> 01:37:13,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Layton.

1168
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:25,401
[SPEAKER_15]: What this sounds like to me, Mr. President, is almost, you know, the street opening permit gets issued and the street gets ripped up and there's an obligation to restore the street to its previous condition, right?

1169
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:35,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we have one entity that's gonna do that and pay for it, there's two utilities that are involved, MWRA and National Grid.

1170
01:37:35,688 --> 01:37:38,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the obligation is to restore it to what it was.

1171
01:37:39,378 --> 01:37:41,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's almost like a double recovery, right?

1172
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:46,885
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting paid for the same scope of work twice, but it's only getting done once.

1173
01:37:46,905 --> 01:37:48,226
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's what the preclusion is.

1174
01:37:48,406 --> 01:37:50,388
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting paid double time.

1175
01:37:51,868 --> 01:37:55,569
[SPEAKER_15]: for the work that's being performed because one entity's responsible for it.

1176
01:37:55,589 --> 01:37:57,410
[SPEAKER_15]: The person that closes the street's responsible for that.

1177
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:59,511
[SPEAKER_15]: So that money's getting spent by them.

1178
01:38:00,171 --> 01:38:03,533
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going into the community to restore it back to that original condition.

1179
01:38:04,073 --> 01:38:08,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything above and beyond that, I think, would be like a double recovery on the impact of the mitigation, you know what I mean?

1180
01:38:09,415 --> 01:38:12,876
[SPEAKER_15]: On the impact of the assessment above and beyond their obligation.

1181
01:38:13,216 --> 01:38:14,477
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it sounds like to me anyway.

1182
01:38:15,418 --> 01:38:17,320
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can understand what Councilor Marks is saying.

1183
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:22,445
[SPEAKER_15]: We were given a paper here that says, approve it with these conditions and these conditions aren't being met.

1184
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:29,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess the question is, does the city engineer want us to approve it with the conditions that he's put forth aren't being met?

1185
01:38:32,512 --> 01:38:36,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Through the chair, what I would respond to that is that those are my recommended conditions.

1186
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:41,154
[SPEAKER_13]: The council does have the ability to change, you know, to adjust that.

1187
01:38:41,414 --> 01:38:44,374
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I've granted permission for that to happen.

1188
01:38:44,394 --> 01:38:49,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's reasonable the way that Councilor Marks described how he would like to change that.

1189
01:38:50,275 --> 01:38:53,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the last time we met on this, I said, yes, that was reasonable.

1190
01:38:53,736 --> 01:38:57,057
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would be more than willing to support that change in language for that item 12.

1191
01:38:59,555 --> 01:39:20,088
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also, if the council has an understanding here that what National Grid is saying, and if you agree with that and you want to strike out in 12, then I believe you can do that as well.

1192
01:39:21,089 --> 01:39:26,772
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, I'm always put in the position to say, the utility company is coming to town.

1193
01:39:28,242 --> 01:39:29,563
[SPEAKER_13]: What should we be looking at?

1194
01:39:29,723 --> 01:39:33,367
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the scope that they should be doing on behalf of the city?

1195
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:34,688
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what I'm always trying to do.

1196
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:40,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm trying to get what I can out of this work.

1197
01:39:41,234 --> 01:39:43,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would respond to Ms.

1198
01:39:43,957 --> 01:39:44,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuddy as well.

1199
01:39:45,058 --> 01:39:47,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anybody was looking for $400,000.

1200
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was a contribution based off of

1201
01:39:51,483 --> 01:39:52,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

1202
01:39:53,483 --> 01:39:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: A contribution towards that particular project that we will do as a city.

1203
01:39:58,384 --> 01:40:01,905
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't looking for National Grid to take on that project.

1204
01:40:01,945 --> 01:40:03,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Kelly.

1205
01:40:03,925 --> 01:40:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question's simple.

1206
01:40:07,466 --> 01:40:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We've always done this for these recommendations.

1207
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:15,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Curb to curb is what we're always, we're stressing.

1208
01:40:15,607 --> 01:40:18,868
[SPEAKER_04]: The permit, requested permits coming from National Grid.

1209
01:40:20,345 --> 01:40:29,691
[SPEAKER_04]: The only question I have before I vote no on this is why can't we have MWA, why isn't MWA asking for this permit as pot as this?

1210
01:40:30,551 --> 01:40:38,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now, the answer I want to vote on this is to make sure that that street is put back the way we said.

1211
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:43,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we just heard from National Grid and the representative, they're not doing that.

1212
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So why should I even vote for that?

1213
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:55,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no, I believe MWRA will restore the road curb to curb and the parts that are not under their scope where we're tying in on a side street about 30 feet on a couple of side streets.

1214
01:40:56,170 --> 01:41:01,515
[SPEAKER_12]: We will also, since we're disturbing it, we're bringing that also back curb to curb.

1215
01:41:02,656 --> 01:41:04,678
[SPEAKER_12]: M, oh, I forgot what I was gonna say.

1216
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:05,599
[SPEAKER_12]: MWRA,

1217
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:10,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, so yeah.

1218
01:41:10,808 --> 01:41:20,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I think what I was going with is they don't, I guess my understanding is they don't need a new grant of location because they're not moving their location.

1219
01:41:20,213 --> 01:41:23,095
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to move ours so they can get to theirs.

1220
01:41:23,795 --> 01:41:25,776
[SPEAKER_12]: And Tim, you can correct me if I'm wrong on that.

1221
01:41:26,076 --> 01:41:26,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You are correct.

1222
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:27,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1223
01:41:29,438 --> 01:41:31,419
[SPEAKER_12]: But they already have a permit, I think, too, right?

1224
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:31,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1225
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:32,440
[SPEAKER_12]: They already have a permit?

1226
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:32,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1227
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,702
[SPEAKER_13]: They own easement rights in Riverside Avenue.

1228
01:41:37,909 --> 01:41:39,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Councilor Marks, you had the floor.

1229
01:41:39,634 --> 01:41:42,443
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a number of points of information, but there are a number of Councilors that want to speak.

1230
01:41:42,483 --> 01:41:44,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wasn't sure, did you want to continue your questioning or?

1231
01:41:46,897 --> 01:42:05,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I would just ask that we get a commitment tonight from National Grid that a portion of funds be allocated to curb work on Riverside F. And that could be discussed between the city engineer and National Grid.

1232
01:42:06,067 --> 01:42:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I thought this originally was requesting.

1233
01:42:09,448 --> 01:42:22,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to make sure that what the request was that it stayed on Riverside Ave, because the original request was that that money be spent somewhere else in the city for paving somewhere else.

1234
01:42:23,335 --> 01:42:25,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand what National Grid's stating.

1235
01:42:25,937 --> 01:42:26,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

1236
01:42:27,237 --> 01:42:28,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just hope they make a commitment tonight.

1237
01:42:29,218 --> 01:42:32,400
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't, I cannot support this paper, Mr. President.

1238
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,982
[SPEAKER_03]: based on what I see in the community.

1239
01:42:36,502 --> 01:42:39,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the city gets a fair shake, to be quite honest with you.

1240
01:42:39,584 --> 01:42:41,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Everywhere you look, they're digging up our streets.

1241
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:42,365
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a mess.

1242
01:42:42,385 --> 01:42:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: They're never put back the way they should be, Mr. President.

1243
01:42:45,066 --> 01:42:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got sinkholes everywhere in the community.

1244
01:42:47,268 --> 01:42:51,110
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got double poles all around the community, you see popping up everywhere.

1245
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:53,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And these utility companies thumb their nose at us.

1246
01:42:54,171 --> 01:42:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, to be quite honest with you.

1247
01:42:56,332 --> 01:43:02,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they want to come up and move their pipes underneath the national grid, it's going to move for the MWRA, let them figure it out.

1248
01:43:03,454 --> 01:43:04,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them figure out, Mr. President.

1249
01:43:06,194 --> 01:43:10,335
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to stand around, Mr. President, while we talked about these curbs.

1250
01:43:10,836 --> 01:43:19,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And I live off of Riverside Ave, not this general area, but I live off of Riverside Ave, and I witness, Mr. President, every time I go by there, curbs that are level with the street.

1251
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:29,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And the gentleman that called me up just recently that his front stairs were totally annihilated, brick stairs at the Conner Locust and Riverside Ave.

1252
01:43:30,142 --> 01:43:34,343
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone remembers that, a cop plowed right into his home, Mr. President.

1253
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:38,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And partly because that the street is even with the sidewalk.

1254
01:43:39,085 --> 01:43:42,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Partly because the person was probably a bad driver, God knows what else was going on.

1255
01:43:43,286 --> 01:43:47,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But it lends itself, Mr. President, for a very dangerous area.

1256
01:43:47,527 --> 01:43:51,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going to do total work like this, that's complete the work, Mr. President.

1257
01:43:51,788 --> 01:43:56,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the city has to step up and put some obligation, fine, but let's get it done now.

1258
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1259
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:01,713
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Councilor Peers, Councilor Ntuk, Councilor Morrell, Councilor Peers.

1260
01:44:02,213 --> 01:44:03,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1261
01:44:03,674 --> 01:44:09,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim, in your opinion, does the delay to the spring need to be included in some way in this petition?

1262
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:19,621
[SPEAKER_13]: No, through the chair, the default position is no work after November 15th.

1263
01:44:19,721 --> 01:44:25,903
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have to ask permission from the DPW commissioner and myself before any work would be allowed in there.

1264
01:44:26,484 --> 01:44:26,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1265
01:44:27,064 --> 01:44:38,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just getting back to this question of coordination, have you been made aware of or do you have confidence that MWRA and National Grid

1266
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:50,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do the timing on the project in the spring so that the road is open for the, you know, is the road going to be open for months, or are the projects going to go one, two, and it'll be addressed relatively quickly?

1267
01:44:51,888 --> 01:44:55,430
[SPEAKER_13]: If I understand the question correctly, it will be sequential.

1268
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:56,731
[SPEAKER_13]: It won't be at the same time.

1269
01:44:57,131 --> 01:44:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sorry, not at the same time.

1270
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:10,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there going to be a gap between the two projects where Riverside Ave is cut up for six weeks before MWRA gets in after National Grid finishes their portion of the project?

1271
01:45:11,535 --> 01:45:20,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So the state-of-the-road post, immediate posts work, utility work, is a temporary asphalt patch.

1272
01:45:20,838 --> 01:45:22,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So you see them all over the place.

1273
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:28,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we're getting ready, or another entity is getting ready to do a full resurfacing,

1274
01:45:30,022 --> 01:45:41,052
[SPEAKER_13]: you put temporary patches down, which is asphalt, and they're obligated to be at the same slope and level and quality as the existing pavement around it.

1275
01:45:41,952 --> 01:45:47,057
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't last as long, obviously, and they deteriorate quicker, but once MWR is complete, then

1276
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:49,172
[SPEAKER_13]: service happens.

1277
01:45:49,572 --> 01:45:53,073
[SPEAKER_13]: So how long the lag between the projects, I don't know.

1278
01:45:53,353 --> 01:45:57,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if there's someone from MWRA here to talk about that.

1279
01:45:57,614 --> 01:45:58,974
[SPEAKER_13]: But there would be a lag.

1280
01:45:59,135 --> 01:46:00,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know exactly how long it would be.

1281
01:46:01,235 --> 01:46:01,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1282
01:46:01,635 --> 01:46:03,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Or what it would be.

1283
01:46:03,255 --> 01:46:03,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

1284
01:46:03,516 --> 01:46:15,598
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just something I think, when this comes back to us, it would be important to have, National Grid to have from MWRA some commitment that they'll be able to come in quickly after National Grid does its portion of this work.

1285
01:46:16,058 --> 01:46:16,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1286
01:46:17,319 --> 01:46:17,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1287
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:18,099
[SPEAKER_08]: We want the same thing.

1288
01:46:18,598 --> 01:46:18,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1289
01:46:18,958 --> 01:46:20,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just had two things.

1290
01:46:20,338 --> 01:46:26,080
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the other things that the city council had asked for is a representative from National Grid with a cell phone number.

1291
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:30,421
[SPEAKER_12]: So the project manager on this job is most likely going to be Matt Carmody.

1292
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:39,404
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks some of the members of the city council have his cell phone, but he'll provide that to everyone and it will go on the letter notifications for people to call.

1293
01:46:39,724 --> 01:46:43,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing before I forget, with regards to the double poles,

1294
01:46:44,275 --> 01:46:55,567
[SPEAKER_12]: National Grid reached an agreement with Verizon that we own the pole going in and Verizon's in charge of coordinating the other utilities to come off the old pole to the new pole and they own it going out.

1295
01:46:55,647 --> 01:47:02,955
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a phone number at Verizon for this particular thing and I'll send it over to Tim tomorrow that might help you with some of the double poles in town.

1296
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:04,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1297
01:47:04,993 --> 01:47:06,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pierres.

1298
01:47:06,094 --> 01:47:08,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, Councilor Nait, then Councilor Morrell.

1299
01:47:08,316 --> 01:47:08,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Nait.

1300
01:47:09,317 --> 01:47:10,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1301
01:47:10,197 --> 01:47:15,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. President, what I'm hearing here is the city engineer saying Riverside Ave is a mess.

1302
01:47:16,342 --> 01:47:18,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Riverside Ave needs a new gas line.

1303
01:47:18,564 --> 01:47:21,166
[SPEAKER_15]: It's leaking everywhere and the city has been requested it for some time.

1304
01:47:22,378 --> 01:47:23,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hearing Ms.

1305
01:47:23,499 --> 01:47:26,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuddy saying that this isn't a planned project.

1306
01:47:27,261 --> 01:47:28,642
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a project that we have to do.

1307
01:47:28,902 --> 01:47:33,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Most likely, they're holding their nose in doing it because the MWRA has an easement.

1308
01:47:34,385 --> 01:47:39,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And because of that, they're not willing to expend any extra dollars or resources in our community.

1309
01:47:39,448 --> 01:47:41,069
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way that sounds to me, Mr. President.

1310
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:45,632
[SPEAKER_15]: MWRA wants the work done and they have an easement, so now they're willing to do the work.

1311
01:47:45,692 --> 01:47:50,535
[SPEAKER_15]: The city was calling for the replacements of the gas mains due to the leaks, and they weren't willing to do the work.

1312
01:47:50,555 --> 01:47:51,596
[SPEAKER_15]: This was not a planned project.

1313
01:47:52,697 --> 01:48:03,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess the question is, if the MWRA didn't want to do this work, would National Grid ever even be looking at replacing this gas line?

1314
01:48:04,523 --> 01:48:09,366
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this wasn't a planned project, which took a little while to design over because of COVID.

1315
01:48:09,386 --> 01:48:12,608
[SPEAKER_12]: So no, this wasn't an immediate future.

1316
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:25,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, so we have a street that has multiple level 2 gas leaks on it, that we've all made phone calls on, that National Grid wasn't willing to fix, but now they will fix it because the MWRA needs access to their easement.

1317
01:48:28,097 --> 01:48:35,146
[SPEAKER_15]: We are getting some community benefit out of it, in my opinion, Mr. President, because if the project doesn't go forward, the gas main doesn't get fixed, right?

1318
01:48:35,607 --> 01:48:39,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the very least, we're getting the gas main fixed with the approval of the paper.

1319
01:48:40,373 --> 01:48:43,797
[SPEAKER_15]: But I commend the councilor in his position on this because

1320
01:48:44,678 --> 01:48:56,002
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that we have all talked about, but most significantly, Councilor Marks, the level of the pavement on Riverside Ave with the sidewalk is something that, as long as I've been on the council, he's been talking about.

1321
01:48:56,862 --> 01:48:58,243
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't blame him for pursuing.

1322
01:48:58,303 --> 01:48:59,643
[SPEAKER_15]: If he sees an opening, pursue it.

1323
01:49:00,483 --> 01:49:01,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Try to get through that crack and get that money.

1324
01:49:02,304 --> 01:49:03,704
[SPEAKER_15]: So I certainly have no problem with that.

1325
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:09,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that he's doing a great job advocating for the residents in that neighborhood.

1326
01:49:12,235 --> 01:49:17,937
[SPEAKER_15]: On the side of things, on the flip of the coin, we are getting 1,500 new feet of gas main that wasn't going to be replaced.

1327
01:49:18,097 --> 01:49:23,698
[SPEAKER_15]: And based upon the commentary of the city engineer, that gas main does need to be replaced.

1328
01:49:23,758 --> 01:49:24,439
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's full of leaks.

1329
01:49:24,499 --> 01:49:26,079
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city's been asking for it to be replaced.

1330
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:27,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a catch-22.

1331
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,940
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a conundrum, Mr. President.

1332
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:33,761
[SPEAKER_15]: That coupled with the fact that the grant of location for MWRA has already been issued.

1333
01:49:33,781 --> 01:49:34,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have an easement.

1334
01:49:35,142 --> 01:49:39,043
[SPEAKER_15]: They're replacing their pipes in the same location that they're granted to exist.

1335
01:49:39,924 --> 01:49:41,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're not going to have to come before this body again.

1336
01:49:42,568 --> 01:49:45,092
[SPEAKER_15]: But the people that are going to have to come before us are the National Grid.

1337
01:49:45,172 --> 01:49:49,919
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can see exactly why National Grid is on the hook for some of this.

1338
01:49:53,795 --> 01:50:02,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm of the inclination to support the paper just based upon the simple fact that the gas line wasn't going to be done ever in the foreseeable future.

1339
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:05,743
[SPEAKER_15]: The city engineer has indicated that it's one that does need to be done.

1340
01:50:06,463 --> 01:50:08,204
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's going to be a benefit to the community.

1341
01:50:09,165 --> 01:50:10,826
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I will support my council colleague.

1342
01:50:11,413 --> 01:50:16,757
[SPEAKER_15]: this evening if he's looking for more information or the like.

1343
01:50:16,817 --> 01:50:22,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Just from my view of it, Mr. President, it feels as though this is a forced project, a project that's being forced on national grants.

1344
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:25,084
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're not really willing to discuss anything because they don't have to.

1345
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:26,865
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to move it.

1346
01:50:27,626 --> 01:50:30,048
[SPEAKER_15]: And then MWRA is coming in and MWRA already has the grant.

1347
01:50:30,088 --> 01:50:31,309
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're not really over a barrel.

1348
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:33,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1349
01:50:35,352 --> 01:50:36,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1350
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:36,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morrell.

1351
01:50:37,495 --> 01:50:38,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1352
01:50:38,456 --> 01:50:40,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have two questions.

1353
01:50:40,277 --> 01:50:41,098
[SPEAKER_10]: The first for Ms.

1354
01:50:41,138 --> 01:50:41,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuddy.

1355
01:50:41,798 --> 01:50:46,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So you said that the MWRA is who is going to start work in April.

1356
01:50:46,261 --> 01:50:46,782
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct?

1357
01:50:47,903 --> 01:50:49,003
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to go in first.

1358
01:50:49,144 --> 01:50:51,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Their pipes are much lower underground.

1359
01:50:51,725 --> 01:50:53,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So National Grid will be starting in April?

1360
01:50:53,307 --> 01:50:53,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1361
01:50:53,727 --> 01:50:54,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure.

1362
01:50:55,028 --> 01:50:55,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1363
01:50:55,748 --> 01:50:55,808
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1364
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:57,029
[SPEAKER_10]: National Grid starts to work in April.

1365
01:50:57,089 --> 01:50:57,330
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1366
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:57,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1367
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:59,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Or earlier.

1368
01:50:59,751 --> 01:51:03,314
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not a bad winter, we could start earlier.

1369
01:51:03,354 --> 01:51:07,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And that better guarantees seamless us coming in

1370
01:51:07,812 --> 01:51:15,234
[SPEAKER_12]: and MWRA coming in behind us because we're not geared up for all the jobs that parade out of the gate.

1371
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:25,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have a mild winter, which I don't think we will have, but if we do, and we can start in March, that will help with some type of seamless progression.

1372
01:51:25,537 --> 01:51:27,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1373
01:51:27,438 --> 01:51:28,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1374
01:51:29,418 --> 01:51:34,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, do we have any understanding what level leaks exist within this span of work?

1375
01:51:36,454 --> 01:51:41,157
[SPEAKER_03]: What level gas leaks, I believe there's level one, two, and three.

1376
01:51:41,997 --> 01:51:45,619
[SPEAKER_03]: What level leaks are within this span of construction?

1377
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:49,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, do you want to talk to that or National Grid?

1378
01:51:50,342 --> 01:51:51,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, I can.

1379
01:51:51,062 --> 01:51:54,544
[SPEAKER_12]: So level one, a grade one leak is an emergency leak.

1380
01:51:55,585 --> 01:52:02,549
[SPEAKER_12]: A grade two leak is a leak that's discovered and needs to, by regulation, needs to be repaired within a year.

1381
01:52:03,549 --> 01:52:04,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Internally, we've added a,

1382
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:07,801
[SPEAKER_12]: level 2A to our classification.

1383
01:52:07,881 --> 01:52:14,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are more, you know, like it's a grade 2 leak in front of a school or, you know, in front of a facility like that.

1384
01:52:14,602 --> 01:52:18,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So those we try to get fixed in six months instead of a year.

1385
01:52:18,503 --> 01:52:22,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And a grade 3 leak is a leak that just is under surveillance.

1386
01:52:22,604 --> 01:52:25,904
[SPEAKER_12]: It's surveilled, surveyed every year.

1387
01:52:25,924 --> 01:52:29,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, just the classification stays the same.

1388
01:52:29,445 --> 01:52:34,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Or if it gets worse, it grades up to a 2 and then a 2A, and then it's fixed according to those regulations.

1389
01:52:36,058 --> 01:52:38,800
[SPEAKER_12]: But how many leaks are in that section, I don't have that answer.

1390
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that.

1391
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:41,742
[SPEAKER_03]: My question wasn't how many leaks.

1392
01:52:42,402 --> 01:52:45,824
[SPEAKER_03]: What level leak is in that particular area?

1393
01:52:46,144 --> 01:52:47,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they grade one, two, or three?

1394
01:52:47,945 --> 01:52:52,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it couldn't be grade one, because a grade one has to be fixed immediately upon discovery.

1395
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:56,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say they're either two or three.

1396
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:56,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three.

1397
01:52:56,711 --> 01:52:56,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1398
01:52:56,911 --> 01:52:59,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Two's have to be fixed within a year or six months.

1399
01:53:00,033 --> 01:53:02,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, which is very common in the city of Meffitt.

1400
01:53:02,654 --> 01:53:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hundreds of them.

1401
01:53:03,895 --> 01:53:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: around the community, hundreds and hundreds of grade level two and grade level three leaks.

1402
01:53:10,258 --> 01:53:19,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize this wasn't a planned project, but by no stretch of the imagination, we're replacing these because they're leaks that are emergency in nature.

1403
01:53:20,483 --> 01:53:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would differ with my colleague a little bit.

1404
01:53:22,585 --> 01:53:31,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the fact that he may see this a little different, but these aren't leaks of emergency nature.

1405
01:53:32,175 --> 01:53:38,242
[SPEAKER_03]: This is work being done on behalf of the MWRA, which has nothing to do with gas.

1406
01:53:39,525 --> 01:53:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1407
01:53:39,785 --> 01:53:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nothing to do with gas.

1408
01:53:41,207 --> 01:53:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at their own piping underneath the gas lines and naturally have to move gas lines in order to get to their piping.

1409
01:53:48,153 --> 01:53:56,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's why I believe strongly the MWRA should be ponying up some money into this project, Mr. President.

1410
01:53:56,962 --> 01:54:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we do with all other projects, like the Eversource and so forth, that we look for mitigation.

1411
01:54:02,827 --> 01:54:13,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see that other than just resurfacing and restriping an area that we're getting any mitigation on this project, we're getting disruption.

1412
01:54:14,217 --> 01:54:17,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it, Mr. President, in a highly traveled street.

1413
01:54:18,381 --> 01:54:28,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I will not be supporting this paper on behalf of area residents, Mr. President, because I don't think we've done our due diligence as a community to negotiate

1414
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:36,213
[SPEAKER_03]: with these two particular utility companies in order to get the utmost benefit on behalf of our residents and our city, Mr. President.

1415
01:54:36,413 --> 01:54:38,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will not be supporting this paper tonight.

1416
01:54:38,194 --> 01:54:39,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1417
01:54:39,114 --> 01:54:40,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morrell, you had the floor.

1418
01:54:41,495 --> 01:54:42,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1419
01:54:42,235 --> 01:54:44,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So my second question, um, through the chair is actually for Tim.

1420
01:54:44,976 --> 01:54:50,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious, based on the conversation we've had tonight, um, how often are these conditions that we vote for?

1421
01:54:50,979 --> 01:54:53,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we, does the utility come back and say, you know,

1422
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1423
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what you're talking about.

1424
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:55,401
[SPEAKER_10]: No, thanks.

1425
01:54:55,421 --> 01:54:56,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is this an is this an aberration?

1426
01:54:56,442 --> 01:55:00,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Or does this happen commonly where we vote on something and then the utility doesn't agree to it?

1427
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:11,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So the something that this doesn't happen is that often as far as I've been around.

1428
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:19,911
[SPEAKER_13]: I personally receive pushback like this.

1429
01:55:20,572 --> 01:55:29,297
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I try to stay reasonable with my conditions and the law and, you know, things that make sense to do.

1430
01:55:30,618 --> 01:55:32,599
[SPEAKER_13]: So, first time.

1431
01:55:32,679 --> 01:55:33,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I can add to that.

1432
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:38,663
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason is because when we come before the City Council for a grant allocation for a main extension,

1433
01:55:39,103 --> 01:55:41,846
[SPEAKER_12]: It's because a customer has prompted that request.

1434
01:55:41,866 --> 01:55:46,931
[SPEAKER_12]: They need gas service and they pay for the main to be extended and the service to be connected.

1435
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:54,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also agree to do road restorations or other conditions that are brought back.

1436
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,841
[SPEAKER_12]: This particular, when it's a main replacement like this,

1437
01:55:57,221 --> 01:56:02,604
[SPEAKER_12]: this goes back into our rate case, which then goes to the DPU and then is passed on to the customers.

1438
01:56:03,364 --> 01:56:05,445
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Yeah, thank you.

1439
01:56:05,465 --> 01:56:06,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand National Grid's reasoning.

1440
01:56:06,766 --> 01:56:12,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just trying to get more information from our city engineer as we, you know, we see a lot of grants and locations.

1441
01:56:12,189 --> 01:56:13,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just trying to get clarity on that.

1442
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:14,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1443
01:56:15,231 --> 01:56:15,491
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

1444
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:17,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Morillo.

1445
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:18,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1446
01:56:19,534 --> 01:56:24,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, not to beat a dead horse, but Councilor Marks makes a good point.

1447
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:31,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just listened to our traffic engineer who said this doesn't happen.

1448
01:56:32,484 --> 01:56:34,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I too think that unfortunately, Ms.

1449
01:56:34,966 --> 01:56:42,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuddy, the MWRA is in front of us right now, National Grid is, so I cannot support this paper either.

1450
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:42,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1451
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

1452
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:49,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any other questions from the council before we move forward?

1453
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:52,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, at this point, I call upon the clerk.

1454
01:56:52,612 --> 01:56:57,633
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe at the last meeting we had, there were a number of amendments that were made to this.

1455
01:56:57,713 --> 01:56:59,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that, am I correct?

1456
01:56:59,173 --> 01:57:02,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm looking through my notes at the last meeting.

1457
01:57:02,534 --> 01:57:08,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, I switched notebooks in the middle of that meeting.

1458
01:57:08,315 --> 01:57:10,015
[SPEAKER_13]: But one was the Opticom system.

1459
01:57:10,095 --> 01:57:11,216
[SPEAKER_07]: One was the Opticom system.

1460
01:57:20,067 --> 01:57:38,873
[SPEAKER_06]: One was the installing the Opticom system one was to look at the intersection of Riverside I think it was locus and and also have the city engineer Redigitize some of the underground utility plans after consulting with the superintendent of wires There were a number of amendments that were added on last week.

1461
01:57:38,913 --> 01:57:39,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have those.

1462
01:57:39,473 --> 01:57:45,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going a little bit from memory To redigitize those drawings and then

1463
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:54,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I believe you, Councilor Marks, you had an amendment on about making sure that there was full repaving and curb restoration.

1464
01:57:54,774 --> 01:57:56,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we just discussed.

1465
01:57:56,315 --> 01:58:00,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And that cell phone, we asked a representative to have a cell phone.

1466
01:58:00,377 --> 01:58:00,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.

1467
01:58:00,677 --> 01:58:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe Ms.

1468
01:58:01,317 --> 01:58:01,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuddy said.

1469
01:58:01,637 --> 01:58:03,298
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't answered yet.

1470
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:08,801
[SPEAKER_06]: No storage of equipment or materials in the public way, absent a mitigation agreement.

1471
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:09,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1472
01:58:09,602 --> 01:58:09,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ms.

1473
01:58:09,842 --> 01:58:15,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuddy did mention earlier that she would have someone with a cell phone number, people would be able to contact.

1474
01:58:16,793 --> 01:58:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. President, while we have the city engineer on, has he had a discussion with the head of WIAS, Mr. Randazzo, about the OptiComm system at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, which is used to allow ambulances and emergency vehicles to pass through quickly at major intersections?

1475
01:58:38,035 --> 01:58:39,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. McKibbin, could you comment on that, please?

1476
01:58:41,192 --> 01:58:47,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't touch the Steven Dalzell, but I caught Blake in my office, and we do have the capacity to do that.

1477
01:58:47,655 --> 01:58:55,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't aware of the exact request on that one, but I know we have the capabilities to do that.

1478
01:58:56,418 --> 01:58:58,719
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is something I think we're looking at moving towards the future.

1479
01:58:59,899 --> 01:59:10,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, while I'm speaking, I might as well put in there, someone would need to deal with item number 12, just to change that language.

1480
01:59:12,191 --> 01:59:19,878
[SPEAKER_13]: to have it be a contribution to Riverside Ave, sidewalk design, as opposed to paving the city.

1481
01:59:20,919 --> 01:59:26,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that... They've already said no, point of information.

1482
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:30,028
[SPEAKER_04]: They've already said no, they're not going to.

1483
01:59:30,428 --> 01:59:31,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's futile, I believe.

1484
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:39,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, I was just talking, if it's voted on now and it's item 12 is the condition, then that's the condition that gets passed.

1485
01:59:40,196 --> 01:59:41,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why.

1486
01:59:41,336 --> 01:59:43,318
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1487
01:59:43,358 --> 01:59:45,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So are you recommending to change the language then, Tim?

1488
01:59:47,822 --> 01:59:58,170
[SPEAKER_13]: I am, well, right now the language, the language in item number 12 says contribute to paving elsewhere in the city.

1489
01:59:59,171 --> 02:00:00,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks,

1490
02:00:01,373 --> 02:00:06,294
[SPEAKER_13]: brought up the idea of having it spent on Riverside Avenue.

1491
02:00:06,394 --> 02:00:09,795
[SPEAKER_13]: And it sounds like a sidewalk design scope.

1492
02:00:10,395 --> 02:00:13,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know what that value is or what that project looks like.

1493
02:00:13,615 --> 02:00:16,536
[SPEAKER_13]: That has to all be evaluated, but it'll be a contribution to that.

1494
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:27,598
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would recommend that that language be revised in item 12, regardless of how this vote goes down or national grid's position on item 12.

1495
02:00:29,166 --> 02:00:43,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, I believe I offered the language last week, but I'll do it again, that item 12 be amended to read the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to Riverside Ave curbing project.

1496
02:00:46,770 --> 02:01:01,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll add that, however, Mr. President, knowing what we heard tonight from the representative from National Grid, that they are not going to fund such a project or even partially fund a project.

1497
02:01:01,796 --> 02:01:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I will not be supporting this.

1498
02:01:04,877 --> 02:01:16,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask my fellow colleagues, in order to send a message to National Grid and the MWRA, let them go back and work this out, that we do not support this, Mr. President.

1499
02:01:16,542 --> 02:01:22,567
[SPEAKER_03]: even with this language, because this language is, as Counselor Scott Pelley stated, a false sense of security.

1500
02:01:22,967 --> 02:01:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Because ideally, I believe we've all, not ideally, I believe we've all heard that it's not going to happen, Mr. President.

1501
02:01:32,775 --> 02:01:35,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I will not be supporting it, even with that language.

1502
02:01:36,217 --> 02:01:37,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Counselor Marks.

1503
02:01:37,778 --> 02:01:38,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor Knight.

1504
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,120
[SPEAKER_15]: This question is for Ms.

1505
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuddy, Mr. President, through you.

1506
02:01:42,802 --> 02:01:45,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Based upon what I've heard, it sounds like National Grids

1507
02:01:46,618 --> 02:01:50,843
[SPEAKER_15]: not willing to do anything extra because they don't have any rate payers to pass the cost off onto.

1508
02:01:52,865 --> 02:01:57,331
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we definitely have rate payers, but it's not equitable.

1509
02:01:57,831 --> 02:02:03,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually, we're not legally, we have a legal obligation to, um,

1510
02:02:03,838 --> 02:02:04,698
[SPEAKER_12]: to the rate payers.

1511
02:02:05,219 --> 02:02:08,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And we actually have a rate case that's being submitted now.

1512
02:02:09,301 --> 02:02:13,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's through the legal department and they're happy to talk with the city solicitor.

1513
02:02:15,544 --> 02:02:23,028
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things I was just going to mention is that an open-ended contribution like that with no maximum limit or something like that isn't something I have.

1514
02:02:24,028 --> 02:02:27,670
[SPEAKER_12]: the ability to- Point of information, Mr. President.

1515
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:29,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, councilor.

1516
02:02:29,711 --> 02:02:31,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, no one's looking for a blank check.

1517
02:02:32,612 --> 02:02:35,593
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's- But it's worded that way, I know.

1518
02:02:35,713 --> 02:02:39,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and we can word it, as you see, we're the legislative body.

1519
02:02:39,235 --> 02:02:41,816
[SPEAKER_03]: We can word it any way we can strike an agreement tonight.

1520
02:02:42,196 --> 02:02:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're willing to strike an agreement, we're willing to word it that way.

1521
02:02:45,938 --> 02:02:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But by no means are we looking for a blank check or an open-ended proposal.

1522
02:02:51,183 --> 02:02:59,372
[SPEAKER_03]: We're asking that you contribute towards a project that the city will implement and work on, having nothing to do with your scope of service.

1523
02:02:59,952 --> 02:03:02,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get that commitment tonight, you'll have my vote.

1524
02:03:02,975 --> 02:03:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know where other people stand, but if not, you may have to go back to the drawing board.

1525
02:03:08,584 --> 02:03:12,645
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was just going to suggest that, you know, something like that can be, you know, we still have to get the permit.

1526
02:03:12,665 --> 02:03:14,306
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be in condition of the permit.

1527
02:03:14,506 --> 02:03:16,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we give you the permit, what leverage do we have to get everything?

1528
02:03:17,147 --> 02:03:21,908
[SPEAKER_12]: When there's a more definitive plan, a definitive engineered drawing, because that has to be designed.

1529
02:03:21,928 --> 02:03:25,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, through you to Ms.

1530
02:03:25,469 --> 02:03:27,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuddy, does National Grid have a charitable division?

1531
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:31,191
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of charitable divisions.

1532
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:36,813
[SPEAKER_12]: We, different initiatives for green communities, for elderly people that can't pay their bill.

1533
02:03:38,341 --> 02:03:40,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're really pretty good about that.

1534
02:03:40,382 --> 02:03:50,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, in lieu of this language, the city would be very willing and welcoming a donation equivalent to the amount of money that it would have cost for us to have that portion of the street resurfaced.

1535
02:03:51,789 --> 02:03:56,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And then those funds can be placed in the general fund and then appropriated whichever way we'd like to see them appropriated.

1536
02:03:58,093 --> 02:04:00,134
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is opportunity and options, it sounds like.

1537
02:04:01,314 --> 02:04:02,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to check on that.

1538
02:04:02,955 --> 02:04:04,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if they're blanket donations.

1539
02:04:04,596 --> 02:04:08,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you have to apply for whatever the program is.

1540
02:04:09,138 --> 02:04:15,280
[SPEAKER_12]: They give out incentives for replacing your heating system and no interest loans and things like that.

1541
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,042
[SPEAKER_15]: When we built the park right across the street over here, National Grid gave us five grand.

1542
02:04:20,522 --> 02:04:22,583
[SPEAKER_12]: But did you have to apply for it, right?

1543
02:04:22,823 --> 02:04:23,043
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1544
02:04:23,844 --> 02:04:25,684
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked, can you give us a donation to build a park?

1545
02:04:25,744 --> 02:04:26,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And they said, yep, here you go.

1546
02:04:26,665 --> 02:04:28,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, here's five grand.

1547
02:04:31,055 --> 02:04:33,057
[SPEAKER_15]: So now we're asking for a donation to build some sidewalks.

1548
02:04:33,857 --> 02:04:34,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can look into it.

1549
02:04:35,519 --> 02:04:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Night.

1550
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:36,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

1551
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think what Councilor Night just brought up a great suggestion.

1552
02:04:42,324 --> 02:04:46,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if we lay this on the table for one week, asking the representative, Ms.

1553
02:04:46,928 --> 02:04:59,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuddy, to go back and ask whether or not they'd be willing to give the amount of the resurface and the striping towards the curbing.

1554
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:03,374
[SPEAKER_03]: if they would be willing to make that type of commitment to the city.

1555
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Or any commitment to the city, I don't know the cost.

1556
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:12,801
[SPEAKER_12]: So- $400,000, that's the cost.

1557
02:05:12,841 --> 02:05:15,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So $400,000, so if we can get some type of- We'll take half.

1558
02:05:15,662 --> 02:05:16,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a deal?

1559
02:05:16,962 --> 02:05:24,424
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can get some type of commitment, Mr. President, between now and next week, I'd be willing to support this, Mr. President.

1560
02:05:24,904 --> 02:05:28,284
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it doesn't have to be done under their scope of service.

1561
02:05:28,684 --> 02:05:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be something that the city will embark upon at a later time.

1562
02:05:33,338 --> 02:05:38,804
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would ask if the representative is amendable to that.

1563
02:05:39,184 --> 02:05:42,367
[SPEAKER_03]: If she doesn't think that will happen, then I'm prepared to vote no tonight.

1564
02:05:43,348 --> 02:05:43,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1565
02:05:43,529 --> 02:05:44,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Connie, would you be able to comment on that?

1566
02:05:45,431 --> 02:05:47,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I honestly don't think

1567
02:05:48,157 --> 02:05:51,680
[SPEAKER_12]: they have programs like that for that type of a donation?

1568
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not looking for a program.

1569
02:05:53,922 --> 02:05:54,823
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Councilor Knight.

1570
02:05:54,863 --> 02:06:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for you just to make a commitment, a mitigation commitment to this city to put funding within, uh,

1571
02:06:06,139 --> 02:06:13,943
[SPEAKER_03]: the curbing for Riverside F. And if you can't, I can appreciate you can't make that commitment, but if we give you a week, are you willing to come back or?

1572
02:06:13,963 --> 02:06:23,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll ask again, but that is the condition that drew the attention of our legal department, which prompted me to reach back out to Tim because

1573
02:06:23,696 --> 02:06:25,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, $400,000, that goes back to the rate payers.

1574
02:06:25,717 --> 02:06:26,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just not- Who's coming up with this $400,000 figure?

1575
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:27,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Get off the $400,000.

1576
02:06:27,518 --> 02:06:34,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe if you downgrade that a little bit from the $400,000, we'd be happy with a commitment, as I think the council mentioned, even 50% of that, we'd be happy with that type of commitment.

1577
02:06:45,806 --> 02:06:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would go a long way to doing sidewalks and some curbing.

1578
02:06:49,148 --> 02:06:50,829
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the entire lane, if you look at it.

1579
02:06:50,849 --> 02:06:53,010
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some sections that don't need to be done.

1580
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:55,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would go a long way.

1581
02:06:55,632 --> 02:07:02,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're willing to do that, I'd be willing to lay it on the table for one week, if my council colleagues see fit.

1582
02:07:03,796 --> 02:07:03,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1583
02:07:03,956 --> 02:07:09,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuddy, would you be willing to go back to the people that you would talk to about this?

1584
02:07:09,299 --> 02:07:13,061
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, maybe the city solicitor could reach out to our legal,

1585
02:07:14,257 --> 02:07:19,439
[SPEAKER_12]: our legal team, and just, they could kind of iron this out a little bit more definitively.

1586
02:07:20,539 --> 02:07:22,680
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I'm happy to bring it back and come back.

1587
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be here next week anyway, so.

1588
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:28,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to lay on the table for one week, Mr. President.

1589
02:07:29,082 --> 02:07:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Pending response from National Grid on the mitigation response for the curbing on Riverside Ave.

1590
02:07:39,246 --> 02:07:40,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Moxwell.

1591
02:07:40,146 --> 02:07:42,747
[SPEAKER_14]: I motion by Councilor Moxwell to lay it on the table for one week.

1592
02:07:44,024 --> 02:07:47,687
[SPEAKER_14]: seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, Clerk Hertovich, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1614
02:08:21,133 --> 02:08:22,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's make sure we have that first.

1615
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:26,259

1616

02:09:45,059 --> 02:09:46,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1630
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:47,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, you're to please call the roll.

1631
02:09:48,742 --> 02:09:50,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs?

1632
02:09:51,144 --> 02:09:51,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1633
02:09:51,444 --> 02:09:52,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Kerrio?

1634
02:09:54,747 --> 02:09:55,287
He stepped away.

1635
02:09:55,868 --> 02:09:56,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1636
02:09:56,488 --> 02:09:56,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1637
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:58,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

1638
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:58,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1639
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell?

1640
02:09:59,811 --> 02:10:00,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1641
02:10:00,292 --> 02:10:01,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1642
02:10:01,132 --> 02:10:01,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1643
02:10:01,873 --> 02:10:02,454
[SPEAKER_07]: President Fevella?

1644
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:03,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1645
02:10:03,755 --> 02:10:05,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1646
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:06,737
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1647
02:10:08,198 --> 02:10:08,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1648
02:10:11,649 --> 02:10:13,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to hear from, was it the city engineer?

1649
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:17,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, let's go.

1650
02:10:19,691 --> 02:10:24,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim McGivern.

1651
02:10:29,233 --> 02:10:35,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim, if you could give us a brief synopsis of the project and talk about some of the conditions that you placed on this.

1652
02:10:37,255 --> 02:10:37,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't do that.

1653
02:10:40,023 --> 02:11:00,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Comcast should speak to, it is their project, but a summary, they would like to bring conduit, I believe it's one or two four-inch conduits from the island in front of City Hall, the grass island in front of City Hall, to across City Hall Mall in the approximate location of where the stop line is on City Hall Mall.

1654
02:11:01,654 --> 02:11:04,456
[SPEAKER_13]: to Salem Street, to the business right there.

1655
02:11:04,476 --> 02:11:05,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I forget exactly what the business is.

1656
02:11:06,458 --> 02:11:07,959
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be this project.

1657
02:11:08,699 --> 02:11:12,202
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a, it's going across the street.

1658
02:11:12,262 --> 02:11:14,043
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not longitudinal on City Hall Mall.

1659
02:11:14,423 --> 02:11:16,685
[SPEAKER_13]: City Hall Mall was paved in 2015.

1660
02:11:17,365 --> 02:11:27,833
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm recommending that they pave a swap, basically, from an existing seam to a point on City Hall Mall.

1661
02:11:28,633 --> 02:11:29,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I forget the exact number.

1662
02:11:29,814 --> 02:11:31,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I wrote it in the condition.

1663
02:11:33,196 --> 02:11:37,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So to bring it back to the way it is today.

1664
02:11:37,318 --> 02:11:39,860
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what we try to do with the five-year guaranteed streets.

1665
02:11:41,121 --> 02:11:48,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's also some trees that are nearby and some sod work that they'll need to do to restore the island.

1666
02:11:49,466 --> 02:11:51,267
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'm recommending that they

1667
02:11:52,573 --> 02:11:54,514
[SPEAKER_13]: They keep an eye on it for a year.

1668
02:11:54,874 --> 02:11:58,595
[SPEAKER_13]: So they own the sod and the trees, any tree work that they do for a year.

1669
02:11:59,155 --> 02:12:06,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also recommending that they coordinate with the tree warden on any tree trimming or root work that needs to happen to get by the island trees.

1670
02:12:06,358 --> 02:12:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a summary.

1671
02:12:09,339 --> 02:12:09,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1672
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:10,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1673
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:13,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, would you like to speak to the project?

1674
02:12:15,013 --> 02:12:16,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Dave Fullerman, Comcast.

1675
02:12:17,114 --> 02:12:18,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to speak in favor of the petition.

1676
02:12:19,774 --> 02:12:25,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, David, if you could just give us a brief synopsis of the project, then we'll open up the hearing for those in favor and those against.

1677
02:12:25,556 --> 02:12:31,077
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could please just give us a brief synopsis of the project, anything that the city engineer left out.

1678
02:12:31,758 --> 02:12:31,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1679
02:12:32,058 --> 02:12:32,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1680
02:12:32,398 --> 02:12:39,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So we received a request from number 26, City Hall Mall, and it is Artist Health that has requested our service.

1681
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:43,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, we put together an engineering plan.

1682
02:12:43,381 --> 02:12:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We submitted it.

1683
02:12:45,223 --> 02:12:46,064
[SPEAKER_02]: for the petition.

1684
02:12:46,704 --> 02:13:01,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're basically hoping that, and I know it's late in the year, but we are hoping that we will be able to hopefully get the service to this customer this year and not have to wait to the spring, especially where it is for a healthcare facility.

1685
02:13:01,671 --> 02:13:03,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1686
02:13:03,351 --> 02:13:03,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1687
02:13:05,953 --> 02:13:11,055
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I declare the public hearing open, open to anyone in favor of the proposal.

1688
02:13:13,114 --> 02:13:14,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, I assume you're in favor.

1689
02:13:14,814 --> 02:13:16,575
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could please give me a name and address for the record.

1690
02:13:18,635 --> 02:13:20,416
[SPEAKER_02]: The following nine Forbes road.

1691
02:13:21,116 --> 02:13:21,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1692
02:13:21,856 --> 02:13:24,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak?

1693
02:13:24,357 --> 02:13:28,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1694
02:13:28,177 --> 02:13:28,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing and seeing none.

1695
02:13:28,958 --> 02:13:30,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1696
02:13:31,658 --> 02:13:33,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone in opposition to the petition?

1697
02:13:33,839 --> 02:13:34,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone in opposition?

1698
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:36,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1699
02:13:36,839 --> 02:13:37,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing and seeing none.

1700
02:13:37,779 --> 02:13:39,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1701
02:13:42,389 --> 02:13:43,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any questions from the council?

1702
02:13:47,993 --> 02:13:48,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1703
02:13:48,914 --> 02:13:58,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So as I understand this, Mr. President, this is going to come straight across the street from my parking lot, cut a little bit through our parking lot underneath some bushes and trees, and then go right to the Harvard Vanguard building.

1704
02:14:00,522 --> 02:14:01,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

1705
02:14:01,683 --> 02:14:01,903
Correct.

1706
02:14:02,984 --> 02:14:03,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1707
02:14:05,427 --> 02:14:05,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1708
02:14:07,288 --> 02:14:07,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have one.

1709
02:14:07,988 --> 02:14:10,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, could you just explain the patchwork?

1710
02:14:10,749 --> 02:14:16,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't, I just want to make sure that the roads aren't left, uh, with divots later on.

1711
02:14:16,871 --> 02:14:22,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, even if it is going across our parking lot.

1712
02:14:22,973 --> 02:14:27,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it just trench work?

1713
02:14:28,075 --> 02:14:29,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it not curb to curb?

1714
02:14:29,495 --> 02:14:32,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously I could speak to that.

1715
02:14:32,637 --> 02:14:32,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1716
02:14:35,565 --> 02:14:37,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Engineer, if you could please speak to that, that would be great.

1717
02:14:38,188 --> 02:14:42,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, I'll just pull up the exact wording of the condition, President Paco.

1718
02:14:42,333 --> 02:14:42,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1719
02:14:43,134 --> 02:14:46,998
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's an existing seam and stop line on City Hall Mall.

1720
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:52,485
[SPEAKER_13]: So City Hall Mall was paved from that scene all the way back to Riverside Avenue not too long ago.

1721
02:14:52,505 --> 02:14:53,605
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a guaranteed road.

1722
02:14:54,166 --> 02:15:00,510
[SPEAKER_13]: So because they're making a proposal to cut into it perpendicular as opposed to longitudinal.

1723
02:15:01,731 --> 02:15:04,533
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no curve to curve, it's not even an option.

1724
02:15:05,073 --> 02:15:10,237
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm having them offset three feet from the trench to give plenty of space.

1725
02:15:10,957 --> 02:15:13,879
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a good wide

1726
02:15:15,984 --> 02:15:20,109
[SPEAKER_13]: patch, I guess you'd call it, from one side of City Hall Mall to the other.

1727
02:15:20,369 --> 02:15:23,273
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of those seams would be hidden in the stop line.

1728
02:15:23,413 --> 02:15:24,194
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the theory.

1729
02:15:24,234 --> 02:15:30,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the end of the day, there will be a seam where there wasn't one before.

1730
02:15:31,623 --> 02:15:35,308
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's no way around that.

1731
02:15:36,113 --> 02:15:49,498
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Tim, now being that it's later in the season and we're right in the cusp of the deadline, how long do we have a guarantee that if it doesn't sink or have issues later, even if it is three feet?

1732
02:15:56,145 --> 02:16:07,254
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were to allow them to work past the winter moratorium, I would recommend, and this is typically what we do in my office, that they don't do the final paving in the same season.

1733
02:16:07,274 --> 02:16:13,359
[SPEAKER_13]: That results in compaction issues, so it sinks basically.

1734
02:16:13,739 --> 02:16:19,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we're talking about a final mill and overlay, we want to wait at least a season, and hopefully it's a winter season.

1735
02:16:22,926 --> 02:16:28,468
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even made a decision if we're gonna let that, this is the first I'm hearing tonight if they wanna do this in the winter.

1736
02:16:28,788 --> 02:16:32,990
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's lots of things that myself and the commissioner would need to look at before allowing that to happen.

1737
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1738
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:36,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, any other questions from the council?

1739
02:16:38,032 --> 02:16:38,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1740
02:16:40,173 --> 02:16:49,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Would any of those items that the engineer needs to look at and discuss with the commissioner result in potentially further recommendations for conditions of approval?

1741
02:16:54,514 --> 02:17:00,817
[SPEAKER_13]: They would be, one of the things that I set up in my office is called an MSE.

1742
02:17:00,858 --> 02:17:02,779
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a winter moratorium exception.

1743
02:17:03,199 --> 02:17:10,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So any requests or conditions on a street opening permit would be tied to that moratorium special exemption.

1744
02:17:10,843 --> 02:17:12,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I get it.

1745
02:17:12,744 --> 02:17:13,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1746
02:17:13,204 --> 02:17:13,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1747
02:17:13,765 --> 02:17:14,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.

1748
02:17:14,105 --> 02:17:14,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks Tim.

1749
02:17:15,045 --> 02:17:15,245
Yeah.

1750
02:17:16,466 --> 02:17:16,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1751
02:17:16,706 --> 02:17:17,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1752
02:17:17,487 --> 02:17:18,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the council?

1753
02:17:20,048 --> 02:17:20,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1754
02:17:20,288 --> 02:17:23,210
[SPEAKER_14]: This was approved by the engineer with the following conditions.

1755
02:17:27,530 --> 02:17:29,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1756
02:17:29,210 --> 02:17:29,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

Yes.

1822
02:20:52,178 --> 02:20:52,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1823
02:20:53,078 --> 02:20:53,439

1828

[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the DPW paint the crosswalks and stop lines at the intersection of Tinker and Park Street in the interest of public safety.

[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco.

1830
02:21:14,355 --> 02:21:15,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Caraballo.

1831
02:21:15,695 --> 02:21:23,338
[SPEAKER_14]: I was walking through the neighborhood just about a week ago, through that Tainter Street, Park Street neighborhood.

1832
02:21:23,998 --> 02:21:34,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And I couldn't help but notice that the crosswalks in the vicinity of Roberts Elementary School, that particular crosswalk in that location needs to be painted.

1833
02:21:36,002 --> 02:21:38,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like it hasn't been painted in quite some time.

1834
02:21:38,884 --> 02:21:45,507
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to request that that be painted ASAP in the interest of public safety.

1835
02:21:46,107 --> 02:22:00,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could amend the resolution that if the DPW could please just check into the various crosswalks in the vicinity of each of our schools to make sure that they are painted, or if they need painting,

1836
02:22:01,082 --> 02:22:09,865
[SPEAKER_14]: painted as soon as possible, since we do have students that are attending schools, and if they need to be painted, we should make sure that that gets done as soon as possible.

1837
02:22:09,985 --> 02:22:13,486
[SPEAKER_14]: It should have been done by now, but we just need to make sure it gets done as soon as possible.

1838
02:22:13,666 --> 02:22:14,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

1839
02:22:16,346 --> 02:22:16,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1840
02:22:17,527 --> 02:22:18,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other discussion?

1841
02:22:18,047 --> 02:22:20,628
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Nye.

1842
02:22:20,648 --> 02:22:21,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1843
02:22:26,435 --> 02:22:26,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1844
02:22:26,636 --> 02:22:26,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1845
02:22:27,016 --> 02:22:27,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1846
02:22:35,409 --> 02:22:37,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 7 in favor, motion passes.

1847
02:22:37,330 --> 02:22:48,979
[SPEAKER_11]: 2-0-6-3-1, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the DPW have the street sweeper clean the parking lot at the Roberts Elementary School in the interest of public safety.

1848
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:49,880
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco.

1849
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

1850
02:22:51,501 --> 02:23:01,788
[SPEAKER_14]: As I was walking during the same tour, I was actually walking through the neighborhood, walked into the Roberts Elementary School parking lot, and I was talking to one of the neighbors.

1851
02:23:01,828 --> 02:23:03,650
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess during the summer,

1852
02:23:04,310 --> 02:23:04,530
[SPEAKER_14]: parking lot.

1853
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:05,991
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a portion of the parking lot.

1854
02:23:06,051 --> 02:23:11,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that was maybe used as a staging area for some work that was done, I believe, in the Salmon Street location.

1855
02:23:12,396 --> 02:23:17,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe there was a pile of dirt that was left that was basically in the parking lot.

1856
02:23:18,481 --> 02:23:23,224
[SPEAKER_14]: The dirt has been removed, but there's still a layer on the ground there that, you know,

1857
02:23:24,545 --> 02:23:25,885
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bit of a safety hazard.

1858
02:23:26,086 --> 02:23:29,326
[SPEAKER_14]: It's blowing into people's yards, windows, if they have their windows open.

1859
02:23:29,386 --> 02:23:39,109
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could please have the street sweeper, if the DPW could send the street sweeper by to clean up that lot in the interest of public safety, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1860
02:23:39,669 --> 02:23:40,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

1861
02:23:40,829 --> 02:23:43,230
[SPEAKER_11]: A motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1862
02:23:43,690 --> 02:23:44,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1863
02:23:44,470 --> 02:23:44,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Behrs?

1864
02:23:44,810 --> 02:23:44,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1865
02:23:48,651 --> 02:23:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1866
02:23:49,211 --> 02:23:49,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1867
02:23:51,332 --> 02:23:51,812
Councilor Marks?

1868
02:23:52,092 --> 02:23:52,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1869
02:23:56,161 --> 02:23:56,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1870
02:23:57,921 --> 02:23:59,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, affirmative motion passes.

1871
02:23:59,701 --> 02:24:10,023
[SPEAKER_11]: 20632 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that DPW rake the leaves, trim the bushes, clean the soil of Tainter Street entrance of the Roberts Elementary School parking lot.

1872
02:24:10,063 --> 02:24:10,803
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco.

1873
02:24:11,684 --> 02:24:13,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

1874
02:24:13,604 --> 02:24:18,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Just the Tainter Street entrance of the Roberts Elementary School, it's

1875
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:25,993
[SPEAKER_14]: The trees that abut the neighbors on the side, a little bit out of control, they need to be trimmed back.

1876
02:24:26,613 --> 02:24:31,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And the sewer, the Tantor Street entrance is covered over with leaves.

1877
02:24:31,516 --> 02:24:33,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's been cleaned in some time.

1878
02:24:33,117 --> 02:24:43,623
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could please have the DPW go by and clear the sewer and clean the drain out, clear the leaves and trim the bushes in that side of the parking lot.

1879
02:24:43,843 --> 02:24:44,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I greatly appreciate it.

1880
02:24:45,284 --> 02:24:45,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Move for approval.

1881
02:24:47,735 --> 02:24:52,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by President Falco, seconded by Councilor Bares, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1882
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:55,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1883
02:24:55,541 --> 02:24:55,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1884
02:24:55,861 --> 02:24:56,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1885
02:25:03,352 --> 02:25:03,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1886
02:25:04,733 --> 02:25:06,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 7 affirmative motion passes.

1887
02:25:06,534 --> 02:25:17,380
[SPEAKER_11]: 20633 offered by President Falco being resolved that the crack sidewalk panels in front of 248 Park Street and 44 10th Street be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1888
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:18,181
[SPEAKER_11]: President Falco.

1889
02:25:18,955 --> 02:25:20,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Carvalho.

1890
02:25:20,816 --> 02:25:27,601
[SPEAKER_14]: 248 Park Street, the panel is raised and it's a trip hazard for anyone that's walking down Park Street.

1891
02:25:27,681 --> 02:25:31,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I'm sorry, that one's cracked and it's got a number of cracks in it.

1892
02:25:31,204 --> 02:25:33,905
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right near the, I guess the,

1893
02:25:35,873 --> 02:25:37,253
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like right out there on the corner.

1894
02:25:37,273 --> 02:25:42,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are a number of cracks in that panel that really, it really needs to be replaced.

1895
02:25:42,895 --> 02:25:47,176
[SPEAKER_14]: It's definitely a trip hazard to anyone that's crossing in that location.

1896
02:25:47,376 --> 02:25:54,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And the panel at 44 Tanker as well, that has lifted up and definitely a trip hazard.

1897
02:25:54,958 --> 02:26:01,380
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the interest of public safety, we could please add those to the list of sidewalk panels that need to be replaced or repaired.

1898
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:02,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

1899
02:26:05,933 --> 02:26:13,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I may offer a B paper in relation to this, it's also related to sidewalk panels.

1900
02:26:14,545 --> 02:26:19,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Only this B paper is related to the sidewalk panels that would be located outside of the former Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1901
02:26:20,693 --> 02:26:32,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Just this past week, we had a bit of work being done along that stretch of Lawrence Road between, let's say, Governor's Ave and Lawrence Road, right to the entrance, the old entrance to the emergency room, Mr. President.

1902
02:26:33,661 --> 02:26:38,243
[SPEAKER_15]: And they ripped up the sidewalk panels, and they did some work, and then they put sidewalk panels packed down.

1903
02:26:38,403 --> 02:26:44,046
[SPEAKER_15]: And we used to have nice gray concrete sidewalk panels, and now this asphalt cold patch.

1904
02:26:45,407 --> 02:26:46,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to ask the question.

1905
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:53,028
[SPEAKER_15]: to our friends at Lawrence Memorial Hospital as to whether or not this is a temporary or permanent patching.

1906
02:26:54,069 --> 02:27:06,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I certainly do not find it acceptable that they take out the concrete sidewalking, which quite frankly, there was nothing wrong with, and replace it with this asphalt sidewalking, Mr. President, that doesn't fit in with the character of the neighborhood.

1907
02:27:07,159 --> 02:27:09,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, it does fit in with the character of the neighborhood.

1908
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:10,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it doesn't, Mr. President.

1909
02:27:10,281 --> 02:27:12,643
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason it doesn't is because if you look directly across the street,

1910
02:27:13,833 --> 02:27:19,148
[SPEAKER_15]: At the bottom of Summit Road, you'll see seven sidewalk panels that are gone, that haven't been there for five months.

1911
02:27:19,962 --> 02:27:26,767
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so on one side of the street, we're tearing up the entire side of the street that has a nice concrete sidewalk, and we're replacing it with black asphalt.

1912
02:27:27,388 --> 02:27:33,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And across the street, where we have a stump that needs to be taken down, the stump's been there for, I don't know, I think it was 11.

1913
02:27:35,033 --> 02:27:37,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the sidewalk's been ripped up, but the sidewalk hasn't been replaced.

1914
02:27:37,995 --> 02:27:41,398
[SPEAKER_15]: So on one side of the street, we're tearing it up and we're replacing it with an inferior product.

1915
02:27:41,418 --> 02:27:43,620
[SPEAKER_15]: But on the other side of the street, it's just being ignored, Mr. President.

1916
02:27:44,180 --> 02:27:46,802
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe that's something that needs to be addressed in post haste.

1917
02:27:47,853 --> 02:27:52,456
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd offer that in the form of a B paper, and I thank the council for bringing this measure forward.

1918
02:27:52,556 --> 02:27:54,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you.

1919
02:27:55,618 --> 02:27:59,721
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by president Falco, seconded by councilor Beers.

Yes.

1953
02:29:03,985 --> 02:29:04,305
Councilor Marks.

1954
02:29:04,465 --> 02:29:04,525
Yes.

1955
02:29:04,545 --> 02:29:05,566

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Stroud-Billings.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1960
02:29:12,075 --> 02:29:14,197
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-9-660.

1961
02:29:16,198 --> 02:29:26,606
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of council night to table the ordinance amending, actually, I'm sorry, to table the promote, prevent, support behavioral health commission ordinance, seconded by?

1962
02:29:26,626 --> 02:29:35,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, the reason I offer the table is because Councilor Mox made a number of amendments when we took this paper up and those amendments still have not been integrated into the document.

1963
02:29:36,614 --> 02:29:36,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1964
02:29:37,462 --> 02:29:40,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will table that until we can get this updated.

1965
02:29:40,743 --> 02:29:41,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs.

1966
02:29:41,543 --> 02:29:42,283
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, yeah.

1967
02:29:42,363 --> 02:29:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I believe I had one change as well in the representation section that wasn't made.

1968
02:29:47,864 --> 02:29:50,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've also found a typo in the attendance section.

1969
02:29:51,925 --> 02:30:04,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Just if we want people to send us back the right document, the last sentence of the section attendance, the word or after the word absences should actually be R-A-R-E.

1970
02:30:06,089 --> 02:30:06,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's that again?

1971
02:30:07,288 --> 02:30:12,232
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go into the section attendance, I think it's the third section.

1972
02:30:14,975 --> 02:30:18,378
[SPEAKER_08]: In the last sentence after the word absences, it should read are not or.

1973
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:22,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have that change?

1974
02:30:24,103 --> 02:30:26,325
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of table offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1975
02:30:27,005 --> 02:30:27,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1976
02:30:28,446 --> 02:30:30,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beers, Clerk here to please call the roll.

1977
02:30:30,688 --> 02:30:31,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beers?

1978
02:30:31,489 --> 02:30:31,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1979
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:32,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Kerrio?

1980
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:33,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1981
02:30:33,571 --> 02:30:34,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1982
02:30:34,191 --> 02:30:34,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1983
02:30:35,334 --> 02:30:35,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1984
02:30:36,695 --> 02:30:36,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1985
02:30:37,935 --> 02:30:38,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1986
02:30:39,196 --> 02:30:39,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1987
02:30:39,416 --> 02:30:40,597
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 affirmers during the negative.

1988
02:30:40,617 --> 02:30:41,497
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

1989
02:30:42,758 --> 02:30:46,940
[SPEAKER_14]: We already took up two zero five five nine two zero six two five offered by consular marks.

1990
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:59,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas public safety concerns raised almost two years ago to city officials by residents living in the neighborhood of Fulton spring road, bells at Murray Hill road and fells out of terrorists have gone without any response or relief from the city.

1991
02:30:59,946 --> 02:31:01,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And whereas it's known

1992
02:31:02,207 --> 02:31:17,557
[SPEAKER_14]: known fact that many roads in North Medford are used as cut-through, and whereas the Medford City Council requested that a complete traffic study be done of the entire area to help alleviate concerns of area residents regarding speeding and cut-through traffic.

1993
02:31:19,186 --> 02:31:39,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold an on-site committee of the whole meeting on either Saturday, November 21st or Saturday, November 28th, and invite area neighbors, police, Chief Buckley, City Engineer Tim McGibbon, Traffic Engineer Tom Blake, Mayor's Office, and DPW Commissioner Brian Kearns, Catholics.

1994
02:31:40,743 --> 02:31:45,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I know some of my colleagues that live in the area are very familiar with this.

1995
02:31:46,905 --> 02:31:50,185
[SPEAKER_03]: We all recall when we had the meetings at St.

1996
02:31:50,245 --> 02:32:03,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis back a couple years ago, and there were a number of area residents that came down regarding speeding, cut through traffic, lack of signage in the Heights area.

1997
02:32:04,809 --> 02:32:08,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought really, Mr. President, at the time we had

1998
02:32:09,951 --> 02:32:16,000
[SPEAKER_03]: all the players at the table, and I really, really thought some movement was going to happen.

1999
02:32:16,951 --> 02:32:41,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's been two years, Mr. President, and other than some signs that are restricted use only during rush hour and resident only signs, there's been very little done, to be quite honest with you, in regards to trying to alleviate some of the concerns of area residents in that neighborhood regarding cut through, regarding speeding, and so forth.

2000
02:32:42,548 --> 02:32:48,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We did request, Mr. President, that a complete comprehensive traffic study be done.

2001
02:32:49,997 --> 02:32:57,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone behind this reel know of or read or aware of this comprehensive traffic study?

2002
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:07,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they referring to when Officer Brooks did traffic counsel there for the Thanksgiving weekend a couple of years ago, maybe?

2003
02:33:07,954 --> 02:33:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That may have been part of the study, and Officer Brooks does a great job.

2004
02:33:12,197 --> 02:33:21,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mr. President, I'm not aware of any comprehensive traffic study that resulted from this council's request over and over again.

2005
02:33:22,442 --> 02:33:25,543
[SPEAKER_03]: residents request over and over again, Mr. President.

2006
02:33:26,043 --> 02:33:33,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's quite troubling when you have area residents that call you up and say, whatever resulted with the meetings that we had at St.

2007
02:33:33,984 --> 02:33:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis?

2008
02:33:35,285 --> 02:33:40,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever resulted with the traffic commission that was going to look into speeding cars and cut through traffic?

2009
02:33:41,186 --> 02:33:52,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever resulted from the additional signage that we spoke about on Fulton Spring Road, Fels Ave, Murray Hill Road, Fels Ave Terrace, that particular corridor, Mr. President?

2010
02:33:52,448 --> 02:33:56,552
[SPEAKER_03]: which is still a bone of contention for many, many area residents.

2011
02:33:56,812 --> 02:33:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to tell you that, Mr. President.

2012
02:33:58,674 --> 02:34:05,681
[SPEAKER_03]: You're well aware of the concerns and have fought just as hard to get something done in that particular area, Mr. President.

2013
02:34:06,441 --> 02:34:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a resident call me the other day.

2014
02:34:08,664 --> 02:34:17,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It said, we as residents were concerned about a four-way stop at Rockland Road, Fels Ave, and Fels Ave Terrace.

2015
02:34:18,350 --> 02:34:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And they asked for a four-way stop.

2016
02:34:20,851 --> 02:34:30,593
[SPEAKER_03]: They were told by someone within the police department or the traffic division, well, what you need to do first is get together a petition.

2017
02:34:31,694 --> 02:34:36,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to get more than 50% of the area residents to sign the petition.

2018
02:34:37,635 --> 02:34:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll entertain it with the traffic commission to put up a four-way stop.

2019
02:34:43,863 --> 02:34:45,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking to myself, Mr-.

2020
02:34:45,223 --> 02:34:51,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the same process that they use, Councilor Mox, to put up all those pylons all around the city and what they did down in Tufts Square?

2021
02:34:51,965 --> 02:34:53,326
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an excellent point.

2022
02:34:53,546 --> 02:35:05,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what that process was, but I can tell you, Mr. President, it's one thing to say that you're looking to get resident permit parking on a street and to see if there's a buy-in from the area residents.

2023
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:07,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that, Mr. President.

2024
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:12,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not agree with having someone go out and do the legwork, but I can see why that's done.

2025
02:35:13,552 --> 02:35:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get basic signage regarding four-way stops, Mr. President, there should not be a need of area residents to get together, sign petitions, do the legwork.

2026
02:35:25,145 --> 02:35:27,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes absolutely no sense, Mr. President.

2027
02:35:27,968 --> 02:35:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be an issue that's presented before the Traffic Commission and let them do their homework.

2028
02:35:33,727 --> 02:35:38,070
[SPEAKER_03]: No reflection on the traffic commission, but I've stated this for years as a member of the council.

2029
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:42,033
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have a traffic commission and then an off-street parking commission in the city.

2030
02:35:42,513 --> 02:35:44,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would say, how do I get this done?

2031
02:35:44,494 --> 02:35:49,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not sure, you may have to go to the off-street parking commission or the traffic commission, maybe they don't handle that particular item.

2032
02:35:50,278 --> 02:35:52,339
[SPEAKER_03]: We finally merged both back some years ago.

2033
02:35:52,379 --> 02:35:55,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We finally merged them together, so it's one stop shopping.

2034
02:35:55,521 --> 02:35:56,682
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Mr. President,

2035
02:35:58,203 --> 02:36:07,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but the chief of police in his capacity with a department of over 100 people in a major city is also the chair of the traffic commission.

2036
02:36:08,671 --> 02:36:13,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my opinion, no reflection, I know many of the members and they do great work.

2037
02:36:13,655 --> 02:36:15,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a reactionary body.

2038
02:36:16,408 --> 02:36:19,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't go out looking to make improvements, Mr. President.

2039
02:36:20,190 --> 02:36:22,011
[SPEAKER_03]: They just wait for stuff to come to them.

2040
02:36:22,771 --> 02:36:32,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's long overdue that we look how we operate the rules and regulations and how our traffic commission operates, Mr. President.

2041
02:36:32,396 --> 02:36:40,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's too much of a process to get quick turnaround and things to happen quick in the city.

2042
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:45,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you may get something through the traffic commission, but it may take you eight months to get the sign.

2043
02:36:45,965 --> 02:36:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Erect it.

2044
02:36:48,126 --> 02:36:52,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an issue, Mr. President, that needs to be attended to.

2045
02:36:52,509 --> 02:37:03,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I hope I don't offend anyone, but when you see something that needs to be attended to, after so many years, the traffic commission's created by, I believe, the state legislature.

2046
02:37:03,837 --> 02:37:07,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a home rule petition that creates the traffic commission and so forth.

2047
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:09,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be looked at.

2048
02:37:09,582 --> 02:37:12,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It possibly needs to be revisited.

2049
02:37:13,845 --> 02:37:16,667
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of the concerns I had with area residents.

2050
02:37:17,047 --> 02:37:19,089
[SPEAKER_03]: that I tried to bring to the chief's attention.

2051
02:37:20,911 --> 02:37:26,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for phone calls back from the chief from weeks and months ago.

2052
02:37:26,998 --> 02:37:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiple phone calls.

2053
02:37:29,101 --> 02:37:32,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize he's a busy man, but guess what?

2054
02:37:32,885 --> 02:37:35,007
[SPEAKER_03]: In that capacity, you have to delegate.

2055
02:37:36,115 --> 02:37:49,915
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're that busy that you can't return a call to a resident or an elected official or whoever it might be, then maybe you should practice the art of delegating and having someone follow up, Mr. President.

2056
02:37:50,616 --> 02:37:52,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to him because he was the chief.

2057
02:37:54,908 --> 02:38:00,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, I am very disappointed in not getting a return phone call, though.

2058
02:38:00,591 --> 02:38:01,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Common courtesy.

2059
02:38:01,812 --> 02:38:04,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't on my behalf, Mr. President.

2060
02:38:04,493 --> 02:38:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on behalf of the residents that are so angry, Mr. President, that they see no results on meetings, city meetings, and so forth.

2061
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:16,400
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet again, I'm going to call for another meeting.

2062
02:38:17,112 --> 02:38:19,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this resident said, and we're going to have more of the same.

2063
02:38:20,574 --> 02:38:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard for me as an elected official to say, you know what, the other meetings we had at St.

2064
02:38:24,297 --> 02:38:26,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis, we tried to do something but nothing resulted.

2065
02:38:27,539 --> 02:38:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: This onsite meeting, hopefully we'll get the chief, hopefully he'll participate.

2066
02:38:32,421 --> 02:38:34,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's busy, hopefully we can get him.

2067
02:38:34,462 --> 02:38:35,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we'll get the mayor.

2068
02:38:36,183 --> 02:38:43,188
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor has stated when she ran for public office, she stated unequivocally, I'm gonna be before that Memphis City Council.

2069
02:38:43,929 --> 02:38:47,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe even one time she said, they'll see me so many times, they'll get sick of me.

2070
02:38:49,192 --> 02:38:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's COVID, Mr. President, but the line of communication is not there.

2071
02:38:54,047 --> 02:38:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not there, it's lacking.

2072
02:38:55,608 --> 02:39:05,997
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm asking for an on-site visit, Mr. President, with the traffic engineer, with the head of DPW, with the mayor, and our office, and the chief of police.

2073
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:18,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope, Mr. President, as I put two Saturdays down, the weather's still fine, COVID's out there, but we can meet outdoors in a safe manner.

2074
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:27,402
[SPEAKER_03]: and inviting area residents to let us know what they go through on a daily basis, dealing with the traffic and the cut through.

2075
02:39:27,682 --> 02:39:28,782
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is during COVID.

2076
02:39:29,683 --> 02:39:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys see it, it's starting to pick up again.

2077
02:39:34,284 --> 02:39:38,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a lull for a little while and it's starting to pick up again.

2078
02:39:40,447 --> 02:39:42,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And residents are very concerned, Mr. President.

2079
02:39:43,130 --> 02:39:50,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask with all due deference that you set up those meetings, Mr. President, on one of the other dates.

2080
02:39:52,582 --> 02:39:53,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I can do that?

2081
02:39:53,984 --> 02:39:55,746
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an extremely important issue.

2082
02:39:57,248 --> 02:39:59,291
[SPEAKER_03]: This is happening throughout the entire community.

2083
02:40:00,458 --> 02:40:03,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to get a handle on what's happening on our streets.

2084
02:40:03,419 --> 02:40:04,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to take back our roads.

2085
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:12,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to make it safe for pedestrians, bicyclists, cars, anyone that wants to traverse, Mr. President, our roads.

2086
02:40:13,042 --> 02:40:14,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to make it safe.

2087
02:40:14,603 --> 02:40:17,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, what's happening up the heights right now is not safe.

2088
02:40:18,384 --> 02:40:29,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few signs that are put saying area residents only or restrictive use doesn't take the place of enforcement, doesn't take the place of additional signage, Mr. President.

2089
02:40:30,971 --> 02:40:42,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And my second point, the Connor of Doonan and, Doonan and, that's the next one.

2090
02:40:42,454 --> 02:40:44,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave that for the next one, Mr. President.

2091
02:40:46,495 --> 02:40:47,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on a roll.

2092
02:40:48,115 --> 02:40:51,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the same issue, Mr. President, and that I'll leave for the next one.

2093
02:40:52,376 --> 02:40:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would hope my fellow colleagues, Mr. President, I know they all support this.

2094
02:40:57,359 --> 02:40:59,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure many of them are tired of hearing of it.

2095
02:40:59,981 --> 02:41:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what, Mr. President?

2096
02:41:01,501 --> 02:41:03,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It still remains a concern.

2097
02:41:04,143 --> 02:41:08,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe our public safety, I think Councilor Beers, are you the chairman of public safety subcommittee?

2098
02:41:09,766 --> 02:41:15,790
[SPEAKER_03]: The public safety sub, it may not be you, but we really need to have a public safety summit, Mr. President.

2099
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:17,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been calling for it for years.

2100
02:41:17,951 --> 02:41:25,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've still yet to get a buy-in from the city administration or the chief of police to call for a public safety summit.

2101
02:41:26,835 --> 02:41:32,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's long overdue in this community, and maybe we as a council have to call for the meeting.

2102
02:41:32,883 --> 02:41:42,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Because clearly this administration and the chief of police have other things that they're embroiled in right now, and it's clearly not safety in this community.

2103
02:41:42,535 --> 02:41:43,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2104
02:41:46,336 --> 02:41:47,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else like to speak?

2105
02:41:48,438 --> 02:41:55,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I may, I want to thank Council Marks for bringing this forward as I very well know how painful the traffic is in this area.

2106
02:41:55,965 --> 02:41:58,888
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on Fulton Spring Road and I think I've told you before.

2107
02:42:00,490 --> 02:42:03,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not getting out of the morning.

2108
02:42:03,672 --> 02:42:04,953
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how bad the traffic is.

2109
02:42:05,493 --> 02:42:08,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Even during the pandemic did a lot of for a while.

2110
02:42:08,134 --> 02:42:12,096
[SPEAKER_14]: But even during the pandemic, you know, it's it's an issue in the morning.

2111
02:42:12,917 --> 02:42:16,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And I even between the stop signs of and I can speak this person because I live there.

2112
02:42:17,539 --> 02:42:21,081
[SPEAKER_14]: The stop signs between Fulton Spring and Fulton Street in Fulton

2113
02:42:27,597 --> 02:42:31,739
[SPEAKER_14]: literally the traffic, it's like people race to get from one stop sign to the next.

2114
02:42:31,919 --> 02:42:34,319
[SPEAKER_14]: And it, it is, it is a safety hazard.

2115
02:42:34,359 --> 02:42:39,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've, I've talked to the, um, to, uh, Sergeant Hartman about this before in the past.

2116
02:42:39,841 --> 02:42:42,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, so he's, I think everyone's well aware of it, but you're right.

2117
02:42:43,143 --> 02:42:44,583
[SPEAKER_14]: These things need to be addressed.

2118
02:42:45,183 --> 02:42:48,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last time I, because I would get a lot of calls with regard to, um,

2119
02:42:50,021 --> 02:42:56,067
[SPEAKER_14]: traffic in the morning because pre-pandemic the traffic literally used to go up Fells Ave and down the other side.

2120
02:42:56,627 --> 02:42:57,989
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like a parade of cars.

2121
02:42:58,729 --> 02:43:10,161
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that what happened was at one point they were trying to go before the Malden traffic commission to see if they could shut down kind of the traffic coming in on the Malden side.

2122
02:43:10,841 --> 02:43:11,362
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think

2123
02:43:12,856 --> 02:43:14,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Malden said no to it, I think.

2124
02:43:15,197 --> 02:43:17,038
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's something we could discuss at the meeting.

2125
02:43:17,058 --> 02:43:19,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's why they couldn't alleviate some of the traffic.

2126
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,821
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need to look at something.

2127
02:43:21,861 --> 02:43:23,002
[SPEAKER_14]: You are 100% correct.

2128
02:43:23,382 --> 02:43:24,302
[SPEAKER_14]: It needs to be addressed.

2129
02:43:24,322 --> 02:43:30,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you don't mind me asking now, is everyone available on the 21st of November?

2130
02:43:30,926 --> 02:43:32,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that I can get on it right away?

2131
02:43:32,047 --> 02:43:32,087
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2132
02:43:32,867 --> 02:43:34,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have a no.

2133
02:43:36,005 --> 02:43:42,247
[SPEAKER_15]: 28th doesn't work for me, Mr. President, but I'd just like to ask that a robocall be made to all the residents of the streets for whatever date you do decide.

2134
02:43:42,887 --> 02:43:45,608
[SPEAKER_15]: The 28th is right after Thanksgiving.

2135
02:43:45,648 --> 02:43:46,248
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be traveling.

2136
02:43:47,168 --> 02:43:50,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, what time are we thinking?

2137
02:43:50,189 --> 02:43:51,149
[SPEAKER_14]: The 28th would be an issue.

2138
02:43:51,749 --> 02:43:53,130
[SPEAKER_14]: What time are we thinking?

2139
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,470
[SPEAKER_14]: That also has an impact.

2140
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:56,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I would say probably preferably in the morning.

2141
02:43:56,511 --> 02:43:58,491
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have neighborhood residents.

2142
02:43:58,551 --> 02:43:59,932
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to wake them up at six in the morning.

2143
02:44:01,952 --> 02:44:04,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we set it for the 21st and what time works?

2144
02:44:04,874 --> 02:44:05,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Is a better time?

2145
02:44:05,955 --> 02:44:07,356
[SPEAKER_10]: 10 or 11.

2146
02:44:08,237 --> 02:44:10,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we set it for the 21st at 11 o'clock?

2147
02:44:10,118 --> 02:44:10,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Car Park.

2148
02:44:11,219 --> 02:44:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And say Car Park.

2149
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:14,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's meet right in that area.

2150
02:44:15,142 --> 02:44:16,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I prefer to be right in that area.

2151
02:44:16,323 --> 02:44:21,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we might want to meet at John's house and he'll have b-boys for us.

2152
02:44:21,546 --> 02:44:22,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that.

2153
02:44:22,347 --> 02:44:24,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's meet right in that stretch, Mr. President.

2154
02:44:24,068 --> 02:44:24,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick an area.

2155
02:44:25,069 --> 02:44:26,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Fulton Street and Fern Road.

2156
02:44:26,230 --> 02:44:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, a corner and we'll meet right there.

2157
02:44:30,573 --> 02:44:32,795
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to do Fulton Spring and Fern.

2158
02:44:33,155 --> 02:44:36,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so let's do the 21st.

2159
02:44:36,258 --> 02:44:36,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it 11 a.m.

2160
02:44:36,679 --> 02:44:37,499
[SPEAKER_14]: or 10 a.m.?

2161
02:44:37,519 --> 02:44:38,240
[SPEAKER_14]: What works best?

2162
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:38,761
[SPEAKER_14]: 11 would be great.

2163
02:44:39,081 --> 02:44:38,761
11?

2164
02:44:39,501 --> 02:44:40,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everybody on board with that?

2165
02:44:40,702 --> 02:44:41,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that.

2166
02:44:41,423 --> 02:44:42,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2167
02:44:43,085 --> 02:44:43,845
[SPEAKER_08]: We're saying 28th at 11?

2168
02:44:44,746 --> 02:44:45,667
[SPEAKER_14]: No, 21st.

2169
02:44:45,827 --> 02:44:45,967
[SPEAKER_08]: 21st at 11.

2170
02:44:46,288 --> 02:44:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that works.

2171
02:44:47,409 --> 02:44:51,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I second Councilor Knight's robo-call.

2172
02:44:53,774 --> 02:44:53,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2173
02:44:54,075 --> 02:44:55,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid to go closer to Murray Hill Road.

2174
02:44:55,576 --> 02:44:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too dangerous.

2175
02:44:59,281 --> 02:45:11,758
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Council of Marks second of I vice-president Cobb yellow or Kirby's please call the roll

2176
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:14,381
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Haynes.

2177
02:45:14,421 --> 02:45:19,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, just so we are all under the same impression, that the roll call go out.

2178
02:45:19,725 --> 02:45:27,931
[SPEAKER_03]: First we invite all the department heads and so forth, and the roll call go out requesting that the Method City Council is requesting this meeting.

2179
02:45:28,091 --> 02:45:29,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2180
02:45:29,452 --> 02:45:34,056
[SPEAKER_14]: You said as far as invite, as far as, make sure you get the list of people that we want to invite.

2181
02:45:34,116 --> 02:45:41,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief of Police, City Engineer, Traffic Engineer, DPW Commissioner, Mayor,

2182
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:44,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And mayor's office, anyone else?

2183
02:45:44,791 --> 02:45:47,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that covers.

2184
02:45:47,173 --> 02:45:48,374
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we have to be cautious.

2185
02:45:48,394 --> 02:45:49,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we have to be cautious.

2186
02:45:49,795 --> 02:45:53,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, if we have so many people from the traffic commission, then they'll reach a quorum.

2187
02:45:55,898 --> 02:45:58,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell the chief, the chief, you know, it's fine.

2188
02:45:58,720 --> 02:45:59,941
[SPEAKER_15]: He's the head of the traffic commission.

2189
02:46:00,601 --> 02:46:00,942
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good.

2190
02:46:00,962 --> 02:46:03,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll put that together.

2191
02:46:05,965 --> 02:46:08,026
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in the ordinance in the resolution.

2192
02:46:08,046 --> 02:46:08,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2193
02:46:08,587 --> 02:46:08,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2194
02:46:10,341 --> 02:46:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, that cover, I may have missed the street or two, so.

2195
02:46:13,304 --> 02:46:16,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, does that cover Fulton Spring Road, Fell's Ave?

2196
02:46:17,287 --> 02:46:17,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Murray Hill.

2197
02:46:18,208 --> 02:46:19,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Murray Hill Road.

2198
02:46:19,549 --> 02:46:20,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Twice, and it doesn't have Rockwell.

2199
02:46:22,892 --> 02:46:24,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to add Rockland Road?

2200
02:46:24,674 --> 02:46:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to add Fern?

2201
02:46:27,316 --> 02:46:28,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Fern Road.

2202
02:46:28,097 --> 02:46:28,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Fern Road.

2203
02:46:28,677 --> 02:46:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hit that chunk of area.

2204
02:46:33,105 --> 02:46:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the Agapinos live right there.

2205
02:46:34,626 --> 02:46:34,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2206
02:46:35,186 --> 02:46:37,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have Fern Road, Fulton Springs, Wells Ave.

2207
02:46:37,208 --> 02:46:37,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Westfield.

2208
02:46:38,228 --> 02:46:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

2209
02:46:38,549 --> 02:46:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Westfield and some of the- West.

2210
02:46:40,210 --> 02:46:40,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Rova.

2211
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:47,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because then you get like, if you have Rockland, then you want like Vista Ave, Lookout Road.

2212
02:46:47,695 --> 02:46:50,016
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bunch of- Yeah, yeah.

2213
02:46:50,036 --> 02:46:51,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go whatever you want to send it out to.

2214
02:46:51,797 --> 02:46:52,318
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.

2215
02:46:52,458 --> 02:46:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2216
02:46:52,578 --> 02:46:52,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2217
02:46:52,678 --> 02:46:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

2218
02:46:53,478 --> 02:46:55,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be sent to the whole ward.

2219
02:46:57,641 --> 02:46:58,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bad idea.

2220
02:46:59,548 --> 02:47:01,149
[SPEAKER_04]: at Fellsway West.

2221
02:47:01,189 --> 02:47:06,172
[SPEAKER_04]: The last one we got people from Parris Street if you don't mind.

2222
02:47:06,232 --> 02:47:12,555
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Knight.

2223
02:47:12,595 --> 02:47:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2224
02:47:16,817 --> 02:47:17,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2225
02:47:18,038 --> 02:47:18,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2226
02:47:19,239 --> 02:47:19,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2227
02:47:20,539 --> 02:47:22,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2228
02:47:23,081 --> 02:47:23,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2229
02:47:23,321 --> 02:47:25,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So the affirmative is here and the negative, the motion passes.

2230
02:47:26,174 --> 02:47:36,939
[SPEAKER_14]: 20-626 offered by Councilor Marks, be resolved that the four-way stop at the intersection of Doonan and Park Ave be discussed in the interest of public safety.

2231
02:47:37,059 --> 02:47:37,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2232
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2233
02:47:39,601 --> 02:47:47,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, this was an intersection that we ended up getting after many years of four-way stop at the corner of Doonan and Park.

2234
02:47:48,685 --> 02:47:59,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the signs that were erected were put back in an angle that makes it very difficult for people coming into the intersection of Park and Doonan.

2235
02:47:59,872 --> 02:48:08,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I'm being told by area residents, that people are blowing right through the four-way stop, not stopping at all, just going through.

2236
02:48:09,578 --> 02:48:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: They believe partially it's the inability of people to see the signs when they're approaching because of the angle.

2237
02:48:17,243 --> 02:48:20,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I had a discussion with Chief Buckley.

2238
02:48:20,967 --> 02:48:28,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going back and forth with a couple of the residents and the chief, and the follow-up wasn't there.

2239
02:48:28,536 --> 02:48:35,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I reached back out to Chief Buckley, and the follow-up still wasn't there, and the calls weren't returned.

2240
02:48:35,924 --> 02:48:39,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's on the agenda, Mr. President, which is unfortunate.

2241
02:48:40,506 --> 02:48:54,453
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm asking, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety, that the chief of police, along with his traffic division, go out and take a cursory look

2242
02:48:56,234 --> 02:49:00,775
[SPEAKER_03]: at this particular intersection and see what may be the underlining problems.

2243
02:49:01,236 --> 02:49:08,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Why cars are blowing through this intersection, if it's how the signs are faced, the stop signs are faced or not.

2244
02:49:09,318 --> 02:49:15,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Mr. President, the residents asked for, no one wants to get ticketed, but they asked for increased enforcement.

2245
02:49:16,322 --> 02:49:20,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And it happened for a short period of time, and then it got brushed aside.

2246
02:49:20,727 --> 02:49:27,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are real concerned about safety and concern of area residents in that area, Mr. President.

2247
02:49:27,815 --> 02:49:28,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2248
02:49:28,436 --> 02:49:28,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2249
02:49:28,816 --> 02:49:31,660
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to cut to 05, Vice President Cabiela.

2250
02:49:32,703 --> 02:49:33,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2251
02:49:33,323 --> 02:49:38,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I sympathize with Council Marks and the people doing it in the park.

2252
02:49:38,587 --> 02:49:41,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I live on a street that's got a four-way stop sign.

2253
02:49:41,469 --> 02:49:45,292
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not even a stop sign there.

2254
02:49:45,533 --> 02:49:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Before, people used to slow down when they went through it.

2255
02:49:50,428 --> 02:49:53,229
[SPEAKER_11]: They just don't even, I mean, I can see them going down the street.

2256
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:54,810
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're not even putting the foot in the brake.

2257
02:49:56,451 --> 02:50:00,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's the way people just driving nowadays.

2258
02:50:01,854 --> 02:50:05,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's in a hurry, more than they've ever been.

2259
02:50:06,236 --> 02:50:11,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of the problem is you've got so many more delivery drivers now.

2260
02:50:11,958 --> 02:50:17,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only in trucks, but like DoorDash, GrubHub, all these things.

2261
02:50:17,380 --> 02:50:20,721
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are all trying to make a buck during these times, I know it's tough.

2262
02:50:23,532 --> 02:50:29,294
[SPEAKER_11]: You see them, they just fly through these stop signs, and there's no consideration for the neighborhood.

2263
02:50:29,674 --> 02:50:37,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And I live a block from the Brooks School, and even during school times, no one stops at these signs anymore.

2264
02:50:39,156 --> 02:50:44,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that the traffic department can figure something out to slow these people down in the city of Medford.

2265
02:50:45,858 --> 02:50:47,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

2266
02:50:47,579 --> 02:50:50,180
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

2267
02:50:50,660 --> 02:50:51,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2268
02:50:57,169 --> 02:50:57,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2269
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:58,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2270
02:50:58,770 --> 02:50:59,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2271
02:50:59,930 --> 02:51:00,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2272
02:51:00,971 --> 02:51:01,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2273
02:51:02,232 --> 02:51:02,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2274
02:51:03,452 --> 02:51:03,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2275
02:51:04,753 --> 02:51:05,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2276
02:51:05,873 --> 02:51:06,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2277
02:51:07,014 --> 02:51:07,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven.

2278
02:51:07,234 --> 02:51:08,274
[SPEAKER_14]: The affirmative zero in the negative.

2279
02:51:08,295 --> 02:51:13,517
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes two zero dash six, two seven offered by consulate Morrell.

2280
02:51:13,537 --> 02:51:24,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Memphis city council request that the city administration installed pedestrian crossing signs at the Winthrop street crosswalks at the intersection of place, Ted road in the interest of safety.

2281
02:51:25,003 --> 02:51:25,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Consulate Morrell.

2282
02:51:26,157 --> 02:51:27,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2283
02:51:27,238 --> 02:51:42,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to continue on the night's theme of pedestrian safety and safety, which I say in jest, but I mean, obviously there's countless intersections we could probably bring up due to people's love of Medford as a cutthroat to get many places, among other issues.

2284
02:51:43,451 --> 02:51:47,414
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know everyone here knows just how dangerous this area is.

2285
02:51:47,494 --> 02:51:48,895
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where Playset hits Winthrop.

2286
02:51:49,295 --> 02:51:50,997
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the cemetery entrance right there.

2287
02:51:51,037 --> 02:51:51,917
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the fells.

2288
02:51:52,698 --> 02:51:53,419
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a high,

2289
02:51:53,999 --> 02:51:55,880
[SPEAKER_10]: a level of pedestrian traffic.

2290
02:51:55,900 --> 02:51:59,481
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a high level of road traffic coming down 38 from Winchester.

2291
02:51:59,541 --> 02:52:00,642
[SPEAKER_10]: The cars just fly.

2292
02:52:00,702 --> 02:52:03,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are two crosswalks that are there.

2293
02:52:03,883 --> 02:52:08,145
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fairly faded on the north and the south side of where a place that hits Winthrop.

2294
02:52:08,725 --> 02:52:10,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And they may as well not be there.

2295
02:52:11,146 --> 02:52:13,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime you see people out, people wait there forever.

2296
02:52:13,528 --> 02:52:14,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Cars will never stop for them.

2297
02:52:15,588 --> 02:52:21,131
[SPEAKER_10]: On the north side of the intersection, it is so incredibly wide that if you're lucky enough to have a car stop for you,

2298
02:52:21,931 --> 02:52:29,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Oftentimes, cars will fly around that car while people are in the intersection, and it's amazing that worse hasn't happened there, considering how dangerous this is.

2299
02:52:30,699 --> 02:52:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, during COVID times, there's even more people out walking, biking, getting to the fells.

2300
02:52:35,163 --> 02:52:39,186
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more people trying to get through these crosswalks, really to no avail.

2301
02:52:41,348 --> 02:52:50,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did see that on the traffic commission agenda for this week, there is a request for a slow for children sign at around at around those same crosswalks.

2302
02:52:51,038 --> 02:52:52,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously people are concerned about this.

2303
02:52:53,861 --> 02:52:57,025
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a high number of school kids trying to get to and from in the area.

2304
02:52:57,045 --> 02:52:57,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And

2305
02:52:58,586 --> 02:53:01,308
[SPEAKER_10]: not for nothing, I realize there's a deer crossing sign in that area.

2306
02:53:01,389 --> 02:53:05,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So all I can ask is if we've got a sign for deer, can we at least get a few signs for people?

2307
02:53:06,393 --> 02:53:10,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked to Todd and Tim about this.

2308
02:53:10,216 --> 02:53:23,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this entire intersection is something they want to work on, but I really think we need to do something in the interim to just get some signs up to let people know about the crosswalks that are there so people have a better chance of getting across safely.

2309
02:53:23,848 --> 02:53:25,069
[SPEAKER_10]: So I move approval.

2310
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:26,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

2311
02:53:26,627 --> 02:53:27,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2312
02:53:27,408 --> 02:53:27,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2313
02:53:27,708 --> 02:53:28,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morrell.

2314
02:53:28,329 --> 02:53:32,133
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Pierce, Councilor Knight.

2315
02:53:32,253 --> 02:53:41,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I thank the council for bringing this forward and there's another contributing factor to the dangerous intersection and that's our MBTA buses.

2316
02:53:42,330 --> 02:53:43,051
[SPEAKER_15]: at that location.

2317
02:53:43,091 --> 02:53:45,674
[SPEAKER_15]: And what happens is we'll have MBTA buses that come down.

2318
02:53:45,714 --> 02:53:46,355
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the terminus.

2319
02:53:46,375 --> 02:53:46,875
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the loop.

2320
02:53:47,436 --> 02:53:50,680
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where now the route ends and starts right in front of the cemetery.

2321
02:53:51,361 --> 02:54:00,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll see buses that come down and they stop on Winthrop Street right at the end of Place that Road, making it very difficult for cars.

2322
02:54:01,761 --> 02:54:06,569
[SPEAKER_15]: to come out of place that road, take a left or a left-hand turn to go down Route 38 into Winchester.

2323
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:09,554
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you're seeing is a lot of cat and mouse.

2324
02:54:10,055 --> 02:54:13,701
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're also seeing a lot of these buses that sit there for 10, 15, 20 minutes idling.

2325
02:54:16,921 --> 02:54:17,962
[SPEAKER_15]: abutting the woods.

2326
02:54:18,922 --> 02:54:20,763
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I think that's also a problem.

2327
02:54:20,783 --> 02:54:31,569
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the past, we've passed council resolutions asking them to not put the buses there, to move the buses to a different location, to line them up along, place that road if they're making the loop, but those have fallen on deaf ears, Mr. President.

2328
02:54:31,589 --> 02:54:32,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's not the contributing factor.

2329
02:54:33,670 --> 02:54:42,615
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to ask that we ask the traffic commission to review the location where the bus stop is and make recommendations to see if that's something we should move.

2330
02:54:42,635 --> 02:54:42,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2331
02:54:44,616 --> 02:54:45,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2332
02:54:45,416 --> 02:54:46,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2333
02:54:47,087 --> 02:54:47,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2334
02:54:47,808 --> 02:54:55,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank Councilor Knight for bringing that up because absolutely there is one bus that idles and creates a complete blind spot if you're trying to cross in one way.

2335
02:54:56,115 --> 02:55:07,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Then also buses make U-turns there, which I understand they need to turn around somewhere, but it creates a really unpredictable traffic patterns for cars and pedestrians alike.

2336
02:55:07,385 --> 02:55:09,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's a really dangerous area.

2337
02:55:09,668 --> 02:55:10,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank Councilor Knight for highlighting that.

2338
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:12,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2339
02:55:13,261 --> 02:55:18,945
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Behrs, and seconded by Councilor Nye, Clerk Ker-Gibbs, please call the roll.

2340
02:55:20,066 --> 02:55:20,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs?

2341
02:55:20,827 --> 02:55:21,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2342
02:55:21,487 --> 02:55:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Ker-Gibbs?

2343
02:55:22,408 --> 02:55:22,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2344
02:55:22,988 --> 02:55:23,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Nye?

2345
02:55:23,549 --> 02:55:23,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2346
02:55:24,049 --> 02:55:24,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

2347
02:55:24,749 --> 02:55:25,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2348
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:25,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell?

2349
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:26,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2350
02:55:26,571 --> 02:55:27,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Strunk-Kelly?

2351
02:55:27,411 --> 02:55:27,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2352
02:55:27,672 --> 02:55:28,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Fevella?

2353
02:55:28,672 --> 02:55:28,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2354
02:55:28,933 --> 02:55:32,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2355
02:55:32,595 --> 02:55:34,797
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-0-628 offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved.

2356
02:55:36,025 --> 02:55:43,473
[SPEAKER_14]: by the Medford City Council that the residents of Medford are encouraged to attend the MBTA public meeting on Thursday, November 12th at 6 p.m.

2357
02:55:44,094 --> 02:55:48,319
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom regarding service cuts and changes for our area Minuteman Region 2.

2358
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:55,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Registration link and additional information can be found at mbta.com forward slash events.

2359
02:55:56,968 --> 02:55:57,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs.

2360
02:55:57,948 --> 02:55:59,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2361
02:56:00,129 --> 02:56:06,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Due to the ongoing neglect of the state government, it's looking like public service cuts are coming down the line across the board.

2362
02:56:07,833 --> 02:56:13,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, not willing to tax the billionaires who made $17 billion since March.

2363
02:56:13,416 --> 02:56:20,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, we're going to start cutting bus routes in Medford and start not funding our public services, our public schools, our public colleges.

2364
02:56:21,381 --> 02:56:30,377
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a shame, but there is a public meeting this Thursday by Zoom regarding service cuts and service changes that are being proposed.

2365
02:56:31,159 --> 02:56:33,884
[SPEAKER_08]: There is also now, I believe, a map

2366
02:56:34,635 --> 02:56:39,959
[SPEAKER_08]: which can be downloaded into a list on the MBTA website of various service cuts.

2367
02:56:40,599 --> 02:56:47,664
[SPEAKER_08]: The MBTA is proposing completely cutting two bus routes in Medford, the 326 Express and the 710 bus in the Fulton Heights.

2368
02:56:48,224 --> 02:57:01,633
[SPEAKER_08]: The small bus is completely cut and also reducing service on every single bus route in the city and the commuter rails on both the Wellington side and on the West Medford station, reducing service on the Orange Line.

2369
02:57:02,170 --> 02:57:08,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows, probably reducing service before it's even started on the Green Line extension, which is just an absolute shame.

2370
02:57:10,435 --> 02:57:11,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a public meeting.

2371
02:57:11,736 --> 02:57:17,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage residents to attend this Thursday via Zoom to at least try to protest this issue.

2372
02:57:19,541 --> 02:57:26,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just an absolute shame and just absolute neglect by our state government that would

2373
02:57:26,818 --> 02:57:40,846
[SPEAKER_08]: impose these massive public service budget cuts at a time when most of us are hurting so badly, people need public transit to get to work, and at a time when the, you know, 20 richest people in the state are doing twice as good as they've ever done.

2374
02:57:41,126 --> 02:57:42,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage residents to

2375
02:57:44,433 --> 02:57:47,995
[SPEAKER_08]: try to do something about this, to speak up about it, to attend this meeting on Thursday.

2376
02:57:48,176 --> 02:57:49,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2377
02:57:49,216 --> 02:57:51,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2378
02:57:51,438 --> 02:57:52,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2379
02:57:52,739 --> 02:57:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2380
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:55,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring light to this.

2381
02:57:55,100 --> 02:58:07,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that after hearing the news this week, my plan was to hold a subcommittee meeting, talk to the president, and I know we're meeting next week with the DOT to talk about the

2382
02:58:12,492 --> 02:58:17,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Main Street and South Street intersection, and I will follow up with the meeting.

2383
02:58:17,675 --> 02:58:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many questions lately with the T right now, and now with the services being affected, I think we need to really get ahead of this right now.

2384
02:58:26,020 --> 02:58:35,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be asking the Council President to find some time for us, at least early December, for a subcommittee on transportation.

2385
02:58:35,885 --> 02:58:38,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you again, Council Bias.

2386
02:58:39,827 --> 02:58:40,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpa.

2387
02:58:41,748 --> 02:58:42,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Layton.

2388
02:58:42,729 --> 02:58:46,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, much like the airplane noise, they're not going to listen to us.

2389
02:58:46,851 --> 02:58:47,931
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to listen to the residents.

2390
02:58:48,772 --> 02:58:51,053
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I got two words for you.

2391
02:58:51,253 --> 02:58:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Robocall.

2392
02:58:52,134 --> 02:58:57,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it might make sense for us to ask the administration to do a robocall alerting residents of this meeting.

2393
02:58:57,777 --> 02:59:03,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of us have transitioned from working in the city and relying on public transit to working at home.

2394
02:59:03,500 --> 02:59:07,002
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's going to be a day where we all have to go back, and when we do have to go back,

2395
02:59:07,702 --> 02:59:12,123
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we should have a quality service, the service that our assessments reflect.

2396
02:59:12,803 --> 02:59:16,044
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I'd ask that a robo-call be made as part of this paper.

2397
02:59:16,364 --> 02:59:16,624
Thank you.

2398
02:59:16,664 --> 02:59:18,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, Councilor Behrs.

2399
02:59:18,284 --> 02:59:21,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may, Councilor Knight just brings up an essential point.

2400
02:59:21,645 --> 02:59:24,145
[SPEAKER_08]: These are not things that can be easily replaced once they're gone.

2401
02:59:24,725 --> 02:59:26,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Once they're gone, they're not coming back quickly.

2402
02:59:26,706 --> 02:59:29,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll take months, if not years, if ever, to get them back.

2403
02:59:30,287 --> 02:59:32,587
[SPEAKER_08]: We know what happens when service gets cut on the MBTA.

2404
02:59:33,111 --> 02:59:37,373
[SPEAKER_08]: It never comes back, so thank you, Councilor Knight, and thank you to all my colleagues.

2405
02:59:38,214 --> 02:59:41,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, thank you, Councilor Pierce, Vice President Carvillo.

2406
02:59:41,656 --> 02:59:42,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2407
02:59:43,137 --> 02:59:55,984
[SPEAKER_11]: President, we have one of the highest assessments in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the T. I would hope that if there's going to be cuts, I would hope that our contribution to the T also gets reduced.

2408
02:59:57,152 --> 03:00:04,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, every time we turn around, they're hitting us for more money, and more money, and more money, and not providing the service that they were promised.

2409
03:00:05,195 --> 03:00:12,078
[SPEAKER_11]: If cuts are made, I would hope that our contribution also gets cut, what we pay.

2410
03:00:12,438 --> 03:00:21,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think we're the fourth or fifth highest payer to the T. Vice President Caviello, good point, and you are 100% correct.

2411
03:00:23,553 --> 03:00:25,355
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a very important issue.

2412
03:00:25,375 --> 03:00:32,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs, I thank you for bringing it forward, especially if you look at somewhere like North Bedford, Fulton Heights, the 710 bus.

2413
03:00:33,444 --> 03:00:40,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Once that goes away, that means North Bedford is pretty much not serviced by any type of public transportation, which is unfortunate.

2414
03:00:40,731 --> 03:00:42,492
[SPEAKER_14]: because people do actually use that bus.

2415
03:00:43,113 --> 03:00:45,034
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

2416
03:00:45,774 --> 03:00:52,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, great idea with regard to the robo call because people need to get involved and they need to rally around this.

2417
03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:53,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

2418
03:00:54,219 --> 03:00:54,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

2419
03:00:55,785 --> 03:00:56,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2420
03:00:56,625 --> 03:00:59,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank Councilor Bierce for bringing this up.

2421
03:00:59,566 --> 03:01:06,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's no secret the MBTA, even before COVID, has been trying to cut service for years, Mr. President.

2422
03:01:06,768 --> 03:01:16,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for an agency that's responsible for public transportation, I've never met a group of people that are looking to cut services constantly.

2423
03:01:17,030 --> 03:01:21,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can appreciate they're dealing with the budget and so forth, never ending.

2424
03:01:22,191 --> 03:01:24,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just read an article that

2425
03:01:24,952 --> 03:01:27,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating dedicated bus lanes.

2426
03:01:27,894 --> 03:01:30,176
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating rapid busing.

2427
03:01:31,517 --> 03:01:35,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the same breath, we're cutting bus service.

2428
03:01:35,960 --> 03:01:36,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it make any sense?

2429
03:01:37,841 --> 03:01:38,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes zero sense.

2430
03:01:40,623 --> 03:01:44,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And COVID, we've been dealing with COVID since March.

2431
03:01:45,206 --> 03:01:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now November.

2432
03:01:47,487 --> 03:01:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wait, what, seven months to figure out that bus service ridership is down?

2433
03:01:55,125 --> 03:02:02,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It took them seven months to figure that out, and now they want to make these draconian cuts across the board.

2434
03:02:02,213 --> 03:02:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching the news tonight, they're cutting ferry service for the salt shore.

2435
03:02:06,277 --> 03:02:10,101
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cutting across the board some deep, impacting cuts.

2436
03:02:10,601 --> 03:02:15,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Councilor Beals mentioned, once it's gone, it's going to be very hard to get it back.

2437
03:02:16,885 --> 03:02:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: The 326 and the 325, as you know, Mr. President, those are vital lines that take residents into town, vital to this community.

2438
03:02:28,613 --> 03:02:31,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And always constantly on the chopping block.

2439
03:02:31,114 --> 03:02:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of the other routes have been subject to cuts.

2440
03:02:36,378 --> 03:02:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: But those particular lines, for some reason, and you pay through the nose to get on them, those are always the first they want to chop.

2441
03:02:45,625 --> 03:02:57,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a problem with overabundance of people on those routes, because they were cutting the routes and the limit of the capacity on the bus would be 50 or 60 people.

2442
03:02:57,037 --> 03:02:59,079
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 80 or 90 people on the bus.

2443
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:02,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a cartoon you were hanging out the window to take a bus ride.

2444
03:03:05,740 --> 03:03:11,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we finally figured it out that they had to add some more roots on there.

2445
03:03:11,987 --> 03:03:13,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did, Mr. President.

2446
03:03:13,849 --> 03:03:15,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ridership was there.

2447
03:03:15,370 --> 03:03:17,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Then COVID kicked in, the ridership's not there.

2448
03:03:17,993 --> 03:03:18,834
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's gonna come back.

2449
03:03:18,914 --> 03:03:20,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this is temporary.

2450
03:03:20,436 --> 03:03:25,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what, everything I've read they're saying, I don't know if it's just PR, that this is gonna be temporary.

2451
03:03:27,037 --> 03:03:29,158
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a tough time believing that, Mr. President.

2452
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:31,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope a lot of residents get on there.

2453
03:03:31,180 --> 03:03:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling when I deal with the MBTA.

2454
03:03:35,503 --> 03:03:36,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

2455
03:03:37,104 --> 03:03:38,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their way or the highway.

2456
03:03:38,845 --> 03:03:39,666
[SPEAKER_03]: No pun intended.

2457
03:03:40,126 --> 03:03:42,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny, though.

2458
03:03:42,928 --> 03:03:45,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just the highway, right?

2459
03:03:46,429 --> 03:03:47,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2460
03:03:47,310 --> 03:03:47,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2461
03:03:47,770 --> 03:03:49,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Moxley, I agree with you 100%.

2462
03:03:49,892 --> 03:03:54,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've talked about this many times, especially with regard to the 325 and 326.

2463
03:03:55,857 --> 03:03:58,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Those bus routes were more popular than ever.

2464
03:03:59,460 --> 03:04:00,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were still trying to cut them.

2465
03:04:00,922 --> 03:04:02,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And here they are, they cut them.

2466
03:04:03,224 --> 03:04:04,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beasley, you're 100% right.

2467
03:04:05,946 --> 03:04:07,647
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to fight tooth and nail to get them back.

2468
03:04:08,568 --> 03:04:12,532
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, hopefully people will get on the call.

2469
03:04:13,092 --> 03:04:21,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully that will help, but from watching the news tonight, as you said, Councilor Moxley, and I watched it before it came down to City Hall tonight, it's drastic.

2470
03:04:22,037 --> 03:04:23,657
[SPEAKER_14]: They're cutting everything, it seems like.

2471
03:04:23,718 --> 03:04:27,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll have to keep an eye on that, but hopefully residents will tune in.

2472
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:30,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor Behrs, thank you for bringing this forward.

2473
03:04:31,021 --> 03:04:33,342
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

2474
03:04:34,703 --> 03:04:35,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

2475
03:04:37,184 --> 03:04:39,486
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Knight.

2476
03:04:40,406 --> 03:04:42,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one more thing, and I just want to make this point.

2477
03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:46,341
[SPEAKER_08]: The T is making these cuts over $142 million loss.

2478
03:04:47,481 --> 03:04:51,642
[SPEAKER_08]: The 18 billionaires in the state have made $17 billion since March.

2479
03:04:52,782 --> 03:04:55,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make that stark point clear.

2480
03:04:56,522 --> 03:04:58,683
[SPEAKER_08]: We're worth less than those billionaires.

2481
03:04:58,843 --> 03:05:02,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what the MBTA and the government, the state government is saying.

2482
03:05:02,603 --> 03:05:03,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make that clear.

2483
03:05:04,624 --> 03:05:05,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2484
03:05:06,344 --> 03:05:11,865
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Night, Clerk Herderby, please call the roll.

2485
03:05:13,156 --> 03:05:13,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2486
03:05:14,356 --> 03:05:16,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2487
03:05:16,137 --> 03:05:17,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2488
03:05:17,357 --> 03:05:17,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2489
03:05:18,617 --> 03:05:18,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2490
03:05:19,857 --> 03:05:20,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2491
03:05:21,237 --> 03:05:21,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2492
03:05:21,457 --> 03:05:22,178
[SPEAKER_14]: 70 affirmative.

2493
03:05:22,198 --> 03:05:22,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero.

2494
03:05:22,438 --> 03:05:22,798
[SPEAKER_14]: The negative.

2495
03:05:22,818 --> 03:05:40,721
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes two zero dash six, two nine offered by council appears to be resolved by the method city council that Tufts university remove construction materials from the sidewalks on college Avenue and keep all Jersey barriers in a consistent and stationary position to avoid encroachment on travel lanes and sidewalks.

2496
03:05:41,952 --> 03:05:56,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that Tufts University adjust the placement of the construction sign in front of the Tisch Gantt Center so it is not blocking the sidewalk, consulting with City of Memphis staff or Greenline Extension project staff if necessary.

2497
03:05:56,881 --> 03:06:10,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that Tufts University create and share a policy for contractors and construction partners to ensure unencumbered access to sidewalks and to store construction materials on Tufts property, not on public property,

2498
03:06:11,410 --> 03:06:12,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Pierce.

2499
03:06:12,530 --> 03:06:13,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2500
03:06:13,611 --> 03:06:20,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's sidewalk night down here, and we're trying to make sure that sidewalks are safe and clear for residents.

2501
03:06:21,333 --> 03:06:25,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone knows all the construction that's going on down by Tufts University.

2502
03:06:25,534 --> 03:06:32,537
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of different projects, a lot of different agencies, and a lot of materials out there, sidewalks, Jersey barriers, et cetera.

2503
03:06:33,697 --> 03:06:39,939
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a constant issue for area residents who are dealing with changes week to week, day to day, and seemingly

2504
03:06:40,799 --> 03:06:41,499
[SPEAKER_08]: without end.

2505
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:45,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke with Tim McGivern, who is going to work out any issues.

2506
03:06:46,522 --> 03:06:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: He, apparently it is his job to work out these issues between the various contractors, which I appreciate.

2507
03:06:54,106 --> 03:06:56,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's going to do that on this specific case.

2508
03:06:56,447 --> 03:07:01,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tufts, I spoke with Rocco DiRico at Tufts, and he assures me that all of their materials are stored on Tufts property.

2509
03:07:02,571 --> 03:07:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents have sent me images of various materials that are clearly changing the sidewalk.

2510
03:07:07,553 --> 03:07:08,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the big issues here,

2511
03:07:09,293 --> 03:07:17,579
[SPEAKER_08]: is that contractors keep moving barriers and other kind of, essentially, the Jersey barriers are moved six inches one day, six inches the next day.

2512
03:07:17,619 --> 03:07:21,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And suddenly, more of the street is blocked off, more of the sidewalk is blocked off.

2513
03:07:22,682 --> 03:07:33,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be very helpful if we could get rid of some of this constant back and forth, where residents are seeing they'll complain and things will go back.

2514
03:07:33,730 --> 03:07:35,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a week later, things have moved back out again.

2515
03:07:37,724 --> 03:07:51,919
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hopeful that some of these immediate issues will be addressed, but it would be very helpful if folks in that area could work together and make sure there's a policy where sidewalks aren't being blocked for these various construction projects.

2516
03:07:53,547 --> 03:07:56,128
[SPEAKER_08]: because we do have issues with pedestrian access in the area.

2517
03:07:56,408 --> 03:07:57,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2518
03:07:57,689 --> 03:07:58,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Ferris.

2519
03:07:58,809 --> 03:07:59,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

2520
03:07:59,689 --> 03:08:01,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I certainly support the paper.

2521
03:08:01,650 --> 03:08:20,718
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if we think back to, oh, was it about a year ago where this council stood up and fought to ensure that Tufts University and the related construction crews were not staging materials on the field behind Nolwood Road in College Ave.

2522
03:08:21,618 --> 03:08:27,101
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a big point of contention when they wanted to create a whole staging area for the whole entire construction project over there.

2523
03:08:27,121 --> 03:08:39,088
[SPEAKER_15]: And as a compromise, Tufts University agreed to set up the staging areas where they have down closer to the end of College Avenue at the intersection of Boston Avenue, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President.

2524
03:08:39,128 --> 03:08:48,093
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to be clear that a yes vote for this paper in no way, shape, or form changes my position that that field should not be used for a staging area.

2525
03:08:48,433 --> 03:08:50,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think that that's the will of this council either.

2526
03:08:50,953 --> 03:08:57,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want that to be very clear that the council isn't saying, hey, listen, I know you have all this land back there, so use it.

2527
03:08:57,695 --> 03:09:00,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we've specifically asked them in the past not to.

2528
03:09:01,876 --> 03:09:04,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may, definitely not the intent.

2529
03:09:04,416 --> 03:09:08,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Tufts keeps assuring me that they already are storing everything on Tufts property.

2530
03:09:10,497 --> 03:09:14,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe it is just GLX and some other projects, but

2531
03:09:15,703 --> 03:09:18,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it doesn't seem like it to me, at least from the photos that I'm getting.

2532
03:09:18,944 --> 03:09:26,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So not the intent to use open fields for this, but just have them commit to their commitment to make sure that these sidewalks are accessible.

2533
03:09:28,547 --> 03:09:29,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

2534
03:09:30,168 --> 03:09:30,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2535
03:09:30,828 --> 03:09:34,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a motion of Councilor Pierce, seconded by Councilor Knight.

03:13:21,073 --> 03:13:21,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Hoyt.

2630
03:13:22,093 --> 03:13:23,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2631
03:13:23,834 --> 03:13:25,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy anniversary to the Crotty's.

2632
03:13:25,474 --> 03:13:27,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, that's a great presentation.

2633
03:13:28,035 --> 03:13:34,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Growing up in West Medford, you know, the Crotty's house was one of those houses as a kid you knew you could always go to.

2634
03:13:34,057 --> 03:13:41,239
[SPEAKER_15]: If you needed a drink of water, you were hungry, you had to go to the bathroom, you were late to go home, and you needed to use the phone to call your parents, the Crotty's had an open door policy.

2635
03:13:41,859 --> 03:13:49,041
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember fondly the days of playing stickball down at the Gleason School, and Mr. Crotty coming down, making sure we're all set, bringing us extra tennis balls and waters.

2636
03:13:50,081 --> 03:13:54,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a great family and I had the great privilege and pleasure of growing up with Jason and Janelle.

2637
03:13:54,967 --> 03:13:57,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent a lot of time in that house as a child.

2638
03:13:57,490 --> 03:14:05,318
[SPEAKER_15]: And to think back now, when I was ten years old, running around in that house some 30 years ago, they were married for 20 years.

2639
03:14:05,419 --> 03:14:07,141
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just amazing to me, Mr. President.

2640
03:14:08,121 --> 03:14:10,684
[SPEAKER_15]: think about now that I'm here married ten years.

2641
03:14:11,164 --> 03:14:14,186
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were already married 20 before I could even think about it.

2642
03:14:14,727 --> 03:14:15,267
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing.

2643
03:14:15,347 --> 03:14:18,029
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to wish Mr. and Mrs. Crotty the best of luck.

2644
03:14:18,690 --> 03:14:21,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulate them on 50 years and wish them 50 more.

2645
03:14:22,333 --> 03:14:26,696
[SPEAKER_15]: And like Councilman Locke said, Marianne Howell is Mrs. Crotty's twin sister.

2646
03:14:28,758 --> 03:14:29,679
[SPEAKER_15]: They all go together.

2647
03:14:29,879 --> 03:14:33,522
[SPEAKER_15]: We lost her husband Tom a few years back and this council paid tribute.

2648
03:14:33,862 --> 03:14:39,807
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, Mr. President, congratulations to Ron and Joanne on 50 years.

2649
03:14:40,487 --> 03:14:41,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

2650
03:14:41,909 --> 03:14:42,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President, carry on.

2651
03:14:42,829 --> 03:14:43,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2652
03:14:43,630 --> 03:14:46,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank my two counselors for bringing this forward.

2653
03:14:47,053 --> 03:14:50,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I have known the Crowley's for many years, the little league fields with their kids.

2654
03:14:51,636 --> 03:14:53,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Good family, always running, see them everywhere.

2655
03:14:53,638 --> 03:14:57,621
[SPEAKER_11]: 50 years, I hope I'm only five behind them.

2656
03:14:58,602 --> 03:15:02,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to congratulate them on their 50th anniversary.

2657
03:15:02,948 --> 03:15:04,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

2658
03:15:04,970 --> 03:15:07,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to the cronies on the 50th anniversary.

2659
03:15:07,693 --> 03:15:11,658
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Marks and Councilor Nights.

2660
03:15:11,678 --> 03:15:14,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Vice President Carviello.

2661
03:15:15,022 --> 03:15:15,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Please call the roll.

2662
03:15:17,184 --> 03:15:17,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2663
03:15:17,364 --> 03:15:17,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2664
03:15:17,504 --> 03:15:17,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2665
03:15:18,165 --> 03:15:18,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2666
03:15:23,238 --> 03:15:23,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2667
03:15:24,559 --> 03:15:24,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2668
03:15:25,699 --> 03:15:25,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2669
03:15:26,219 --> 03:15:26,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Senator the affirmative.

2670
03:15:26,980 --> 03:15:27,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero in the negative.

2671
03:15:27,580 --> 03:15:28,501
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

2672
03:15:29,141 --> 03:15:33,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next resolution that is on the suspension is offered by vice-president Caviello.

2673
03:15:33,783 --> 03:15:41,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Memphis city council ask the Medford police to look into overnight parking of tractor trailer vehicles on commercial street.

2674
03:15:42,418 --> 03:15:43,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2675
03:15:43,079 --> 03:15:48,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think in the last year, we are now the tractor trailer parking capital of the state.

2676
03:15:50,108 --> 03:15:55,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Commercial Street, which used to have one or two trucks parked there, is now lined.

2677
03:15:56,188 --> 03:16:06,338
[SPEAKER_11]: We had tractor trailers, every day, every, it's to the point where they're now a disturbance to the businesses that are over there.

2678
03:16:06,658 --> 03:16:10,142
[SPEAKER_11]: The tractor trailers are parking on Route 16, all along the city yet.

2679
03:16:10,462 --> 03:16:14,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're parking on the grass and back of the city yet.

2680
03:16:15,980 --> 03:16:26,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these guys with these stripes, I don't know if they live in Medford, if they're based in Medford, but it's about time that they're going to have to find a place to park and pay like other people do.

2681
03:16:27,014 --> 03:16:29,817
[SPEAKER_11]: We're out there tagging the Johnny Diploma.

2682
03:16:30,748 --> 03:16:35,072
[SPEAKER_11]: who parks his plumbing truck on the street and he's getting hit with overnight tickets.

2683
03:16:35,713 --> 03:16:37,655
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's good for one and it's good for another.

2684
03:16:39,337 --> 03:16:41,839
[SPEAKER_11]: These trucks are just, they're overwhelming our city now.

2685
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:47,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about time they find a place to park and not on our streets, Mr. President.

2686
03:16:47,708 --> 03:16:49,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

2687
03:16:50,090 --> 03:16:50,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good night.

2688
03:16:50,530 --> 03:16:51,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2689
03:16:51,351 --> 03:16:52,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2690
03:16:52,492 --> 03:16:59,337
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that a lot of these people that drive these trucks are actually still in the trucks when they're parked.

2691
03:16:59,357 --> 03:16:59,798
[SPEAKER_15]: They're sleeping.

2692
03:17:00,338 --> 03:17:00,838
[SPEAKER_15]: They're sleeping.

2693
03:17:01,259 --> 03:17:05,802
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're long haul truckers that are delivering foodstuff and products across America.

2694
03:17:06,363 --> 03:17:10,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they find a nice place to park, they're going to park, and they're going to sleep, and they're going to catch their rest.

2695
03:17:10,826 --> 03:17:14,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And we want them all to be well rested, but at the same time, not at a detriment to the quality of life in our community.

2696
03:17:15,550 --> 03:17:17,831
[SPEAKER_15]: What Councilor Caviello is saying is absolutely correct.

2697
03:17:17,851 --> 03:17:23,335
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen an increase, an inordinate increase in the number of trucks that are parked on our public roadways, and it's something that needs to be addressed.

2698
03:17:24,195 --> 03:17:29,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Mox has always had a great idea, and that idea was the trucking unit with the police department.

2699
03:17:30,319 --> 03:17:34,861
[SPEAKER_15]: The command of the weight and the size of the trucks that are riding on our public streets, as well as do some enforcement issues like that.

2700
03:17:34,881 --> 03:17:37,823
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's something that we should revisit, but I thank the council for bringing this forward.

2701
03:17:37,945 --> 03:17:38,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2702
03:17:38,765 --> 03:17:40,827
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caviello.

2703
03:17:41,047 --> 03:17:41,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2704
03:17:42,288 --> 03:17:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2705
03:17:42,968 --> 03:17:45,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Caviello for bringing this up.

2706
03:17:46,570 --> 03:17:50,993
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue on Commercial Street has been brought up for the last couple of years.

2707
03:17:51,693 --> 03:17:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe there was a sign put up back about two years ago.

2708
03:17:56,816 --> 03:17:57,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It says no idling.

2709
03:17:58,477 --> 03:18:02,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So the trucks used to park there and idle for hours and hours and hours, so they stopped the idling.

2710
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:16,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're going to stop and shop and come out the commercial street entrance, it is such a dangerous area now because they park the 18 wheelers and you have to literally inch, inch, inch, otherwise you're going to get in a horrific accident.

2711
03:18:17,049 --> 03:18:17,870
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really bad.

2712
03:18:19,851 --> 03:18:27,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at the very least that this should be sent to our traffic division to have them take a look, Mr. President.

2713
03:18:28,017 --> 03:18:31,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how other communities do it, but maybe we can get creative.

2714
03:18:32,140 --> 03:18:42,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And if these truckers want to park for hours in a particular area and take up spots that are not one car spot, two cars, but ten car spots.

2715
03:18:42,987 --> 03:18:50,750
[SPEAKER_03]: in a particular area, maybe we should charge them so and maybe have areas on these streets that offer trucks.

2716
03:18:51,350 --> 03:18:59,233
[SPEAKER_03]: because as Councilor Knight mentioned, these truckers keep logs and they have to be off the road a certain amount of hours and so forth.

2717
03:18:59,533 --> 03:19:04,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't want to encourage truckers to not get their rest, they need their rest.

2718
03:19:04,955 --> 03:19:13,440
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe we should come up with creative ways that we allow a certain number of them in areas that are conducive to this and charge them at the same time, Mr. President.

2719
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have to go put meters in the kiosk when I'm in the square, why can a trucker stay there for 12 hours on Commercial Street?

2720
03:19:22,265 --> 03:19:23,405
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're delivering something?

2721
03:19:23,725 --> 03:19:24,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

2722
03:19:25,746 --> 03:19:26,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge them.

2723
03:19:27,928 --> 03:19:28,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

2724
03:19:30,009 --> 03:19:30,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

2725
03:19:30,709 --> 03:19:31,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Charge them.

2726
03:19:32,799 --> 03:19:33,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2727
03:19:33,499 --> 03:19:35,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2728
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:38,022
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by?

2729
03:19:38,262 --> 03:19:38,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

2730
03:19:39,122 --> 03:19:41,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Behrs, Clerk Hertovich, please call the roll.

2731
03:19:44,645 --> 03:19:45,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs?

2732
03:19:45,285 --> 03:19:45,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2733
03:19:46,065 --> 03:19:46,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Carviello?

2734
03:19:46,966 --> 03:19:47,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2735
03:19:47,486 --> 03:19:47,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Ntuk?

2736
03:19:48,006 --> 03:19:48,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2737
03:19:48,427 --> 03:19:48,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

2738
03:19:49,307 --> 03:19:49,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2739
03:19:49,947 --> 03:19:50,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morales?

2740
03:19:50,708 --> 03:19:50,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2741
03:19:51,068 --> 03:19:51,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2742
03:19:52,028 --> 03:19:52,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2743
03:19:53,389 --> 03:19:55,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2744
03:19:55,190 --> 03:19:56,110
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

2745
03:19:56,691 --> 03:19:59,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we adjourn, I'm going to recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

2746
03:19:59,917 --> 03:20:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

2747
03:20:01,239 --> 03:20:11,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Council Member Mox helped me point out, we had communications to the Mayor from City Solicitor Kim Scanlon.

2748
03:20:12,150 --> 03:20:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The question that Councilor Scanlon had

2749
03:20:15,593 --> 03:20:19,235
[SPEAKER_04]: is at its regular scheduled meeting on October 6th.

2750
03:20:19,295 --> 03:20:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford City Council requested the city solicitor give the city council an opinion on dealing with open meeting law violations for overcrowding due to fire department protocol on maximum capacity dealing with city council chambers.

2751
03:20:34,182 --> 03:20:36,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said that the question wasn't clear.

2752
03:20:36,884 --> 03:20:42,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I could just clear up the question to the city clerk to get back to the city solicitor.

2753
03:20:43,027 --> 03:20:44,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The question dealing with

2754
03:20:45,880 --> 03:20:53,942
[SPEAKER_04]: opening the council chambers for regular meetings during COVID in relation to the maximum number of people.

2755
03:20:54,382 --> 03:21:07,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, what is the opinion of the city solicitor if we reached maximum capacity with rules to the fire department for overcapacity?

2756
03:21:08,425 --> 03:21:10,385
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that affect the open meeting law?

2757
03:21:13,278 --> 03:21:29,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the same scenario, if we put a number to the availability of the chambers using the six feet and so on and so forth, and post that, and we reach capacity, how does that

2758
03:21:30,746 --> 03:21:32,467
[SPEAKER_04]: affect the open meeting law.

2759
03:21:32,507 --> 03:21:43,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that the city, the public health director has requested that I put together a plan.

2760
03:21:44,231 --> 03:21:47,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still waiting for some information from her.

2761
03:21:48,492 --> 03:21:50,174
[SPEAKER_04]: to put that plan together.

2762
03:21:50,794 --> 03:21:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully City Solicitor Scanlon can get us this information.

2763
03:21:57,719 --> 03:22:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: The good news is they waited long enough that the vaccine looks very promising.

2764
03:22:04,204 --> 03:22:06,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So not to make light of it, I'm really excited about it.

2765
03:22:06,626 --> 03:22:10,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're in a good place.

2766
03:22:10,109 --> 03:22:12,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are moving forward, hopefully with the

2767
03:22:15,758 --> 03:22:34,350
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with these protocols put in place, I still, um, you know, we still have to find a way to open these chambers and obviously with the, the spike, um, making sure that we're doing it, um, thoroughly and, um, making sure that public health is number one priority.
