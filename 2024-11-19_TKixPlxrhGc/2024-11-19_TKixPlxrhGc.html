    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=147.55s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=148.13s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=149.192s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=156.536s">Yes,</a>  78 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=157.917s">7</a>  in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=159.398s">0</a>  opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=160.958s">The</a>  rules are suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=162.259s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=163.039s">Mr.</a>  President, I offer this paper this evening to suspend the rules so that we can take up paper 20559, paper 20634, and 20635, relative to the finances of the city of Medford and appropriations thereof.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=178.388s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=179.028s">Councilor</a>  Knight, you said the 20559? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=180.369s">Yes,</a>  followed by 20634 and 635.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=181.83s">OK,</a>  634, 635.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=196.286s">20-559</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=198.627s">Update</a>  on the current fiscal circumstances and projections following the close of the first quarter of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=205.872s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=207.111s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, this was a paper that the council had kicked around for some time during our budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=211.795s">We</a>  talked about how it would be a good idea for us to get quarterly updates as to where we were in terms of our financial stability, our projections, and whether or not we're meeting, exceeding, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=223.123s">So</a>  I had the opportunity to speak with our finance director this afternoon, and she is prepared to join us this evening and present us with a presentation where we stand three months into the fiscal year after the passage of our budget at the close of the month of June.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=235.994s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=237.115s">So</a>  we have Aleesha Nunley with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=240.477s">Alicia.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=241.959s">Good</a>  evening, Honorable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=244.08s">I'm</a>  here tonight to present Q1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=246.222s">If</a>  you could please unmute Dave Rodriguez as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=248.704s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=250.926s">The</a>  Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=258.651s">If</a>  you could please allow me to share my screen to show a presentation to the Council and the public.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=265.847s">One</a>  minute, we're gonna take care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=271.397s">Okay,</a>  you should be able to share your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=274.562s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=303.092s">Can</a>  everyone see my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=304.832s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=305.933s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=306.993s">So</a>  for Q1, the city is meeting its target revenue estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=312.674s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=313.374s">I</a>  keep hearing some kind of ruffling when I'm speaking.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=322.136s">Can</a>  you hear it now?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=324.557s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=325.697s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=340.544s">Should</a>  I just go through it, even if it's doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=345.748s">Okay,</a>  so the city's meeting its target revenue estimates for the year, just minimize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=354.055s">As</a>  you can see, there's a graph of the Q1 local receipts, budget versus actual. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=358.919s">You</a>  can see the motor vehicle excise tax, which is the blue column for my estimate and the fiscal year 21 actuals in the orange column. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=367.788s">Penalties</a>  and interest is actually up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=370.289s">Pilots</a>  are where we expect them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=373.43s">Hotel</a>  excise is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=375.41s">Local</a>  meals tax is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=377.511s">This</a>  is the first time we've gotten a community impact fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=380.612s">It's</a>  extremely small. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=383.153s">So</a>  I didn't budget for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=384.874s">It's</a>  the very first payment we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=386.534s">That's</a>  going to be on the next screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=389.923s">Rentals,</a>  departmental revenue, license and permits is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=395.007s">Medicaid</a>  doesn't come in until Q2. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=398.609s">Fines,</a>  investment income, and miscellaneous are the last categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=403.873s">I</a>  just want to note that for Q1 CARES Act funds couldn't be used as a revenue offset, and no more federal stimulus is at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=412.259s">And</a>  the city conservatively estimated a 10% cut to locally, but fortunately the governor committed to level fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=421.125s">On</a>  this slide, you're going to see what we budgeted for Q1 for motor vehicle excise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=426.427s">These</a>  are all our local receipts, penalties and interest, pilots, hotel excise, local meals tax, community impact fee, which was really small, which is the only $224.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=436.691s">Our</a>  fees budgeted at a million for this quarter 250,000 rentals, departmental revenue, license and permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=446.789s">Medicaid,</a>  which doesn't come in yet until Q2, fines, investment income, and miscellaneous revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=452.749s">So</a>  the 31st one budgeted, the Q1 budgeted estimate for motor vehicle is 667,826. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=458.112s">And</a>  we got in 637,713. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=461.094s">And</a>  to the far right, I also included a column for fiscal year 20 Q1 actual. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=467.558s">So</a>  you could actually see what we collected the year before just so you can have a comparison between last year and this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=476.884s">Boat</a>  excise, we estimate 153. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=478.625s">We</a>  got 153 penalties and interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=483.033s">875,</a>  we got 118, 313. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=483.754s">Pilots,</a>  450. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=484.174s">We</a>  got the 450. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=484.614s">Hotel</a>  excise tax, we cut down to 75,000 for our estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=488.678s">We</a>  actually got in 89,638.95. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=490.5s">Local</a>  meals tax, we estimated 183, 375. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=491.841s">We</a>  got in 194, 875. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=506.046s">Skip</a>  over community impact fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=507.547s">So</a>  for the fees, we estimated 250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=508.808s">We</a>  actually got in 370,221. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=509.488s">For</a>  rentals, 1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=510.068s">We</a>  got 1,615. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=510.629s">For</a>  departmental revenue, we budgeted 156,890. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=512.009s">We</a>  received 153,545. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=513.77s">For</a>  license and permits, 565,862. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=514.411s">We</a>  received 568,491. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=514.891s">For</a>  fines, 31,250. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=533.895s">We</a>  got $8,416, so that is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=536.617s">Investment</a>  income, we estimated $96,250. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=538.239s">We</a>  received $6577, so that was actually down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=540.321s">And</a>  miscellaneous revenue, $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=541.542s">We</a>  only have $8,000, so that was down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=542.963s">But</a>  overall, our estimate for Q1 was $2,615,606. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=544.184s">We</a>  received $2,662,642. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=561.539s">On</a>  this slide, we're just showing you the preliminary 2021 cherry sheet receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=566.46s">This</a>  is what has passed through the House Way and Means Proposal so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=571.361s">We</a>  had estimated a 10% cut to chapter 70, but as I stated previously, the governor decided to commit to local fund of what we had in fiscal year 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=579.643s">So</a>  you can see that 12,000,143,306. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=580.523s">A</a>  charter tuition, 1,000,195,940. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=589.244s">Unrestricted</a>  government aid, also known as UGA, 12,880,443. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=591.205s">Veterans</a>  benefits at 85,611. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=592.006s">Elderly</a>  exemptions, VBS, 154,310. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=592.966s">State</a>  only, 52,728. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=593.326s">Public</a>  libraries, 69,107. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=594.007s">So</a>  total estimated receipts at 26,581,445. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=616.937s">Here</a>  are the assessments to those local receipts, local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=620.74s">$20,303</a>  for air pollution. <a

quickly, what we budgeted versus our preliminary local aid summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=667.586s">So</a>  the difference in chapter 70, that 1,000,089,537, you're on a little lottery program back to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=674.654s">UGA,</a>  we budgeted $11,000,916,986. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=676.235s">We're</a>  actually going to get $12,880,443, a difference of $963,457. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=677.555s">Tonight,</a>  we have a paper that's reprogramming $740,000 back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=679.876s">And</a>  in other receipts, $1,031,317 budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=680.956s">Preliminary,</a>  we see $1,557,696, but that's subject to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=707.088s">We're</a>  going to go over the CARES Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=712.713s">So</a>  citizens across the United States receive stimulus checks to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=718.378s">Unfortunately,</a>  cities and towns were not given a revenue stimulus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=721.26s">Instead,</a>  the city was awarded funds that must be expended only on COVID-19 eligible expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=727.005s">Cities</a>  and towns have revenue issues and no stimulus package has been announced nor an extension on the CARES funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=734.113s">The</a>  CARES Act was awarded May 14th, 2020, and will end on December 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=739.936s">The</a>  city has charged 75% of COVID related expenses to FEMA and 25% to CARES. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=747.059s">The</a>  city is awaiting from FEMA what expenses were deemed ineligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=750.301s">It</a>  must be 100% CARES Act funded. <a

href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=766.176s">We</a>  had encumbered 65,756.22 and expended 132,155.03. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=767.217s">This</a>  number is reflective of 25% of the COVID-19 FEMA eligible expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=770.159s">In</a>  fiscal year 21, the city has encumbered 1,00,507,939.05 and expended 496,271.89. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=771.56s">The</a>  schools in the city will be using the remaining 2.5 to 2.9 million <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=795.528s">for</a>  HVAC, PPE, additional personnel and backfill, and various other COVID-19 related expenses until December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=805.176s">Some</a>  of those other related expenses include food pantry expenses, additional voting expenses that were allowable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=813.282s">FEMA</a>  doesn't have an expiration or an award total. <a

href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=838.142s">The</a>  FEMA funds were drawn down on October 15th, and we haven't heard back from the Fed yet, and there's additional amounts of money that I still need to reclass, but I'm in the middle of the close, that's actually gonna go to FEMA and CARES for back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=856.905s">Enterprise</a>  fund fiscal year 21 revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=858.646s">For</a>  fiscal year 21, we budgeted $26,351,329. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=859.926s">And</a>  for the Q1, we budgeted $5,616,207. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=861.226s">Fiscal</a>  year 20 budget was $26,232,490. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=876.855s">And</a>  last year, we received $5,115,441.39. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=878.176s">And</a>  if you look at the percentages between the two, we're actually right on target for Q1 for our revenues for the Enterprise Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=886.919s">I</a>  don't know if you want me to go down category by category. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=891.081s">I'd</a>  be happy to if you want me to, or if you're OK with just an overall summary.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=894.283s">I</a>  defer to you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=898.845s">Either</a>  way, I'm satisfied with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=901.126s">I'm</a>  very happy with what I'm hearing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=902.867s">So</a>  maybe we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=907.865s">So</a>  for free cash and retained earnings, free cash as of June 30th, we ended with $5,022,079.90. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=912.289s">Tonight</a>  we have a paper reprogramming back $703,000 back to the free cash to increase the free cash ending to $5,725,279.90. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=931.107s">And</a>  I have estimated preliminary retained earnings at $5,946,094. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=935.89s">None</a>  of these have been certified by DOR. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=941.834s">I'm</a>  still in the middle of the close, so these numbers will change. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=947.817s">In</a>  conclusion, the city's Q1 revenues are on target, but the city is closely monitoring revenues throughout the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=954.702s">The</a>  city's CARAC stimulus is set to expire December 30th, even though COVID-19 numbers are currently spiking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=961.133s">The</a>  city is prepared to assess upon the new year revenues in place a spending freeze if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=966.774s">The</a>  city hopes your Honorable body will vote to extend 703,000 of the 5,000,496 510 back to free cash to bolster reserves for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=975.936s">Since</a>  the governor level funded local aid, the city able to program funds back to the schools and city to stabilize operations.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=990.239s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=991.56s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=992.74s">And</a>  through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=993.761s">Nunley,</a>  that was an excellent presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=995.222s">And</a>  it's very encouraging to hear what we're hearing in terms of the financial picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1001.645s">So</a>  this year's fiscal year budget relies on about a $5.5 million free cash appropriation to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1008.989s">And</a>  based upon what I'm seeing now, we are achieving about, what, $2.5 million of an increase in state aid from what we budgeted for, if that's correct, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1019.775s">Nunley?</a> </p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1020.705s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1021.625s">So</a>  that takes up about half of that structural deficit that we budgeted with the $5.5 million for free cash appropriation?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1029.889s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1030.269s">And</a>  that's why we wanted to reprogram some of that back to stabilize operations because we had to cut so much on the school and the city side.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1036.532s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1037.432s">And</a>  looking at moving forward based upon these projections, do you think that we're going to be on pace to eliminate that structural deficit with our receipts?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1050.098s">Depending</a>  on how Q2 plays out, yes, I mean, so far, Q1 is very encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1055.021s">We're</a>  meeting and exceeding actually what we estimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1057.763s">So</a>  Q1 looks really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1059.304s">It's</a>  now, let's see how Q2 through Q4 look, but yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1062.646s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1068.049s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1068.79s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1070.07s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1070.831s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1072.332s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1073.272s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1076.414s">Similarly,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1077.85s">Yes,</a>  we had a structural deficit and used free cash to address it, but there were significant cuts to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1085.153s">And</a>  I'm just wondering what percentage of those cuts has been restored so far on the school side and on the city side.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1092.937s">So</a>  far, well, for tonight, we're asking to program funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1096.158s">So</a>  we haven't restored any funds on the city side yet, but on the school side we have, I don't know exactly what the percentage would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1103.742s">That</a>  would be something to ask the school finance director.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1107.381s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1107.761s">Um,</a>  then on, if we were to approve the, uh, appropriations tonight, how much would that restore on the city side?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1116.829s">That</a>  would restore $740,000, uh, back to the city side for some positions that we need to stabilize operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1125.396s">Um,</a>  I don't have a percentage, but I certainly can give you that after the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1130.3s">That</a>  would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1131.021s">And</a>  I guess just, um, this might be for you or for, uh, chief of staff Rodriguez, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1136.805s">How</a>  much of this appropriation would go to restoring positions that were cut versus creating new positions?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1154.539s">The</a>  position of Facilities Director was previously in the budget was cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1157.86s">There</a>  was a funded but unfilled position that was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1161.221s">The</a>  9-1-1 supervisor is a new position, but that is something that we feel is very important to stabilize operations down at 9-1-1 Dispatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1169.423s">Lieutenant</a>  Rudolph from the PSAP is here to answer questions in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1174.104s">We</a>  took a very thoughtful approach when we looked to add in <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1177.405s">any</a>  of this, reprogram any of this money to what we needed at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1182.166s">So</a>  I can take a look at, do the apples to apples comparison as to what was cut and what was being restored, but we kind of looked at it with fresh eyes when we were drafting the paper as to what we needed now and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1194.408s">It's</a>  important to note also, and Alicia can shed some light on this as well, that the appropriation that's gonna be discussed later is for full year appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1203.649s">We</a>  wanted to give the public and the council <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1207.062s">a</a>  full picture of what this will be a year-over-year cost, not just what we're actually going to need for FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1212.705s">But</a>  it should be about half of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1215.467s">Because</a>  as we do ramp up the hiring process for those positions, it should be a month or two until we get everybody on board and start drawing down money like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1223.311s">So</a>  we wanted to give a full picture of what this would be, but not what it's actually going to be for FY21.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1230.475s">So</a>  I guess that gets to kind of the heart of my question on the thoughtful approach, which is where <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1238.052s">where</a>  does this fit into your, to the plans for long-term plans that the administration has? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1242.779s">And,</a>  you know, if we're prioritizing the positions listed here, does that mean that there are positions that were cut that we're no longer prioritizing or may not be prioritized going forward?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1254.672s">No,</a>  I don't think it's, I don't think it's, these are certainly priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1258.277s">It</a>  doesn't mean that these are our only priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1261.001s">These</a>  are the ones that we, that the mayor felt very strongly about re-appropriating back into the budget to help stabilize operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1269.654s">I'm</a>  just looking over it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1271.756s">The</a>  facilities manager and the maintenance lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1274.638s">We</a>  are expecting a final capital improvement plan to be released in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1279.482s">It</a>  was the preliminary finding of the Collins Center, working with our staff, that the number one thing that we needed to do was get a facilities manager on board as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1287.868s">This</a>  will be a long-term savings for us in terms of facility maintenance costs and addressing some of these long-term needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1294.994s">It's</a>  my understanding this has been a long-term priority of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1297.987s">as</a>  well, so we want to make sure that that was in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1301.189s">Ellen</a>  Bordeaux is also on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1303.27s">The</a>  call, or she will be, yep, there she is, to talk about the assessing position that's adding in her office. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1310.731s">It's</a>  always been my role, the way that I looked at it, is investments in the assessing department are investments in the long-term financial health of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1318.899s">And</a>  the more money that we invest there, the more money is returned back to the community based on being able to fulfill the goals of the assessing department and bring money back to the community to make sure that what we're assessing is accurate and up to date.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1334.29s">Yeah,</a>  I think I'm just, and I appreciate this presentation very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1338.374s">So</a>  it's not nothing about this presentation, but I think what might be helpful if we're going to continue kind of going through this quarter by quarter process going forward is an understanding of how much these appropriations are restoring funds and programs and positions that were cut in the initial FY 21 budget, how much of them are going to new positions and kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1361.225s">how</a>  much of that budget we expect to be able to restore going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1364.847s">So</a>  that's just something that would be helpful for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1368.249s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1374.053s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1374.954s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight for following up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1379.677s">These</a>  type of presentations, in my opinion, are extremely important and aren't done frequently enough to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1386.822s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Knight following up on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1389.844s">My</a>  question is twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1392.725s">First,</a>  what <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1395.532s">regarding</a>  the capital plan is part of this current budget now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1401.675s">So</a>  anything that's in the capital plan, what would be expended out of the current budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1407.657s">Or</a>  do we anticipate bonding for everything?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1411.22s">The</a>  capital plan will outline, it'll be a five-year plan, potentially a six-year plan, depending on how things are structured, and it will identify different funding sources for each different project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1422.388s">Capital</a>  improvement plans are generally guidance roadmaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1425.31s">They're</a>  not necessarily budgets per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1427.932s">Spending</a>  would be included within the budget and be subject to appropriation from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1432.115s">But</a>  a CIP is just to give the council, the administration, and the community <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1436.781s">a</a>  good sense of what the needs are so that we can plan for in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1440.967s">So</a>  there will be, as part of the analysis that was done by the Collins Center, it's not only just identifying the projects, but working with Alicia and her team as to identify potential funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1450.381s">So</a>  it's not always <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1451.843s">It's</a>  not always bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1452.704s">Sometimes</a>  it's using proceeds from the sale of real estate, for example, is a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1458.166s">Also,</a>  grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1460.408s">I</a>  know there's some 9-1-1 funding that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1464.29s">Using</a>  our money as intelligently and as resourcefully as we possibly can to address the capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1470.833s">So</a>  they took a deep dive of all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1472.674s">They've</a>  been working closely with Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1475.837s">Right,</a>  so online to what Councilor Bears mentioned, do we have any idea what percent of this $740,000 would be actually items that would be part of the capital plan?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1488.78s">There's</a>  a $200,000 line item that's in there to address maintenance for the remainder of FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1494.241s">As</a>  part of the FY22 budget development process, we'll start to take a look at what those needs are and start to fold in some things from the capital improvement plan as it's finalized in December.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1504.649s">So</a>  this $740,000 would be an integral part of moving forward with a five- or six-year capital plan?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1513.277s">As</a>  part of folding in the facilities manager and this small $200,000 nest egg for facilities maintenance is going to be a huge part in making sure that we get some momentum as part of that long-term plan, that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1526.813s">So</a>  why are we taking this approach that we haven't seen a capital plan but we're moving forward with items that may or may not be part of the capital plan?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1538.907s">I</a>  believe the facilities and the maintenance has been a huge thing that the city council has been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1543.972s">I</a>  know the mayor's office has been talking about it with looking at the different fire stations, looking at the different buildings and the different needs within the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1552.519s">This</a>  is just the first step towards taking care of that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1555.462s">It's</a>  really not, I mean, it's in the capital plan, but this is definitely a need that I think both the mayor and the city council will agree upon.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1563.749s">And</a>  the reason why we're moving forward now, although we just did the budget four months ago, is that this newfound money is giving us the ability to progress on some of the issues that the city needs to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1580.182s">Is</a>  that why we're looking at this?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1582.164s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1582.885s">We</a>  took a 10% cut assumption with our local aid, and we were very thankful the governor level funded to fiscal year 20 levels, which gave us some flexibility to take care of those needs.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1594.579s">So</a>  my other point, and I think you're right with some of these concerns, and I do support many of the items in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1604.365s">And</a>  when we get to this paper, I have other questions on this paper itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1609.168s">But</a>  regarding some of these positions, there's been long discussion, not just this particular year with the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1618.554s">that</a>  the elections department just went through, but for the past several years, this city has requested an election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1628.058s">We</a>  currently don't have someone that coordinates our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1632.099s">We</a>  do have a city clerk that wears multiple hats, but he is not an elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1639.562s">And</a>  all the surrounding cities and towns that I looked into have that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1644.904s">And</a>  for some reason, the city of Medford, with a city of almost 60,000 people and 41,000 registered voters, we don't have someone that coordinates our elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1656.607s">And</a>  I think that's a shortfall in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1660.248s">And</a>  with everything going on nationally, that it's very important that <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1666.67s">We</a>  have someone that can make sure the integrity of our election is what everyone would come to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1675.237s">So</a>  have we looked into, I know this council has put forward several, and I know I've put forward a couple, and I know my colleagues have, several requests for the city administration to hire an elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1687.907s">I</a>  believe the mayor has sat down and has discussed the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1693.272s">Can</a>  you give us an update? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1694.893s">where</a>  we stand with an election coordinator, and why it's not part of this list here.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1701.015s">Well,</a>  thankfully this year, the CARES Act has allowed additional funding towards the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1706.717s">So</a>  I've been allowing this CARES Act funding to help with election costs that are unbudgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1714.1s">And</a>  I will let Dave speak on the mayor's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1718.622s">But</a>  for right now, the best use of the fund was to use our grant funds at this point.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1723.123s">Right,</a>  but those are one-time funds, and I'm talking about a long-term plan in the community to have oversight within a very important department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1734.589s">And</a>  I think when this list that we're going to go over soon that was presented to us, this is to help the city move forward on some shortfalls that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1744.675s">or</a>  shortcomings, I should say, in how we operate city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1749.68s">And</a>  in my opinion, election coordinators should be at the top of the list, to be quite frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1755.486s">So</a>  I would hope that we can get some answers tonight on this.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1759.958s">During</a>  these were conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1760.998s">So</a>  the council, you're a hundred percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1762.859s">We</a>  did have a conversation with, with clerk Herbies and some of his team shortly after the September election to kind of do an after action to try to debrief a little bit on what we could, what we, what we could do better and some improvements that we can make for November. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1776.801s">And</a>  we did work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1777.881s">The</a>  mayor's office attempted to provide as much support as we possibly could to clerk Herbies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1782.262s">We</a>  hope that it was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1783.782s">And</a>  we kind of regrouped at that point and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1786.843s">All</a>  right, let's get through the 18th of November when the election is certified, do the same thing again, and evaluate what that position could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1794.965s">What</a>  they would do in a 12-month cycle, the duties that they would have to perform, the type of compensation, and really be thoughtful about how we're going to approach it instead of creating something in the heat of the election that might not be in the long-term best interest to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1811.209s">But</a>  we are certainly evaluating it, and we're hopefully going to have a good conversation with Adam and his team. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1816.89s">shortly</a>  after the election is certified on the 18th to assess just that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1822.015s">Okay,</a>  so and I appreciate that response, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1826.499s">It's</a>  my understanding that a fair amount of work over the past two years has already gone into what this petition position would <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1837.978s">be</a>  created for what purpose, the duties and responsibilities, the actual job title, who they would oversee, the responsibilities, the salary and the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1850.705s">So</a>  I think a lot of the legwork that you just mentioned has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1854.367s">So</a>  to hear that this is something that we're going to look at once again after the election seems to be, with all due respect, more lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1865.133s">So</a>  in order to get my support for this particular paper, and I don't know where my colleagues stand, but I can tell you we've all reiterated this over and over and over again ad nauseum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1877.704s">I</a>  will not support a paper that doesn't include an election coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1882.548s">And</a>  you can work out the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1885.011s">The</a>  facilities manager, I haven't seen the job description other than the title and the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1892.501s">I</a>  don't know anything else about that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1895.299s">But</a>  it found its way in this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1897.48s">And</a>  I would think, in my opinion, that there's been more homework and due diligence done already for the election coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1906.324s">The</a>  need's there, the demand is there, and the integrity of our elections is extremely important in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1913.707s">And</a>  to have someone facilitate and pull this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1917.807s">I</a>  think is vital in this community, extremely vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1922.191s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1924.713s">I</a>  will not support this paper unless the paper includes the election coordinator position that this council has voted on, I believe unanimously, a half a dozen times in the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1937.024s">And</a>  I'll let my colleagues speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1938.645s">So</a>  I just want to let you know where I stand on this.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1942.088s">I</a>  have not personally seen a job description or <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1945.771s">a</a>  compensation study or any of the duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1948.592s">I</a>  haven't seen anything detailing that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1950.633s">If</a>  that exists, I'm happy to take a look at it and elevate that to the mayor as soon as possible so that we can further evaluate and take those things into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1958.676s">But</a>  just to note, we have not seen that information.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1962.998s">I</a>  believe it's out there, so we will get you a copy of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1966.159s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1968.7s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1969.34s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1972.801s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1975.978s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1977.499s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1979.52s">For</a>  one, I agree with Councilor Marks on the elections coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1982.422s">I</a>  think it's essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1983.582s">I</a>  just had one more question and I didn't want to, I was trying not to mix topics too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1989.365s">In</a>  the presentation, Alicia, you mentioned that 2.5 to 2.9 million in CARES will be spent on HVAC PPE and additional personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1997.67s">Do</a>  we know what additional personnel would be covered under that?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2002.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2002.828s">So</a>  for the school side, they asked if they could have some additional aides to help with the hybrid model. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2008.771s">So</a>  for the school side, they'll have some additional aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2012.514s">As</a>  far as personnel, also any backfill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2014.735s">Or</a>  if anybody gets sick and we need to hire somebody to cover their position, that would be the additional personnel.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2022.581s">And</a>  on the HVAC, is that just school HVAC or city HVAC?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2027.024s">That</a>  would be the school's HVAC.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2029.445s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2029.685s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2031.031s">I'm</a>  just gonna add on the personnel side, that the personnel costs for, that are being used for CARES also covers the cost of greeters at City Hall, contact tracers, food security folks, as well as a number of other individuals supporting our COVID relief efforts.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2046.157s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2046.897s">Thank</a>  you, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2048.878s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, then Councilor Morell, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2052.22s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2052.96s">Mr.</a>  President, do we have a summary of where we are with our HVAC stuff at schools as of today?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2063.975s">I</a>  do have that information prepared for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2066.898s">We</a>  can circle back to the school department and see if we can get that for you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2072.077s">If</a>  we could, I'd be appreciative because I don't know where we're at and I think the people would like to know where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2078.502s">But</a>  having that ready to go moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2082.345s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello, if I may, do you want to add that as an amendment to the paper that we receive an update with regard to the HVAC situation at Medford High School or- Yes, if you could add that as an amendment to the paper.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2093.793s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2095.374s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2097.016s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2100.297s">If</a>  we can add to that amendment, I know that in the update of who's going back to school, I think that we've asked that at the last meeting, and parents have been calling us that I believe juniors and seniors are going back in the vocational school, and they're very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2116.506s">So</a>  if we can get an update with that, if that's okay as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2121.349s">So</a>  you have an amendment by- Second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2122.53s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2124.331s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2125.472s">And</a>  if we can get one more, Mr. President, amendment to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2130.469s">A</a>  report on where our staffing levels are with both the police and the fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2136.571s">I</a>  know we were short some people on both the pen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2139.732s">And</a>  there'll be some retirements coming up next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2143.133s">Do</a>  we have a plan to put people in classes? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2145.614s">because</a>  I know it takes about a year to get a policeman out to the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2147.774s">So</a>  we can get an update on where we are staffing with both the police and the fire, and if we have anybody in classes at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2156.83s">We</a>  have that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2157.551s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2158.733s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2159.674s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2160.776s">We</a>  have Council Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2162.903s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2164.183s">If,</a>  through the chair, I could just ask Alicia just a few questions just to offer, I'm sorry, for clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2170.085s">Remind</a>  me of the deadlines as far as the CARES Act funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2172.525s">Is</a>  it that services need to be rendered by that December date? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2176.486s">It's</a>  billed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2177.226s">How</a>  does that, I'm just trying to understand how that 2.5 to 2.9 applies as far as regarding, would that only be staff for before the break? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2187.008s">Or</a>  if you could just offer clarity on how that money and the timing of how it has to be spent.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2194.187s">services</a>  have to be rendered by December 30th.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2197.388s">Okay,</a>  so it would only cover personnel for the remainder, I guess, this term until the Christmas break?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2205.292s">It</a>  would cover until December 30th, so they could charge up to December 30th and after that they could not.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2210.975s">Okay,</a>  so just to make sure I'm clear on this, so that could not cover staff, that would not support any staff from January through the spring?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2222.742s">You</a>  are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2224.224s">You</a>  are absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2225.085s">Even</a>  though COVID is soaring, there's no extension right now, no further stimulus, and it's set to expire December 30th.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2232.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2232.51s">And</a>  so, and do you believe you will, you're able to spend all 2.5 to 2.9 or will, might you come back and say, just due to what was accepted and what was available, we spent X number of dollars out of this?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2249.794s">As</a>  of right now, I estimate we will fully spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2252.235s">My</a>  big concern more is with FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2254.075s">FEMA</a>  takes a long time to tell us what's accepted and not accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2260.497s">And</a>  if we, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2261.577s">charged</a>  it to FEMA, that 75%, and then FEMA comes back and says, no, I got to move that to CARES. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2267.839s">So</a>  they kind of move in tandem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2269.74s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we will hear something from FEMA soon on our first drawdown, so we know what items are rejected versus what items are accepted.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2278.463s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2281.324s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2282.444s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2283.324s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2284.565s">President.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2290.039s">My</a>  question was, I know that you were in sort of a hot seat last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2294.261s">Just</a>  to be clear, all of our funding will be spent with the CARES Act, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2301.184s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2301.744s">Okay,</a>  so there's not going to be the biggest things, how are we leaving money on the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2306.146s">That's</a>  not happening, correct?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2308.335s">We</a>  don't, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2309.276s">We</a>  estimate we're going to fully expend it by December 30th.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2312.759s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2313.339s">And</a>  then I know I too have a couple of questions with when Council Marks brought up with the facilities and a little bit more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2322.948s">I</a>  don't know if it was a mistake, but I thought, or maybe my mistake, that when you were talking about the facilities position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2334.117s">That</a>  person's only working on city buildings, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2336.839s">Johnny</a>  McLaughlin's still in charge of the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2339.881s">Is</a>  that person now going to be overseeing all the buildings in the city?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2346.332s">So</a>  there will be some crossover on the building and school side, but in terms of, this is more of a facilities, a strategic facilities position in lieu of, in addition to what Mr. McLaughlin does on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2358.961s">So</a>  this is designed to complement the work that John does, not to replace it, and look at strategic facilities maintenance in a more comprehensive way across the board, both city and school side.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2374.062s">Okay,</a>  and I don't want to keep jumping around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2378.165s">I</a>  know that this is different topics, but again, I appreciate all the work we're doing, and I know this is getting difficult, so I'll leave more questions to our other resolutions, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2392.794s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2393.395s">Scarpelli.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2394.529s">Talk</a>  all night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2395.51s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2396.351s">I'd</a>  like to just amend the paper and request that we receive a copy of the Warren Articles from January to date and monthly thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2404.219s">The</a>  Warren Articles are where we spend our money, the bills, and how we paid for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2408.064s">So</a>  I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment, Mr. President, or a motion to amend the paper if we want to move forward on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2414.553s">But</a>  it sounds like we have an update on the HVAC system and a copy of the Warren articles from January to date and monthly thereafter as amendments to paper 20559. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2424.443s">We</a>  have a lot of discussion, a lot of talk about the other two papers that are on the table, and those are the money papers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2429.968s">I'm</a>  very satisfied with the presentation that we got this evening, so I'm going to be bold and suggest that we take this paper to a vote and we move on to the money papers.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2440.159s">So</a>  we have the amendment, the amendment would be to get year-to-date, that's calendar year, January 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2445.221s">Perfect,</a>  okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2452.424s">Councilor</a>  Knight, if you wouldn't mind, if I ask a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2456.486s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2457.967s">So</a>  let's see, so Alicia, thank you very much for your report, appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2462.088s">Would</a>  it be possible that the council gets a copy of that report?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2466.541s">Absolutely,</a>  I'll send it to the clerk.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2467.943s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2469.205s">And</a>  with regard to, you talked about your month being closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2472.549s">You're</a>  closing the month of October still, am I correct?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2476.194s">I'm</a>  closing the fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2477.776s">Oh,</a>  you're closing the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2479.339s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2480.881s">And...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2483.806s">I</a>  kind of, I guess, have a more specific question because I know we had a lot of discussion in our prior meetings about KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2491.308s">How</a>  did those numbers look so far with regard to Q1, what was budgeted versus what was actually spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2498.99s">I</a>  know there's a lot of projects going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2500.51s">I</a>  know we've had a number of meetings for different ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2504.491s">We've</a>  had different attorneys from KP Law helping us with each of those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2508.332s">And</a>  I believe they're also helping out on the 40B front as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2511.513s">So</a>  I was wondering if you could just kind of comment on that as to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2515.119s">Are</a>  we in line with what we have budgeted for that specific expense to KP Law?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2521.349s">I</a>  have a purchase order for KP Law, but I haven't processed any invoice payments yet.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2527.518s">So</a>  I can speak to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2528.759s">Yeah,</a>  the appearances from attorneys from KPA at council meetings and other, those are all covered under the retainer agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2535.842s">So</a>  that's not an hourly fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2538.043s">Any</a>  adversarial matters are based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2543.826s">that</a>  hourly fee that was inside the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2546.748s">And</a>  I believe that we are in line with what we were budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2549.41s">They</a>  are separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2550.11s">So</a>  the Board of Appeals manages that litigation process of 40 Bs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2554.793s">We</a>  can get a breakdown of what they've done so far on that, but it's my indication that everything's been in line with what we've budgeted so far.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2562.738s">So</a>  if I'm correct, 40 Bs are outside of the $60,000 contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2565.08s">The</a>  $5,000 a month retainer, yes.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2570.356s">Any</a>  adversarial, anything adversarial, any litigation or anything like that would be outside of that room too.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2575.762s">Okay,</a>  so can we get a breakdown of that if someone else wants to offer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2580.928s">So</a>  if I, on the motion of... <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2583.512s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello to seconded by Councilor Knight to get a breakdown of the fees so far paid to KP Law under the $5,000 a month contract and with regard to any work that's done, for example, like 40 Bs outside of that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2600.896s">Do</a>  you have that Councilor?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2610.409s">And</a>  if I may, more specifically, Alicia, have we paid any claims in excess of $5,000 this calendar year that did not come before the council for approval?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2624.679s">Have</a>  we paid any what? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2626.581s">Sorry,</a>  I apologize.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2628.342s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2629.923s">Any</a>  claims against the city in excess of $5,000?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2639.483s">I</a>  would have to get back to the council and look for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2641.765s">I</a>  don't have that off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2643.246s">I'd</a>  have to research.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2644.947s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2645.287s">Could</a>  you please actually vice-president. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2651.75s">If</a>  vice-president Caraviello, if you wouldn't mind, if we could have an amendment to the paper to get a breakdown of all claims that have been paid over $5,000 since January 1st, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2666.628s">Anything</a>  pending? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2669.85s">Seconded</a>  by Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2685.858s">They're</a>  all amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2689.639s">And</a>  if I may, last but not least, and this is for <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2694.769s">Dave</a>  Rodriguez, Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2696.03s">I</a>  believe Council Knight has asked repeatedly since January 1st for a breakdown of consultants that the administration has hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2704.217s">Are</a>  we gonna get that breakdown of the consultants, who's been hired, what they're doing, how much they're paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2713.585s">It</a>  seems to have fallen upon deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2715.147s">I</a>  know it's a request that's been made numerous times by this council and we have yet to receive any type of documentation.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2721.846s">Could</a>  you please? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2723.267s">I</a>  will actually correct you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2724.368s">We</a>  did send something over the summer after it was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2727.73s">So</a>  I can look back at my records. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2728.99s">I</a>  know that it was sent via email so I can send it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2731.652s">I</a>  think it was in a memo that we included regarding the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2735.474s">So</a>  I'm happy to send that out, to resend that along.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2738.156s">It</a>  was a breakdown of consultants that were hired? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2741.618s">In</a>  what they're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2743.079s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2743.64s">And</a>  how much they're being paid?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2745.12s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2745.561s">If</a>  you could resend that, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2746.962s">As</a>  requested.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2749.089s">A</a>  number of my colleagues don't remember seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2751.713s">I</a>  know I haven't seen it, so.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2756.16s">I</a>  do believe that document does exist and then recently we also asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2762.053s">a</a>  report on whether or not we're using outside council to negotiate salaries, negotiate contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2768.516s">We</a>  got a response to that as well, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2770.297s">So</a>  we've gotten a couple of responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2771.658s">I</a>  mean, I think it might even warrant a committee of the home, Mr. President, if that's the case, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2776.561s">So</a>  we can all get on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2777.701s">I'd</a>  certainly be willing to entertain that as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2779.902s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2781.183s">Any</a>  other council, any other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2783.404s">Okay,</a>  Alicia, thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2787.006s">On</a>  the motion of council and I, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2790.153s">Seconded</a>  by Vice President Caraviello, as amended by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight, Vice President Caraviello, and Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2801.618s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2813.984s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2814.244s">70</a>  affirmatives, zero negatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2815.564s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2818.045s">We're</a>  under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2820.679s">We</a>  have 20-634, communications from the mayor, November 5th, 2020, to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves to partially rescind <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2841.75s">the</a>  appropriation of free cash per council paper 20-464 in the amount of $703,000 that was used to subsidize the fiscal 2021 general fund budget due to the health pandemic and current economic conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2857.12s">The</a>  balance of free cash before this vote is 5,022,279.90. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2864.304s">Finance</a>  director Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2870.788s">Sincerely,</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehnbeck.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2873.932s">I</a>  think, Mr. President, move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2876.475s">I</a>  think that... Are there any questions on this?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2878.858s">I</a>  just want to make sure that nobody wants to speak.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2881.941s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2882.722s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2883.463s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarapelli.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2886.989s">Speak</a>  to that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2887.569s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Bears, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2890.211s">An</a>  item of this much severity, I just would like a brief presentation from the finance director, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2896.375s">We're</a>  taking a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2897.096s">We</a>  took a $5.5 million vote some months back and we're taking a vote now for 700K. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2903.7s">So</a>  I think it would make sense to get at least a presentation to bring us full circle.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2907.768s">Alicia,</a>  if you could please give us a free synopsis of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2912.272s">Yes,</a>  so we're asking to rescind $703,000 back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2915.454s">Fortunately,</a>  our new growth number actually came in higher than we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2920.659s">We</a>  had budgeted $1 million, but we actually got $1.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2923.281s">And</a>  that's allowing us to re-appropriate back to the free cash $703,000.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2931.302s">So</a>  this 703,000 represents the $703,000 in new growth that is above and beyond the forecasted estimate at the close of the last fiscal year?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2944.371s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2945.171s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2948.073s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2948.754s">Councilor</a>  Peers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2949.714s">I'll</a>  ask you a question too. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2954.738s">Was</a>  there any consideration to using this money to address budget cuts that were made in fiscal 21?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2962.761s">Well,</a>  we used our local aid cuts to address the budget cuts in 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2967.262s">And</a>  we also knew that we had to use our free cash to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2974.124s">And</a>  we didn't need to use as much as we took. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2976.285s">And</a>  we know that we're going red. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2977.925s">And</a>  we're not sure how next year's going to look. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2980.126s">So</a>  we think the most prudent financial thing to do right now is to reprogram and bolster reserves for next year.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2987.128s">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2988.529s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2989.891s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2990.993s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2991.794s">Alicia,</a>  the union contracts that were negotiated, which union is that with? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2997.223s">That's</a>  the wrong one.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3001.551s">I</a>  don't believe we can discuss those right now, what we're discussing in negotiations, but I'll turn it over to Chief Rodriguez.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3010.536s">And</a>  do we have any other brief email sent over to Council a couple months ago regarding the outstanding contracts, which including the police superiors, the newly formed dispatchers, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3025.685s">form</a>  of inspectors, RAC, and TDW form of the superintendents, as well as the newly formed dispatchers union. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3032.89s">So</a>  all three of those are still pending negotiation in varying stages of that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3039.294s">I'm</a>  sorry, Dave, you said those are pending?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3043.376s">Those</a>  are currently in negotiation.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3044.437s">Those</a>  are currently pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3046.539s">And</a>  the yearly retirement incentive, how many employees took up the yearly retirement incentive?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3052.755s">Well,</a>  it was a program that was discussed during the budget process that we took a closer look at after the budget was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3058.398s">We</a>  got together with Alicia and we wanted to get the mayor's thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3061.659s">We</a>  don't have an exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3062.92s">This</a>  is a placeholder number that we're putting in place for now in order to determine exactly how much money we might be able to offer for an early retirement incentive in varying degrees as we figure out part of our net losses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3076.627s">So</a>  this is something that we plan to use going forward as a placeholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3080.092s">We're</a>  not 100% sure it's exactly the incentive that we're going to be offering, but we do plan on offering an incentive of some varying degree at some point in time.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3090.439s">And</a>  the $200,000 for facility maintenance, is that going to be spread out amongst all the buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3095.162s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3095.862s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3098.184s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3101.586s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3102.506s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3104.407s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3105.528s">Through</a>  you to the Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3106.629s">So</a>  if I'm understanding this correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3108.898s">We're</a>  asking for a $200,000 appropriation to go into the negotiated salaries account.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3113.38s">I'm</a>  confused.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3117.162s">That</a>  funding would or would not be subject to further appropriation after the contract is settled?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3123.885s">It</a>  will be subject to transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3127.587s">So</a>  once it's appropriated, we would transfer it out of the negotiated salaries to appropriate buy-in to address the obligations of the community.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3136.819s">Because</a>  the past practice has always been that the administration negotiates the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3142.923s">They</a>  provide us with the opportunity to vote on the compensation package and fund the contract at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3150.589s">So</a>  this seems to be a little bit different than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3153.972s">Is</a>  that safe to say?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3156.014s">It's</a>  different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3156.774s">I</a>  think if that's more style than substance, I don't think there will be the opportunity to discuss all those matters with the council prior to any further transportation.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3166.668s">So</a>  if I may, a lot of the questions that are being asked, I think right now are pertaining to the next paper, which is 635. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3172.19s">So</a>  this is 634, which is for the 703,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3176.211s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion of councilor Scott Peli to approve the paper seconded by councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3186.715s">Clerk</a>  Cunaby, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3287.787s">Yes,</a>  so I know that the citizens and the council and the mayor, we were all talking about translation services, that that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3296.233s">So</a>  that was added to be part of amending the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3300.477s">Also</a>  part of this paper that 295,000 for the facilities manager and the facilities maintenance would create a new facilities department, which is greatly needed within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3311.362s">The</a>  assessors, 65,000 administrative assessor position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3314.863s">I've</a>  spoken to the assessor and the assessor really needs that position to help out with going out, assessing properties, in addition to helping with other administrative tasks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3327.985s">And</a>  the union contracts, the 200,000 would be put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3332.606s">And</a>  then we would come back before you once contracts are settled for us to fund those and accept those contracts.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3348.284s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3350.025s">Thank</a>  you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3350.686s">Again,</a>  I know the administration tried to reach out, and I just didn't have time to circle back with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3360.387s">I</a>  have a tough time tonight without, these are some initiatives that we have talked about and waiting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3366.47s">But</a>  there's a lot of vagueness to it in the sense that the job description of facilities manager, the facilities for $200,000, what that would entail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3376.996s">Because</a>  we took a tour of all the fire stations and it's going to be a lot more than 200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3382.96s">So</a>  I'd like to know more detail what <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3387.042s">what</a>  that would look like, what we're focusing on $200,000 for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3390.763s">And</a>  I know that Mr. Rodriguez talked about having the assessor, getting more information and understanding the administrative assessor that how are we going to, we see more tenfold in hiring that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3407.609s">I</a>  want to know more about the 911 supervisor and what role they're playing and how that's working out so far before we commit to a supervisor position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3419.039s">So</a>  there's a lot of variables here that I don't know if I'm comfortable to vote on this money until I know more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3430.229s">And</a>  I don't think that can be done in today's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3435.129s">put</a>  a lot of work to this, but at the same time, I do have questions.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3438.291s">So</a>  I don't, um, that's where I stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3443.234s">I'm</a>  on the fire department task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3445.635s">So</a>  I have toured all the fire stations and I absolutely do agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3449.038s">$200,000</a>  is not going to fix them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3449.938s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3453.573s">facilities</a>  department, that's a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3456.516s">They</a>  need somebody that has that skillset to come in and look at those facilities and say, this is what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3463.542s">This</a>  is what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3464.683s">This</a>  is how we should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3465.964s">We</a>  don't have anybody on staff with that kind of expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3469.407s">In</a>  addition, as far as any kind of maintenance that needs to be done, we don't have a maintenance budget.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3478.393s">I</a>  love the concept but again it when I'm voting on something I want to know more details of what this person is doing and where if this person just focus on just doing the fire stations there's a lot of the questions that we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3491.997s">a</a>  building facility here, what we're doing with outside buildings, what are they going to be working with the school system? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3498.758s">What</a>  are the roles that they're going to be doing combined? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3502.239s">Is</a>  it going to be too daunting for one facilities manager that if they are working as part of the total facilities, being with the working, giving time to the schools, considering that that's a daunting task. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3515.942s">So</a>  there's a lot of questions that, and I appreciate what you're saying, but again, the job itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3521.803s">To</a>  me, it just needs more of an understanding what it's for, so I can wrap myself around and understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3527.829s">Because</a>  this is something we've all pushed, and this is something that we all want. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3532.413s">But</a>  again, to look at the big picture, this just looks like, in a sense, another round of budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3543.638s">And</a>  because these are the changes we have, the additional money that we have, so it'll be nice to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3549.02s">Well,</a>  I'd like to talk about it and get more details on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3551.881s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3553.761s">I</a>  appreciate you being on the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3555.782s">And</a>  we all know that we can spend $200,000 on one of the stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3560.783s">But</a>  like I said, I know we need the facilities manager to outline that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3565.505s">But</a>  I do think that I need more information for what we're trying to do with that position and where we're going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3571.847s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3573.761s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3575.383s">Councilor,</a>  through the chair, I think that that's always been a real, that's always been kind of a large question when it comes to facilities maintenance is what are the absolute needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3584.835s">What</a>  are the must haves? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3586.077s">What</a>  are the wants and what are the wishes? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3587.972s">And</a>  how do you categorize those? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3589.252s">And</a>  how do you prioritize those? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3590.473s">And</a>  how do you make sure that what needs to get done absolutely has to get done? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3595.034s">And</a>  what can wait, can wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3596.074s">And</a>  how do you budget for that in a strategic, comprehensive way? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3598.855s">And</a>  I think that's what this knowledgeable subject matter expert is going to be doing largely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3603.976s">We</a>  have a large discussion internally about how that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3607.457s">Is</a>  this person somebody who's going to roll up their sleeves and actually work on facilities maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3611.579s">Or</a>  is this somebody who's going to be more <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3613.359s">of</a>  a higher level strategic facilities manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3616.42s">We're</a>  still discussing that and how we think it's going to be a little bit of that hybrid, at least at first, in order to get the work done and think about how these things have to get done in a long-term way and not just hop from one project to the next based upon questionable criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3634.208s">So</a>  we know that there's a lot of needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3636.289s">We</a>  understand that there's a lot of asks and a lot of needs and a lot of must-haves, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3640.13s">We</a>  want to make sure that we get this done thoughtfully and that we're spending the money in the best possible way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3644.073s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3645.453s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3646.634s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3647.855s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3648.976s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3650.877s">I</a>  think he hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3653.499s">As</a>  a member of this council, I would like to see Mr. President for any newly created position, which this request has several, that we receive a full job description on the position itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3668.469s">I</a>  realize that the city administration probably put a lot of time and effort into this, but they have to realize we weren't privy to these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3676.199s">Secondly,</a>  Mr. President, I would ask that when my colleagues are done speaking, that I would like to evoke rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3684.791s">for</a>  this particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3685.791s">It's</a>  the first time it has appeared on the council agenda and it's a financial paper and any request of a member of this council for a financial paper appearing for the first time gets automatically laid on the table for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3699.436s">So</a>  I would say when my colleagues are done speaking, I would like to evoke rule 20 Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3705.338s">I</a>  would also ask that within this week that the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3710.24s">which</a>  is the chief of staff, along with the mayor, sit down with the city clerk, come up with a job description for the election coordinator, a salary for the election coordinator, and what their responsibilities would be, and come back to us within a week with that title added to this particular list. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3731.587s">And</a>  if there's no money for the appropriation, I would ask that it be taken from the facilities, line item of 200,000 minus whatever the salary for the election coordinator position would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3745.356s">And</a>  when we receive the job description for these other positions, that we also receive a new job description for the election coordinator, Mr. President, as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3755.869s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3756.769s">So</a>  just to repeat Councilor Marks, we'd like to invoke rule 20, which rule 20, section four states, any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3771.798s">On</a>  that motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3779.278s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3780.219s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3780.519s">I</a>  want to echo my fellow council colleagues in that I, I understand the acute and immediate need for these items listed here, but there's, there are a lot of items with acute and immediate need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3791.09s">And</a>  I think just there's more information that this body requires before we can make a decision on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3796.295s">I</a>  think as other colleagues have pointed out, just the understanding of which positions are new positions, which positions are, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3804.122s">You</a>  know, replacing something that was cut, which I think there's just a real lack of information here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3808.787s">I</a>  do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3809.888s">Um,</a>  if through the chair for Miss Emily Benjamin, if there was consideration for any of this 700,000 to be put towards the schools and any of that budget, I know they had a bit of a larger hit than the city as far as cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3824.524s">So</a>  I'm curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3825.745s">I'm</a>  curious what the thought process was there as far as applying this entirely city side as opposed to looking at the schools as they're obviously due to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3835.29s">I</a>  understand there's a lot of money through CARES and everything else going to the schools, but there's a serious need there for support as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3841.574s">So</a>  I'm curious the thought process behind that, why the funding is all on the city side versus considering the schools as well.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3848.297s">Right,</a>  so when we did the local aid, when we looked at that, we did the 10% cut to the chapter 70, we gave the million dollars back to the schools to leave them unharmed as we had promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3858.263s">With</a>  the unrestricted general government aid, we had deeply cut the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3862.386s">A</a>  lot of the city, where it looked like it increased, it really didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3865.587s">It's</a>  because the fixed costs are so high in the city side, which encompasses the schools, that it get that view of, oh, the city's went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3872.692s">It</a>  really hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3875.347s">When</a>  we looked at the positions, because we had cut the city so slim, we wanted to make sure to add things back that we thought were really, really important, such as the maintenance, the facilities manager, the 911, assessor position that's needed in the assessor's office, translation services that were requested by the citizens, was a really thoughtful, thoughtful process of what our needs were. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3897.543s">It</a>  wasn't just a wishlist, but what's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3900.305s">But</a>  at the same time, still keeping conservative, because we don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3905.179s">we're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3906.12s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3907.661s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3908.902s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3909.763s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3910.644s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3911.565s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3913.246s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3914.187s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3915.068s">We're</a>  not going to be able to do that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3929.701s">We're</a>  not going <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3933.165s">Councilor</a>  Morell, could you please repeat the amendment just so the clerk can get that?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3937.89s">Sure,</a>  if we could get a list of the city side positions that were requested in the previous budget and not funded exclusive of, you know, separate from the ones that are listed on this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3950.218s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3951.679s">And</a>  that was seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3953.2s">So</a>  we have Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Knight, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3956.022s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3957.443s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3958.524s">I'm</a>  going to support Councilor Marks on his issue with the election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3965.809s">As</a>  we see as we just got through an election throughout the country, elections have become more complex than they've ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3975.736s">And</a>  the longer we wait to fund this position, the harder it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3979.897s">Because</a>  again, not only are we going to need a coordinator, but the rules and the way we've done the elections over the years have vastly changed over the last four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3990.62s">And</a>  again, it's time that we bring our election department up to the standard that it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3996.521s">And</a>  let's say, if we're going to wait until after this election, and then before you know it, it'll be after January, and before you know it, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4002.835s">The</a>  new election is going to be around the corner, and we're going to be still arguing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4007.057s">So</a>  I'm not going to support anything that doesn't have the election coordinator in this package here, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4014.9s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4016.121s">Counsel</a>  night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4018.096s">In</a>  looking at this, I certainly agree with my colleagues in their positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4021.139s">I</a>  have concerns over the $300,000 in union contracts and only retirement incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4026.425s">I</a>  also have a concern over the $200,000 in facility maintenance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4028.186s">That's</a>  $500,000 of a $740,000 paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4028.667s">But</a>  there is one item that I look at, Mr. President, on this list, and that's the 911 supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4042.138s">And</a>  this is a position that's my understanding was created out of need and necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4048.745s">So</a>  I'm wondering if there's anybody available from the administration to talk a little bit about this expense, if a job description does exist for it, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4056.012s">I</a>  know that as we've been transitioning from professional to civilian dispatches, we've had some bumps in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4063.6s">a</a>  need for us to revisit this, then we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4066.042s">When</a>  this council moved to support a move to civilian dispatching, we did so as a cost savings measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4071.766s">But</a>  we don't want those cost savings measures to get in the way of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4075.569s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, for a $70,000 appropriation salary expense on this, I'm hoping that the administration has a type of job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4085.896s">And</a>  the reason I say that is because there was somebody that was already doing this work before. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4090.079s">It</a>  went to civilian dispatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4092.001s">So</a>  if there's anybody available that could speak to this, I think that that might be very helpful for us in preparing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4096.984s">I</a>  mean, the paper is going to get laid on the table no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4099.446s">So</a>  it's not going to be voted on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4101.127s">But</a>  if there's someone here that can provide us with some of that information, I think that'd be very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4104.11s">Lieutenant</a>  Rudolph, I'm from the Medford Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4107.072s">I'm</a>  the head of the Peace Office here to answer your questions about the 9-1-1 supervisors.</p>

    <p>[TH89eXSxkYo_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4111.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4115.05s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4115.871s">This</a>  is Lieutenant Mark Rudolph of the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4118.132s">I</a>  am the PSAP Director, meaning I'm in charge of the 911 Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4122.136s">I'm</a>  dispatching for both police, fire, and our EMS partner, Armstrong Ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4127.86s">The</a>  reasoning behind looking to hire a supervisor at this time, we've been operating the center now since June of last year with originally 13 dispatchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4139.53s">We</a>  are at a level right now of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4143.177s">due</a>  to some individuals that left for better paying positions at other locations once they had been trained, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4151.482s">Currently,</a>  the purpose of hiring a dispatch supervisor is multifaceted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4156.985s">The</a>  amount of work done inside a 9-1-1 center of approximately 85 to 9,500 of them across the country is extremely critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4167.071s">It</a>  is time driven simply by <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4170.822s">The</a>  fact that these are the very first first responders who initiate receipt of the calls, they dispatch police, fire and EMS appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4182.186s">The</a>  dispatch supervisors role simply is a shift supervisor is also a working dispatcher, but has a much higher level of certifications and training from the association from professional communications officers, which is a nationwide professional organization that certifies these individuals <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4200.197s">as</a>  well as other individuals that work as police, fire, and EMS dispatchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4206.219s">The</a>  goal behind hiring a dispatch supervisor obviously requires some of it, a lot more experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4213.382s">There</a>  is a job description that was created with input from my chief, my administrative captain, my operations captain, and I, in fact, wrote that dispatch supervisor job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4225.927s">I</a>  provided it over to the personnel department, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4229.358s">Mr.</a>  Wasbon has that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4231.9s">He's</a>  also trimmed it a little bit to go out as a, if we do in fact get the positions, monetary appropriation, he's already set up a slightly shortened version to send out to outlets that would be hosting it for potential hirees looking for that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4253.637s">Currently</a>  there are about 9,500 <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4255.878s">dispatch</a>  centers in the country, so having a dispatch supervisor at most locations, including in most of the PSAP 9-1-1 centers currently in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, typically have a shift supervisor on every shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4271.023s">We're</a>  looking for one dispatch supervisor that can basically handle that same workload, rotating schedules, so that he or she can actually interface with all of the dispatchers, continue their in-service training programs, as you all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4286.113s">The</a>  State 9-1-1 Center Training Academy has been shut down since the beginning of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4290.175s">It's</a>  hit across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4292.076s">So</a>  we are at a disadvantage, along with every other peace app across the country, in trying to hire people who are currently trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4299.779s">Hiring</a>  someone who is an APCO certified training officer, as well as a dispatch supervisor with experience, provides us the ability to be able to train our own personnel without having to send them through an in-house program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4316.277s">Most</a>  all of the supervisory people that are working in 911 centers have currently APCO certifications for police dispatch, fire dispatch, and EMS dispatching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4326.585s">So</a>  the purpose is multifaceted to have a dispatch supervisor that can not only handle day-to-day routine situations, but also conduct training as a certified training officer under APCO certifications as well as state certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4341.337s">And</a>  that gives us the opportunity again to hire personnel that are currently not trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4347.5s">There</a>  are a number of applicants who have submitted applications to us over the past five months, but unfortunately we have not been able to hire anybody that has training because the vast majority of them, about 98% had no training or experience as a dispatcher in any 911 settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4365.33s">So</a>  bringing those people in is impossible at this time without having a certified training officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4370.068s">who</a>  is also a dispatch supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4372.79s">It</a>  is not just a single shift job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4375.513s">They</a>  would be rotating throughout all three shifts, seven days a week, on a rotating schedule, so that they could interface with every dispatcher on each shift, find out who continues to need additional training, if anything, offer a new training, continue annual certification in the different dispatch center <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4397.605s">jobs</a>  which are basically police, fire, and EMS on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4401.606s">We</a>  are moving into a new dispatch center in probably about a week or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4405.907s">And</a>  the purpose of having a dispatch supervisor at that point allows us to professionalize our dispatch center even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4414.35s">We</a>  have some really good dispatchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4416.57s">They've</a>  already completed state training. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4419.791s">They've</a>  been doing this now for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4422.835s">in</a>  most cases over a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4424.515s">And,</a>  uh, for a couple of them that came in later in October, November, uh, close to a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4430.817s">So</a>  they are doing a very good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4432.437s">There's</a>  still work to be done to continue their training. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4434.878s">You</a>  don't learn this job overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4436.558s">It</a>  is one of the most difficult training programs going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4440.959s">It</a>  is pressure driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4443.459s">And,</a>  uh, individually, each of these individuals has been doing a very good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4448.06s">We</a>  continue our training program in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4450.987s">but</a>  without the ability to hire a dispatch supervisor that can maintain training programs, that can help with the budget process, can help with any disciplinary issues that may arise, that can help with continued training of all of these individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4467.296s">That</a>  brings about the ability for us to create a better environment, a better working environment, a better training environment, and an environment of professional dispatchers that are here to do their job, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4480.178s">to</a>  the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4481.699s">So</a>  if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4484.2s">And</a>  I'm here to listen and answer what I can.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4488.402s">I</a>  just want to thank you, Lieutenant, for that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4491.003s">I</a>  think that that made me feel very confident and comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4493.864s">Moving</a>  forward, when I do take a vote on this paper, that that's something that I will be supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4497.245s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4498.386s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4499.186s">Counsel</a>  Beers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4501.727s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4504.768s">Question</a>  for, I believe, Mr. Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4509.698s">When</a>  could we expect another supplemental appropriation to come before the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4513.421s">Do</a>  you have a timeline for that?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4517.764s">Supplemental</a>  appropriation would be dependent on supplemental revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4522.408s">So</a>  outside of that happening, I don't see another supplemental appropriation happening before the continuation of the budget process in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4530.474s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4531.174s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4531.675s">And</a>  I would just like to join with my colleagues and say that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4536.344s">this</a>  supplemental appropriation should include the elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4539.427s">And</a>  I would not be voting to appropriate additional funds until such appropriation includes the elections coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4546.315s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4547.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4548.197s">Council</a>  appears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4549.218s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4551.88s">If</a>  I may really quick, um, uh, I get a question regarding, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4558.275s">Well,</a>  first of all, I want to say support Councilor Marks, you mentioned the election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4562.457s">I</a>  think everyone has through the last few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4564.818s">It's</a>  definitely something that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4567.18s">And</a>  I think at one point there was maybe a recommendation that had come from maybe the facilities expense, but Alicia and Chief of Staff Rodriguez, with regard to the billboard agreement and the extra $250,000 that was not included in the budget, has that been allocated yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4588.822s">Is</a>  there any plans for that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4589.843s">I</a>  know I have recommended that it goes to the schools, but if not, I mean, is that something where we could allocate some of that money or some of that facilities money to the election coordinator and then backfill the facilities maintenance with some of the money from the billboard agreement?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4606.977s">As</a>  of right now, as Chief Rodriguez had spoken to before, we're working on finalizing the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4614.483s">That's</a>  not finished yet, but there are some items I know that the mayor was looking to use that money to fund.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4622.008s">And</a>  can you elaborate on those?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4626.251s">Anybody?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4626.831s">Yeah,</a>  that'll be part of the final CIP report, which we're expecting in December.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4631.214s">I'm</a>  sorry, what's the expectation?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4634.637s">So</a>  that will be part of the final CIP report, which we presented to the council sometime in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4639.4s">December,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4642.722s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4646.656s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4649.257s">So</a>  rule 20 has been invoked and this will lay on the table until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4653.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4656.441s">On</a>  the motion of council tonight to revert back to the regular order of business.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4750.974s">Thank</a>  you for being with us tonight.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4752.416s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4754.879s">There</a>  were a number of questions last time, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4757.767s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4759.328s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4760.668s">If</a>  I could, there was a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4763.809s">The</a>  major question I believe was by many of the council members was why this work was taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4771.271s">Gas</a>  work, first of all, during the holidays and secondly, during cold winter months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4776.773s">where</a>  it potentially could impact residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4780.974s">And</a>  we asked what the nature of the emergency was to do it at this particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4786.356s">So</a>  I'd like to hear a response from National Grid.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4790.737s">So</a>  I don't know the urgency with MWRA, but the staff engineer that did the design of the project reached out to the consultant that's doing the project management for this project for MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4805.255s">and</a>  they are willing to wait until the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4808.916s">I</a>  can give you the exact words. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4814.877s">They're</a>  waiting until April to start the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4816.978s">There</a>  is no immediate need to have this be winter work, but we would like to get all our ducks in a row, as they say, so that we're not holding them up when they're ready to go.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4832.75s">So</a>  Mr. President, that's good news as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4838.392s">Another</a>  issue that I brought up, I believe it was last week or the week before, not week before because of the election, was the fact that item bullet point number 12 was the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes the resurfacing and striping this portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4858.417s">The</a>  engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4866.48s">And</a>  we got a commitment from our city engineer at the time that the restoration and other paving will indeed take place on Riverside Ave to make sure the curbing is brought up to standards, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4883.445s">Currently,</a>  much of the curbing on Riverside Ave, in this particular project span, the curbing is level with the street, which poses a safety concern and a public safety risk for area residents that are walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4896.579s">And</a>  I know that language wasn't changed, but I want to make sure that that indeed is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4903.166s">So</a>  I'm not sure if we formally need to change this scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4907.009s">of</a>  service, bullet point 12, if there's a need, or if the city engineer feels that that's not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4916.834s">I</a>  know he's on the call, I thought I saw him earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4919.396s">I</a>  think he did actually, let's see, so.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4920.856s">I</a>  think one of the things that was raising the curve <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4928.448s">then</a>  gives you a trip hazard between the sidewalk and the new curb, even though the curb to the street is DOT compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4936.471s">So</a>  it opened up more cans of worms type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4940.893s">But</a>  I thought I saw.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4942.694s">Yep,</a>  Tim's on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4944.395s">Tim</a>  McGiven, our city engineer is on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4946.515s">Tim.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4948.356s">I</a>  think, good evening, honorable council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4952.398s">I</a>  believe my response is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4955.279s">So</a>  the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4958.588s">The</a>  scope of work for adding curbing to Riverside Avenue is a separate type of scope than what MWRA has committed to resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4969.637s">So</a>  what I'm committing to is reviewing the condition of Riverside Avenue, which I have started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4975.467s">and</a>  putting together a scope of improvements on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4979.748s">How</a>  that gets done, I don't know the answer to that question yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4983.25s">I</a>  know it needs to get done, but the utility work that is happening, they're obligated to <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4990.672s">And</a>  I've looked into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4991.913s">They're</a>  obligated to put it back the way it was or better, but adding design scope that could involve shifting entire sections of the roadway elevation-wise, curbing-wise, that requires a review by the professional engineering, probably a firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5011.001s">We</a>  could probably do it in-house, but it's even a little... <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5015.783s">something</a>  that we'd probably want one of our on-call designers to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5019.525s">So</a>  it's, in my opinion, it's outside of the scope of what <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5025.73s">they're</a>  obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5026.991s">My</a>  idea of saying, well, they're obligated to restore it back to the condition it was or better, that obligation, my idea in item 12 was to say, well, MWR is doing that already, so can we take that obligated money and use it elsewhere or contribute to improvements on Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5049.123s">And</a>  I have since received correspondence from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5052.045s">Cuddy</a>  that the opinion of National Grid, and she can obviously speak to that, is that that wouldn't be possible from a legal standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5059.909s">So</a>  I did reply with similar language to what I just made as far as what they're obligated to do when they open the street and to try to figure out a way to use that obligation somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5075.178s">But</a>  they're pushing back on that, and I'll let Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5077.699s">Cuddy</a>  speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5079.605s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5082.387s">And</a>  I appreciate the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5085.009s">So</a>  it's my understanding that the MWRA is going to pay for the resurfacing and the striping of the portion of Riverside Ave that's going to be torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5097.958s">This</a>  also states that National Grid is supposed to contribute to the final restoration project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5104.889s">Whereas</a>  the MWRA is paying for it, that money that the national grid would be kicking in goes into, just say, a different pot now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5114.499s">And</a>  the city engineer said, okay, we'll take that different pot and we'll use it for other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5120.965s">So</a>  my request two weeks ago was rather than looking at other paving areas in the city, that's put it towards Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5128.271s">We</a>  know there's work that needs to be done on the curbing and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5132.115s">So</a>  I can appreciate the fact that this is not part of the scope of the overall project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5139.261s">What</a>  I'm asking is as a city that that money be dedicated to the curbing on Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5147.307s">I</a>  don't know what the actual final restoration cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5153.651s">So</a>  is there any indication what this would cost National Grid or what money they'd be giving to the city?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5160.375s">I'm</a>  not sure if that work has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5164.783s">has</a>  been done, it would, you know, if you were to calculate it based off of square footage of asphalt based off of the length of a trench they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5175.835s">And</a>  again, I think last week when we talked about that, I thought that seemed like a reasonable approach to have a contribution to the curbing redesign effort, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5185.641s">I</a>  thought that was reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5187.262s">And</a>  again, I received correspondence, legal type correspondence from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5191.844s">Cuddy,</a>  pushing back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5194.765s">And</a>  I've since replied, saying that, you know, that's a cast iron line in Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5201.567s">It's</a>  gotta be replaced anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5205.249s">There</a>  isn't only a sole reason that they're doing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5209.09s">The</a>  Riverside Avenue gas line needs to be replaced at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5212.031s">It's</a>  been leaking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5213.972s">So</a>  I thought that was a reasonable approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5217.774s">I</a>  still believe it's a reasonable approach.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5219.434s">So</a>  my question to you, Mr. Engineer, is that if we were to allow the resurfacing and striping take place at this particular juncture, that would preclude us down the line for raising our curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5239.201s">Or</a>  would it make it more difficult? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5242.11s">at</a>  that particular point to do maybe curbing and sidewalking at a later date?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5247.696s">No,</a>  it wouldn't preclude it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5249.958s">I</a>  think there's a question of creep when you talk about pavement and slopes and how you tie things in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5257.245s">So</a>  it's always a shame to put down new work and then have to dig it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5265.122s">a</a>  whole bunch of utility work happens, and then they put it back to the way it was, better condition, obviously, than it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5273.765s">MWI,</a>  I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5275.106s">And</a>  then if we come in with a curbing and sidewalk design, we're doing something very, very similar on Winthrop Street, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5281.608s">The</a>  timing of things is such we would prefer to coordinate those two efforts so we're not duplicating work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5288.491s">That</a>  would be ideal, and that's what I would strive for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5292.032s">But</a>  does it preclude it? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5293.653s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5295.094s">So</a>  just so I understand, National Grid's exception to this is not the fact that we want to do curbing, it's the fact that they don't want to be involved in curbing, but the money that they give towards the project, we can put towards curbing or whatever we want to do as a community, correct?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5319.168s">Not</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5320.289s">Yeah,</a>  I was going to let Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5321.51s">Cuddy</a>  respond to that.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5324.072s">So</a>  we've been asked by MWRA to move our gas main because it's above their main and they need to access it to do the infrastructure work that they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5335.282s">So</a>  this isn't a planned project for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5337.764s">So</a>  MWRA will reimburse us to move our gas main to this other location, which I'm here requesting the grant location for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5347.754s">But</a>  any additional costs, this is a different type of grant allocation because it's a main replacement versus a new main where we pass additional costs to the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5358.627s">This</a>  type of added cost goes into our rate case, which then is paid by the customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5367.008s">It's</a>  inequitable to have gas customers paying for road improvements and non-gas customers not, or people in other communities paying for road improvements in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5377.593s">So</a>  our legal department is really starting to scrutinize this type of stuff and push back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5384.156s">This</a>  got their attention because 1,500 feet times <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5387.843s">30,</a>  40 feet wide times $7 a square foot, which includes the police details of, you know, $400,000 that we would have had to incur and pass through the rate case for a project that we didn't initiate on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5402.068s">So,</a>  you know, so this funding for the paving isn't really something we're, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5410.064s">we</a>  can do at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5413.048s">Like</a>  I said, I'll be back next week with another one for a customer who is willing to pay for these <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5419.095s">these</a>  other charges because it's to service them and their need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5423.657s">And</a>  so we as National Grid will pass that cost on to the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5426.498s">It</a>  doesn't go into the rate case and it is an effect, you know, people trying to make ends meet with their utility bills.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5431.781s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5432.821s">I</a>  mean, I think we're well aware of projects like we're going through right now with 3.2 miles of Eversource coming through the community that gives <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5441.765s">zero</a>  benefit to this community other than ripping up our streets, 3.2 miles of our street, and we get zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5450.489s">So</a>  I think we can appreciate the fact that National Grid is doing this on behalf of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5459.793s">My</a>  question is then the way this is worded. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5463.315s">It</a>  says the scope of the MWRA section 57 project includes resurfacing and striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5470.493s">So</a>  from what I understand is the MWRA is going to pay for resurfacing and striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5475.437s">Am</a>  I correct with that?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5477.178s">Yeah,</a>  because they're the last ones in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5478.68s">We're</a>  moving our gas main.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5480.741s">OK,</a>  just so the MWRA is paying for resurfacing and striping the portion of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5487.067s">Then</a>  it goes on to say the engineering division requests that National Grid, not the MWRA, National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to other paving in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5499.997s">So</a>  it's our engineering department requesting not just MWRA do their surfacing and striping, but also now that National Grid pay something towards other paving projects in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5513.886s">Is</a>  that not correct?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5516.742s">That</a>  was the wording, yeah, you got the wording correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5518.583s">And</a>  since last week, I said that your approach sounded reasonable as well, and I'd be open to changing.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5527.706s">Right,</a>  but from what I'm hearing now is that the other project can't be us putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Not National Grid, us as a community going off on our own and putting that money into curbing on Riverside F. Is that what I just not heard?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5549.375s">from</a>  Tim or from me? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5551.036s">From</a>  Tim? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5551.836s">You</a>  were saying that it involves, to bring the curbing up to, I mean, you can correct me, Tim, but then now the sidewalk's too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5561.201s">That's</a>  a trip hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5562.442s">And</a>  you're creating.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5564.003s">We</a>  would replace the sidewalk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5565.864s">We</a>  wouldn't just raise curbing and leave the sidewalk.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5568.285s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5570.346s">But</a>  I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5571.887s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5572.887s">Point</a>  of information, Council of Peers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5574.908s">I</a>  just want to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5578.603s">are</a>  you saying that no payment will be made at all regardless of the purpose?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5584.088s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5585.128s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5587.931s">I'm</a>  sorry, I didn't hear what Councilor Bears said.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5592.094s">Councilor</a>  Bears, can you repeat your question, please?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5594.376s">My</a>  question was National Grid is saying that no payment will be made regardless of the purpose, and I believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5601.021s">Cuddy's</a>  answer was yes, no payment would be made.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5603.923s">An</a>  arbitrary amount, like, you know, just some</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5607.015s">OK,</a>  so the request from the engineer that would be voting on tonight that states that National Grid would contribute to the final cost is now different. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5621.688s">That's</a>  for Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5623.67s">Anyone</a>  that wants to answer it.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5625.792s">National</a>  Grid is pushing back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5627.894s">National</a>  Grid does not want to have</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5632.072s">Okay,</a>  so if we were gonna vote on this tonight, we're voting on this language that's in front of us, and we're hearing that they're not gonna honor this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5642.318s">That</a>  is what you're hearing.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5644.499s">Yeah,</a>  because the scope of the work, 1,500 linear feet times whatever, whether it's curbing on both sides, it's 3,000 linear feet, or the paving of the street curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5656.527s">Like</a>  I said, that comes to about $400,000,</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5661.396s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5662.938s">I</a>  don't think anybody behind this rail cares how much it costs because once you guys pack up your trucks and put your shovels in your car and you drive away, we're stuck with the mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5671.086s">So</a>  we don't really, I don't think anybody back here cares what it's going to cost National Grid.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5674.889s">Well,</a>  it's costing the rate payers and legally, there's a legal obligation through our rate case.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5684.722s">Right,</a>  so let me, just so I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5688.963s">So</a>  if we made it as a condition, this says the engineering division recommends that the grant location be approved with the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5700.387s">Now,</a>  he doesn't recommend it unless it has these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5703.868s">Am</a>  I correct, Mr. Engineer?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5707.273s">Well,</a>  it becomes a legal question because National Grid is pushing back and saying, we don't think item 12, we can do that legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5716.215s">And</a>  from my understanding of the research I have done since we spoke last and what the legal obligations are, according to my understanding of it, the legal obligations when street opening permits happen to utilities would be to repair the surface, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5735.296s">to</a>  the condition it was or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5739.5s">So</a>  you're putting it back to the way it was or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5743.023s">So</a>  there's a cost associated with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5744.584s">That</a>  national grid is not paying for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5748.107s">So</a>  I'm recommending that that value be still put into Riverside Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5756.354s">From</a>  who?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5758.698s">So</a>  if this was only National Grid doing this work, then National Grid would be obligated to repair Riverside Ave to existing condition or better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5770.263s">So</a>  back to the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5772.384s">But</a>  they don't have to... Right now, MWI already has that scope, so MWI would be paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5778.985s">They</a>  don't need to do that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5782.668s">So</a>  why can't National Grid go back to the MWRA and say, you know what, we applied for a permit and the city's requesting these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5791.674s">And</a>  if you want the work done, these are the conditions they're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5796.438s">Why</a>  can't that be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5799.1s">I</a>  understand National Grid's the middle man, but they're the ones applying for the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5805.54s">And</a>  if we're saying that we want X, Y, and Z done, these are the conditions, and National Grid says we can't do that because legally we can't obligate ourselves to fix that that way for whatever reason, they can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5818.583s">Then</a>  they need to go back to the MWRA and say, this is the pushback from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5822.944s">The</a>  city wants X, Y, and Z done in order for you to get this project moved forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5828.185s">I</a>  don't understand why we have to back off as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5831.17s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5832.611s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Layton.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5834.352s">What</a>  this sounds like to me, Mr. President, is almost, you know, the street opening permit gets issued and the street gets ripped up and there's an obligation to restore the street to its previous condition, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5846.141s">And</a>  if we have one entity that's gonna do that and pay for it, there's two utilities that are involved, MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5855.688s">Well,</a>  the obligation is to restore it to what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5859.378s">So</a>  it's almost like a double recovery, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5861.9s">We're</a>  getting paid for the same scope of work twice, but it's only getting done once. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5866.905s">So</a>  I think that's what the preclusion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5868.406s">We're</a>  getting paid double time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5871.868s">for</a>  the work that's being performed because one entity's responsible for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5875.589s">The</a>  person that closes the street's responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5877.99s">So</a>  that money's getting spent by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5880.171s">And</a>  that's going into the community to restore it back to that original condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5884.073s">Anything</a>  above and beyond that, I think, would be like a double recovery on the impact of the mitigation, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5889.415s">On</a>  the impact of the assessment above and beyond their obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5893.216s">That's</a>  what it sounds like to me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5895.418s">But</a>  I can understand what Councilor Marks is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5897.36s">We</a>  were given a paper here that says, approve it with these conditions and these conditions aren't being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5903.246s">So</a>  I guess the question is, does the city engineer want us to approve it with the conditions that he's put forth aren't being met?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5912.512s">Through</a>  the chair, what I would respond to that is that those are my recommended conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5916.893s">The</a>  council does have the ability to change, you know, to adjust that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5921.414s">You</a>  know, I've granted permission for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5924.394s">And</a>  I think it's reasonable the way that Councilor Marks described how he would like to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5930.275s">And</a>  then the last time we met on this, I said, yes, that was reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5933.736s">And</a>  I would be more than willing to support that change in language for that item 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5939.555s">And</a>  then also, if the council has an understanding here that what National Grid is saying, and if you agree with that and you want to strike out in 12, then I believe you can do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5961.089s">So</a>  I mean, I'm always put in the position to say, the utility company is coming to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5968.242s">What</a>  should we be looking at? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5969.723s">What</a>  is the scope that they should be doing on behalf of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5973.407s">So</a>  that's what I'm always trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5974.708s">So</a>  I'm trying to get what I can out of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5981.234s">And</a>  I would respond to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5983.957s">Cuddy</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5985.058s">I</a>  don't think anybody was looking for $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5987.86s">I</a>  think it was a contribution based off of</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5991.483s">Exactly,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5993.483s">A</a>  contribution towards that particular project that we will do as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5998.384s">We</a>  weren't looking for National Grid to take on that project.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6001.945s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6003.925s">So</a>  my question's simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6007.466s">We've</a>  always done this for these recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6010.666s">Curb</a>  to curb is what we're always, we're stressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6015.607s">The</a>  permit, requested permits coming from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6020.345s">The</a>  only question I have before I vote no on this is why can't we have MWA, why isn't MWA asking for this permit as pot as this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6030.551s">Because</a>  right now, the answer I want to vote on this is to make sure that that street is put back the way we said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6038.617s">And</a>  what we just heard from National Grid and the representative, they're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6043.56s">So</a>  why should I even vote for that?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6046.04s">Oh</a>  no, I believe MWRA will restore the road curb to curb and the parts that are not under their scope where we're tying in on a side street about 30 feet on a couple of side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6056.17s">We</a>  will also, since we're disturbing it, we're bringing that also back curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6062.656s">M,</a>  oh, I forgot what I was gonna say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6065.199s">MWRA,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6069.147s">Well,</a>  so yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6070.808s">I</a>  think what I was going with is they don't, I guess my understanding is they don't need a new grant of location because they're not moving their location. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6080.213s">We</a>  have to move ours so they can get to theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6083.795s">And</a>  Tim, you can correct me if I'm wrong on that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6086.076s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6086.957s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6089.438s">But</a>  they already have a permit, I think, too, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6091.439s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6091.599s">They</a>  already have a permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6092.46s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6093.34s">They</a>  own easement rights in Riverside Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6097.909s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Marks, you had the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6099.634s">There</a>  are a number of points of information, but there are a number of Councilors that want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6102.483s">So</a>  I wasn't sure, did you want to continue your questioning or?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6106.897s">Mr.</a>  President, I would just ask that we get a commitment tonight from National Grid that a portion of funds be allocated to curb work on Riverside F. And that could be discussed between the city engineer and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6126.067s">And</a>  that's what I thought this originally was requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6129.448s">And</a>  I just wanted to make sure that what the request was that it stayed on Riverside Ave, because the original request was that that money be spent somewhere else in the city for paving somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6143.335s">So</a>  I understand what National Grid's stating. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6145.937s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6147.237s">I</a>  would just hope they make a commitment tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6149.218s">If</a>  they don't, I cannot support this paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6153.1s">based</a>  on what I see in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6156.502s">I</a>  don't think the city gets a fair shake, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6159.584s">Everywhere</a>  you look, they're digging up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6161.745s">They're</a>  a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6162.385s">They're</a>  never put back the way they should be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6165.066s">You've</a>  got sinkholes everywhere in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6167.268s">You've</a>  got double poles all around the community, you see popping up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6171.43s">And</a>  these utility companies thumb their nose at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6174.171s">Mr.</a>  President, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6176.332s">And</a>  if they want to come up and move their pipes underneath the national grid, it's going to move for the MWRA, let them figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6183.454s">Let</a>  them figure out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6186.194s">But</a>  I'm not going to stand around, Mr. President, while we talked about these curbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6190.836s">And</a>  I live off of Riverside Ave, not this general area, but I live off of Riverside Ave, and I witness, Mr. President, every time I go by there, curbs that are level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6200.8s">And</a>  the gentleman that called me up just recently that his front stairs were totally annihilated, brick stairs at the Conner Locust and Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6210.142s">If</a>  anyone remembers that, a cop plowed right into his home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6214.623s">And</a>  partly because that the street is even with the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6219.085s">Partly</a>  because the person was probably a bad driver, God knows what else was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6223.286s">But</a>  it lends itself, Mr. President, for a very dangerous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6227.527s">And</a>  if we're going to do total work like this, that's complete the work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6231.788s">And</a>  if the city has to step up and put some obligation, fine, but let's get it done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6237.03s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6238.231s">We</a>  have Councilor Peers, Councilor Ntuk, Councilor Morell, Councilor Peers.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6242.213s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6243.674s">Tim,</a>  in your opinion, does the delay to the spring need to be included in some way in this petition?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6251.238s">No,</a>  through the chair, the default position is no work after November 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6259.721s">So</a>  they have to ask permission from the DPW commissioner and myself before any work would be allowed in there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6266.484s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6267.064s">And</a>  then just getting back to this question of coordination, have you been made aware of or do you have confidence that MWRA and National Grid <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6278.8s">We'll</a>  do the timing on the project in the spring so that the road is open for the, you know, is the road going to be open for months, or are the projects going to go one, two, and it'll be addressed relatively quickly?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6291.888s">If</a>  I understand the question correctly, it will be sequential. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6295.83s">It</a>  won't be at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6297.131s">No,</a>  sorry, not at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6299.424s">Is</a>  there going to be a gap between the two projects where Riverside Ave is cut up for six weeks before MWRA gets in after National Grid finishes their portion of the project?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6311.535s">So</a>  the state-of-the-road post, immediate posts work, utility work, is a temporary asphalt patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6320.838s">So</a>  you see them all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6322.979s">So</a>  when we're getting ready, or another entity is getting ready to do a full resurfacing, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6330.022s">you</a>  put temporary patches down, which is asphalt, and they're obligated to be at the same slope and level and quality as the existing pavement around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6341.952s">They</a>  don't last as long, obviously, and they deteriorate quicker, but once MWR is complete, then <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6348.552s">service</a>  happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6349.572s">So</a>  how long the lag between the projects, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6353.353s">I'm</a>  not sure if there's someone from MWRA here to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6357.614s">But</a>  there would be a lag. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6359.135s">I</a>  just don't know exactly how long it would be.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6361.235s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6361.635s">Or</a>  what it would be.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6363.255s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6363.516s">That's</a>  just something I think, when this comes back to us, it would be important to have, National Grid to have from MWRA some commitment that they'll be able to come in quickly after National Grid does its portion of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6376.058s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6377.319s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6377.539s">We</a>  want the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6378.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6378.958s">And</a>  I just had two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6380.338s">One</a>  of the other things that the city council had asked for is a representative from National Grid with a cell phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6386.54s">So</a>  the project manager on this job is most likely going to be Matt Carmody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6390.921s">He</a>  thinks some of the members of the city council have his cell phone, but he'll provide that to everyone and it will go on the letter notifications for people to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6399.724s">And</a>  the other thing before I forget, with regards to the double poles, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6404.275s">National</a>  Grid reached an agreement with Verizon that we own the pole going in and Verizon's in charge of coordinating the other utilities to come off the old pole to the new pole and they own it going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6415.647s">So</a>  I have a phone number at Verizon for this particular thing and I'll send it over to Tim tomorrow that might help you with some of the double poles in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6423.916s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6424.993s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Pierres. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6426.094s">Let's</a>  see, Councilor Nait, then Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6428.316s">Councilor</a>  Nait.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6429.317s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6430.197s">So,</a>  Mr. President, what I'm hearing here is the city engineer saying Riverside Ave is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6436.342s">Riverside</a>  Ave needs a new gas line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6438.564s">It's</a>  leaking everywhere and the city has been requested it for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6442.378s">I'm</a>  hearing Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6443.499s">Cuddy</a>  saying that this isn't a planned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6447.261s">This</a>  is a project that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6448.902s">Most</a>  likely, they're holding their nose in doing it because the MWRA has an easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6454.385s">And</a>  because of that, they're not willing to expend any extra dollars or resources in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6459.448s">That's</a>  the way that sounds to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6462.27s">MWRA</a>  wants the work done and they have an easement, so now they're willing to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6465.692s">The</a>  city was calling for the replacements of the gas mains due to the leaks, and they weren't willing to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6470.555s">This</a>  was not a planned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6472.697s">So</a>  I guess the question is, if the MWRA didn't want to do this work, would National Grid ever even be looking at replacing this gas line?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6484.523s">No,</a>  this wasn't a planned project, which took a little while to design over because of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6489.386s">So</a>  no, this wasn't an immediate future.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6493.83s">Right,</a>  so we have a street that has multiple level 2 gas leaks on it, that we've all made phone calls on, that National Grid wasn't willing to fix, but now they will fix it because the MWRA needs access to their easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6508.097s">We</a>  are getting some community benefit out of it, in my opinion, Mr. President, because if the project doesn't go forward, the gas main doesn't get fixed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6515.607s">So</a>  at the very least, we're getting the gas main fixed with the approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6520.373s">But</a>  I commend the councilor in his position on this because <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6524.678s">This</a>  is something that we have all talked about, but most significantly, Councilor Marks, the level of the pavement on Riverside Ave with the sidewalk is something that, as long as I've been on the council, he's been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6536.862s">And</a>  I don't blame him for pursuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6538.303s">If</a>  he sees an opening, pursue it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6540.483s">Try</a>  to get through that crack and get that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6542.304s">So</a>  I certainly have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6545.625s">And</a>  I think that he's doing a great job advocating for the residents in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6552.235s">On</a>  the side of things, on the flip of the coin, we are getting 1,500 new feet of gas main that wasn't going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6558.097s">And</a>  based upon the commentary of the city engineer, that gas main does need to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6563.758s">And</a>  it's full of leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6564.499s">And</a>  the city's been asking for it to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6566.459s">So</a>  it's a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6567.44s">It's</a>  a conundrum, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6569.62s">That</a>  coupled with the fact that the grant of location for MWRA has already been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6573.781s">And</a>  they have an easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6575.142s">They're</a>  replacing their pipes in the same location that they're granted to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6579.924s">So</a>  they're not going to have to come before this body again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6582.568s">But</a>  the people that are going to have to come before us are the National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6585.172s">So</a>  I can see exactly why National Grid is on the hook for some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6593.795s">I'm</a>  of the inclination to support the paper just based upon the simple fact that the gas line wasn't going to be done ever in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6602.981s">The</a>  city engineer has indicated that it's one that does need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6606.463s">So</a>  that's going to be a benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6609.165s">However,</a>  I will support my council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6611.413s">this</a>  evening if he's looking for more information or the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6616.817s">Just</a>  from my view of it, Mr. President, it feels as though this is a forced project, a project that's being forced on national grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6622.282s">So</a>  they're not really willing to discuss anything because they don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6626.205s">They</a>  have to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6627.626s">And</a>  then MWRA is coming in and MWRA already has the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6630.088s">So</a>  they're not really over a barrel.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6633.21s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6635.352s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6636.172s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6637.495s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6638.456s">I</a>  just have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6640.277s">The</a>  first for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6641.138s">Cuddy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6641.798s">So</a>  you said that the MWRA is who is going to start work in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6646.261s">That's</a>  correct?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6647.903s">We</a>  need to go in first. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6649.144s">Their</a>  pipes are much lower underground.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6651.725s">So</a>  National Grid will be starting in April? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6653.307s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6653.727s">I</a>  just want to make sure.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6655.028s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6655.748s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6655.849s">National</a>  Grid starts to work in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6657.089s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6657.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6658.47s">Or</a>  earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6659.751s">If</a>  it's not a bad winter, we could start earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6663.354s">And</a>  that better guarantees seamless us coming in <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6667.812s">and</a>  MWRA coming in behind us because we're not geared up for all the jobs that parade out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6675.294s">So</a>  if we have a mild winter, which I don't think we will have, but if we do, and we can start in March, that will help with some type of seamless progression.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6685.537s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6687.438s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6689.418s">Mr.</a>  President, do we have any understanding what level leaks exist within this span of work? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6696.454s">What</a>  level gas leaks, I believe there's level one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6701.997s">What</a>  level leaks are within this span of construction?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6707.42s">Tim,</a>  do you want to talk to that or National Grid?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6710.342s">Yeah,</a>  well, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6711.062s">So</a>  level one, a grade one leak is an emergency leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6715.585s">A</a>  grade two leak is a leak that's discovered and needs to, by regulation, needs to be repaired within a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6723.549s">Internally,</a>  we've added a, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6725.18s">level</a>  2A to our classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6727.881s">And</a>  those are more, you know, like it's a grade 2 leak in front of a school or, you know, in front of a facility like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6734.602s">So</a>  those we try to get fixed in six months instead of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6738.503s">And</a>  a grade 3 leak is a leak that just is under surveillance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6742.604s">It's</a>  surveilled, surveyed every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6745.924s">And,</a>  you know, just the classification stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6749.445s">Or</a>  if it gets worse, it grades up to a 2 and then a 2A, and then it's fixed according to those regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6756.058s">But</a>  how many leaks are in that section, I don't have that answer.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6758.86s">I</a>  don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6760.121s">My</a>  question wasn't how many leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6762.402s">What</a>  level leak is in that particular area? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6766.144s">Are</a>  they grade one, two, or three?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6767.945s">Well,</a>  it couldn't be grade one, because a grade one has to be fixed immediately upon discovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6773.689s">So</a>  I would say they're either two or three.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6776.21s">Two</a>  or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6776.711s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6776.911s">Two's</a>  have to be fixed within a year or six months.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6780.033s">Right,</a>  which is very common in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6782.654s">We</a>  have hundreds of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6783.895s">around</a>  the community, hundreds and hundreds of grade level two and grade level three leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6790.258s">And</a>  I realize this wasn't a planned project, but by no stretch of the imagination, we're replacing these because they're leaks that are emergency in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6800.483s">So</a>  I would differ with my colleague a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6802.585s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that he may see this a little different, but these aren't leaks of emergency nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6812.175s">This</a>  is work being done on behalf of the MWRA, which has nothing to do with gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6819.525s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6819.785s">They</a>  have nothing to do with gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6821.207s">They're</a>  looking at their own piping underneath the gas lines and naturally have to move gas lines in order to get to their piping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6828.153s">So</a>  I think that's why I believe strongly the MWRA should be ponying up some money into this project, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6836.962s">Like</a>  we do with all other projects, like the Eversource and so forth, that we look for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6842.827s">And</a>  I don't see that other than just resurfacing and restriping an area that we're getting any mitigation on this project, we're getting disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6854.217s">And</a>  a lot of it, Mr. President, in a highly traveled street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6858.381s">So</a>  again, I will not be supporting this paper on behalf of area residents, Mr. President, because I don't think we've done our due diligence as a community to negotiate <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6869.11s">with</a>  these two particular utility companies in order to get the utmost benefit on behalf of our residents and our city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6876.413s">So</a>  I will not be supporting this paper tonight.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6878.194s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6879.114s">Councilor</a>  Morell, you had the floor.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6881.495s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6882.235s">So</a>  my second question, um, through the chair is actually for Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6884.976s">I'm</a>  just curious, based on the conversation we've had tonight, um, how often are these conditions that we vote for? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6890.979s">Do</a>  we, does the utility come back and say, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6893.96s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6894.18s">I'm</a>  not sure what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6895.221s">No,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6895.421s">Like,</a>  is this an is this an aberration? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6896.442s">Or</a>  does this happen commonly where we vote on something and then the utility doesn't agree to it?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6903.167s">So</a>  the something that this doesn't happen is that often as far as I've been around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6917.77s">I</a>  personally receive pushback like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6920.572s">You</a>  know, I try to stay reasonable with my conditions and the law and, you know, things that make sense to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6930.618s">So,</a>  first time.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6932.679s">I</a>  can add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6933.72s">The</a>  reason is because when we come before the City Council for a grant allocation for a main extension, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6939.103s">It's</a>  because a customer has prompted that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6941.866s">They</a>  need gas service and they pay for the main to be extended and the service to be connected. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6947.311s">And</a>  they also agree to do road restorations or other conditions that are brought back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6954.639s">This</a>  particular, when it's a main replacement like this, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6957.221s">this</a>  goes back into our rate case, which then goes to the DPU and then is passed on to the customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6963.364s">So...</a>  Yeah, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6965.465s">I</a>  understand National Grid's reasoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6966.766s">I</a>  was just trying to get more information from our city engineer as we, you know, we see a lot of grants and locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6972.189s">I</a>  was just trying to get clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6974.59s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6975.231s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6975.831s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Councilor Morillo. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6977.512s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6979.534s">Again,</a>  not to beat a dead horse, but Councilor Marks makes a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6985.359s">We've</a>  just listened to our traffic engineer who said this doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6992.484s">I</a>  too think that unfortunately, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6994.966s">Cuddy,</a>  the MWRA is in front of us right now, National Grid is, so I cannot support this paper either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7002.412s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7004.27s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7006.49s">Are</a>  there any other questions from the council before we move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7009.711s">Okay,</a>  at this point, I call upon the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7012.612s">I</a>  believe at the last meeting we had, there were a number of amendments that were made to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7017.713s">Is</a>  that, am I correct?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7019.173s">Yeah,</a>  I'm looking through my notes at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7022.534s">I</a>  apologize, I switched notebooks in the middle of that meeting.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7028.315s">But</a>  one was the Opticom system.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7030.095s">One</a>  was the Opticom system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7040.067s">One</a>  was the installing the Opticom system one was to look at the intersection of Riverside I think it was locus and and also have the city engineer Redigitize some of the underground utility plans after consulting with the superintendent of wires There were a number of amendments that were added on last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7058.913s">I</a>  don't have those. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7059.473s">I'm</a>  going a little bit from memory To redigitize those drawings and then <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7067.31s">And</a>  then I believe you, Councilor Marks, you had an amendment on about making sure that there was full repaving and curb restoration.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7074.774s">Which</a>  we just discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7076.315s">And</a>  that cell phone, we asked a representative to have a cell phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7080.377s">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7080.677s">And</a>  I believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7081.317s">Cuddy</a>  said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7081.637s">They</a>  haven't answered yet.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7084.239s">No</a>  storage of equipment or materials in the public way, absent a mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7089.001s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7089.602s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7089.842s">Cuddy</a>  did mention earlier that she would have someone with a cell phone number, people would be able to contact.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7096.793s">So,</a>  Mr. President, while we have the city engineer on, has he had a discussion with the head of WIAS, Mr. Randazzo, about the OptiComm system at the corner of Riverside and Locust Street, which is used to allow ambulances and emergency vehicles to pass through quickly at major intersections?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7118.035s">Mr.</a>  McKibbin, could you comment on that, please?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7121.192s">I</a>  didn't touch the Steven Dalzell, but I caught Blake in my office, and we do have the capacity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7127.655s">I</a>  wasn't aware of the exact request on that one, but I know we have the capabilities to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7136.418s">And</a>  it is something I think we're looking at moving towards the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7139.899s">And</a>  also, while I'm speaking, I might as well put in there, someone would need to deal with item number 12, just to change that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7152.191s">to</a>  have it be a contribution to Riverside Ave, sidewalk design, as opposed to paving the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7160.919s">I</a>  think that... They've already said no, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7167.285s">They've</a>  already said no, they're not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7170.428s">So</a>  I think that's futile, I believe.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7173.33s">Right,</a>  I was just talking, if it's voted on now and it's item 12 is the condition, then that's the condition that gets passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7180.196s">So</a>  that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7181.336s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7183.358s">So</a>  are you recommending to change the language then, Tim?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7187.822s">I</a>  am, well, right now the language, the language in item number 12 says contribute to paving elsewhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7199.171s">Councilor</a>  Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7201.373s">brought</a>  up the idea of having it spent on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7206.394s">And</a>  it sounds like a sidewalk design scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7210.395s">And</a>  I don't know what that value is or what that project looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7213.615s">That</a>  has to all be evaluated, but it'll be a contribution to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7216.916s">So</a>  I would recommend that that language be revised in item 12, regardless of how this vote goes down or national grid's position on item 12.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7229.166s">So</a>  Mr. President, I believe I offered the language last week, but I'll do it again, that item 12 be amended to read the engineering division requests that National Grid contribute the cost of final restoration to Riverside Ave curbing project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7246.77s">So</a>  I'll add that, however, Mr. President, knowing what we heard tonight from the representative from National Grid, that they are not going to fund such a project or even partially fund a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7261.796s">Mr.</a>  President, I will not be supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7264.877s">And</a>  I would ask my fellow colleagues, in order to send a message to National Grid and the MWRA, let them go back and work this out, that we do not support this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7276.542s">even</a>  with this language, because this language is, as Councilor Scarpelli stated, a false sense of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7282.967s">Because</a>  ideally, I believe we've all, not ideally, I believe we've all heard that it's not going to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7292.775s">So</a>  that's why I will not be supporting it, even with that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7296.217s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7297.778s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7299.36s">This</a>  question is for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7300.16s">Cuddy,</a>  Mr. President, through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7302.802s">Based</a>  upon what I've heard, it sounds like National Grids <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7306.618s">not</a>  willing to do anything extra because they don't have any rate payers to pass the cost off onto.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7312.865s">No,</a>  we definitely have rate payers, but it's not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7317.831s">It's</a>  actually, we're not legally, we have a legal obligation to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7323.838s">to</a>  the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7325.219s">And</a>  we actually have a rate case that's being submitted now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7329.301s">So</a>  it's through the legal department and they're happy to talk with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7335.544s">One</a>  of the things I was just going to mention is that an open-ended contribution like that with no maximum limit or something like that isn't something I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7344.028s">the</a>  ability to- Point of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7347.71s">Point</a>  of information, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7349.711s">Mr.</a>  President, no one's looking for a blank check.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7352.612s">No</a>  one's- But it's worded that way, I know.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7355.713s">I</a>  know, and we can word it, as you see, we're the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7359.235s">We</a>  can word it any way we can strike an agreement tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7362.196s">So</a>  if you're willing to strike an agreement, we're willing to word it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7365.938s">But</a>  by no means are we looking for a blank check or an open-ended proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7371.183s">We're</a>  asking that you contribute towards a project that the city will implement and work on, having nothing to do with your scope of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7379.952s">And</a>  if we can get that commitment tonight, you'll have my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7382.975s">And</a>  I don't know where other people stand, but if not, you may have to go back to the drawing board.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7388.584s">But</a>  I was just going to suggest that, you know, something like that can be, you know, we still have to get the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7392.665s">It</a>  can be in condition of the permit.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7394.506s">Once</a>  we give you the permit, what leverage do we have to get everything?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7397.147s">When</a>  there's a more definitive plan, a definitive engineered drawing, because that has to be designed.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7401.928s">Mr.</a>  President, through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7405.469s">Cuddy,</a>  does National Grid have a charitable division?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7409.25s">We</a>  have a lot of charitable divisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7411.251s">We,</a>  different initiatives for green communities, for elderly people that can't pay their bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7418.341s">Yeah,</a>  they're really pretty good about that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7420.382s">Certainly,</a>  in lieu of this language, the city would be very willing and welcoming a donation equivalent to the amount of money that it would have cost for us to have that portion of the street resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7431.789s">And</a>  then those funds can be placed in the general fund and then appropriated whichever way we'd like to see them appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7438.093s">So</a>  there is opportunity and options, it sounds like.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7441.314s">I</a>  have to check on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7442.955s">I</a>  don't know if they're blanket donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7444.596s">I</a>  think you have to apply for whatever the program is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7449.138s">They</a>  give out incentives for replacing your heating system and no interest loans and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7455.84s">When</a>  we built the park right across the street over here, National Grid gave us five grand.</p>
