1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,072
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone, thanks for joining us.

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are on Solidarity Live.

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:06,333
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our second week.

4
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:12,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about how COVID-19 is affecting Medford and Somerville.

5
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:18,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have the great pleasure of having Medford City Councilor Zach Baers here with me.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:30,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Zach, first I would love to have you just introduce yourself and maybe say a little bit about what is happening at the Medford City Council now.

7
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:31,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

8
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:35,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on, and thanks for putting these together, Hannah.

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,621
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complicated question.

10
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,604
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much, so many moving parts, so much is moving so quickly.

11
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:48,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I think obviously a lot of the policy has focused on public health.

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, that that's the utmost order right now.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been, you know, we, we closed schools before the statewide order.

14
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:00,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We had started implementing some of the business stuff before the statewide order.

15
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, no, it was three weeks ago.

16
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:05,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like three months ago.

17
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:11,018
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we had really, um, you know, it's an interesting time.

18
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,239
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mayor who came in in January.

19
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, that's,

20
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:24,122
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really big challenge for a new mayor to face something like the coronavirus And I think our mayor's done a good job really good job.

21
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:29,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and got out ahead a lot of a lot of the Statewide orders.

22
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:44,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean obviously if we started two weeks earlier we'd be in a very different position, but we weren't getting um that information From anyone, you know at the federal or the state level that guidance wasn't there when it needed to be there So in the absence of that, I think we've done

23
00:01:45,875 --> 00:02:13,708
[SPEAKER_00]: um a really impressive job and I think to uh businesses and residents and volunteers and you know just local people have really stepped up um and supported each other and shown solidarity you know I think we're living solidarity right now and we're also living the crisis of our economic and social order right now and people might not be calling it the things that we some of us may call it um but I think it's a

24
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:15,750
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually really important.

25
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:22,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in that general public health, stay at home, keep things closed.

26
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:26,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got out a little earlier than some folks, and I think that's been good.

27
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've also just had really good communication.

28
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:45,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of emergency orders at the state or city level, if people have questions or they're interested, if you go to medfordma.org or medford-ma.gov, there's a really good page on coronavirus and also some really good stuff on food.

29
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,422
[SPEAKER_00]: and other issues as well.

30
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:50,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a general summary.

31
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:57,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk specifically about some policy, but I want to give you a chance to guide the conversation.

32
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:57,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

33
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.

34
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I really want to do in every episode is, in case there are people, probably everybody's gotten the memo, but in case there are people who haven't gotten the memo, just how serious this is and why it's important to what they call social distancing, which I wish they were calling physical distancing.

35
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I pass people on the street, like I'm walking with my son or something, and we're like more than six feet away, and I'm like, hey, how are you?

36
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people are really friendly and some people are like, meh.

37
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:32,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So physical distancing, why is it really important and what are we facing?

38
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:34,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

39
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So really at this moment,

40
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,033
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can call it social distancing, physical distancing, what it is in practice, and this is something, again, three months ago, a.k.a.

41
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,714
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks ago, sharing out.

42
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what social distancing is.

43
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:58,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new word for people, so that makes it really hard for some people, and also then translate that into other languages, and suddenly you have a huge kind of information breakdown, right?

44
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:09,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it really means is you need to stay at home if possible and avoid contact with other people like that's really what it is You want to know who you're in touch with?

45
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:16,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Um six feet has been the guidance I saw some science the other day that maybe even farther than six feet would be preferable.

46
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:26,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Um for a lot of uh of interactions physical distancing, um But it's important because we're breaking the chain of transmission of the of the virus right now.

47
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so

48
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,628
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some effect of that.

49
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:34,930
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough testing to know how well everything is working or how sick the people around us are.

50
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just adds to that need to just pause, isolate, self-isolate.

51
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:44,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, ideally, you know, I'm with my parents.

52
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:51,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we are in the same household, but we don't necessarily sit close to each other on the couch even.

53
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:55,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, that kind of, uh,

54
00:04:56,631 --> 00:05:03,114
[SPEAKER_00]: distancing I think is how we're gonna break the chain because we can't do, I think Dr. Fauci said it right.

55
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:07,196
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing right now is mitigation and that's not where we wanna be.

56
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:09,217
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna be in the tracing and containment.

57
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,038
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so bad that we can't do that.

58
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:18,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all need to take actions in absence of the ability to actually track who's sick and who isn't.

59
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:22,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And this asymptomatic, especially asymptomatic among people like my age, like 25 to 20 to 40,

60
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:28,313
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another huge spreader as well.

61
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're young, especially stay at home.

62
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:36,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're with roommates that you like and you can make it through.

63
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,418
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's, it's really essential.

64
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing someone right now.

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We live 10 minutes away from each other.

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,042
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not seen each other in three and a half weeks.

67
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So even making sacrifices like that is really important.

68
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,945
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even if you think you're,

69
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,210
[SPEAKER_00]: you're safe.

70
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,392
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the information, we don't have the testing, so we really need to, yeah.

71
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:09,295
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I just got a comment that says if it's okay for you to mute your own computer, either put in the headphones or mute your own computer screen while you're speaking, that there's a little bit of... Sure.

72
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a headphone right now, so I don't know if that's me.

73
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I have headphones in, so yeah.

74
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: If the other, we also have two other folks who are on Skype.

75
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:28,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it matters if they mute, if, you know, if they're in headphones or mute, that would be amazing.

76
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:30,723
[SPEAKER_04]: That might make a difference.

77
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Caroline is, so.

78
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:33,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

79
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:38,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet I can probably mute her if she is not muted.

80
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

81
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as easy as in Zoom, but Caroline, if you're listening, if you could mute, that would be awesome.

82
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:45,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

83
00:06:47,592 --> 00:06:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

84
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:56,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, one thing I want to emphasize is that the real danger here is the idea that we may overwhelm the hospitals.

85
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:09,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what, like, big picture-wise, that, I think, is what we're trying to avoid and why social distancing, why it's worth it to, like, literally almost crash our economy temporarily, because if we don't do this,

86
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:18,796
[SPEAKER_04]: you have so many people going to the hospitals that you literally just don't have enough ventilators and beds and doctors to treat them.

87
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's no treatment.

88
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:24,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's no treatment, then people simply, they just, a ton of people will die.

89
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of the reasoning why it's important.

90
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can, you know, we've talked about this a little bit last week, but if you have some notes of hope for people who may

91
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:51,115
[SPEAKER_04]: realize how bad it is and be at home feeling very down about things, that this maybe won't be forever, like what is your sense of us pulling out of this?

92
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean my personal...

93
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:17,368
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I found I was doing my back of the napkin we're gonna have this many cases on this day and you know based on doubling every day and for the first couple weeks we were ahead of that now we're behind that that's just my calculation I'm not a scientist that's just what I'm doing to make myself feel a little more comfortable I mean I

94
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,792
[SPEAKER_00]: If they hold, we need multiple polls, we need a polling average, right?

95
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:34,400
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that Boston Globe poll that 90 plus, 94 plus percent of people think this is incredibly serious, they're taking it seriously in Massachusetts was really good.

96
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:43,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, too, just the, you know, we haven't seen here what we've seen in New York over the past couple weeks as well.

97
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,547
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it shows that

98
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting out a little bit ahead of everything has helped us here.

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We're certainly not out of the woods.

100
00:08:49,700 --> 00:09:12,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stop We're probably you know, if we do this for another month, maybe then we'll be able to assess but I Mean the other good thing is that you know The stimulus package wasn't what we wanted it to be but it was a lot better than 2008 and as things get worse I studied economics when I went to school and I actually worked as an economist for the Department of Labor and

101
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,607
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't mean I know what's going to happen.

102
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:16,748
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unprecedented.

103
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:21,334
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the next step will need to be another stimulus.

104
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:23,656
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need to be more focused on regular people.

105
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:27,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's going to eventually come to this conclusion that

106
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:46,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we're gonna have to do direct income support or do a payment kind of hold and for me I mean we've never seen something like this before we're like having the great depression in world war ii in three months, which is a very It means it's nuts for the economy.

107
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:55,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know if we could eventually get to a place where we say wherever we were on march 1st that's where you're gonna be on july 1st and just say

108
00:09:57,016 --> 00:10:02,479
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually an even better system than trying to prop everything up through income support.

109
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,700
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just saying, we're just going to live in our houses for four months.

110
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,622
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a landlord, the landlord's not going to pay out stuff for four months.

111
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,063
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to pay them for four months.

112
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:15,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It really starts to think about, instead of crashing the economy, freezing the economy.

113
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:25,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I think either way, because of the depth and scope and speed of the crisis, there has been more of a focus on working people than in the past.

114
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously not everyone, obviously not our undocumented neighbors.

115
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:36,623
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are left out, there are funds that I really think you should look into to support people.

116
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

117
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:48,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really interested in hearing a little bit more from you about the two sort of avenues that you talked about.

118
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:54,333
[SPEAKER_04]: One is direct payments and the other is freezing the economy, right?

119
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know

120
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:02,500
[SPEAKER_04]: In Denmark, they're paying every worker 75% of their income, I believe, for the time being.

121
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the government, that's the way that they're handling it.

122
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:15,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Boston, there is a new movement for Massachusetts, I believe it's called Housing Guarantee, that's talking about

123
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:27,507
[SPEAKER_04]: in addition to a moratorium on mortgage payments, having some sort of a cancellation of rent for people who are unable to pay.

124
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:32,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about either of those?

125
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:36,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk either about the freezing economy or about the direct payments side?

126
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:43,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think we're getting a little bit more there on the direct payments just in terms of we're all getting $1,200.

127
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:46,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough.

128
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:52,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a system in place, and we are receiving something.

129
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:53,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some form of direct payment.

130
00:11:53,832 --> 00:12:10,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Senator Sanders was able to do around the 1099 tipped and gig employees and getting them into unemployment, and then also having that extra $600 a week on top of standard benefits, as well as the extension from six months to nine months of how long you can be on.

131
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:12,726
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we are now.

132
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the new income supports that we've created.

133
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,555
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be sufficient.

134
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:26,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to have to come back and say, what's a regular payment schedule and just instead of just saying you get $1,200 one time.

135
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:31,666
[SPEAKER_00]: So really thinking about at least for some period of time essentially a basic income, right.

136
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:33,733
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody.

137
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:54,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would love to see jobs programs at the federal level if we can get to a point where the economy isn't strong, but we are healthy enough for us to do something like that to try to finally rebuild a lot of our broken country and pay people good wages and make sure they have union jobs to do that.

138
00:12:54,205 --> 00:13:02,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the payment stuff is something that's a little more in our scope of control at the state level, especially around housing.

139
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:08,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that there's kind of many different ideas out there right now.

140
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:15,982
[SPEAKER_04]: By the payment stuff, you don't mean direct payments from the government, you mean... Sorry, I mean... Freezing.

141
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:17,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the freezing of the economy.

142
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,786
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is something I think called rentfreeze.org.

143
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:29,291
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to type that into my browser really quick just to make sure that I'm not lying to you, and I'm not.

144
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Rentfreeze.org is a website.

145
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:39,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Representative State Rep Mike Connolly, Somerville, Cambridge, has been working a lot on housing-related legislation.

146
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last night, the Medford City Council supported

147
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:48,511
[SPEAKER_00]: HD 4935, which is the eviction and foreclosure moratorium bill that he's filed.

148
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's also drafting legislation.

149
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:54,116
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually drafting it publicly at rentfreeze.org.

150
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hasn't filed it yet.

151
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:59,760
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to get input and suggestions and thoughts before he files it.

152
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have them, go put those in.

153
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:05,785
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's because we can't gather right now.

154
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:08,607
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't come together at the state house and say, this is what we want.

155
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:15,022
[SPEAKER_00]: that would do a rent freeze and kind of There's a lot of things we talk about.

156
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:25,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the idea that we're talking about is essentially what some people call cancellation, which is just More for both mortgages and for rent We're taking these few months off.

157
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,995
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to accrue interest You don't have to pay a balloon payment at the end of a pandemic to your landlord, right?

158
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:39,420
[SPEAKER_00]: um, so That's really what we're thinking, but it's not you know tenants don't pay and everyone else is in

159
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:45,300
[SPEAKER_00]: that landlords and property owners are kind of in trouble from that.

160
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,961
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need everybody.

161
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been trying to say is this is all hands on deck and we're trying to help everyone.

162
00:14:53,023 --> 00:15:00,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be the intent of what's going on with definitely the progressive housing legislation here in Massachusetts.

163
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

164
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:08,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else going on at the city level?

165
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:15,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so for housing, we're just kind of trying to pull everything together.

166
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:30,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something that communities to look into is if you have Community Preservation Act, CPA, you may have some funding that's for affordable housing, and that is allowed to be used for rental assistance, or at least we think it is.

167
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking into that right now.

168
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:37,238
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not as well resourced as some of our neighbors in Somerville.

169
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:41,199
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they have a whole housing stability office.

170
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:49,701
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at least trying to get a housing stability hotline up for Medford residents that has the state and federal resources and then hopefully city resources.

171
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:54,543
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our food security task force has been doing a fantastic job.

172
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:56,063
[SPEAKER_00]: They have existed

173
00:15:56,974 --> 00:16:04,257
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a very serious food security problem in Medford We're one of the top cities in the state in terms of people who don't have access to food.

174
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:22,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so We have been over the past several years a group of residents sarah mcgiburn and others have really been doing a great job along with the You know people at city hall our city staff, um, and they have stepped up unbelievably, uh during this crisis we have I think

175
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:40,757
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grab and go for seniors and children and families now where we've actually expanded that so much that I think, you know, it's not just necessarily focused on, we might not have enough for everybody who comes so there's a lot of locations around the city for grab and go lunch pickups and I think breakfast pickups as well.

176
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:56,680
[SPEAKER_00]: From this food security task force and our interfaith clergy who have been putting together micro pantries around the city so basically almost small boxes and different places that are just come, come and grab food that Sarah bring food if you can.

177
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've seen that on the mamas list, the Mutual Aid Medford and Centerville, that people are helping with that.

178
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:12,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also have a lot of good advice about how to, wearing gloves, washing before you go out.

179
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:16,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And that if you're leaving something in the pantry, that you want to do that safely.

180
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So that even if you're completely asymptomatic, that you're not leaving something for someone that could potentially infect them.

181
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:23,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

182
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:31,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that there are a lot of good people who are helping to fill those as well.

183
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

184
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:40,384
[SPEAKER_00]: One other really quick thing, Anna, if I can, is just that we've had volunteers also calling our seniors.

185
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been just checking in, seeing if they need anything.

186
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,430
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a great thing that we've been able to do.

187
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:53,539
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some ward captains that are kind of sometimes linked into the mamas, and there's just a lot of interconnected networks of people helping each other.

188
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:57,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been, and the city's been kind of lifting that up as much as possible.

189
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

190
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

191
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

192
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:08,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually do have a food insecurity person who's just about to come on the call.

193
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to ask if you have any final words for people

194
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:18,006
[SPEAKER_04]: for this week before we go to the next guest.

195
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just stay strong.

196
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,290
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help, reach out.

197
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,412
[SPEAKER_00]: People are here everywhere around you.

198
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:41,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford, again, if you're in Medford, there's a lot of resources on our city website, including all the different kinds of help, and especially if you're in crisis or you're struggling and you just need someone to speak to and kind of work through that.

199
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:44,005
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some connections to some resources on that as well.

200
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:45,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

201
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:48,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to say one more time the website that people can go to for Medford?

202
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:49,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

203
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:53,368
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medfordma.org or medford-ma.gov.

204
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:55,250
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring you to the same place.

205
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

206
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being on.

207
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to hear about the great work that you guys are doing there and chat a little bit also about state and federal policy.

208
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

209
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:07,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Anna.

210
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

211
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,644
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and switch to Becca Miller.

212
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Becca, I've got you on screen now.

213
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:21,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to switch out the name so that you don't look like you're Zack Bares.

214
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:22,733
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

215
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

216
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:33,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, I would love for you to introduce yourself before I kind of read the story that led me to invite you on here.

217
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

218
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:36,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Becca Miller.

219
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Somerville, Mass.

220
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: For my day job, I work as the campaign manager at the Massachusetts Food System Collaborative for the Funding for Healthy Incentives campaign, long name, which is a program under SNAP in Massachusetts.

221
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:55,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also organize with Boston BSA, and I'm on the steering committee of Nationwide Ecosocialism Working Group.

222
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:56,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

223
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for all the great work that you are doing.

224
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:03,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to just go ahead and read.

225
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone sent an email to the show, and they wanted me to read it.

226
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:14,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is someone who says, I am a 58-year-old disabled Medford resident.

227
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,870
[SPEAKER_04]: My doctor advised me to shelter in place due to my congenital lung disease.

228
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:27,193
[SPEAKER_04]: When attempting to set up an online grocery delivery, I discovered that Massachusetts does not allow SNAP EBT recipients this necessary service.

229
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:28,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this?

230
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: This presents a very dangerous choice to high-risk individuals.

231
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:35,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Go hungry or expose oneself to a potentially fatal infection.

232
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:36,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Please explain.

233
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, solidarity.

234
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

235
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:43,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's extremely frustrating.

236
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, again, sorry that that's happening.

237
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:49,024
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not really like a state issue.

238
00:20:49,064 --> 00:21:11,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a federal level issue USDA which manages snap across the country Doesn't allow online sales for snap right now except in five states, which is part of a pilot program which started back in 2019 and those states are mainly working with two retailers for that online purchasing pilot program, which are Amazon and Walmart and

239
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not really like a state issue.

240
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a federal issue on the back end.

241
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like super exciting.

242
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly just like the tech isn't there to support online purchasing.

243
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:40,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance, which manages SNAP in Massachusetts, understands that, especially right now, folks want this and are seeing other folks being able to purchase groceries through Peapod or

244
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:46,118
[SPEAKER_02]: prime or through a variety of local distributors, right?

245
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have been asked by the Massachusetts legislature to ask USDA for a waiver that would allow this to happen.

246
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:58,720
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, because it's a tech issue, it's something that would probably take a couple months to get set up and running.

247
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:10,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are also some concerns among advocates in the food security world that because Amazon and Walmart are the two retailers in this pilot program, that they would be the only ones benefiting from this expansion.

248
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:32,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that they're going to survive this crisis, but we don't know that other farmers that are SNAP-authorized or other smaller retail or grocery chains that serve areas that are commonly known as food deserts or bodegas, they're not necessarily going to be automatically included in this, which is just another complicating factor.

249
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:37,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a long-winded answer, and I'm sorry, but there are a couple ways to get around this.

250
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add an authorized person to your EBT account.

251
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that online through the DTA Connect portal.

252
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:49,824
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also ask a trusted friend or neighbor to go shopping for you.

253
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:53,688
[SPEAKER_02]: You give them a list through Mamas, as Anna lifted up earlier.

254
00:22:54,907 --> 00:23:00,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Retailers are really like not allowed to ask about the identity on your EBT card that's protected by federal law.

255
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:06,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't feel uncomfortable about that, but just definitely make sure that it's someone that you trust if you're gonna ask someone to do that for you.

256
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and also you had mentioned when I first asked you about this that the HIP program, you actually can order fresh produce through the HIP program for delivery.

257
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:21,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about that?

258
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:22,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.

259
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:25,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So HIP is a special program.

260
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only statewide program of its kind in the country.

261
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:36,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, if you receive SNAP in Massachusetts, you get an extra $40 to $80 per month to spend on fruits and veggies with participating farmers.

262
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the crisis, a couple of farmers have reworked their business models to do online delivery.

263
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, folks can put in

264
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:56,279
[SPEAKER_02]: orders online and they pay in person, like farmers are literally going door-to-door across the state to like make sure that folks can like swipe their cards in person, still make that happen.

265
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a couple of farmers that are doing this in Western Mass.

266
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Sunderland Co-op, which essentially aggregates a couple different farmers.

267
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:10,262
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one called Mass Food Delivery.

268
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a bunch of different ones that I can like call out, but essentially it's

269
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:20,969
[SPEAKER_02]: easiest if you call Project Bread to find a hip retailer near you.

270
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I don't know where this question came from.

271
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to like make sure that we're missing anyone.

272
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:34,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, a lot of farmers have reworked their business models to make sure that like folks are still accessing fresh food during this crisis.

273
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:37,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's an amazing program that Massachusetts has.

274
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:45,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you either, like, do you happen to know the phone number for Project Bread, or is there a website for them?

275
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, where can people find this information?

276
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can tell you both.

277
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:59,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Project Bread's food source hotline, which has language capacity for about 160 different languages.

278
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And that number is 1-800-645-8333.

279
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also just look at Project Bread's website at projectbread.org slash get dash help.

280
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:15,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a bunch of different resources there.

281
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:16,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

282
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

283
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:23,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm slightly curious just about the tech issue that you talk about.

284
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:34,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're saying that we can't get it here in Massachusetts, I understand the issue with Amazon and Walmart being the two options in the five states that do have it, right?

285
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:40,833
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not perfect, to say the least.

286
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's the tech issue between us and getting at least those two who are piloting it in other states to be able to deliver to people in Massachusetts?

287
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:59,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I am not an expert in this, so forgive me.

288
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:04,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has to do with the EBT system's third-party processor.

289
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:21,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially they just need to code the ability for Snap transactions to happen online because essentially USDA Snap regulations only get updated when there's like new farm bills, which only happen every 45 years and there's usually tensions.

290
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:28,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's mostly just like the back end, like there needs to be a lot of coding and like security that needs to happen on that end.

291
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been told it will take a while.

292
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:36,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, at least we've got HIP here, that's great.

293
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:46,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for folks who either may have some, either are on SNAP or maybe aren't on SNAP?

294
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,756
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, who's eligible for SNAP?

295
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And would people now who have lost their jobs, maybe they would be eligible for SNAP and they don't know?

296
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Who can apply?

297
00:26:55,918 --> 00:27:01,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's a couple of different requirements to apply for SNAP.

298
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,301
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to do with income,

299
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: citizenship status and a couple of verification documents.

300
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:20,678
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've recently lost your job or had a decrease in hours, definitely don't wait to apply for unemployment insurance.

301
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that first and then apply for SNAP.

302
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:33,978
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of rules changes with SNAP just to make things easier and more expedited because of the increase in applications the state has seen because of the crisis.

303
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:41,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of ease and restrictions.

304
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:47,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have lost your job, definitely apply for unemployment assurance and then apply for SNAP.

305
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:50,426
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that online at DTAConnect.org.

306
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:57,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do it with a partner agency, like I said, with Project Bread's food source hotline.

307
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,054
[SPEAKER_02]: They also take SNAP applications over the phone.

308
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have internet access, you can do it that way.

309
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:05,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have language capacity, as I mentioned.

310
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:14,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The state's max SNAP benefit isn't too much.

311
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely advocacy going around that in the federal stimulus budgets, but right now,

312
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: is definitely an important resource for folks to get if they have been affected by the crisis.

313
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

314
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

315
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much, Becca.

316
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been great to have you on.

317
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, for the work that you do, always.

318
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we are about to start a conversation about incarcerated folks in Massachusetts and how they are dealing with SNAP.

319
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:45,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Becca.

320
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to say ciao to you.

321
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to invite on.

322
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Carolyn Bayes.

323
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, Carolyn, you are live.

324
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:04,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I fear that I have a frozen version of you.

325
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:06,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.

326
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:18,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Carolyn, we might have to reopen our phone call.

327
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to dial in again.

328
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:19,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

329
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if I can get Carolyn on the horn here.

330
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:36,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I will say you can always send in your stories.

331
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send in your questions.

332
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:40,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You can comment on YouTube, and I can see all those comments, so we can bring those in.

333
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,599
[SPEAKER_04]: There is Becca again.

334
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you?

335
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and get Carolyn on here.

336
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:51,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me call her back.

337
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:02,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha, she is calling in.

338
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:22,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me, I have a little bit of an issue with Skype.

339
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me one second.

340
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:25,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get Caroline on here.

341
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:39,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, I don't have your video, but I do have your audio.

342
00:30:40,562 --> 00:30:41,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I've got you.

343
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:43,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

344
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:45,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

345
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, we're gonna talk about how COVID-19 is affecting folks in jails.

346
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love it if you would go ahead and just introduce yourself and how you are sort of related to this topic.

347
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:01,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

348
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,446
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Caroline Bays.

349
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:11,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the president of the Board of Progressive Massachusetts, and I've been working on criminal justice issues for a while now.

350
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:19,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, oh, by the way, I'm also a town Councilor in Watertown, so I could relate to what Zach was saying.

351
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:30,081
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have been visiting, as a result of my activism, I've been visiting a young man who's been in solitary confinement for three years.

352
00:31:32,214 --> 00:31:35,935
[SPEAKER_01]: because he doesn't have any family nearby and has nobody else to visit him.

353
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:46,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been learning what it's like really almost as a family member for somebody who's inside prison and especially inside solitary confinement.

354
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

355
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:49,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

356
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:59,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we talk a little bit more generally about what's happening, well, you tell me, do you want to talk generally about what's happening in Massachusetts prisons?

357
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:04,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you want to go, should we just go straight at what's happening related to COVID-19?

358
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I think let's start with COVID-19 and why it's so dangerous for them at this moment.

359
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:10,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can broaden it up a little bit after this.

360
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:11,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

361
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:14,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, right now, I've actually been talking to him.

362
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,293
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been emailing daily.

363
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:17,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now,

364
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:24,935
[SPEAKER_01]: basically paranoia and fear is running rampant through his tier.

365
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:28,217
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically helpless.

366
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:35,582
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot leave their cells without touching, you know, people, things.

367
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:44,667
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be, I mean, to the point where they actually, every time they leave their cell, even just for a shower, they're strip searched.

368
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:48,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have no way of protecting their own bodies.

369
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:53,706
[SPEAKER_01]: and from the correctional officers.

370
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:56,453
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the correctional officers are

371
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,920
[SPEAKER_01]: from what he's saying, not taking it as seriously as they would like them to.

372
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as of a few days ago, they were finally given masks, you know, face masks, the correctional officers, but none of them are wearing it.

373
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:24,264
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting them, you know, I'm thinking of all these doctors who were killing for masks and they're just putting them around their necks and joking about it and joking that they're gonna breathe on, that they'll joke like they'll cough.

374
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:30,738
[SPEAKER_01]: act like they're sick and say that they're going to breathe on the prisoners.

375
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very scary for the prisoners.

376
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,620
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying as much soap as they can.

377
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,001
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any hand sanitizer.

378
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mean that the prisoners themselves are spending their own money to buy soap?

379
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:44,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

380
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:47,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's true of everything.

381
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:49,023
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the broader issue.

382
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:52,704
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to spend their own money to buy toothpaste, toothbrushes,

383
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,754
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want decent food, they have to spend their own money.

384
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:09,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So before you go on, I do want to just mention we have someone who's commented on YouTube saying they're hoping to hear about what correctional facilities are doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

385
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it sounds like one thing that they're doing is they seem to have obtained masks, which it's so incredibly important for our, like there's a shortage of masks, and it's so important for our hospital staff and doctors to be able to have the masks that they need.

386
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:39,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's important for correctional facilities to have masks as well, but not if they're just wearing them around their neck and using it to, you know, taunt the inmates.

387
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

388
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also said they were cleaning, like they were cleaning the showers, they were doing things like that.

389
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:51,516
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as he could tell, the showers didn't look any cleaner.

390
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:59,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have, he actually saw the cleaning supplies that they said there was gonna be special cleaning supplies, but he's seen those cleaning supplies a million times.

391
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:00,543
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same cleaning supplies.

392
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:03,506
[SPEAKER_01]: So they haven't, they're saying that they're doing things.

393
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:07,269
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that they have done that is the best thing they have done is,

394
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:11,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, he's in solitary confinement.

395
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,861
[SPEAKER_01]: He does get one visit a week.

396
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:18,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandably, everybody understands they've had to cancel all visitors.

397
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:27,652
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are in lieu of that giving them two extra phone calls a day, and they're giving them a free phone call.

398
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that little step

399
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:39,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that the CEOs, I wish that actually the people who run the prisons could understand that little step goes a long way.

400
00:35:39,644 --> 00:35:52,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so appreciated by Andrew, the young man I visit, and all of the other prisoners who have to endure being separated from their families.

401
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

402
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to jump in.

403
00:35:55,481 --> 00:36:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't resist jumping in here because I did spend two nights in jail in 2000 when I was illegally arrested for protesting.

404
00:36:05,524 --> 00:36:06,764
[SPEAKER_04]: There were about 71 of us.

405
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:10,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We were illegally strip searched.

406
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: The women only were strip searched twice during our time there, and there was a giant lawsuit afterwards and all that.

407
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:20,808
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say that this was in Los Angeles, and I will say that we were

408
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: we were arrested and literally not allowed to wash in any way.

409
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:39,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And the police who had arrested us had us leaning up against, like, pushing us against a chain link fence that was, like, covered in grease and oil because it was right directly underneath a freeway.

410
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:45,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our hands and our bodies were just, they had all this black grease all over them.

411
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were not, there was no,

412
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,688
[SPEAKER_04]: ability for us to wash anything at all for like, you know, 30 hours or more.

413
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:54,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

414
00:36:57,902 --> 00:37:11,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole taunting thing, people may not realize how much psychological games are played to inmates by correctional staff.

415
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:22,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea that correctional staff are joking about purposefully getting inmates sick with COVID-19, that is,

416
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when this is real psychological.

417
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:31,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's terrible.

418
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,857
[SPEAKER_04]: That should not be legal for them to do that.

419
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:45,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to, for a second, before we go on, to talk a little bit about how dangerous it is to be in these close quarters with people.

420
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:53,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking about social distancing, and people who are incarcerated do not have that ability.

421
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk a little bit just about how dangerous it is and if there have been any outbreaks inside of any correctional facilities?

422
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,814
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been an outbreak in a correctional facility.

423
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:06,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a number of people have gotten sick.

424
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:14,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not up to date on today on what the numbers are, but it was 17 the last I'd looked.

425
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:28,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I did hear from Chris Fallon, who said that they have lots of protocol and that he was going to keep people from being sick, but the protocol obviously is not being followed.

426
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,280
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are getting sick.

427
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:39,184
[SPEAKER_01]: The main problem is, and as you must have experienced and felt yourself, is just a pure helplessness.

428
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,986
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control where our bodies go.

429
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:52,570
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control what is gonna happen to us, but they are totally at the whim of other human beings.

430
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,371
[SPEAKER_01]: They have zero control over this.

431
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:56,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So the psychological sort of fear

432
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:25,439
[SPEAKER_01]: even without another human being actively trying to terrorize you, the psychological fear is there already and the helplessness and the not being able to, you know, protect yourself is just, you know, it's heartbreaking to listen, well, I'm reading right now what Andrew has to say about the experience of being inside there right now.

433
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:29,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another question here.

434
00:39:30,676 --> 00:39:36,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there ways for people to get involved and support the incarcerated population during this time of crisis?

435
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Canteen money for soap, masks, letters.

436
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sympathetic to those who are in prisons.

437
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:44,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So letters are always appreciated.

438
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,602
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different, you can go online and find, you know, write a prisoner.

439
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:54,424
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of websites that can match you up with prisoners.

440
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how much letters are appreciated.

441
00:39:57,806 --> 00:40:08,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've established a relationship, it's a little difficult to get money to somebody, but once you've established a relationship, they can describe how you need to, how you can

442
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:09,939
[SPEAKER_01]: get some money for people.

443
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:14,061
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no donation for getting things.

444
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:21,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually quite difficult to get anything to a friend or relative.

445
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:24,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't buy it for them.

446
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:25,989
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to buy it themselves.

447
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:33,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only prison-approved things from the canteen that are allowed to go into their cells.

448
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,511
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really buy them anything.

449
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we go on to the next questions, we do have another question.

450
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:46,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying that letters and emails are really helpful.

451
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a particular easy way?

452
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that a lot of people who are involved in Mamas Mutually Medford and Somerville are, people want to help.

453
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,340
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to be able to do something.

454
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,861
[SPEAKER_04]: What's an easy way for people to get involved that way?

455
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:08,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to do that, I think, writeaprisoner.com, I think is the name of it.

456
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Look that up.

457
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:19,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of prisoners who really are begging for people to write them because they don't have that much contact with the outside.

458
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:20,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would do that.

459
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:22,668
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best way.

460
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also a whole bunch of different groups who are working on different issues.

461
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:39,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a member of both Massachusetts Against Solitary Confinement.

462
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:44,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a member of a group called Concerned Elders.

463
00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:48,514
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually go in and visit people in prisons.

464
00:41:49,355 --> 00:42:00,181
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to give people my contact information, especially if they're interested in visiting people, that is one of the things that are harder for people to do.

465
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:04,620
[SPEAKER_01]: really makes a big difference in their lives.

466
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And I assume we can't do that right now.

467
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:07,763
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

468
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Visiting, yeah, there's no visiting, right.

469
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:12,466
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no visiting right now.

470
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:18,030
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if the writing the letters is allowed, so that can be done.

471
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:29,539
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anyone's interested in getting involved, I'm happy to point them in the right direction, you know, for whatever thing they might want to do.

472
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:48,368
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also different groups who go in and educate prisoners so they can go in and actually they could become part of a group that might teach people how to read or teach people how to write.

473
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,055
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's also groups like that.

474
00:42:51,075 --> 00:43:03,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, there's a, there's a long list of groups and I'm like, the names are escaping me right now, but, but I would be more than happy to, to, you know, forward all that information to anyone who's interested.

475
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:04,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

476
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: There is another question, which is, do you know what sort of medical care is available in case someone in prison does get the virus?

477
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,294
[SPEAKER_01]: There is medical care available.

478
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:29,880
[SPEAKER_01]: However, from what I've seen, and I don't know if they've improved it at all, it's been very, very lax.

479
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:40,987
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have nurses, but they have way too few doctors and nurses per prisoner to really deal with.

480
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,708
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a huge outbreak,

481
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:47,103
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be a big problem because they just don't have the bandwidth.

482
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:57,047
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too few doctors and nurses employed by the system to deal with a huge outbreak in the Massachusetts state prisons.

483
00:43:57,943 --> 00:43:58,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

484
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:12,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I've heard, I know that a couple of our city councilors here in Somerville, Ben, you and Kevin and JT Scott, and as well as other people have been talking about releasing certain portions of the prison population.

485
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly the the ones who are oh, what's I'm forgetting the term.

486
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I I sometimes call it debtors prison, right?

487
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's people who their pretrial detention.

488
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:23,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

489
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:27,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So they they haven't been convicted of anything and they just can't pay bail.

490
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're held in jail.

491
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:38,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that yes So so despite the fact that they're supposed to actually not not not force people to

492
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:44,956
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay a bail that's unaffordable, they are still requiring bails that are unaffordable to people.

493
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:56,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people in jail, the vast majority, I think it's the majority of the prisoners, jails, we've been talking about prisons, now there's jails, have not actually been convicted of a crime.

494
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:58,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so insane.

495
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:02,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really mind-blowing to me that this is true in America today.

496
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:04,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Rachel Rollins,

497
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:07,266
[SPEAKER_01]: has been working on that.

498
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:08,667
[SPEAKER_01]: She kind of took the lead.

499
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:10,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Peter Kattushian and D.A.

500
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:14,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan are looking at who they can release, but it's taking them a while.

501
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:17,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I think Andrea Harrington is another D.A.

502
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:27,214
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the western part of the state who's also looking into trying to get people released who could possibly, you know, be released.

503
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:34,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And this includes not just the people who are held on bail and are pre-sentencing, there's

504
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,281
[SPEAKER_01]: There's high-risk people with illnesses who should definitely come home.

505
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:41,682
[SPEAKER_01]: There are geriatric prisoners who should come home.

506
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:46,703
[SPEAKER_01]: There are parole-eligible people should be coming home.

507
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:52,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone who's really close to being released should just be released.

508
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:58,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there some way that we can pressure people?

509
00:45:58,086 --> 00:46:01,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a way that folks listening here can help with that?

510
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:17,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, first of all, the DAs are, you know, they're elected, so certainly, as a constituent, please contact every DA, especially the ones who are not acting on this, please contact them.

511
00:46:17,322 --> 00:46:28,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, contact your state reps and your senators, because Lindsay Sabadoza has filed a bill, HD, you can write this down, HD 4963,

512
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:33,209
[SPEAKER_01]: to decarcerate prisoners.

513
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:36,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that people can do.

514
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:39,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get your legislators to support that bill.

515
00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

516
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:47,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to talk a little bit about, we've talked a lot about COVID-19 and how it's affecting people.

517
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:53,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk to us a little bit about what you were working on before COVID-19 and about solitary confinement?

518
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:56,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yes.

519
00:46:56,657 --> 00:47:03,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm part of a group, like I said before, Massachusetts Against Solitary Confinement, which people could also join.

520
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:18,034
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have more members trying to bring attention to the fact that Massachusetts has one of the largest solitary confinement populations

521
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:25,040
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the proportion of prisoners we have, inmates we have in Massachusetts.

522
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:40,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time for the last year where they were really taking a sample, out of 9,000 prisoners, approximately 3,000, a little bit less than 3,000 had been put in solitary confinement in Massachusetts.

523
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And they keep them in there for up to 10 years.

524
00:47:45,354 --> 00:47:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that legal?

525
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:54,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal in Massachusetts, and it's still legal even after the Criminal Justice Act was passed.

526
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:58,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a friend who's visiting someone who was sentenced for 10 years.

527
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:03,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm visiting someone who was sentenced to four years.

528
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:08,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the young man I'm visiting was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

529
00:48:08,943 --> 00:48:15,948
[SPEAKER_01]: He was sentenced to four years in solitary confinement in an incident where nobody was hurt.

530
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,429
[SPEAKER_01]: so where nobody was even injured.

531
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:25,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was an altercation with a correctional officer, but it was a minor altercation.

532
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:29,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, I think you once mentioned to me the limit.

533
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:36,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there a limit under the sort of world human rights?

534
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has a limit that's... Oh, 15 days.

535
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:43,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, according to the...

536
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,339
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, the UN, 15 days is torture.

537
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:54,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And 15 days is nothing.

538
00:48:54,962 --> 00:48:58,124
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even, you know, everybody gets 15 days.

539
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people spend two, three months.

540
00:49:02,308 --> 00:49:07,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lots of people, and for the place where the young man I visit, it's a DDU,

541
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:16,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It's specifically, it's almost a separate prison that's specifically just for long-term solitary confinement.

542
00:49:16,439 --> 00:49:18,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has over a year.

543
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: That is totally insane.

544
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:22,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

545
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:22,961
[SPEAKER_04]: That's horrible.

546
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrifying.

547
00:49:26,282 --> 00:49:33,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've all spent at least six months waiting in solitary confinement for a sentence, and then they're sentenced to at least six months.

548
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they're sentenced to about a year or two years.

549
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:39,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

550
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:41,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

551
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:48,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's end on a slightly better note than that one.

552
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:57,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any better notes than that one in terms of the incarcerated population?

553
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:00,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what do you... Is there anything on the horizon?

554
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:07,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any bills that you think are happening right now, maybe at the state level, that have a good chance of passing?

555
00:50:07,198 --> 00:50:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, Rachel Rollins, you know, she seems pretty good.

556
00:50:11,562 --> 00:50:16,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe through our elected DAs, we're going to be having some positive movement.

557
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:32,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping through DAs like Rachel Rollins, like Andrea Harrington, there is gonna be some movement and they are gonna stop incarcerating so much, so many people in our population are incarcerated who do not need to be incarcerated.

558
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:45,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually did court watch and I'm starting to see the change and I'm starting to see the decarceration of our population, which is the hopeful,

559
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:55,369
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that's happening on our, that's the hopeful, you know, if they're not in prison in the first place, then we don't have to worry about the conditions in prison.

560
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:56,872
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly right.

561
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:57,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That is right.

562
00:50:58,393 --> 00:50:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

563
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:07,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for coming on today and for talking about this incredibly important, I think, too often overlooked topic.

564
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:09,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And also for all the work that you do.

565
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

566
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important.

567
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:14,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to actually go on.

568
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:17,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see if I can get some mamas folks to

569
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:21,900
[SPEAKER_04]: some momma's folks to start writing letters.

570
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one final comment.

571
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:32,049
[SPEAKER_04]: As the mother of a previously incarcerated, I agree with Caroline when she says the medical care is lax.

572
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:37,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Inmates are often not taken seriously and there are longer than average wait times for care.

573
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:39,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

574
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:46,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So medical care in prisons, important topic, especially now.

575
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:50,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we're going to see if we can get some folks to write some letters.

576
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you so much.

577
00:51:52,921 --> 00:51:53,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to talk to you.

578
00:51:54,422 --> 00:51:54,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

579
00:51:56,779 --> 00:52:02,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to close this out, you can always, as you can see, we take comments over YouTube.

580
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We really want to elevate people's stories.

581
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:14,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a story, if anything has been happening to you because of COVID-19, if you've been affected by either the health

582
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: crisis that we have or if you have been affected economically.

583
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:21,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We know a lot of people in the district have.

584
00:52:21,574 --> 00:52:36,586
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there are a lot of students in Medford and Somerville who had to leave school and either are stuck having to pay rent where they're not living or are stuck not having a place to live.

585
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:41,150
[SPEAKER_04]: and then having to find places to live.

586
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,833
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have any stories, please send them in.

587
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about them anonymously.

588
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:48,616
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have you on the show.

589
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:52,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe that good policy is based on

590
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,141
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, hearing directly from what's happening to people.

591
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:11,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, uh, I also think that we help people understand why policy is necessary by really elevating these stories, um, so that we all understand, uh, how policy affects our lives.

592
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:12,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.

593
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:15,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, great to have everybody here.

594
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the end of today's show.

595
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:19,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back next week.

596
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:19,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
