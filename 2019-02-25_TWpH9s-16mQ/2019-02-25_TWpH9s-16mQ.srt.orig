[SPEAKER_08]: Can you move in a little bit, honey?

58
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:11,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we go any further, I'd just like to ask all of you, when we're finished, if you would just go down on the stairs so we can take a group picture with everybody.

62
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next recipient is St.

63
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael's School, and Patrick Coughlin is representing St.

64
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:27,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael's.

65
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,115
[SPEAKER_07]: $2,105.13.

66
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:37,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

67
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Come here, Patrick.

68
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Patrick, come here so your mother can take a picture.

69
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you take a picture?

70
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:49,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Beth?

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:50,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, go ahead.

72
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:50,966
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

73
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:55,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just like to explain how we got these crazy cent numbers.

74
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,054
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens is everything that the school, the kids raise, either through sponsorship, runners,

75
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:06,625
[SPEAKER_08]: or selling the chances, goes 100% back to them.

76
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:12,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Lonergan Insurance and Real Estate and Members Plus, we pay for all the expenses of the school for the race.

77
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,793
[SPEAKER_08]: The shirts, the timer, the advertising, whatever.

78
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:16,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We pay for it.

79
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So they get 100% back.

80
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:29,023
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyone who runs in the race and they don't designate which organization or which school that they would like to have their funds go to, goes in a pool.

81
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,184
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end,

82
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:41,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Elaine Rocha, who's like a dynamo, I wouldn't do this in a million years, she takes that proportion and she divides it so the Roberts gets a certain percentage and it goes down.

83
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,881
[SPEAKER_08]: The more money you raise for yourself, the more money you get out of the pool.

84
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:51,062
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a good incentive for everybody to get their little acts together.

85
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,423
[SPEAKER_08]: The next one is crew.

86
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:53,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Crew we have

87
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:09,296
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Dylan Barbino, Isaac Bassman, Maya Gomez, Aaron Diskin, and Hannah Chin. 2178.09

88
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:32,699
[SPEAKER_08]: The next one is the Columbus School, and Bob Russo is representing Columbus School. 4,902.63.

89
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:55,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next one is the Andrews Middle School, Susan Powers, Liam Antwine, Jen

90
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,374
[SPEAKER_08]: My god, my mind's gone blind.

91
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:25,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Overberg and Hunter Overberg.

92
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:36,224
[SPEAKER_08]: The boys, Hunter and Liam, really did a great job on really trying to raise as much money for the school as they could.

93
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:40,687
[SPEAKER_08]: They sold chances everywhere they could, bake sales, voting days, whatever.

94
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:42,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They really did a good job.

95
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to commend these two boys for what they did. 1,868.51.

96
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:22,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next recipient is the Asian Club, Justin Truong,

[SPEAKER_08]: Wendy Van Vaughn, I'm sorry.

99

[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,696

[SPEAKER_08]: And last year you earned $31,698, so it's only a difference of about $150.

[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll do better and bigger next year.

151
00:13:50,672 --> 00:14:00,700

152
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:12,662
[SPEAKER_03]: They are here tirelessly working on this event and many others that raise money not only for our schools, but like our Alzheimer's Center, our Memory Loss Center.

153
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:18,343
[SPEAKER_03]: They do phenomenal work, and I am gonna join the group someday.

154
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep saying it, I don't know when that is, but I... I have great respect, thank you for all you do.

155
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:42,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And during the festival, we raised $54,000.

156
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:42,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

157
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:42,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Van De Kloot.

158
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:43,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible work.

159
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:46,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Judy, you are such an inspiration to our community.

160
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,844
[SPEAKER_20]: And you and all of your team, Rosemary, all the team, thank you so very much.

161
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:56,346
[SPEAKER_20]: My colleague said it perfectly, so I'll just add my thanks from the bottom of my heart.

162
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:04,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a village, and somebody said earlier, when we had girls on the committee, especially for the festival, this is us, seven of you, right?

163
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:11,391
But the festival was at 12 o'clock, and we still had some girls that, women, as you say, that have been on it for 20 years.

164
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:22,419
So we're always looking for somebody to add to the program, and we need some young people to fit in, so anyone that you know who'd like to join, why don't you fit in,

165
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

166
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:42,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Next we have under Roman numeral 8, item 2, recognition of Columbus Elementary student writers.

167
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:43,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

168
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:43,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell.

169
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,345
So this time I'd like the Columbus grade 5 students to line up please.

170
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Kara Bates is here.

171
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: She's one of the, she is the grade five teacher here with the writers.

172
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:09,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up please, Kara.

173
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:19,578
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a grade five teacher at the Columbus Elementary School and she was working with her students on developing their creative writing skills.

174
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: The children were inspired to be imaginative and innovative and had fun writing, so much fun writing, that when she received, when Ms.

175
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Bates received information from the young writers,

176
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:37,407
[SPEAKER_02]: She challenged them to write a 100-word mini saga for this publication.

177
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:44,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Young writers received 12,000 entries from Texas to California, Ohio to Maine.

178
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:56,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Perception, imagination, and creativity were as important as expression, originality, and the use of language as the students composed their 100-word sagas.

179
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:59,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The following students in Ms.

180
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Bates' class were chosen for this publication.

181
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to acknowledge at this time Ms.

182
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Kay, the principal of the Columbus School, as well as Ms.

183
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:17,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Nancy Sherman Hudson, our elementary assistant principal at the Columbus School, and all the Columbus School fans in the audience.

184
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming.

185
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,142
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, I'd like to read off the names of the winners who will be published soon.

186
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Udom Izone.

187
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:29,651
Okay.

188
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Ismond Petit.

00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Patricia Castillo.

190
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kristen Morris.

191
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So Elliot couldn't be with us, but Elliot and Glacey also won this award.

192
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Spooky Saga Massachusetts Authors is scheduled for publication on March 31st.

193
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The Columbus School will receive a copy of the book.

194
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to our young writers.

195
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: How good?

196
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:53,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful, congratulations.

197
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:14,511
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to say that the members received your stories and we had a great time reading them.

198
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:22,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially things that made me feel a little creepy was things like green-fleshed army and you have been dead for years.

199
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:24,819
[SPEAKER_20]: So a great job kids.

200
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

201
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:37,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo?

202
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:39,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Ms.

203
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:39,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Kretz.

204
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

205
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:41,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

206
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:41,898
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

207
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:42,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

208
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:49,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Item 3, recognition of Arden Ingersoll and Catherine Schmidt for accomplishments in music.

209
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the best job in the world here tonight.

210
00:19:54,766 --> 00:20:01,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to give out all the awards, but at this time I'd like to invite our Director of Fine Arts, Mr. Tony Zignib, to come up front please.

211
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to honor two more students from our music department for their accomplishments, recent accomplishments.

212
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:20,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Catherine Schmidt was accepted to the MMAA Junior Festival.

213
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:26,644
[SPEAKER_01]: She auditioned in Methuen on February 2nd and she was selected to the cello section.

214
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So she'll be rehearsing with

215
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:47,222
[SPEAKER_01]: with other students from around the northeast section of our state, and we'll get to perform with a guest conductor in Wakefield at the Galvin Middle School on March 31st for the MMEA Junior Festival.

216
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:52,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And fewer than half of the nearly 1,000 students who auditioned were accepted.

217
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:53,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a pretty big deal.

218
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost had two.

219
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:01,346
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our trombonists missed the last spot on a tiebreaker.

220
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:05,667
[SPEAKER_01]: But Miss McStone will have to wait till next year to go see her daughter.

221
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,688
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure she'll make it next time.

222
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:12,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a return appearance by Arden Ingersoll.

223
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:16,327
[SPEAKER_01]: He was here a few weeks ago because he was accepted to the senior festival.

224
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:25,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on his audition, he was invited to audition for Allstate, which he did and which he made.

225
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:30,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll be performing at Symphony Hall on March 3 with the Massachusetts Allstate.

226
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Mr. Digny.

227
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,163
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.

228
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:40,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on up, Artie.

229
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, for sure.

230
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:49,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

231
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:55,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see her.

232
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

233
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:57,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

234
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,840
Thank you.

235
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Nice job, Arden.

236
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I love watching you play.

237
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

238
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:20,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

239
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:20,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Nishihara?

240
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:21,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

241
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:21,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Ms.

242
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:22,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Krutz.

243
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:22,909
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

244
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:23,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

245
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:24,270
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

246
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

247
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:27,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper number four.

248
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Could someone move to table?

249
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: He could not be in attendance.

250
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:31,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Tristan could not be here tonight.

251
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to table.

252
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:34,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to table item four.

253
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

254
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:35,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

255
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,399
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

256
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

257
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:43,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Item 5, Recognition of the Contributions of the Class of 1965.

258
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:47,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent will be presenting.

259
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:11,419
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Medford Public Schools would like to thank the class of 1965 for their generous ongoing donations to provide funds to support our students.

260
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:23,845
[SPEAKER_18]: The class of 1965 gives money to pay for T-passes and school supplies for those students who have financial need and the district is grateful for their continued generosity.

261
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:35,897
[SPEAKER_18]: We thank Sharon Diaso, president of the class of 1965, along with her colleagues who were there, which I'll ask to introduce themselves, for spearheading this work.

262
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:39,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, thank you for your continued support of our students.

263
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:44,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

264
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:45,523
[SPEAKER_13]: This does it all.

265
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: This does it all.

266
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,525
[SPEAKER_13]: We can follow up.

267
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

268
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:58,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and also new superintendent, Mayor Vincent.

269
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:03,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I did teach for a while at the high school, a while ago, and it's a pleasure to be here tonight.

270
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,242
[SPEAKER_21]: We were actually very surprised when we got the call from Assistant Headmaster David Bloch about a week ago.

271
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:11,403
[SPEAKER_21]: We were like, this is really unnecessary.

272
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,062
[SPEAKER_21]: We just do it to get together.

273
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:13,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only kidding.

274
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:37,772
[SPEAKER_21]: In the spirit of just the beginning of this, and I'll just take up a couple of sentences of time, because I think some people could benefit from this in case they wanted to start the same type of idea of going from their own class, we're probably going to extend this to maybe an upperclassman and then one lower, because it gets to be really kind of big and organized if you do it two way out.

275
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:40,413
[SPEAKER_21]: We had our 50th class reunion.

276
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,503
[SPEAKER_21]: about four years ago now, and we had wonderful attendance.

277
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:49,026
[SPEAKER_21]: We had about 800 in our graduating class a long time ago.

278
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:58,917
[SPEAKER_21]: So I happened to be at the high school doing an errand maybe a few weeks before that, and I'm looking around, I saw a bench, and I saw something else over here.

279
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,860
[SPEAKER_21]: And I mentioned to a few of my classmates that we've never really done anything.

280
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
[SPEAKER_21]: What is really meaningful?

281
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:19,585
[SPEAKER_21]: And being a part-time instructor now at Barnacle Hill Community College, I noticed during the last decade there were more, quote, if you will, needy kids, more so than when we went to school.

282
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,086
[SPEAKER_21]: We really had milk money sometimes ourselves.

283
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,387
[SPEAKER_21]: So I mentioned it to a few of my pals.

284
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:28,188
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, how about each year we have a brunch?

285
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:37,505
[SPEAKER_21]: and the residue of the ticket money, we start a book bag bus pass fund and it took off.

286
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,491
[SPEAKER_21]: So each year we try to have a very nice brunch.

287
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,109
[SPEAKER_21]: and we raise money that way.

288
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,072
[SPEAKER_21]: This year we were able to give four bus passes in two book bags.

289
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:51,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year we gave four or five bus passes in about six book bags.

290
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:57,880
[SPEAKER_21]: So our brunch will be, again, towards the fall because I had a big surgery and I couldn't orchestrate it this year.

291
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,264
[SPEAKER_21]: But we have wonderful people who attend who are very interested in the students, as I still am.

292
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:06,767
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my classmate, James Pryor, who is originally from Medford.

293
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:11,759
[SPEAKER_21]: And also Thomas Taranti, they went to the Columbus, so they were very proud of those kids tonight.

294
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:17,665
[SPEAKER_21]: So if anyone's thinking of a similar item to gyrate, that's really not a bad idea.

295
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,408
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're hoping it continues as long as I'm alive.

296
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,830
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to thank you for the thanks.

297
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,754
[SPEAKER_21]: It makes us feel good, and we want to continue on.

298
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:26,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

299
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:29,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

300
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,541
[SPEAKER_18]: D'Eso, can you please come forward?

301
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:32,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

302
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:36,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to invite Sharon up and her compadres.

303
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,136
[SPEAKER_21]: So nice to meet you.

304
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:53,657
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll see you one day.

305
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:54,637
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

306
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:55,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

307
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice job.

308
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:57,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

309
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,240
[SPEAKER_08]: On behalf of your class, thank you.

310
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

311
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:04,963
Thank you.

312
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:06,343
Thanks.

313
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good picture.

314
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:19,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

315
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:37,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

316
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:39,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

317
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:43,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

318
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:44,464
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.

319
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:45,344
[SPEAKER_04]: By Ms.

320
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:47,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Van de Kloet, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

321
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:48,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

322
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Van de Kloet, did you wish to speak on this?

323
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:51,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, I did.

324
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:58,088
[SPEAKER_20]: While we're under suspension, I wish to bring information to the committee.

325
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:05,450
[SPEAKER_20]: I was approached by Kirsten Patterson to discuss the potential of doing in-depth

326
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:09,139
[SPEAKER_20]: budget review this year in a slightly different way.

327
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,426
[SPEAKER_20]: We've normally had quick proposals that

328
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:15,272
[SPEAKER_20]: presentations that have come at the school committee.

329
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:25,735
[SPEAKER_20]: She suggested that we might do better to send it to a subcommittee to go for a very thorough, transparent look at the budget.

330
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:28,796
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to ask Christine if she could come forward.

331
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:38,878
[SPEAKER_20]: She suggested that it would come to the, that we would set up the meetings through the personnel subcommittee since 80% or so of the budget is personnel.

332
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:51,509
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the head of personnel, so I just want to make it clear that for me it would be always important that every member realizes that this would be a meeting that they are welcome and encouraged to attend.

333
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,253
[SPEAKER_20]: We debated back and forth what we do with the Committee of the Whole.

334
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,435
[SPEAKER_20]: That puts an obligation on the whole committee.

335
00:28:57,794 --> 00:28:58,334
[SPEAKER_20]: It's difficult.

336
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:01,675
[SPEAKER_20]: There will be expected to be quite a number of meetings.

337
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,738
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's really important is that we always have a certain number of members present to review.

338
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,439
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Christine, could you speak to the proposal?

339
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thank you.

340
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:42,657
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, in the vein of transparency and being able to really go a little bit deeper in conversation and understanding of what some of the goals are for the district and being able to identify that as we're building the budget so that there's an understanding and consensus that while we have already approved certain areas, that means that other areas are going to have to have a balance.

341
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:59,654
[SPEAKER_14]: And by presenting this in a subcommittee format, we can really have some good discussion where this is truly building a budget and showing where we were a year ago, where we are right now, showing actual expenditures from the prior year.

342
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:21,021
[SPEAKER_14]: current expenditures year to date and then build from there, already identifying what we know for the collective bargaining units that have settled thus far and being able to really drill down into some of the concerns that have surfaced throughout the process and being able to

343
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:30,755
[SPEAKER_14]: really see the numbers before the very ending of the fiscal year when we're trying to get an actual budget approved.

344
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:44,005
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were hopeful that we would get support in this new format to really have some honest, good discussions and be able to have open, transparent communication for this process.

345
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:49,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ruggiero.

346
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:51,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for all these meetings.

347
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,465
[SPEAKER_17]: I just was curious, how many times do you anticipate on meeting?

348
00:30:57,206 --> 00:31:03,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So our initial block of meetings, we are identifying six different subcommittee meetings.

349
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:09,500
[SPEAKER_17]: If possible, I mean, I would really like to attend these meetings because I'm very interested in this particular topic.

350
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,208
[SPEAKER_17]: I would prefer it to be as a committee of the whole.

351
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:16,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand perhaps we could vote on that now or we could discuss that.

352
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:17,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this should be tabled.

353
00:31:17,572 --> 00:31:19,153
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't on our agenda this evening.

354
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:26,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone should table this for the next meeting so it's formally written on our agenda and the public has an opportunity to speak on this topic.

355
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to table?

356
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:28,821
[SPEAKER_04]: By Ms.

357
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustone, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

358
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:31,643
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

359
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:32,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

360
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:32,924
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

361
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

362
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

363
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be on the next agenda.

364
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:40,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

365
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:41,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Vander Kloot.

366
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:41,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second?

367
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo?

368
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,216
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

369
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:45,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

370
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:46,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

371
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

372
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:48,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back on the calendar.

373
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Report of committee.

374
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:51,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Support services subcommittee.

375
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo?

376
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:54,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

377
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:59,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Last Monday, was it last Monday?

378
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:00,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

379
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:00,804
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it was.

380
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:05,827
[SPEAKER_16]: We met to just to send the policy to the full subcommittee.

381
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And we agreed to do that.

382
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:16,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I will be scheduling another subcommittee meeting to discuss the issues raised by some of the members.

383
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:17,796
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

384
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

385
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:24,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

386
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

387
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:26,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

388
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:26,779
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

389
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

390
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Report of the superintendent.

391
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Item 1, superintendent's updates and comments.

392
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Am I missing?

393
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:38,571
[SPEAKER_18]: That's correct.

394
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:56,819
[SPEAKER_18]: So as part of my updates and comments, I wanted to start by saying that I'm going to be showing a brief video that kind of captures the work that took place during our learning walks, the mathematics learning walks, the second round.

395
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:10,146
[SPEAKER_18]: I also just wanted to share that later on today, I would be presenting on our 5-6 middle school transition later for those who are interested in that report.

396
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:26,354
[SPEAKER_18]: But as most of you are aware, over the past two weeks, my team and I, along with members of Lesley University, completed our second round of our math learning walks, visiting the Brooks, Columbus, Roberts, and the McGlynn.

397
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:31,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Our former media teacher, Jack Dempsey, put together this video clip.

398
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:48,439
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I just want the school committee to know that he was not available to film when we were at the Brooks School, but we do have footage and photos from all of the schools that we did visit.

399
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:02,371
Yes.

400
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:04,767
Academic discourse.

401
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:50,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Evidence.

402
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:35,649
Everyone should have the master's pamphlet.

403
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:38,672
We're going to be focusing exclusively on all of our productive struggles and so that-

404
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I try to finish it this time.

405
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:52,735
The last thing is Robertson.

406
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:30,922
Hey!

407
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:57,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your patience in watching that video, but I wanted to really focus and share with you this go-around that although you hear that we're talking about math learning walks and focusing on core actions, what does it actually look like?

408
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:02,647
[SPEAKER_18]: And so for the second round, these instructional rounds

409
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:07,248
[SPEAKER_18]: looked significantly different than the ones that took place in the fall.

410
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:13,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Because in the fall, for the sake of time, we tried doing two schools in one day.

411
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:21,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And so in speaking with our partners at Lesley, Patricia said, you know what, we'll make the sacrifice of time.

412
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:26,990
[SPEAKER_18]: let's separate it out so we can spend more time at each school and go deeper.

413
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:39,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And so what you saw were clips that when we conducted these learning walks, we met before the walk to kind of just do a quick overview of what the core actions were.

414
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone got their assigned schedule.

415
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:49,582
[SPEAKER_18]: We went into the classrooms, observed instruction for an hour, and after observing instruction for an hour, we came back.

416
00:43:50,198 --> 00:43:54,202
[SPEAKER_18]: And every group debriefed what they saw.

417
00:43:55,043 --> 00:44:02,551
[SPEAKER_18]: And each school leader gave us specific core actions that they were focusing on with their respective school.

418
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,595
[SPEAKER_18]: So we worked in small groups, looked at our data.

419
00:44:06,094 --> 00:44:11,420
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you saw a lot of stickies up on charts, but that was like part of the main meat of the work.

420
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:25,155
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm very appreciative to Jack for showing the discussions that would happen after observations, how we would debrief as a team and talk about what could next steps look like for that particular school.

421
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope that this

422
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:42,961
[SPEAKER_18]: video piece that you got to see kind of opened your eyes, and I was fortunate that I had spoken with Paulette close to the time that I was doing one of the walks, and she was able to join for one of the walks.

423
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:52,402
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're going to do the walks again at the end of the school year, and so I do want to put it out to all of the school committee members who are interested.

424
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:57,403
[SPEAKER_18]: If your schedules allow, you need about three hours of time to participate

425
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:08,163
[SPEAKER_18]: in a learning walk, if you can even do one, once we have the dates, once all regular testing is done, I will put it out and hopefully be able to have more of you participate.

426
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: in it, but it's truly, I feel it's like revolutionary work.

427
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:18,321
[SPEAKER_18]: We are all using the same language, talking about the instruction.

428
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:28,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And so although instruction was always happening, but now that we have a common language, I think we'll be able to see greater results in a shorter amount of time.

429
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:30,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

430
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:32,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Van de Kloot.

431
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:37,034
[SPEAKER_20]: So as the superintendent mentioned, I was talking to her and asked if I could attend when she mentioned this.

432
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:50,226
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really felt that it was a wonderful opportunity to understand because I didn't, quite honestly, I really didn't understand what the superintendent was getting at when she was saying learning walks.

433
00:45:50,676 --> 00:45:52,297
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, you spent 15 minutes in each class.

434
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:54,878
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thinking, what are you going to find out in 15 minutes and whatever?

435
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:57,640
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was really terrific to be able to go.

436
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:04,143
[SPEAKER_20]: And as I watched this video, I'm sure that I saw things because I was able to participate.

437
00:46:05,704 --> 00:46:19,272
[SPEAKER_20]: For instance, watching a student and understanding that concept of productive struggle was really great to see happening in our classroom, to understand why we want to encourage our teachers,

438
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:23,675
[SPEAKER_20]: to continue to have that grow in our classrooms.

439
00:46:24,036 --> 00:46:33,403
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, if you have the opportunity in the next go-around, I highly would encourage my committee members to go and I'm quite thankful I was at the right place at the right time.

440
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

441
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:38,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

442
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:46,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So having done your second set of learning walks, do you notice,

443
00:46:48,050 --> 00:47:07,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've encouraged, as a committee and through our administrators, to make sure that every school has the same opportunity for growth and is on the same...they're learning the same things across the district, and that one school isn't doing something differently.

444
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:09,963
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency.

445
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:24,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes we're definitely seeing in the beauty one of the comments that was made by Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli when she was comparing one school to another one of the schools we each group

446
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:28,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you were in group two, you might have been observing grade four.

447
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:33,600
[SPEAKER_18]: So you might have had the opportunity to see four different fourth grade classrooms.

448
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:38,886
[SPEAKER_18]: And so for the most part, there's a pacing guide, a scope and sequence.

449
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:40,968
[SPEAKER_18]: The same content should be taught.

450
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:46,013
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you go into different rooms, everyone has their own unique style of teaching.

451
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:51,777
[SPEAKER_18]: but you're seeing the same content being taught to students and able to see how they are responding.

452
00:47:53,078 --> 00:48:03,166
[SPEAKER_18]: In some of the other learning walks, because I didn't give really specifics, I just said we want to observe instruction and the principals were able to design a schedule.

453
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:07,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So we got sometimes you might go to another school and observe

454
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:14,072
[SPEAKER_18]: a third, a fourth, a fifth grade, and maybe a second grade classroom math instruction.

455
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:18,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we were able to see a significant difference.

456
00:48:19,053 --> 00:48:27,855
[SPEAKER_18]: The language, we hear a lot of appropriate academic discourse taking place, official vocabulary.

457
00:48:28,215 --> 00:48:34,177
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, in this go-around, you got to see all of the other directors participating

458
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:40,301
[SPEAKER_18]: in this instructional round because we do plan on scaling up the work throughout the district.

459
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:58,335
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it's important, even though the learning walks are happening at the elementary levels, you saw Headmaster DeLeva, you were able to see Principal Tucci, Principal Downs, Principal Toomey from the other schools, they too came to participate to see what would it look like.

460
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,217
[SPEAKER_18]: So Patricia, who's usually

461
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:06,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Our Leslie partner, who's usually with me, we've been partnering.

462
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:17,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Even she has said she has seen significant difference in terms of from where in the math language, how students were working with math in the fall to now at this midpoint.

463
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:18,788
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very intentional.

464
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:20,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Teachers are using manipulatives.

465
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Teachers are using manipulatives.

466
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,972
[SPEAKER_18]: You saw cutouts, magnets.

467
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:30,796
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't the same exact tool in every single classroom, but students are being given access

468
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:39,537
[SPEAKER_18]: They're multiple modalities, they're using videos, they're using magnets, they have opportunities to draw, they're using small whiteboards.

469
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:48,142
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're really happy to just see intentional practice and intentional attention being given to mathematics.

470
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just had one more question.

471
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:54,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the EL director.

472
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:55,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as well.

473
00:49:56,186 --> 00:50:00,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and I'm wondering if our special education department was

474
00:50:01,644 --> 00:50:06,289
[SPEAKER_03]: present during the learning walks and if they're planning on being a bigger part.

475
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:12,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And do we go into small group settings that are also supposed to be learning, like pull-out classes?

476
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:18,091
[SPEAKER_18]: for math or... Yes, we observe inclusion classes.

477
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:25,079
[SPEAKER_18]: When I've done my walks, I've gone to visit even sub-separate classrooms, depending what the classroom is.

478
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:32,908
[SPEAKER_18]: This particular time, my rounds, I was only in one room that was an inclusion room, but other members of the team

479
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:37,050
[SPEAKER_18]: could have been in rooms that had inclusion going on.

480
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Not everyone's scheduled for this second go around.

481
00:50:42,012 --> 00:50:52,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Not everyone was able to hop in at this second round, but it was open and we intend on scaling it.

482
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:58,560
[SPEAKER_18]: The director of English language learners was there because EL students also take math.

483
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,402
[SPEAKER_18]: And so again, it's using the team

484
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:12,467
[SPEAKER_18]: leveraging members of the team to all work collaboratively towards one end to improve outcomes for all of our students.

485
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:14,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked great.

486
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:16,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

487
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:18,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

488
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:22,132
[SPEAKER_16]: So how are classrooms selected?

489
00:51:22,272 --> 00:51:27,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they selected ahead of time or are all classrooms actually observed?

490
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:38,006
[SPEAKER_18]: So during the learning walks, we had our math coaches and our Fiza Khan, who's our supervisor of math, with us as well.

491
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:47,728
[SPEAKER_18]: So the coaches for this year, we had them focusing on grades three, four, and five at all of the elementary schools.

492
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:52,230
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is their main focus when they are in the schools two days a week.

493
00:51:54,110 --> 00:52:05,943
[SPEAKER_18]: They are, when we do the purpose of the rounds, you know, one of the schools, we had four groups, we had a very large grouping, so we observed 16 classrooms.

494
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:10,468
[SPEAKER_18]: So taking 16 classrooms of a school,

495
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:12,969
[SPEAKER_18]: that would include all third, fourth, and fifth.

496
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:23,474
[SPEAKER_18]: So sometimes you were able to observe mathematics at kindergarten or first grade or second grade in order for everyone to have the opportunity to visit four classrooms.

497
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:33,038
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's 16 classrooms being observed, four rounds, each individual round was 15 minutes long.

498
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:38,281
[SPEAKER_18]: So for all elementary schools, we were able to go into

499
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:42,503
[SPEAKER_18]: third, fourth, and fifth grade classrooms.

500
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:49,106
[SPEAKER_16]: My question really was, is every classroom being observed?

501
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:56,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Every classroom is observed by a school leader, just because we have to follow the evaluation process.

502
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Every classroom is observed, but during a round,

503
00:53:01,788 --> 00:53:03,128
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only 16 classrooms.

504
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:08,310
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there are 30 classrooms, we'll get to like half the school, depending on the total number.

505
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:17,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to make sure that we're not, you know, the principals or whomever's selecting which of those classrooms to select to observe aren't

506
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:22,034
[SPEAKER_16]: choosing their classrooms where they expect the best outcomes?

507
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:24,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no, no, no, yes, every classroom.

508
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:31,878
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm saying sometimes it could be English language learner, whatever the grade level was, they're all teaching the same content.

509
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:46,423
[SPEAKER_18]: And so if you're looking at the standard and you're looking at how students, how the content's being presented to them, how do students have access to the content, and we're using the core actions to ground us in the same language.

510
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:47,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

511
00:53:51,555 --> 00:53:55,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I, that was part one of the report.

512
00:53:55,996 --> 00:54:05,319
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna try to abbreviate what's been happening in Medford over the past week or so, yes, since we just met last Monday.

513
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:09,700
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of our students at the Andrews Middle School, Brianna St.

514
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Germain, met Master Chef Leon.

515
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:19,483
[SPEAKER_18]: About two years ago, Brianna's mother reached out to the chef, asking him to send Brianna an autographed photo.

516
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:24,307
[SPEAKER_18]: He went above and beyond and went to their home and gave Brianna a cooking lesson.

517
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:34,731
[SPEAKER_18]: And she got to see one of his championship shirts received from the Master Chef show, judged by Chef Gordon Ramsay.

518
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:48,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Daniel Pontes Macedo, or Master Chef Leon, grew up in Medford and Somerville and served as a substitute teacher for a time for the Medford public schools.

519
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:53,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Chef Leon and Brianna made a wonderful steak dinner for her family.

520
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:59,574
[SPEAKER_18]: How wonderful that Master Chef Leon took time out of his schedule to spend with a local fan.

521
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:02,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Brianna has a memory that will last a lifetime.

522
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:12,777
[SPEAKER_18]: So although Medford Community Schools is not hosting a February vacation camp this year, they are hosting

523
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:21,209
[SPEAKER_18]: a volleyball camp at the McGlynn School, and there are extended ice skating hours available for all at the La Conte Rink.

524
00:55:21,629 --> 00:55:23,149
[SPEAKER_18]: So we want people to be aware of that.

525
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Parents can find out additional information on our website and blog.

526
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:35,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Last Wednesday night, ninth grade course selection night, was held at Medford High School.

527
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:36,816
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a packed house.

528
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:42,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Students and parents first heard from Headmaster DeLeva and Principal Fallon.

529
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:46,984
[SPEAKER_18]: and then they were able to meet with curriculum directors in the library.

530
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:57,150
[SPEAKER_18]: One parent actually took the time to drop Headmaster DeLaver an email, applauding him and the rest of his staff on a wonderful presentation.

531
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:06,636
[SPEAKER_18]: She loved the fact that the high school and the vocational technical high school had merged and were able to offer so much more to all of our students.

532
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:12,400
[SPEAKER_18]: She expressed how great it was that the vocational technical track of study

533
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,742
[SPEAKER_18]: was no longer deemed a consolation prize.

534
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:19,784
[SPEAKER_18]: She couldn't rave about the course selection night enough.

535
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:26,989
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to say congratulations to the team, Headmaster DeLeva, and all who worked on coordinating that event.

536
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:35,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, last week, last Thursday, there was a vaping presentation and hidden in plain sight.

537
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,896
[SPEAKER_18]: It was held last Thursday night at the McGlynn School.

538
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:43,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Parents attended while their children were enjoying the annual Valentine's Day dance.

539
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:47,647
[SPEAKER_18]: There were over 100 students at the dance enjoying themselves.

540
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:49,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I did pop my head in for a while.

541
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:59,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Approximately 25 parents attended the vaping presentation by Diane Knight, the nurse and director of the Northeast Tobacco-Free Community Partnership.

542
00:57:00,676 --> 00:57:02,657
[SPEAKER_18]: The Tobacco-Free Community Partnership

543
00:57:04,704 --> 00:57:17,526
[SPEAKER_18]: is funded by the Massachusetts Tobacco Cessation and Prevention Program to support communities' efforts to help people quit using tobacco, prevent youth from starting, and protecting everyone from secondhand smoke.

544
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:20,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Her presentation was extremely informative.

545
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:31,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Then parents were escorted to the hidden in plain sight room, where parents could learn how their children might try to hide tobacco or marijuana or other drug paraphernalia.

546
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that I did learn a lot.

547
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:39,561
[SPEAKER_18]: School committee members Kathy Krutz and Paul Russo were also in attendance.

548
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:56,951
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to thank Tony Ray, our Director of Health Services, Rachel Perry, our Director of Health Education, as well as Team Medford, Penny Bruce, who spearheaded the Hidden in Plain Sight presentation, Principal Nick Tucci for hosting and collaborating,

549
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:07,917
[SPEAKER_18]: this wonderful presentation and I think it should be repeated throughout the district because it was truly informative and it can help us keep all of our children safe.

550
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Some Mustang news.

551
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:19,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week we did mention that Tristan Howard won the Northeast Conference title for Indoor Track.

552
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:22,668
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are four regions in the state.

553
00:58:23,192 --> 00:58:29,856
[SPEAKER_18]: And this past weekend, Tristan came in second place in the 55-meter race in the state finals.

554
00:58:30,696 --> 00:58:38,501
[SPEAKER_18]: He qualified for the nationals and will be traveling to Chicago in the early spring sometime in March.

555
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:46,606
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to say congratulations to Tristan again, and he will be joining us on our March 4th meeting.

556
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Professional culture training.

557
00:58:51,025 --> 00:59:04,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Last Wednesday, we had training with staff, but two weeks before that, we hosted professional culture training for both our administrators in the district, as well as our high school and middle school teachers.

558
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:13,623
[SPEAKER_18]: The training was provided by All One Health, our EAP provider, with additional information that was provided by DESE.

559
00:59:14,483 --> 00:59:20,405
[SPEAKER_18]: The professional development session discussed harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying in the workplace.

560
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:27,627
[SPEAKER_18]: It also discussed the importance of reliability and responsibility of educators in a school community.

561
00:59:28,308 --> 00:59:34,810
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a crowded, caring theater with approximately 300 educators who actively participated

562
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:42,334
[SPEAKER_18]: and they professionally pushed the presenters and provided administration with constructive feedback to build upon.

563
00:59:42,714 --> 00:59:46,936
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was very appreciative of their participation and their feedback.

564
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:48,417
[SPEAKER_18]: That was last week.

565
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:52,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week as well, we had some excitement at Medford High School.

566
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,781
[SPEAKER_18]: On Friday, evacuations at Medford High School.

567
00:59:57,482 --> 00:59:59,183
[SPEAKER_18]: So due to an electrical issue,

568
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:06,468
[SPEAKER_18]: and a Trojan Transformer issue, Medford High School had to be evacuated twice during Friday's classes.

569
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:10,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Both times, this was done out of an abundance of caution.

570
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:14,595
[SPEAKER_18]: At no time were students or staff in any danger.

571
01:00:15,976 --> 01:00:19,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Building principals make the call when incidents like this occur.

572
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:26,744
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate that parents and guardians are nervous and want to be sure that their children are safe.

573
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:35,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Please know our goal is to issue notifications with the best information possible, as soon as possible.

574
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:46,067
[SPEAKER_18]: We strongly advise parents to listen to a verbal call from the building administrator or read posts on our blog, Twitter, or website.

575
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:48,249
[SPEAKER_18]: The facts will be listed there.

576
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:55,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Random posts on Facebook about what might be happening do not help anyone in these situations.

577
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,762
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate everyone's cooperation.

578
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:17,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to publicly thank Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent of Finance Christine Patterson, Headmaster DeLeva, Principal Fallon, Director of Building and Grounds John McLaughlin, the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department,

579
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:47,561
[SPEAKER_18]: our assistant principals, Gail Trainor, David Blouk, Stephen Burnham, and Stacey Mulligan, our school resource officer, Rich Zeobro, our security officer, Bill Mazzica, my staff assistant, Emily Lazaro, Eastern Bus Company, and our PR person, Lisa Evangelista, as well as the staff, custodians, all who work together to keep our students safe,

580
01:01:48,493 --> 01:01:55,660
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, a big thank you to the students who were very, very cooperative and paid attention to directions.

581
01:01:56,821 --> 01:02:05,229
[SPEAKER_18]: They made me proud and they did act like true, true Mustangs and I just want to publicly thank them and acknowledge their support.

582
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:17,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, just as a reminder to all our listening audience, that fire lanes around our school buildings are marked clearly for that purpose.

583
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Fire lanes are not for parking.

584
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:27,282
[SPEAKER_18]: The Medford Police will be randomly patrolling the school and ticketing those who might park there.

585
01:02:28,063 --> 01:02:33,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Fire lanes are for the safety of all in our buildings, so please be mindful of this.

586
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:45,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Friday was an example when we had at one point four fire trucks at the high school, police cars supporting us while we were trying to get to the root cause.

587
01:02:46,088 --> 01:02:47,488
[SPEAKER_18]: So please keep that in mind.

588
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:54,210
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to just recognize Saturday was a wonderful event.

589
01:02:54,771 --> 01:03:08,182
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Medford Family Network's annual Valentine's Day Festival, and we had over 300 families that enjoyed the entertainment, food, and especially the ice cream.

590
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:11,065
[SPEAKER_18]: A great time was had by all.

591
01:03:11,585 --> 01:03:13,707
[SPEAKER_18]: A few members of the city council joined.

592
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:20,458
[SPEAKER_18]: with all of the members of our school committee, and I thank all of you for being there, especially for the meet and greet.

593
01:03:21,038 --> 01:03:37,021
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also want to acknowledge our city council members who were there, Rick Carviello, George Scarpelli, Council President John Falco, and Council Vice President Brianna Lungo-Kern, and State Representative Paul Donato.

594
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:38,061
[SPEAKER_18]: They were all there.

595
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:41,262
[SPEAKER_18]: It was really a happy event, a love fest.

596
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:42,602
[SPEAKER_18]: It was wonderful.

597
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:48,988
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to definitely extend a warm thanks to our director, Marie Cassidy.

598
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:52,171
[SPEAKER_18]: She has a heart the size of this room.

599
01:03:53,132 --> 01:04:03,702
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of her staff, the friends of the Medford Family Network for hosting the lovely day and really reaching out to families.

600
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:17,692
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, our family network also had hosted Friday night for family and friends, and again, it was held in gyms one and two at the high school, and featured knuckle bones and lots of games.

601
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:26,995
[SPEAKER_18]: They had over 40 families participate, which amounted to, these were families with multiple children, so there were a couple hundred

602
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:32,832
[SPEAKER_18]: people in the gymnasium participating in that event as well, and it's an excellent event.

603
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:35,454
[SPEAKER_18]: You should really stay tuned to their postings.

604
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:43,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Friday evening, after the excitement of the school day, I had the opportunity to go to the West Manfred Community Center.

605
01:04:44,263 --> 01:04:46,847
[SPEAKER_18]: for their Black History Month kickoff.

606
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:57,885
[SPEAKER_18]: And with February being Black History Month, the West Medford Community Center presented a multimedia celebration that acknowledged African American veterans.

607
01:04:58,747 --> 01:05:01,931
[SPEAKER_18]: There were poetry and spoken words from different genres.

608
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:14,688
[SPEAKER_18]: There was music provided by S Factor, an acapella group from Tufts University, and school committee member Paul Russo was able to be in attendance and attended the full event.

609
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:15,929
[SPEAKER_18]: from 8 p.m.

610
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:16,849
[SPEAKER_18]: to 10 p.m.

611
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,891
[SPEAKER_18]: on Friday night for that kickoff.

612
01:05:19,371 --> 01:05:22,934
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was great to see you there.

613
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:34,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to just make a brief announcement because we know that there are also going to be reports tomorrow about some inclement weather coming our way.

614
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:38,847
[SPEAKER_18]: in the afternoon, late afternoon for dismissal.

615
01:05:39,308 --> 01:05:49,462
[SPEAKER_18]: So in preparation for that inclement weather, we are not having afternoon events at the school.

616
01:05:51,063 --> 01:05:54,765
[SPEAKER_18]: There will not be the enrichment program at the Andrews and McGlynn.

617
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:59,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Families are going to be notified that at dismissal time, we will have regular dismissal.

618
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:15,072
[SPEAKER_18]: We won't be sending late buses, and we'll be doing that for all of our after-school programming tomorrow because we're unsure how it's going to be, but it looks like it's going to be worse in the evening, the evening commute.

619
01:06:15,492 --> 01:06:18,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So we will continue to send notifications out.

620
01:06:19,233 --> 01:06:22,475
[SPEAKER_18]: through phone calls and through our blogspot and website.

621
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:43,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, I'd like to wish all of you a very happy Valentine's Day for you and your families, and happy President's Day, which will be next week, and a restful February vacation, and take advantage, rest, relax, and I look forward to seeing you all in early March again.

622
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

623
01:06:44,644 --> 01:06:45,224
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

624
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:45,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Bird.

625
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:46,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo.

626
01:06:48,693 --> 01:06:54,934
[SPEAKER_16]: a piece of new, I just would like to request a policy be sent to a subcommittee, the technology use policy.

627
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:56,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Could that be sent to the rules subcommittee?

628
01:06:57,595 --> 01:06:58,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And do we need a vote for that?

629
01:06:58,355 --> 01:07:01,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the motion that the technology policy?

630
01:07:02,096 --> 01:07:04,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Technology use policy be sent to the rules subcommittee.

631
01:07:04,277 --> 01:07:05,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sent to the rules subcommittee.

632
01:07:05,677 --> 01:07:09,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second on the motion?

633
01:07:10,058 --> 01:07:10,818
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

634
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:11,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

635
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:12,419
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

636
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:13,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

637
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:13,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

638
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:17,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I just wanted to make one announcement.

639
01:07:17,546 --> 01:07:25,011
[SPEAKER_04]: At 3 o'clock this Saturday at La Conte Rink, we will be paying tribute to Mr. John Welsh, who worked at the rink.

640
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: He was also a Somerville school teacher who passed away about two months ago.

641
01:07:29,574 --> 01:07:30,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Saturday at 3.

642
01:07:31,336 --> 01:07:32,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Please come down.

643
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything he did was for the kids, and we'd like to have a great showing as we unveil a plaque in his name.

644
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:47,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, item six, report on fifth to sixth grade transition.

645
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

646
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:14,118
[SPEAKER_18]: So as I present to you this evening the fifth, sixth grade proposal, I do realize that many parents were wondering what was the district's position going to be.

647
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:29,027
[SPEAKER_18]: In my executive summary, normally the traditional method of choosing a middle school has entrenched misnomers that one middle school is better than the other.

648
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:42,597
[SPEAKER_18]: As an educator and superintendent, I am using my guiding principles of ACE, academic achievement for all, collaboration for all, and equity for all.

649
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:59,745
[SPEAKER_18]: In the vein of equity, it is my firm belief that the quality of education and level of commitment from the teaching staff will afford all students an excellent experience and growth in their educational development.

650
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:07,768
[SPEAKER_18]: In order to ensure equity for all of our students, a cohort model is being implemented.

651
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:17,216
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be a lottery, and 50% of students will be randomly selected from each elementary school, each fifth grade classroom.

652
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:23,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Half the students from each elementary school will go to the Andrews, and half will go to the McGlynn.

653
01:09:25,103 --> 01:09:26,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Understanding the concerns,

654
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:35,126
[SPEAKER_18]: of parents dropping off and picking up at multiple locations, there will be an accommodation for sibling preference.

655
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:49,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, to support the needs of students, if there is an educational service requirement only offered at one middle school, then those needs would be accommodated for placement as well.

656
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:59,842
[SPEAKER_18]: This decision is not made without extensive review of the data and the need for a blended middle school environment.

657
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:17,189
[SPEAKER_18]: For example, the McGlynn Middle School data reveals that 60% of students are economically disadvantaged versus the Andrews Middle School with only 29% economically disadvantaged students.

658
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:29,133
[SPEAKER_18]: There are also vast differences in the number and percentages of ethnic backgrounds of our students that further drives the need for a lottery system.

659
01:10:30,453 --> 01:10:42,501
[SPEAKER_18]: This system will provide all students with the opportunity to learn and share from each other's differences as they develop socially and emotionally in the middle school environment.

660
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:46,445
[SPEAKER_18]: My message is one Medford, one district.

661
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:49,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is fair and an unbiased process.

662
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:57,687
[SPEAKER_18]: This fair and unbiased process will demonstrate the power of equity and the value of a diverse learning environment.

663
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:10,830
[SPEAKER_18]: And the following tables, before you break out the configurations of the schools and what the potential numbers would look like.

664
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm open for questions.

665
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:14,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

666
01:11:15,183 --> 01:11:15,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

667
01:11:17,204 --> 01:11:25,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity to speak to the superintendent about this prior to her presenting this report.

668
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:35,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a very fair way to make sure that both schools have equal opportunity for all students.

669
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I wholeheartedly support this idea, and I also

670
01:11:41,418 --> 01:12:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to talk to the superintendent about an idea that she had when she interviewed with the school committee about the possibility of having one school be a fifth, sixth grade building, and the other school be a seventh, eighth grade building, so that the children are merging, starting in fifth grade and become one group, one class moving forward from that point on.

671
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would like to make a motion on the floor to give

672
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:25,249
[SPEAKER_03]: the superintendent time a few years to look at that and maybe whatever contracts we have to change with teachers or to put a team together to move our district forward in that manner.

673
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking for support from my other members.

674
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:30,564
[SPEAKER_18]: So could I comment?

675
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:36,127
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to comment that I know, as you said, I did present the 5, 6, 7, 8 model.

676
01:12:36,747 --> 01:12:49,773
[SPEAKER_18]: And so with our current enrollment right now, the Andrews and the McGlynn approximately, we're talking about 1,000 students, 500 students at each school.

677
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:57,337
[SPEAKER_18]: And by adding the fifth grade, that would put us at about a little over 1,300 students.

678
01:12:59,178 --> 01:13:12,584
[SPEAKER_18]: which would significantly increase the enrollment at the schools, because as we were talking, that would end up putting 650 students in each building.

679
01:13:13,144 --> 01:13:16,906
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now, the Andrews has like 472, the McGlynn has approximately 450.

680
01:13:16,946 --> 01:13:18,747
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I know we would end up confronting

681
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:30,154
[SPEAKER_18]: a capacity challenge for the size of the building.

682
01:13:31,075 --> 01:13:36,141
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was additional data that I was trying to unearth.

683
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:41,827
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm still always willing to look at other options.

684
01:13:41,927 --> 01:13:45,591
[SPEAKER_18]: But from a physical plant, physical capacity,

685
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:52,803
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking 500, maybe 550, but to go all the way up to 650 students per building, we would come into a space issue.

686
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

687
01:14:01,983 --> 01:14:03,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Vandekloot, you're all set.

688
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:11,746
[SPEAKER_20]: First, Superintendent, I really appreciate your fair and equitable approach to this dilemma that we've had.

689
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,029
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I do believe that it certainly is going to still cause some consternation.

690
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:23,150
[SPEAKER_20]: One specific question, just to start.

691
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:31,093
[SPEAKER_20]: In the past, the McGlynn Elementary students really had a, if they wanted to stay at the McGlynn, they did.

692
01:14:32,257 --> 01:14:39,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Now it appears that this group of students, half of them would be going to the Andrew School.

693
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:39,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that correct?

694
01:14:40,062 --> 01:14:53,290
[SPEAKER_18]: So where we talked about sibling preference, at the McGlynn, since it's already one campus, it would be the option of

695
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:56,410
[SPEAKER_18]: reverse sibling preference for a parent.

696
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:04,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they may have a child in fourth grade and a child in second grade, and so to keep them in one building.

697
01:15:04,794 --> 01:15:11,198
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought about that as well, and I felt like if I said that McGlynn students

698
01:15:12,067 --> 01:15:15,668
[SPEAKER_18]: were required to stay the full eight years at the McGlynn.

699
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:31,074
[SPEAKER_18]: And the remaining three elementary schools, those children would have an option of traveling as a cohort that I felt if we're going to try to be fair, then we should do it for all of the schools.

700
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:39,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to honor sibling preference as long as, you know, if a student is in the school currently,

701
01:15:40,297 --> 01:15:42,659
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, matriculated, enrolled in school at that time.

702
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:55,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was a way to try to say, I didn't want to say the Roberts, the Brooks, and the Columbus, you know, half to the Andrews, and then the McGlynn, you don't have that option.

703
01:15:55,646 --> 01:15:56,847
[SPEAKER_18]: You're required to stay.

704
01:15:56,867 --> 01:16:02,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of felt like if we're going to do it for one, do it for all of them, and just do it fairly.

705
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:20,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, one of the questions we've had in the past had to do with the sibling preference, and I just want to be very clear as we roll this out that the sibling preference of people, and there was a past policy and discussion that happened, and it was around the fact that

706
01:16:21,617 --> 01:16:27,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Parents argued that they had been guaranteed sibling preference for the year after their students.

707
01:16:27,822 --> 01:16:35,888
[SPEAKER_20]: So a child perhaps was going up to the high school and going into 9th grade, but another child was coming in at the 6th grade level.

708
01:16:36,549 --> 01:16:47,678
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reason behind it was that they had spent all that time contributing and building the school, and the parents had relationships which they wanted to continue.

709
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:50,040
[SPEAKER_20]: because of their support of the school.

710
01:16:50,660 --> 01:17:02,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to be clear that as we roll this out, that's one of the things that has arisen in the past that we need to be clear on.

711
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:06,993
[SPEAKER_18]: My recommendation with this current proposal

712
01:17:07,557 --> 01:17:16,742
[SPEAKER_18]: would be sibling preference if you had a rising sixth grader and you had a student in seventh or going into eighth grade.

713
01:17:16,782 --> 01:17:18,103
[SPEAKER_18]: So you need to be enrolled.

714
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:42,915
[SPEAKER_18]: So it couldn't be someone who graduated and you have someone coming up because then you Yep, the whole point is to make it convenient for parents that they're not dropping one student at the McGlynn and one student at another location, but if you're now having one child at the high school then You should be in the lottery just like everyone else It's randomized

715
01:17:43,855 --> 01:17:53,681
[SPEAKER_18]: It's unless your child has a special programmatic need or sibling preference of a sibling currently enrolled.

716
01:17:53,861 --> 01:17:56,762
[SPEAKER_20]: I absolutely understand where you're going, but I just wanted to be clear.

717
01:17:56,782 --> 01:18:01,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the school committee vote from about three or four years ago, correct?

718
01:18:01,225 --> 01:18:02,325
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, right.

719
01:18:02,365 --> 01:18:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a vote taken by... Because there was an issue.

720
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:10,330
[SPEAKER_20]: And in fact, there was a letter and the parents were able to substantiate it.

721
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:12,593
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, policy can change.

722
01:18:12,633 --> 01:18:14,295
[SPEAKER_20]: We just need to be very clear about it.

723
01:18:15,115 --> 01:18:25,805
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing I guess is I'm curious about how you're going to roll this out now after our, I would assume we'll vote on it, but after our approval, how will you sell this to the community?

724
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:31,782
[SPEAKER_18]: So I truly believe that this is the fair way.

725
01:18:31,802 --> 01:18:33,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I have been in the schools.

726
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:35,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been looking at instruction.

727
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:37,285
[SPEAKER_18]: I love being in the field.

728
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:41,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel there is this perception.

729
01:18:41,528 --> 01:18:45,070
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a perception gap about the two middle schools.

730
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:48,533
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, I wish Jessetta McGlynn on.

731
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:54,294
[SPEAKER_18]: I was there Thursday evening, I was there Saturday again.

732
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:57,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Being at the schools, children are learning.

733
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:05,497
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that we have high quality teachers, we have fully licensed, certified teachers across the whole entire district.

734
01:19:06,017 --> 01:19:15,380
[SPEAKER_18]: So no matter what middle school your child ends up, it's not like one school only has licensed teachers and the other school has substitutes.

735
01:19:16,117 --> 01:19:31,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe when I say one Medford, one district, that no matter which school your child goes to, they are going to receive a quality education by teachers that are caring and will push them academically.

736
01:19:32,697 --> 01:19:34,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I think, I mean, I believe that too.

737
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:40,263
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that the other concern that will arise will be the friendship groups.

738
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:46,747
[SPEAKER_20]: My child's over here at this school and all the friends are going over to the other school.

739
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:50,590
[SPEAKER_20]: And to that means, I think that it's really, really important

740
01:19:51,030 --> 01:20:12,556
[SPEAKER_20]: that we do a very concerted effort of understanding, especially now that it's very clear that we're going to have these new mixed groups of students, that we foster activities and create opportunities for kids to get to know new children, and we make that very much part of our goal as we enter this new phase.

741
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:24,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to say, where you were talking about the friends from parents that I've had the opportunity to speak with, one of the things that was said in the past was that

742
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Some students ended up not being able to have even one friend.

743
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:44,977
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you think you have a group and you do 50-50, if you have eight friends, maybe in your cohort it'll be four going to one school, four going to another school.

744
01:20:45,277 --> 01:20:54,940
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is really an opportunity to unify the district because all the students end up together at the high school campus.

745
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,322
[SPEAKER_18]: And they have, right now, the partnership between Principal Downs and Principal Tucci.

746
01:21:01,762 --> 01:21:03,163
[SPEAKER_18]: They're working collaboratively.

747
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:08,146
[SPEAKER_18]: They have after school enrichment program.

748
01:21:08,486 --> 01:21:13,409
[SPEAKER_18]: So they do provide students with opportunities to mingle between the two schools.

749
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:19,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I feel what's most important is that the parents know that their child is receiving

750
01:21:19,654 --> 01:21:32,194
[SPEAKER_18]: a quality education by teachers that are highly, all professional, all certified, and by teachers that are going to provide their child with a quality, rigorous learning experience.

751
01:21:33,652 --> 01:21:35,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

752
01:21:37,053 --> 01:21:51,118
[SPEAKER_17]: This was a major issue to me when I was campaigning for school committee, and I'm really glad to see the beginning motions of resolving the problem, especially the economic and social disparities between the two schools I've always found very troubling.

753
01:21:51,278 --> 01:21:53,179
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have a couple of questions about it, however.

754
01:21:54,682 --> 01:22:04,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Given that some teachers have after school programs at some schools versus other, will students at the McGlynn be able to take an after school program at the Andrews and vice versa?

755
01:22:04,766 --> 01:22:07,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so they have enrichment programs.

756
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:09,909
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of it is with the arts.

757
01:22:11,069 --> 01:22:15,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the offerings are available at both locations.

758
01:22:15,851 --> 01:22:25,775
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's three days a week where they have the late buses, and families choose to allow their students to participate in that enrichment programming.

759
01:22:25,835 --> 01:22:27,496
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an option to the families.

760
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:33,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I don't see any of that changing, any of that going away.

761
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:40,621
[SPEAKER_17]: And also I was concerned before the issue was joining the two schools or having a random lottery.

762
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:42,978
[SPEAKER_17]: was that there were programmatic reasons.

763
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:47,442
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, English learners were assigned to one school and other environments.

764
01:22:47,482 --> 01:22:49,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Will those considerations still apply?

765
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:50,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

766
01:22:50,584 --> 01:23:00,712
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, we will still honor if someone is required to have a certain amount of ESL instruction, they need a specialized program.

767
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:07,996
[SPEAKER_18]: For ELL, they would still be assigned to the McGlynn Middle, because that's where those expert teachers are housed.

768
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:20,303
[SPEAKER_18]: And if students have particular disabilities, if they're part of the TLP program, the TLP program is still, the therapeutic learning program is still housed at the Andrews.

769
01:23:20,844 --> 01:23:30,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So for those pieces, we would take that into consideration, and then the remaining students would be added to the lottery.

770
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:41,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of, I think ultimately this will be this, unless we make a true difference between the two schools, where one has a magnet for one environment and another has a magnet for another environment, which is an option.

771
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:49,192
[SPEAKER_17]: perhaps we should explore, but this probably is the fairest option to make sure that we don't have the same economic disparities that we have now.

772
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:57,455
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I would like to know more about the rollout of this program, and I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we talk more about this issue.

773
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:59,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's excellent, and I think this is a great start.

774
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:08,138
[SPEAKER_17]: I just would like to have more material at hand to see sort of all the steps and implementation, and I want to make sure we can have a forum for community participation.

775
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:11,154
[SPEAKER_17]: before we make an official vote on this plan.

776
01:24:11,274 --> 01:24:13,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I ask when you're saying the steps?

777
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:24,082
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to understand a little bit more about the implementation, and I would like to make sure that the community has an opportunity to buy into the process versus something that's just a surprise at the end of the year.

778
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:28,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Because people are right now, at least two years ago, we're used to being able to choose.

779
01:24:29,146 --> 01:24:33,309
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something that we are going to say, well, you know, it wasn't working for us.

780
01:24:33,349 --> 01:24:34,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We're changing the program.

781
01:24:34,589 --> 01:24:35,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's why.

782
01:24:35,973 --> 01:24:39,915
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure that the community has an opportunity to participate in that conversation.

783
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:43,337
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there a second for my motion?

784
01:24:44,938 --> 01:24:45,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to.

785
01:24:46,299 --> 01:24:52,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to second because I have it written down here that we've always had school choice.

786
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:58,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a little surprised that there's not going to be a selection form.

787
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:00,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that I think

788
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:07,777
[SPEAKER_06]: like the elementary students have always looked forward to getting ready to fill out that middle school selection form.

789
01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:11,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, talking with their friends and picking their schools.

790
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:19,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have students right now that are in fifth grade that might have been looking forward to doing that and they're not gonna get that opportunity.

791
01:25:20,388 --> 01:25:26,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like this is, I mean, I think it's a great way to, you know, to keep

792
01:25:26,973 --> 01:25:31,855
[SPEAKER_06]: everything unbiased and keep everybody in the different schools and meeting everybody.

793
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:38,918
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, it's a very difficult time, you know, moving from elementary school to middle school.

794
01:25:39,878 --> 01:25:45,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't have any prior information about this, so I wasn't expecting it.

795
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought maybe we were going to be doing something like we did last year where

796
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:58,326
[SPEAKER_06]: the school would, you know, the students would fill out their forms, and if there wasn't enough enrollment, then we would do the lottery, the partial lottery.

797
01:25:58,967 --> 01:26:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And, because we did talk about last year that the McGlynn students mostly wanted, is selected, the McGlynn elementary schools because they felt comfortable there.

798
01:26:09,435 --> 01:26:17,600
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do understand it's tough because I understand that you want to split them up to meet other students and they're going to meet them in high school.

799
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little, you know, I'm a little, you know, concerned myself and just a little bit unsure, you know, what's the process and how is the public going to take this.

800
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:35,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm just thinking about that we have school choice and now we're not going to give them that school choice.

801
01:26:36,035 --> 01:26:42,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do want to say, as the school committee, that the final decision will be from you.

802
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:52,562
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do also want to say, I think it would be wrong of me not to say it, that the current system that is in place is a segregated system.

803
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:57,645
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very segregated, and we need to call it as it is.

804
01:26:58,565 --> 01:27:04,908
[SPEAKER_18]: And when you look at the tables, and you see how the schools are divided out,

805
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:17,537
[SPEAKER_18]: We are educating all children, so I just want to formally say that we are endorsing segregation, and that's for the community to hear as well.

806
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:33,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's hard, it's 2019, and this is Medford, but the current system is a segregated system, and it says something about us as a district, so I encourage bringing it to Committee of the Whole,

807
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:38,506
[SPEAKER_18]: But the final decision will be the decision of the school committee.

808
01:27:41,127 --> 01:27:42,668
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to say that.

809
01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:46,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo?

810
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:54,434
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to also refresh our memories of last week when we found that 60 of the eighth graders at the McGlynn are going on the trip.

811
01:27:55,488 --> 01:28:00,854
[SPEAKER_16]: and 128 from the Andrews are going on the same trip with almost the same enrollment.

812
01:28:01,435 --> 01:28:05,340
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's segregation in every way that that word can be used.

813
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:10,025
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my mind, it's completely unacceptable, even if the public isn't happy about it.

814
01:28:10,626 --> 01:28:13,309
[SPEAKER_16]: So I fully support this.

815
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:15,952
[SPEAKER_16]: And in fact, I emailed the superintendent probably

816
01:28:16,675 --> 01:28:20,418
[SPEAKER_16]: making her think I was in her office with her or something, saying, when are we going to do this?

817
01:28:20,438 --> 01:28:22,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we should do this, what she's proposing.

818
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:24,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And I couldn't support it more.

819
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:25,983
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

820
01:28:26,744 --> 01:28:26,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

821
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:30,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Opara, our school committee representative from Medford High School.

822
01:28:30,647 --> 01:28:32,970
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have two things to say very quickly.

823
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:39,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not really go through the Medford public middle school elementary school system.

824
01:28:39,197 --> 01:28:47,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to a charter school, but I did babysit someone who is in the Medford middle school right now, and I babysat her through elementary school.

825
01:28:48,342 --> 01:29:00,165
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought it was very interesting, because I remember her getting ready for middle school and talking about how she's going to, her friend, who was a different race from her, is going to be going to the McLean, and she'll be going to the Andrews.

826
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:03,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was very interesting that it split up.

827
01:29:03,106 --> 01:29:07,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't understand how it was split up, and what happened, and why that is.

828
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:15,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And the girl I babysat, she was from a very prominent background, where her parents were very comfortable.

829
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:25,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's one thing I was exposed to, apparently, that I didn't really understand before, and not going to Mefford School District.

830
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:29,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I, myself, went to a charter school, as I stated previously.

831
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:35,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And since coming to Mefford High School, I understand why people don't really like charter schools.

832
01:29:36,894 --> 01:29:39,296
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a lot different from what people expect.

833
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:46,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And the thing is that it is unfair and a lot of chances that people get different chances, that people

834
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:52,264
[SPEAKER_15]: that it's a different group of people, a selected core group of students in one place.

835
01:29:53,005 --> 01:30:07,661
[SPEAKER_15]: And hearing this tonight and seeing that there are disparities in each school, that there's one school that more kids are benefiting from, like 128 students are going on the same trip that only 60 students from another school are able to go to.

836
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:09,142
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not saying that

837
01:30:10,165 --> 01:30:16,693
[SPEAKER_15]: There is some overlying problem that maybe we're not looking at, but you said it is a segregated system.

838
01:30:17,594 --> 01:30:24,323
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it is something that needs to be addressed because Medford calls out the charter school system.

839
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:47,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And to have one school system where it's like only 29% of students are economically disadvantaged and another school system where 60% of students are economically disadvantaged seems as if Medford has its own charter school, where kids are able to enroll into a school where they're with a greater

840
01:30:50,803 --> 01:30:53,706
[SPEAKER_15]: a better population of students, for lack of better words.

841
01:30:54,486 --> 01:31:02,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just think it's unfair because since coming to Medford High School, I see all the things that, you know, at the end of the day, you're going to end up at Medford High School.

842
01:31:02,673 --> 01:31:10,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have so much opportunity around you to be better people and to get to know each other and do all these great things and to really

843
01:31:11,604 --> 01:31:21,629
[SPEAKER_15]: put a division in that when they're so young and have them see that maybe have students feel who go to one school feel like they're not good enough as other students.

844
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:27,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand how that's unfair, and I understand that it is something that needs to be fixed from what I can see.

845
01:31:28,072 --> 01:31:28,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

846
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:30,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

847
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:31,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Your honest comments.

848
01:31:34,315 --> 01:31:35,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto, next.

849
01:31:36,136 --> 01:31:36,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

850
01:31:38,887 --> 01:31:53,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to remind people when the new schools were built, part of the charter, the request to build the new schools was based on diversity in those buildings.

851
01:31:54,585 --> 01:31:57,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we received funding for those schools because of that.

852
01:31:57,967 --> 01:31:59,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Racial balance plan we had to enact.

853
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:03,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really important piece of our new schools.

854
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know they're not new anymore, and we don't receive federal funds anymore.

855
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:12,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea, the reason we received it, because it was such a great idea.

856
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:18,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we lost that along the way, we maybe need to renew that at this point.

857
01:32:21,183 --> 01:32:24,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as everybody knows, I do work at a charter school.

858
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:31,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's students from all different socioeconomic backgrounds.

859
01:32:31,687 --> 01:32:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And the diversity goes up and down depending on the year and how many families love it and apply for their children.

860
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:46,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been there for 24 years and seen those ups and downs.

861
01:32:46,714 --> 01:32:49,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing that a little bit right now with our middle schools.

862
01:32:50,205 --> 01:32:55,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be McGlynn was the school to go to when my children were going to middle school.

863
01:32:55,848 --> 01:32:58,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was the Andrews, and it would bounce back and forth.

864
01:32:59,469 --> 01:33:09,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if we ever stopped and looked at it so deeply and see the lasting effects of it.

865
01:33:09,974 --> 01:33:19,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is our opportunity to make sure that all children are given every opportunity

866
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:26,007
[SPEAKER_03]: for the best education and to be surrounded by all different types of people in their school.

867
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:29,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to lose this opportunity.

868
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:49,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I think starting now, February, by doing a mailing, doing a phone call, maybe doing a meeting at each elementary school for fifth grade class night or whatever, whichever way we do it, if we do all of those things and make sure we do great outreach and we just, you know, I'm sure the superintendent will

869
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:50,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will be fine.

870
01:33:50,873 --> 01:34:04,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll plot a plan with the other administrators and say when we do, you know, open houses at both buildings just so parents can see both buildings, they should still do those because your child's going to be going to a different building.

871
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:11,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And at those opportunities, just remind people that there is a new way of how we're doing this.

872
01:34:11,569 --> 01:34:12,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get the word out.

873
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:15,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will be fine.

874
01:34:15,051 --> 01:34:18,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that there will be some areas or some students that

875
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:26,405
[SPEAKER_03]: not with their friends and, you know, we can handle things as they come.

876
01:34:26,525 --> 01:34:31,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, change is always a little bit hard, but then it's the new way.

877
01:34:32,587 --> 01:34:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

878
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:33,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Vander Kloot.

879
01:34:34,088 --> 01:34:42,791
[SPEAKER_20]: So earlier tonight, we in subcommittee talked about sort of the guiding principles of the Medford School Committee.

880
01:34:43,491 --> 01:34:48,413
[SPEAKER_20]: And what really we said was that we were here for all students and to make sure

881
01:34:49,137 --> 01:34:52,118
[SPEAKER_20]: that their educational opportunities were the best for them.

882
01:34:53,218 --> 01:35:02,440
[SPEAKER_20]: And if I go back to that guiding principle and I look at what the superintendent just presented to us, I see that there may be some short-term pain.

883
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:14,362
[SPEAKER_20]: The long-term gain of making an equitable middle school environment is where we need to go for the benefit of all students.

884
01:35:14,382 --> 01:35:17,043
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that my colleague

885
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:23,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Ruggiero might like some more time to digest it and to talk a little bit about rollout.

886
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:39,396
[SPEAKER_20]: On the other hand, I am pulled because I would also like to affirm the policy and say that we should move forward and then have a subcommittee meeting to talk about what kind of presentations we're going to have.

887
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:45,658
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would like to, and I'm just trying to figure out the right rules of order to do this,

888
01:35:47,731 --> 01:35:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: His would come first.

889
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:49,892
[SPEAKER_20]: His would come first.

890
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:51,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I change yours?

891
01:35:51,693 --> 01:35:51,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

892
01:35:51,973 --> 01:35:53,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be amenable?

893
01:35:55,255 --> 01:35:57,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Agiro, point of information.

894
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:58,818
[SPEAKER_17]: My concern is this.

895
01:35:59,798 --> 01:36:03,801
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we absolutely, most of us can agree that the system that we have now is not working.

896
01:36:06,222 --> 01:36:19,788
[SPEAKER_17]: is I think that there's another option that might be worth exploring, and that would have a magnet school for one environment, and a magnet school for, let's say, math or science, and a magnet school for language arts or humanities.

897
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,249
[SPEAKER_04]: But that wouldn't be for September.

898
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:23,710
[SPEAKER_04]: That would take so long to get that into place.

899
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:28,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand completely, but it would be, once again, to get a sense of rollout, I think is important.

900
01:36:28,592 --> 01:36:35,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you have four friends, and you have a cohort of four peers that you've always been with,

901
01:36:35,515 --> 01:36:38,558
[SPEAKER_17]: for whatever reason, it's not mathematically impossible.

902
01:36:38,578 --> 01:36:44,804
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's probable that there will be groups of friends split up where one kid's at one school and the rest of the group's at the other.

903
01:36:45,004 --> 01:36:45,925
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just going to happen.

904
01:36:46,906 --> 01:36:48,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are options.

905
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:50,489
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure that we're making the right choice.

906
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:55,705
[SPEAKER_17]: If this is a one-year kind of deal while we discuss other things, I'd be a little bit more comfortable.

907
01:36:56,325 --> 01:37:00,306
[SPEAKER_17]: But once again, I mean, I certainly share the superintendent's concerns.

908
01:37:01,126 --> 01:37:03,107
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an important issue for me during the campaign.

909
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's still an important issue for me.

910
01:37:05,728 --> 01:37:12,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure that we're doing this in the right way and exploring all options versus like, oh, this is the new normal.

911
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's all do it now.

912
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:14,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

913
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:14,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustone.

914
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:20,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the lottery has been long needed.

915
01:37:21,838 --> 01:37:29,281
[SPEAKER_10]: The superintendent's predecessor had told me that every year it went back and forth with which school was more popular, like Member DiBenedetto said.

916
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:31,882
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not addressing the issue.

917
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:33,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Paulette said it perfectly.

918
01:37:33,982 --> 01:37:34,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be painful.

919
01:37:35,223 --> 01:37:36,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a fifth grader.

920
01:37:36,363 --> 01:37:39,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe she'll end up at McGlen and her three siblings went to the Andrews.

921
01:37:39,765 --> 01:37:42,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to live with that if it's at doing the right thing.

922
01:37:42,486 --> 01:37:43,586
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a justice issue.

923
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:44,446
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't done it.

924
01:37:45,847 --> 01:37:46,207
[SPEAKER_10]: We've never

925
01:37:46,746 --> 01:37:52,253
[SPEAKER_10]: bite the bullet before in the past, I'm appreciating the superintendent saying this is the right thing to do by our children.

926
01:37:53,174 --> 01:37:55,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand you want to make sure it's rolled out well.

927
01:37:55,157 --> 01:37:59,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I have great confidence the superintendent will make sure it's rolled out well, that the parents are informed.

928
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:04,128
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is my third year on the school committee and it's been frustrating every year because

929
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:06,682
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, we're not a school choice program.

930
01:38:07,723 --> 01:38:10,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Your predecessors say last year that we're a school choice.

931
01:38:10,664 --> 01:38:12,865
[SPEAKER_10]: No elementary schools you get to choose.

932
01:38:13,146 --> 01:38:14,807
[SPEAKER_10]: You go by where they tell you live.

933
01:38:15,527 --> 01:38:19,109
[SPEAKER_10]: We've never followed school choice as it's really the definition of it.

934
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:24,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So I understand we need to make sure it's rolled out well, but this needs to be done.

935
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:30,295
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a long time, and I'm tired of the schools going back and forth depending on personnel issues.

936
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:35,681
[SPEAKER_10]: If we have equal number of kids at both schools, it shouldn't matter about who the administration is.

937
01:38:35,721 --> 01:38:37,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the kids in the classroom who make the culture.

938
01:38:37,842 --> 01:38:39,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

939
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:41,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

940
01:38:41,204 --> 01:38:42,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Vander Kloot, you're all set?

941
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You blinking again?

942
01:38:43,045 --> 01:38:43,305
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

943
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:52,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So just in terms of- There's a motion on the floor to send this to Committee of the Whole to discuss the rollout and possibly other options.

944
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:54,171
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a second, I believe, by Ms.

945
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:54,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Kretz.

946
01:38:55,415 --> 01:39:02,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we change the committee of the whole to discuss the rollout so that we can find out how we're going to meet the community?

947
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:04,022
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Mr. Ruggiero's resolution.

948
01:39:04,222 --> 01:39:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to him to amend it or change it.

949
01:39:09,086 --> 01:39:10,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll withdraw for now.

950
01:39:12,209 --> 01:39:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Community member, please announce your name and address, please, for our record.

951
01:39:16,052 --> 01:39:16,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

952
01:39:16,412 --> 01:39:19,735
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Melanie McLaughlin, and I live on Alston Street in West Medford.

953
01:39:20,215 --> 01:39:22,837
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had three children that have attended the Brooks Elementary School.

954
01:39:24,512 --> 01:39:27,395
[SPEAKER_12]: One at the Andrews, one at the McGlynn, and then ultimately the high school.

955
01:39:28,236 --> 01:39:32,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to add, I could not get up in this scenario.

956
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to, for those of you who know me.

957
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:39,503
[SPEAKER_12]: know that I do care very much about social justice and equity and equality of opportunity for all children.

958
01:39:40,123 --> 01:39:52,507
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did have to get up and say, when people were talking about how do we talk about this, I think, you know, as in all situations with education, the data tells a story, the data speaks for itself.

959
01:39:52,967 --> 01:39:53,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the data.

960
01:39:54,067 --> 01:39:54,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a moment.

961
01:39:54,668 --> 01:39:59,429
[SPEAKER_12]: We were looking at the data in the audience and there are people in the audience that frankly are stunned by this data.

962
01:40:00,233 --> 01:40:02,555
[SPEAKER_12]: It does tell a story and it tells a very important story.

963
01:40:02,595 --> 01:40:05,998
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a segregated system and it's not a socially just system.

964
01:40:06,418 --> 01:40:14,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I would also ask that the school committee consider taking it a step further in terms of thinking about students with disabilities in this scenario as well.

965
01:40:14,885 --> 01:40:17,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, I understand the programmatic elements.

966
01:40:17,327 --> 01:40:18,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the budgeting concerns.

967
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:20,821
[SPEAKER_12]: when we're talking about programmatic elements.

968
01:40:21,241 --> 01:40:22,842
[SPEAKER_12]: But all means all.

969
01:40:23,602 --> 01:40:32,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Every student should have, you know, the opportunity to have the randomization and the experience of being at any of the schools, not one or the other.

970
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:35,104
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's the school that the kids with the disabilities go to.

971
01:40:35,544 --> 01:40:36,084
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not.

972
01:40:36,424 --> 01:40:37,404
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not okay either.

973
01:40:37,804 --> 01:40:43,645
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, but when we talk about inclusive classrooms, what does that mean for the other classrooms?

974
01:40:44,045 --> 01:40:44,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they exclusive?

975
01:40:45,746 --> 01:40:47,586
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk about even segregated,

976
01:40:48,378 --> 01:40:50,241
[SPEAKER_12]: classrooms, what does even mean?

977
01:40:50,261 --> 01:40:54,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I really do think we need to take this another step and really be looking at this as a whole.

978
01:40:55,248 --> 01:40:56,970
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate the opportunity for you to let me speak.

979
01:40:57,170 --> 01:40:57,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

980
01:40:57,411 --> 01:40:57,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

981
01:40:59,033 --> 01:40:59,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

982
01:40:59,253 --> 01:40:59,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Opara.

983
01:41:00,315 --> 01:41:00,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hello.

984
01:41:02,508 --> 01:41:21,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I came, I'm not sure if I mentioned this, I came to the school, Medford High School last February, and one thing I noticed was that there were a lot of different enclaves in the high school, racial enclaves, ethnic enclaves, and so forth, and it was not something I was very used to, having gone to a very homogenous school.

985
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,529
[SPEAKER_15]: groups, schools before.

986
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:33,155
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I've been working with Mr. DeLeva as a reason to address the issues of enclaves.

987
01:41:33,656 --> 01:41:40,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do think that situations like this where you have different schools and they're different

988
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:50,817
[SPEAKER_15]: socioeconomic standings, greatly different socioeconomic standings in each school does contribute to the issue of enclaves in the future.

989
01:41:51,517 --> 01:41:59,904
[SPEAKER_15]: You are looking at seniors in high school who have gone to school with each other for the past four years and have never met each other, have never talked to each other.

990
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:02,446
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are things that are enforced.

991
01:42:02,606 --> 01:42:04,928
[SPEAKER_15]: And they go on past high school.

992
01:42:04,948 --> 01:42:06,409
[SPEAKER_15]: They continue on to college.

993
01:42:06,429 --> 01:42:08,151
[SPEAKER_15]: They continue on to their adult life.

994
01:42:08,651 --> 01:42:09,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's sad.

995
01:42:10,973 --> 01:42:25,241
[SPEAKER_15]: not being exposed to a multitude of cultures, a multitude of ethnicities is something that should not happen, especially when you come from Mecca, which is such a diverse community.

996
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:39,228
[SPEAKER_15]: And to combat the issue of enclaves that we do deal with in the school, and it's very apparent, and it's a very difficult situation that we have to deal with, I think this is something that has to be done.

997
01:42:42,217 --> 01:42:43,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo's up next.

998
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

999
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1000
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:46,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.

1001
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:47,742
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so proud.

1002
01:42:47,782 --> 01:42:48,483
[SPEAKER_16]: That was excellent.

1003
01:42:49,104 --> 01:42:50,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I have less to say.

1004
01:42:50,725 --> 01:42:50,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1005
01:42:50,945 --> 01:42:52,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get up and clap.

1006
01:42:52,147 --> 01:42:53,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1007
01:42:54,128 --> 01:43:00,394
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue of all meaning all, I think, is very, very important and why I do think that the 5678, my colleague

1008
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:12,480
[SPEAKER_16]: had suggested a motion to consider that, although I think a few years is perhaps a little bit of a long term.

1009
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:22,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would be nice to understand what our options really are about getting all the kids together as early as possible.

1010
01:43:23,622 --> 01:43:30,784
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, when I spoke to the director of EL, and I believe the director of special education, a 4, 5, 6, sorry, a 5, 6, 7, 8 model

1011
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:38,429
[SPEAKER_16]: It, at least for EL, solved a lot of problems.

1012
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:41,491
[SPEAKER_16]: And certainly, all the kids would be in one place.

1013
01:43:41,791 --> 01:43:45,834
[SPEAKER_16]: So the services issue, I think, would automatically resolve itself.

1014
01:43:46,354 --> 01:43:54,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether or not we physically have the physical plant to handle that, I think we really should look at that in depth.

1015
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:58,082
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to make a motion that

1016
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:59,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you seconding Erin's?

1017
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:02,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm seconding Erin's, and she'll let me change it from a few years out, too.

1018
01:44:02,674 --> 01:44:12,402
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the superintendent responded to Erin from a space needs analysis, that the extra grade, the whole fifth grade being in one, he added another.

1019
01:44:12,422 --> 01:44:18,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but what about putting all of the 337 fifth graders?

1020
01:44:18,347 --> 01:44:19,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Added into the middle schools.

1021
01:44:20,049 --> 01:44:22,050
[SPEAKER_16]: And how many kids are at the McGlynn Elementary?

1022
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:24,773
[SPEAKER_18]: McGlynn Elementary.

1023
01:44:27,106 --> 01:44:29,388
[SPEAKER_04]: How many students are in elementary school?

1024
01:44:29,408 --> 01:44:29,388
100?

1025
01:44:29,448 --> 01:44:30,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Under 100, I would say.

1026
01:44:30,289 --> 01:44:30,629
[SPEAKER_04]: What about 70?

1027
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:32,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it that small?

1028
01:44:32,671 --> 01:44:33,091
[SPEAKER_04]: 70, maybe?

1029
01:44:33,272 --> 01:44:36,795
[SPEAKER_18]: No, all elementary schools have approximately 500 students as well.

1030
01:44:36,815 --> 01:44:36,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1031
01:44:36,995 --> 01:44:37,675
[SPEAKER_18]: The fifth grade.

1032
01:44:38,176 --> 01:44:42,019
[SPEAKER_18]: The fifth grade class is 86 students, I believe, at the MacLennan.

1033
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:47,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if we're going to take the principle of all equals all,

1034
01:44:53,130 --> 01:45:08,499
[SPEAKER_16]: to do something with the facilities to really get to all is all, or is it better to double the special education budget, which is a totally impossible thing I recognize.

1035
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:14,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Some kids having the lottery and some not having the lottery isn't fair, period.

1036
01:45:14,883 --> 01:45:17,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's nobody who thinks that's fair, right?

1037
01:45:17,624 --> 01:45:20,486
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it would be good to have a number.

1038
01:45:21,477 --> 01:45:27,119
[SPEAKER_16]: for what it would look like to resolve that, so that really all the children have the lottery.

1039
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:28,120
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the dollar?

1040
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we talking $70 million more a year?

1041
01:45:30,401 --> 01:45:32,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we talking $700,000 more a year?

1042
01:45:32,821 --> 01:45:34,062
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1043
01:45:34,082 --> 01:45:35,402
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anybody knows.

1044
01:45:35,643 --> 01:45:37,623
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need a number so we can decide.

1045
01:45:37,803 --> 01:45:40,585
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fifth and sixth together, and seventh and eighth in another school?

1046
01:45:40,605 --> 01:45:41,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like a projection.

1047
01:45:41,425 --> 01:45:43,166
[SPEAKER_10]: A projection of how it would roll out.

1048
01:45:43,186 --> 01:45:45,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Or EL in both places, and special ed.

1049
01:45:46,067 --> 01:45:46,447
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1050
01:45:47,177 --> 01:45:50,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's pretend you had two kids in middle school on the autism spectrum.

1051
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:51,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that's not real.

1052
01:45:52,219 --> 01:45:56,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of putting them all in the same school, you've somehow managed to do it in both schools.

1053
01:45:56,682 --> 01:46:08,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's got to be a number that we can, we have to be able to decide what that number is so we can decide that all is just too expensive for Medford right now.

1054
01:46:09,728 --> 01:46:13,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is, which is what we've decided right now without knowing what the number is.

1055
01:46:14,851 --> 01:46:15,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean,

1056
01:46:17,013 --> 01:46:24,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess, what are our options and what would it cost the EL department to have all of those services in both schools?

1057
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,481
[SPEAKER_16]: I had two other quick questions.

1058
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:33,903
[SPEAKER_16]: One, the open houses, I presume, will still happen.

1059
01:46:35,044 --> 01:46:35,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes?

1060
01:46:36,084 --> 01:46:36,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1061
01:46:37,445 --> 01:46:45,250
[SPEAKER_16]: And my other question was, we should be able to do the lottery much, much earlier.

1062
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:54,692
[SPEAKER_16]: than previously because, well, than last year, obviously, because we aren't going to be worried that there's going to be like a whole bunch more kids at one school or the other.

1063
01:46:55,252 --> 01:47:03,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, as kids come and go from registration, we can just, oh, this school needs the next kid, this school needs the next kid.

1064
01:47:04,074 --> 01:47:11,515
[SPEAKER_16]: So we should be able to do this much earlier, perhaps even before open houses, which would make the experience

1065
01:47:13,499 --> 01:47:16,680
[SPEAKER_16]: sort of what it was when we had this regular choice.

1066
01:47:17,441 --> 01:47:21,142
[SPEAKER_16]: The kids who go to the Andrews are the kids that are going to the Andrews for open house.

1067
01:47:22,023 --> 01:47:29,266
[SPEAKER_16]: And based on my experiences last year, parents who knew they were going to select the Andrews went to the Andrews.

1068
01:47:30,086 --> 01:47:32,487
[SPEAKER_16]: And they didn't go to the McLean open house and vice versa.

1069
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:39,490
[SPEAKER_16]: So I also know that neither one of those schools can handle all of the families

1070
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:42,923
[SPEAKER_16]: the entire district in one night.

1071
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:43,924
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no parking.

1072
01:47:44,204 --> 01:47:45,145
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no way to do it.

1073
01:47:45,245 --> 01:47:53,371
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can get the lottery before the open houses, I think that would be an excellent thing to do.

1074
01:47:54,672 --> 01:47:55,473
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a motion.

1075
01:47:55,593 --> 01:47:57,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you have to figure out whether you can do it.

1076
01:47:57,274 --> 01:48:01,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the decision's already been made for you, assuming this policy is adopted.

1077
01:48:01,137 --> 01:48:01,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, right.

1078
01:48:02,098 --> 01:48:02,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1079
01:48:02,278 --> 01:48:02,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Van de Kloot.

1080
01:48:05,239 --> 01:48:09,022
[SPEAKER_20]: To my colleague, Mr. Rousseau, I think that there's some pragmatic questions.

1081
01:48:09,523 --> 01:48:25,755
[SPEAKER_20]: We started this year with a new superintendent, and she certainly needed some time to get on board and to learn the ropes and learn all the people and start with an instructional initiative with the math, which we saw earlier.

1082
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:39,452
[SPEAKER_20]: If there was clearly a simple answer other than this in terms of the size or whatever, I think she would have presented it tonight or suggested it.

1083
01:48:40,373 --> 01:48:48,322
[SPEAKER_20]: The in-depth that you speak of I think is probably worthwhile doing for the whole committee and community to really understand.

1084
01:48:49,223 --> 01:48:56,766
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think that there's a question that is before us in the immediate, and that is next year.

1085
01:48:57,266 --> 01:49:03,848
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think it's realistic to have had the superintendent come back and try and figure out all of those in-depth questions.

1086
01:49:04,168 --> 01:49:06,849
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we need to set that as a goal.

1087
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:09,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah?

1088
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:11,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Russo, point of information.

1089
01:49:11,571 --> 01:49:17,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I fully support this.

1090
01:49:18,047 --> 01:49:27,776
[SPEAKER_16]: But the economically disadvantaged students that we're trying to level out so that all of the students get to experience each other, which is really, really important.

1091
01:49:28,716 --> 01:49:31,819
[SPEAKER_16]: They also all need to experience kids on the autism spectrum.

1092
01:49:32,059 --> 01:49:37,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And they all need to experience all kinds of kids, kids who don't speak English.

1093
01:49:37,324 --> 01:49:39,506
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're not.

1094
01:49:39,966 --> 01:49:44,070
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure that I would, I just think that that,

1095
01:49:45,236 --> 01:50:01,451
[SPEAKER_16]: that point is important is that there's not something special about the kids who are economically disadvantaged or advantaged and how they need to mix compared to how all of those kids also need to mix with kids with disabilities and who don't speak English as a first language.

1096
01:50:01,551 --> 01:50:03,893
[SPEAKER_16]: So to me, it's exactly the same thing.

1097
01:50:04,581 --> 01:50:06,722
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a different, just because it's expensive.

1098
01:50:07,103 --> 01:50:07,763
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with you.

1099
01:50:07,883 --> 01:50:15,007
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just trying to figure out the timeline, the pragmatic point of all of this, is trying to say.

1100
01:50:15,087 --> 01:50:24,813
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe we certainly want to, as we're doing this, we certainly want to be looking at that questions in terms of either our special education or our EL students.

1101
01:50:25,533 --> 01:50:28,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a way to better incorporate them into the schools?

1102
01:50:30,696 --> 01:50:33,177
[SPEAKER_20]: and equal opportunities.

1103
01:50:34,598 --> 01:50:49,323
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that the question before us right at the moment is, I hear that there is a general feeling amongst members that this is the right thing to do, that the superintendent has come to us

1104
01:50:49,873 --> 01:50:53,075
[SPEAKER_20]: and she's shown us numbers, numbers speak.

1105
01:50:53,715 --> 01:50:54,896
[SPEAKER_20]: We've talked about equity.

1106
01:50:55,096 --> 01:50:57,157
[SPEAKER_20]: We've talked about doing the right thing for all students.

1107
01:50:57,378 --> 01:51:03,641
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear that we actually have some level of consensus in terms of what we need to do.

1108
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:19,051
[SPEAKER_20]: What I don't hear consensus on yet is whether we're going to approve the policy tonight and then have a subcommittee, or as the motion states, first have a subcommittee meeting and then approve the policy.

1109
01:51:19,803 --> 01:51:20,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1110
01:51:21,064 --> 01:51:25,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of questions that still are up in the air.

1111
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:33,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, for example, how we are doing some programmatic switches between some kids, if they have EL, are going to go to this school.

1112
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Some kids with other needs are going to go to this school.

1113
01:51:37,703 --> 01:51:39,485
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, these issues are up in the air.

1114
01:51:39,545 --> 01:51:41,107
[SPEAKER_17]: While I have complete faith

1115
01:51:41,423 --> 01:51:44,705
[SPEAKER_17]: in the superintendent, I think it's important for us to suss these questions out.

1116
01:51:46,227 --> 01:51:51,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Mustone, I completely understand your frustration, and I know that you just want to go, and I get it.

1117
01:51:52,551 --> 01:52:01,618
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't think delaying this two weeks, a week and a half, for us to have a committee of the whole is going to destroy the program rollout.

1118
01:52:01,778 --> 01:52:02,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't.

1119
01:52:02,599 --> 01:52:05,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that it would be important for us to take a breath.

1120
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:06,742
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a problem.

1121
01:52:07,362 --> 01:52:18,310
[SPEAKER_17]: but to take a beat, think about this problem all together, and we're probably all going to, once we answer our questions, we're probably all going to agree that this is the right, this is the best thing for Medford, perhaps.

1122
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:22,333
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that we do need a little more time to think about this.

1123
01:52:25,152 --> 01:52:39,842
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to make are you standing by your motion to send it to committee of the whole is there a second by miss Kratz to send to committee of the whole I Think a week two weeks.

1124
01:52:40,362 --> 01:52:41,783
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not talking about five months.

1125
01:52:42,123 --> 01:52:43,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Dileva.

1126
01:52:43,364 --> 01:52:43,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1127
01:52:44,065 --> 01:52:48,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, so I guess I'll title myself as former principal of the Andrews Middle School and

1128
01:52:49,874 --> 01:52:50,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And not yet.

1129
01:52:50,695 --> 01:52:51,175
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting there.

1130
01:52:52,857 --> 01:52:55,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things to consider where I agree holding off.

1131
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:00,623
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have to now consider is what you're doing with the open houses that are coming up.

1132
01:53:01,344 --> 01:53:09,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, if things aren't changing, then the open house will be what it always has been for people to decide to choose.

1133
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:15,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are changing, you're now changing those open houses to more be of like an orientation type of thing.

1134
01:53:17,697 --> 01:53:24,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is always of the essence when it comes to a decision, because it affects everything down the line for that.

1135
01:53:24,522 --> 01:53:26,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to kind of keep that in mind.

1136
01:53:28,044 --> 01:53:40,293
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could share my two cents, too, as being the former principal of the Andrews, I will say from a scheduling standpoint, the imbalance is tough to do, where you're trying to get everybody what they want,

1137
01:53:41,613 --> 01:53:46,978
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you come into sixth grade, and you want Spanish, and you want band and orchestra, and you want all of that.

1138
01:53:47,859 --> 01:53:49,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to give you all of that.

1139
01:53:49,961 --> 01:53:52,964
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, we only have so many teachers for so many things.

1140
01:53:53,044 --> 01:53:56,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number inequity sometimes can be a problem as well.

1141
01:53:56,948 --> 01:53:59,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make sure you had this point of information.

1142
01:54:00,772 --> 01:54:01,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1143
01:54:02,825 --> 01:54:06,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there's a motion on the floor to send this to Committee of the Whole.

1144
01:54:06,846 --> 01:54:13,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is to send this paper to Committee of the Whole to then bring a resolution back out to the floor.

1145
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:19,009
[SPEAKER_04]: His motion is to not approve it, to send it to Committee of the Whole.

1146
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:24,311
[SPEAKER_20]: So next week is vacation week.

1147
01:54:26,093 --> 01:54:28,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If it gets voted on, we will figure out a night to have a committee of the whole.

1148
01:54:29,034 --> 01:54:31,575
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, it's to send it to committee of the whole.

1149
01:54:31,595 --> 01:54:36,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if that fails, then someone could make a motion to approve the said policy changes.

1150
01:54:36,156 --> 01:54:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion on the floor right now, send to committee of the whole.

1151
01:54:39,937 --> 01:54:40,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

1152
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:41,378
[SPEAKER_09]: 17 in a row.

1153
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:41,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Democrats.

1154
01:54:43,799 --> 01:54:45,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1155
01:54:45,419 --> 01:54:47,260
[SPEAKER_09]: One of us don't know where she is.

1156
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:47,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1157
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is that?

1158
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:50,041
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1159
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:51,921
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1160
01:54:52,742 --> 01:54:53,062
Mayor Burr.

1161
01:54:53,722 --> 01:54:53,822
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1162
01:54:54,707 --> 01:54:56,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1163
01:54:56,848 --> 01:54:57,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion fails.

1164
01:54:57,849 --> 01:55:01,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve this policy change?

1165
01:55:01,271 --> 01:55:01,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1166
01:55:01,451 --> 01:55:01,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Van de Kloot.

1167
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:06,755
[SPEAKER_20]: I make a motion to approve the policy change and follow it up with the committee of the whole meeting.

1168
01:55:07,427 --> 01:55:32,330
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion on the floor to approve the policy change, follow up by a committee of the whole to determine the rollout procedures, seconded by Mr. Russo, and also in conjunction with the superintendent's recommendation to withdraw that prior school committee resolution deeming a rising freshman not to be a sibling preference item, however that was worded originally.

1169
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:32,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?

1170
01:55:33,951 --> 01:55:35,873
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'd like that to be a separate.

1171
01:55:36,073 --> 01:56:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean separate okay to change on the motion for approval Followed up by a committee of the whole roll call vote, please Yes Yes seven in the affirmative zero in the negative the motion passes on the resolution item B for the preferences it is for the

1172
01:56:02,797 --> 01:56:08,863
[SPEAKER_04]: the superintendent's recommending that the preference be for children that would be in the same school at the same time.

1173
01:56:09,364 --> 01:56:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So no rising freshmen would be deemed a preference.

1174
01:56:12,867 --> 01:56:13,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your recommendation.

1175
01:56:14,469 --> 01:56:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1176
01:56:14,889 --> 01:56:15,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Vandekloot.

1177
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:18,693
[SPEAKER_20]: I make a motion to accept the superintendent's recommendation.

1178
01:56:19,151 --> 01:56:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to accept the superintendent's recommendation, is there a second?

1179
01:56:23,854 --> 01:56:25,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Mr. Russo.

1180
01:56:25,214 --> 01:56:26,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, please.

1181
01:56:26,455 --> 01:56:27,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1182
01:56:27,175 --> 01:56:27,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1183
01:56:28,436 --> 01:56:32,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1184
01:56:33,258 --> 01:56:33,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1185
01:56:34,259 --> 01:56:34,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1186
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:35,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1187
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote is 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1188
01:56:38,481 --> 01:56:39,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1189
01:56:39,562 --> 01:56:40,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1190
01:56:41,363 --> 01:56:41,643
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1191
01:56:41,763 --> 01:56:47,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Item 7, report on UDL Emergency Preparedness Committee Kathleen Madaglio and Melanie McLaughlin.

1192
01:57:07,202 --> 01:57:09,963
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a girls hockey game.

1193
01:57:49,367 --> 01:57:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put you on.

1194
01:57:50,768 --> 01:57:51,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I shut them all off.

1195
01:57:52,589 --> 01:57:53,409
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1196
01:57:53,509 --> 01:57:54,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everyone.

1197
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:58,311
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to thank you for allowing us to come speak about our committee.

1198
01:58:00,193 --> 01:58:07,197
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a CPAC special education collaboration that we started last year, during the last school year.

1199
01:58:07,917 --> 01:58:13,160
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we've been meeting for the last year and a half, talking about emergency preparedness in schools.

1200
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Originally, the title of our presentation

1201
01:58:17,952 --> 01:58:21,715
[SPEAKER_19]: committee was emergency preparedness for students with disabilities.

1202
01:58:22,315 --> 01:58:32,622
[SPEAKER_19]: But as we started to do our research and, you know, get into our elbows here, we realized that it was really important to be talking about all individuals who are in the schools.

1203
01:58:33,203 --> 01:58:44,490
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, including the adults who interface with students every day, parents who come to the buildings, young siblings who might be with parents as they walk through the schools, as well as all the students themselves.

1204
01:58:48,628 --> 01:58:59,874
[SPEAKER_19]: We are following the principle of universal design, whereas you create procedures that can be applied to any person in any of our buildings.

1205
01:59:00,734 --> 01:59:01,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1206
01:59:02,435 --> 01:59:16,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to point out that back in 2000, the Massachusetts legislature passed a law requiring all school districts to create a multi-hazard evacuation plan that is specific to each building.

1207
01:59:16,829 --> 01:59:22,794
[SPEAKER_19]: So here in Medford, each one of our buildings do have evacuation plans for the entire facility.

1208
01:59:24,175 --> 01:59:34,543
[SPEAKER_19]: They must also establish crisis response teams, designate who is in charge of the team, and designate substitutes in case that person is not available in the event of an emergency.

1209
01:59:35,484 --> 01:59:46,153
[SPEAKER_19]: There needs to be a communication plan, crisis procedures for safe entrance to and exit from the school by students, parents, and employees, and policies for enforcing school discipline

1210
01:59:46,597 --> 01:59:49,518
[SPEAKER_19]: and maintaining a safe and orderly environment during a crisis.

1211
01:59:50,138 --> 01:59:54,159
[SPEAKER_19]: These plans are required to be updated on an annual basis.

1212
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:00,860
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, of course, all individuals who are in the building need to be informed as to what these plans are.

1213
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:06,761
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why schools have emergency evacuation drills to make sure everybody knows what to do.

1214
02:00:08,142 --> 02:00:11,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Back in July of 2004, President Bush signed an executive order.

1215
02:00:12,123 --> 02:00:13,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoops, sorry.

1216
02:00:16,162 --> 02:00:26,471
[SPEAKER_19]: requiring that each school, when they take a look at their emergency plans, that they take a look at what the needs are for individuals with disabilities who are in these buildings.

1217
02:00:26,931 --> 02:00:29,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Because obviously, it was a big flaw.

1218
02:00:30,134 --> 02:00:37,540
[SPEAKER_19]: And it requires the public entities to include people with disabilities in each of their emergency preparedness efforts.

1219
02:00:38,901 --> 02:00:44,425
[SPEAKER_19]: So here in Massachusetts, we're a little out of sequence here.

1220
02:00:46,712 --> 02:00:53,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Most plans are guided by the Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools Technical Assistance Center, or REMS.

1221
02:00:54,816 --> 02:01:05,021
[SPEAKER_19]: However, it seems that in most of the literature that we could locate, the reference purely is, and don't forget about students with disabilities in your plans.

1222
02:01:05,761 --> 02:01:07,482
[SPEAKER_19]: So look at the unique needs of students,

1223
02:01:08,038 --> 02:01:12,101
[SPEAKER_19]: revise your plan accordingly, and make sure that student needs are met.

1224
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:21,769
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no real substantial discussion about what to do or how to help staff prepare on how to support students for emergencies.

1225
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:33,338
[SPEAKER_19]: So as our work continued, we started to discover that our first responders were also a little bit confused about what we should do

1226
02:01:33,877 --> 02:01:35,377
[SPEAKER_19]: on an individual student basis.

1227
02:01:35,998 --> 02:01:37,858
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to point out, this is our committee.

1228
02:01:37,878 --> 02:01:40,759
[SPEAKER_19]: We have members of that committee here in our audience.

1229
02:01:40,839 --> 02:01:43,459
[SPEAKER_19]: So Joan Bowen, Susanna.

1230
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Susanna, you want to say hi there?

1231
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:45,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul DeLeva.

1232
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:45,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

1233
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:47,280
[SPEAKER_19]: And Tanya.

1234
02:01:48,901 --> 02:01:53,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And we meet at least a month on a monthly basis to talk about all of our research.

1235
02:01:53,102 --> 02:01:53,202
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1236
02:02:02,477 --> 02:02:12,568
[SPEAKER_19]: So, one of the first recommendations that came from our work was to really take a look at individual needs of students and document what their needs might be to help guide decision making.

1237
02:02:13,749 --> 02:02:19,736
[SPEAKER_19]: So, first we're looking at all students and our first thought was, oh wow, does every student need an individual plan?

1238
02:02:20,356 --> 02:02:23,580
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, that's an awful lot of plans in a school district.

1239
02:02:25,467 --> 02:02:31,352
[SPEAKER_19]: we needed a way to help teams decide whether a student requires their own individual plan.

1240
02:02:32,152 --> 02:02:42,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So one thing we did was we interviewed our staff, we took surveys, and asked principals, like, who are the students in your buildings who seem to struggle when you have drills?

1241
02:02:43,881 --> 02:02:51,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so we started, we took a look at each of those students, we were looking at what their presentation was, and we were kind of surprised because

1242
02:02:52,522 --> 02:03:02,148
[SPEAKER_19]: There were students who looked like maybe they need a lot of help every day, who had no problem following the group and doing what needed to be done during an evacuation.

1243
02:03:02,748 --> 02:03:13,034
[SPEAKER_19]: We also discovered that there were students who were in gen ed who had a lot of difficulty and needed a lot of support and maybe didn't require that level of support at other times.

1244
02:03:13,655 --> 02:03:19,678
[SPEAKER_19]: So we developed an individualized emergency response determination form.

1245
02:03:20,619 --> 02:03:21,680
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is currently in

1246
02:03:24,146 --> 02:03:25,307
[SPEAKER_19]: We've launched it.

1247
02:03:25,347 --> 02:03:28,109
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying to take a look and see whether or not we need to tweak it.

1248
02:03:28,149 --> 02:03:39,117
[SPEAKER_19]: And Suzanne was very, very helpful in doing the research around what other communities have done and pulling together our original version of this form.

1249
02:03:39,958 --> 02:03:41,739
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see that and see what we've been doing.

1250
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:52,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Several of our schools have started to utilize the form to review emergency planning with families during their team meetings and are designing individual plans.

1251
02:03:54,148 --> 02:04:05,058
[SPEAKER_19]: So in about a month or so, we'll be surveying each of those evaluation team leaders and their team members who have been using the form to see whether or not we need to make any revisions.

1252
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:10,684
[SPEAKER_19]: We have other students who require emergency toolkits.

1253
02:04:10,924 --> 02:04:16,630
[SPEAKER_19]: So our classroom teachers have been busy putting together kits where they might carry an emergency bag with them as they

1254
02:04:17,453 --> 02:04:25,138
[SPEAKER_19]: a leafer drill to help students practice using some of those tools that they can use to support the students during an emergency.

1255
02:04:26,379 --> 02:04:32,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've coordinated with first responders for training and understanding around the needs of students with disabilities.

1256
02:04:32,643 --> 02:04:36,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're actually in a very sort of precursory stage there.

1257
02:04:36,846 --> 02:04:45,032
[SPEAKER_19]: We held a forum last spring where we brought together first responders and members of the community at a CPAC meeting.

1258
02:04:45,393 --> 02:04:46,873
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked about emergency responses.

1259
02:04:46,913 --> 02:04:47,994
[SPEAKER_19]: I know many of you were there.

1260
02:04:48,554 --> 02:04:50,935
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a very informative meeting.

1261
02:04:50,955 --> 02:04:52,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we all learned a lot.

1262
02:04:53,055 --> 02:05:03,278
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've opened a dialogue to talk to our local first responders around what needs might be to provide additional support and training around specific disability-related needs.

1263
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:12,601
[SPEAKER_19]: We have collected social stories for students, for staff to use with students to help them to teach them

1264
02:05:13,277 --> 02:05:23,942
[SPEAKER_19]: procedures around evacuation drills to support them during practice drills so they're readily available and in place if there ever is an emergency.

1265
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:35,747
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in the stage of involving community stakeholders, including families, first responders, school personnel, as subject matter experts to be included in school emergency planning.

1266
02:05:39,975 --> 02:05:45,920
[SPEAKER_19]: One of our more recent projects has been to survey local communities to ask what are they doing.

1267
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:59,611
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've called probably 20 different communities, police departments and fire departments, to say, what are you doing around emergency procedures and supporting the needs of individuals with disabilities in the event of an emergency?

1268
02:06:00,932 --> 02:06:08,939
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the following are several resources that we found other communities to use, such as the Municipal Police Training Committee,

1269
02:06:09,717 --> 02:06:14,138
[SPEAKER_19]: The Rescue Task Force to train police and firefighters around active threats.

1270
02:06:15,778 --> 02:06:25,860
[SPEAKER_19]: The Mass Commission Against Discrimination that offers trainings on the law, presentations to community groups, speakers at events to promote fairness, equity, and inclusion.

1271
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:33,221
[SPEAKER_19]: The Mass Firefighting Academy trains municipal fire service personnel at no cost.

1272
02:06:34,542 --> 02:06:36,362
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure I don't crack all my notes here.

1273
02:06:38,411 --> 02:06:49,220
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things I just wanted to add as well is that, as Kathy was speaking earlier around students with disabilities, the other piece is that you don't know when you might be a student with a disability or an individual with a disability.

1274
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:57,346
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day you might be fine, and the next day you trip off the curb, and suddenly you've got a boot on your foot, and you're not going to be able to exit the building as easily as anybody else either.

1275
02:06:57,767 --> 02:07:03,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is an ongoing process that people need to be thinking about for also, like Kathy was saying earlier, our adults in the building as well.

1276
02:07:03,752 --> 02:07:07,695
[SPEAKER_12]: We have teachers who might have needs, other staff who might have needs that we should be thinking about.

1277
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:09,900
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1278
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:13,441
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are several other different groups who are providing supports.

1279
02:07:13,921 --> 02:07:28,266
[SPEAKER_19]: What we realized also is that a lot of the training that's in place in local communities is really focused on the active shooter scenarios, and not so much on what happens if somebody or mental health issues.

1280
02:07:28,426 --> 02:07:34,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Just what happens if you have someone who's upset and maybe doesn't understand the set of directions, what being told to do.

1281
02:07:37,159 --> 02:07:47,586
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's why we feel that there's this need to work together as a community to help all facets of the community to work together to understand disability-related needs.

1282
02:07:48,266 --> 02:07:54,790
[SPEAKER_19]: A couple of communities, we're using ALEC, the Autism in Law Enforcement Education Coalition.

1283
02:07:55,110 --> 02:08:01,855
[SPEAKER_19]: They provide free trainings for first responders to understand the impact of autism, and especially

1284
02:08:02,873 --> 02:08:08,194
[SPEAKER_19]: what the impact would be during an emergency situation where someone might be upset or not know what to do.

1285
02:08:10,214 --> 02:08:13,755
[SPEAKER_19]: We also came across the Massachusetts Office on Disability.

1286
02:08:15,376 --> 02:08:20,156
[SPEAKER_19]: They provide disability emergency preparedness trainings free of cost.

1287
02:08:21,397 --> 02:08:23,317
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a range of trainings that are available.

1288
02:08:23,717 --> 02:08:32,559
[SPEAKER_19]: And so Melanie had reached out to this group last week and was talking about what they can do to come to Medford and provide training to our teaching staff

1289
02:08:32,986 --> 02:08:36,832
[SPEAKER_19]: to administrative staff, and to the community as a whole.

1290
02:08:37,193 --> 02:08:43,924
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll do trainings with individuals who have disabilities to talk to them about establishing their own personal plan.

1291
02:08:44,365 --> 02:08:47,530
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll talk to parents about what you need to prepare your children.

1292
02:08:48,062 --> 02:08:53,745
[SPEAKER_19]: in an emergency, talk to staff about, you know, let's take a look at your protocols and see what kind of tweaking you might need to do.

1293
02:08:54,646 --> 02:09:00,309
[SPEAKER_19]: They have all sorts of great resources here, hurricane preparedness for persons with disabilities.

1294
02:09:00,829 --> 02:09:05,032
[SPEAKER_19]: So we certainly will be tapping into that resource, especially since it's free.

1295
02:09:05,972 --> 02:09:09,975
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of these programs that are out there have been funded through Homeland Security.

1296
02:09:09,995 --> 02:09:15,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just, it seems to me that it's an untapped resource at this point in time.

1297
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:17,991
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have some recommendations.

1298
02:09:18,371 --> 02:09:19,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to talk?

1299
02:09:19,411 --> 02:09:19,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, sure.

1300
02:09:19,992 --> 02:09:21,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Want to take over and talk a little bit?

1301
02:09:21,372 --> 02:09:21,552
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1302
02:09:22,413 --> 02:09:27,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of the recommendations that were on earlier pages were things that we started working on.

1303
02:09:27,975 --> 02:09:32,477
[SPEAKER_12]: These are some of the ones that we want to continue working on, and we'll get to how in a moment.

1304
02:09:32,938 --> 02:09:37,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But communicating emergency preparedness plans specific to students with disabilities and families.

1305
02:09:38,163 --> 02:09:42,884
[SPEAKER_12]: and update those students and families and the community on an annual basis.

1306
02:09:43,364 --> 02:09:51,646
[SPEAKER_12]: We recommend convening a district-wide emergency preparedness committee with representative membership from each school to ensure consistency across the district.

1307
02:09:51,986 --> 02:09:56,368
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now, we do have people at each of the schools, from what I understand, that are addressing and talking about these issues.

1308
02:09:56,728 --> 02:10:06,390
[SPEAKER_12]: But we recommend having one person that's a representative from each of the schools, so essentially creating a community-wide committee, almost like what folks are talking around around the community-wide PTO.

1309
02:10:06,817 --> 02:10:13,220
[SPEAKER_12]: A community-wide committee where we're hearing from each of the schools, you know, so that we're understanding consistency and what the needs are across the district.

1310
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:19,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Ensuring communication between school and first responders specific to students with disabilities.

1311
02:10:19,923 --> 02:10:26,706
[SPEAKER_12]: So some examples of that would be, you know, having our first responders understand what the layout of the special education classrooms are in our school.

1312
02:10:27,186 --> 02:10:31,488
[SPEAKER_12]: And also from a school perspective, to think about what the layout of our special education classrooms are.

1313
02:10:31,868 --> 02:10:36,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it really, you know, wise to have a special education classroom, say, on the

1314
02:10:36,666 --> 02:10:42,171
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, third floor in the far corner if you've got kids with physical disabilities and you need to get them out of the building quickly.

1315
02:10:42,251 --> 02:10:43,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's thinking about that?

1316
02:10:43,792 --> 02:10:44,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's addressing that?

1317
02:10:44,913 --> 02:10:49,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Both from the first responders understanding where those are and from the district administration thinking about that.

1318
02:10:50,428 --> 02:10:53,031
[SPEAKER_12]: understanding of children and also an understanding just of the culture.

1319
02:10:53,171 --> 02:10:57,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Not all children with disabilities are going to be in the special education classrooms, right?

1320
02:10:57,835 --> 02:10:58,636
[SPEAKER_12]: So thinking about that.

1321
02:10:58,716 --> 02:11:03,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Specific training for first responders and assisting students and others with disabilities.

1322
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:08,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So around some of this ALEC programming that we talked about, but others and sort of just a cultural competency piece.

1323
02:11:08,365 --> 02:11:09,006
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that

1324
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:15,773
[SPEAKER_12]: The Department of Education said when we included them on our security and safety panel last year, we invited them and asked them to come.

1325
02:11:16,233 --> 02:11:24,856
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, you know, Ann Gilligan was the representative there from DESE, and she said, you know, it's not going to be a conversation unless you have a triangle of people at the table.

1326
02:11:25,296 --> 02:11:30,679
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's got to be school, fire, and police, you know, all at the table.

1327
02:11:30,919 --> 02:11:35,861
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would say obviously in the center of that would be the family and the children involved in that.

1328
02:11:35,961 --> 02:11:39,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that that's really important that you have all three pieces at that.

1329
02:11:39,542 --> 02:11:51,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And then folks might have noted, I think just a month or two ago, Medford Public Schools was featured on NPR with our work to improve emergency plans for students with disabilities.

1330
02:11:51,228 --> 02:11:52,369
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a really nice program.

1331
02:11:52,749 --> 02:11:58,132
[SPEAKER_12]: That happened because there was discussion around new budgeting with Governor Baker.

1332
02:11:58,152 --> 02:12:00,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was talking about budgeting plans for mental health.

1333
02:12:00,373 --> 02:12:02,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And he had a convening in Burlington.

1334
02:12:02,234 --> 02:12:03,435
[SPEAKER_12]: And I happened to be at the convening.

1335
02:12:03,475 --> 02:12:05,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got up and I asked, what about students with disabilities?

1336
02:12:06,397 --> 02:12:10,618
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was an NPR reporter there who said, that's a really good point.

1337
02:12:10,938 --> 02:12:14,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody's talking about that and wanted to talk with us about it.

1338
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:18,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, hey, we're doing this subcommittee, and here's how Medford's working.

1339
02:12:18,321 --> 02:12:25,223
[SPEAKER_12]: So we think that this is a real opportunity for Medford to be a leader in the state around what we're doing in this community.

1340
02:12:25,643 --> 02:12:31,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would encourage, certainly I will be reaching out, but we would encourage the district as well,

1341
02:12:32,563 --> 02:12:38,986
[SPEAKER_12]: to be reaching out with us to state level committee on education, other folks that we know in the community as we're talking about this.

1342
02:12:39,046 --> 02:12:40,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Because this is a nationwide problem.

1343
02:12:40,686 --> 02:12:42,447
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just a problem in our schools.

1344
02:12:42,707 --> 02:12:48,330
[SPEAKER_12]: But Medford has an opportunity here, especially with these dedicated people who have spent so many hours researching this for you already.

1345
02:12:49,770 --> 02:12:54,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the next page is some resources that we came across here.

1346
02:12:54,812 --> 02:13:01,255
[SPEAKER_12]: The Mass Office on Disability is what Kathy was talking about a few minutes ago, their emergency preparedness program that they have already in place.

1347
02:13:01,753 --> 02:13:06,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I found the teacher's guide, Supporting Students with Disabilities During School Crisis, a teacher guide, to be particularly effective.

1348
02:13:06,856 --> 02:13:07,877
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some other links there.

1349
02:13:07,897 --> 02:13:08,517
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hot links.

1350
02:13:08,577 --> 02:13:14,140
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when we share the PowerPoint with you electronically, you can also click on those and access those.

1351
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:18,063
[SPEAKER_12]: But what we would talk about is next steps.

1352
02:13:18,623 --> 02:13:19,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Kathy, do you want to talk about that?

1353
02:13:20,044 --> 02:13:28,809
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to mention that when we first started our committee and we started searching the government pages and the Department of Education,

1354
02:13:29,575 --> 02:13:35,077
[SPEAKER_19]: We had to dig pretty deep into the pages to find information around emergency preparedness for students with disabilities.

1355
02:13:35,617 --> 02:13:46,541
[SPEAKER_19]: But as I started poking around on the internet within the last couple of weeks preparing for this presentation here, we started to find a lot of really interesting resources.

1356
02:13:46,981 --> 02:13:48,121
[SPEAKER_19]: So people are out there.

1357
02:13:48,141 --> 02:13:49,862
[SPEAKER_19]: It's on everyone's radar.

1358
02:13:50,742 --> 02:13:56,344
[SPEAKER_19]: And when an unfortunate emergency occurs, everyone is talking about emergency preparedness.

1359
02:13:56,704 --> 02:13:58,405
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think it's really, really important

1360
02:13:58,828 --> 02:14:09,294
[SPEAKER_19]: that we keep this conversation going, we keep it open during the good times so that we're prepared and that we can appropriately support all of our community.

1361
02:14:10,494 --> 02:14:16,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And so with that, we would sort of look for some concrete next steps and some of the recommendations that we have for you folks.

1362
02:14:16,377 --> 02:14:22,361
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would put that out to you as what would you recommend for next steps as a result of the presentation.

1363
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:24,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

1364
02:14:24,262 --> 02:14:24,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work.

1365
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1366
02:14:29,256 --> 02:14:31,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for this presentation.

1367
02:14:32,815 --> 02:14:33,795
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very impressed by it.

1368
02:14:34,276 --> 02:14:37,176
[SPEAKER_17]: The idea of emergency preparedness is important to begin with.

1369
02:14:37,457 --> 02:14:40,057
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you mentioned, it's important to think of it when times are good.

1370
02:14:40,758 --> 02:14:47,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And oftentimes, it's easy to forget that there are students, like you mentioned, sometimes they trip and fall, and they just have trouble walking for a little bit.

1371
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:50,781
[SPEAKER_17]: And other students that need a little bit more assistance.

1372
02:14:51,801 --> 02:14:57,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Superintendent, do we have a district-wide emergency preparedness committee?

1373
02:14:57,443 --> 02:14:58,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And would one be able to be formed?

1374
02:15:02,547 --> 02:15:22,427
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a group of administrators that have been working on our safe havens report, things that we can do as a district, but we don't have a formal open forum.

1375
02:15:23,477 --> 02:15:25,638
[SPEAKER_17]: where we were talking about safety in place.

1376
02:15:27,299 --> 02:15:30,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think that such an implementation would be possible for you to do with your staff?

1377
02:15:30,601 --> 02:15:37,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you're all so busy, but... We could definitely look into... Then I'd like to make a motion.

1378
02:15:38,226 --> 02:15:45,510
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion to send this to the superintendent for report to see if we could convene a district-wide emergency preparedness committee.

1379
02:15:46,452 --> 02:15:50,413
[SPEAKER_17]: And also to forward these recommendations to her so she could report back to us.

1380
02:15:50,613 --> 02:15:53,094
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that there's a lot of great work here, and I really appreciate it.

1381
02:15:53,254 --> 02:15:55,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

1382
02:15:55,535 --> 02:15:56,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get the PowerPoint as well.

1383
02:15:57,855 --> 02:16:00,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, of course.

1384
02:16:00,956 --> 02:16:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo, you are next, actually.

1385
02:16:03,337 --> 02:16:03,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just not sure.

1386
02:16:04,297 --> 02:16:07,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't this the committee that you are suggesting?

1387
02:16:07,478 --> 02:16:07,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is it?

1388
02:16:07,818 --> 02:16:08,479
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

1389
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:09,979
[SPEAKER_04]: More broader.

1390
02:16:10,894 --> 02:16:12,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1391
02:16:12,675 --> 02:16:14,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I understand.

1392
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:24,999
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a committee that we put together that we just felt was important to do to talk about our, you know, the more vulnerable student population.

1393
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:28,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Each school has a safety committee.

1394
02:16:29,421 --> 02:16:30,181
[SPEAKER_19]: It's already there.

1395
02:16:30,301 --> 02:16:31,262
[SPEAKER_19]: They're already in place.

1396
02:16:31,282 --> 02:16:32,902
[SPEAKER_19]: They already meet on a regular basis.

1397
02:16:33,363 --> 02:16:34,603
[SPEAKER_19]: What we were suggesting is that

1398
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:55,402
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe two or three times a year, one representative from each of the schools gets together and talks about their planning process, any difficulties they run into, or what goes great, what's worked well, so that everybody could be just more aware and keep a conversation going, and be consistent across the district.

1399
02:16:55,783 --> 02:16:57,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, and specific to students with disabilities.

1400
02:16:57,984 --> 02:17:04,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So some of the other recommendations that are embedded in that are that you have people at the table that have some expertise around students with disabilities.

1401
02:17:04,869 --> 02:17:10,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there is this citywide committee that is considering this, you have representatives from each of the schools.

1402
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:15,355
[SPEAKER_12]: But clearly, it would make sense to have some of the people that are on this committee to be part of that.

1403
02:17:15,375 --> 02:17:18,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we would send somebody from our committee to the district committee.

1404
02:17:18,897 --> 02:17:20,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So I had another question.

1405
02:17:20,839 --> 02:17:44,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for clarifying that I obviously misunderstood So I noticed in the recommendations there wasn't one for something that you found to be quite a surprise and that was that Some gen ed students really needed a plan as well and Is there thinking on how to really I mean you can't start from the IEP or the special ed staff so

1406
02:17:50,219 --> 02:17:58,985
[SPEAKER_19]: So as part of the emergency plan for each school, they're required to take a look at the population of individuals in their school and to have evacuation plans.

1407
02:17:59,466 --> 02:18:12,575
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's very common if you have, let's say, somebody who's mobility impaired, maybe you have a teacher who uses a wheelchair primarily to get around, that there'll be a defined plan for that person.

1408
02:18:12,956 --> 02:18:16,018
[SPEAKER_19]: There'll be evacuation routes or who to call if you run into problems.

1409
02:18:16,341 --> 02:18:17,943
[SPEAKER_19]: And the same for all the students in the building.

1410
02:18:17,983 --> 02:18:25,332
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the world of evacuations, it's very common to look at physical limitations.

1411
02:18:25,792 --> 02:18:36,465
[SPEAKER_19]: What we're concerned about are all those other students who may have other needs, might be emotional, might be cognitive, might be communication.

1412
02:18:36,982 --> 02:18:42,584
[SPEAKER_19]: who sometimes get missed when you're looking for that quick, you know, sort of who needs help getting out of the building.

1413
02:18:43,245 --> 02:18:47,427
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where most of those students are on either IEPs or 504s.

1414
02:18:48,007 --> 02:18:51,388
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want to make sure that that discussion is part of the planning.

1415
02:18:51,428 --> 02:19:00,032
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would also add that the emergency response plan, the individualized emergency response plan that Susanna did such great research on,

1416
02:19:00,422 --> 02:19:01,343
[SPEAKER_12]: can be used for anyone.

1417
02:19:01,523 --> 02:19:05,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's the point, is that we were looking at universal design for everybody.

1418
02:19:05,585 --> 02:19:07,746
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what's so great about disability.

1419
02:19:07,787 --> 02:19:10,988
[SPEAKER_12]: When you consider disability, you're considering everybody as a result.

1420
02:19:11,048 --> 02:19:11,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody benefits.

1421
02:19:14,471 --> 02:19:14,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1422
02:19:14,731 --> 02:19:15,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Vandekloot.

1423
02:19:16,272 --> 02:19:23,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So included in our packet was the determination of need for an individual emergency response plan and procedures.

1424
02:19:25,277 --> 02:19:27,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this ready now for a motion for adoption?

1425
02:19:28,359 --> 02:19:29,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you putting it forward to us now

1426
02:19:30,563 --> 02:19:40,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so this is an internal procedure that we're using in the special education department that we are trialing because we need to see how smoothly it runs.

1427
02:19:40,577 --> 02:19:43,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we capturing everything that we need to capture in the discussion?

1428
02:19:44,323 --> 02:19:52,906
[SPEAKER_19]: And so then the end of next month, we're going to survey all of the evaluation team leaders and see what kind of input the team members have.

1429
02:19:53,146 --> 02:19:53,606
[SPEAKER_20]: That's great.

1430
02:19:53,646 --> 02:19:55,687
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to say, I was so impressed when I read through this.

1431
02:19:56,287 --> 02:20:04,130
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I had a Gen Ed kid who was absolutely incredibly scared of fire drills, and this would have been very appropriate for her.

1432
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:12,773
[SPEAKER_20]: But especially on the back page, listing all the medical needs, the tools, the accommodations, physical needs, tools, accommodations.

1433
02:20:13,653 --> 02:20:16,035
[SPEAKER_20]: communication memory, social-emotional needs.

1434
02:20:16,075 --> 02:20:18,456
[SPEAKER_20]: I just thought this was an excellent, excellent document.

1435
02:20:18,836 --> 02:20:21,438
[SPEAKER_20]: So I look forward for it to come back for approval for us.

1436
02:20:22,359 --> 02:20:22,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1437
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:25,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

1438
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:25,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1439
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:27,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two comments.

1440
02:20:28,142 --> 02:20:40,389
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I would like to see at some point this incorporated to every child's IEP meeting, so that way parents have input of what the needs are for their children, because no one knows their child better than a parent.

1441
02:20:42,078 --> 02:20:59,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also like to include all students that are old enough or are able to communicate to be able to have some input of what works best for them in these drafts and maybe on the committee as well.

1442
02:21:00,311 --> 02:21:08,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I really feel like if you incorporated people with disabilities onto a committee that is so significant and we all learn,

1443
02:21:10,098 --> 02:21:13,421
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had that discussion of how can we be creative.

1444
02:21:13,501 --> 02:21:16,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now we're meeting at 8 a.m.

1445
02:21:16,845 --> 02:21:17,306
[SPEAKER_19]: in the morning.

1446
02:21:18,907 --> 02:21:25,395
[SPEAKER_19]: I suppose it might be possible to have high school students participate.

1447
02:21:25,735 --> 02:21:27,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at lunch when students are at lunch.

1448
02:21:28,638 --> 02:21:29,619
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been talking about that.

1449
02:21:29,659 --> 02:21:29,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1450
02:21:29,979 --> 02:21:33,200
[SPEAKER_12]: We very much agree that having a self-advocate at the table is really critical.

1451
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:41,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, at the last meeting, you heard Leslie was sort of agreeing, and we can see how much value is added by our student here and how much they're appreciated.

1452
02:21:41,884 --> 02:21:43,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's a really good point.

1453
02:21:44,005 --> 02:21:55,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can envision that this being really helpful at any IEP meeting to have parents even aware of just starting to think about it prior to coming to a meeting.

1454
02:21:56,093 --> 02:22:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only for our district, but throughout the state of Massachusetts and maybe the country.

1455
02:22:00,797 --> 02:22:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So children with disabilities, that this is on people's radar.

1456
02:22:06,382 --> 02:22:12,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you receive services, you get a lot of communication from schools.

1457
02:22:13,267 --> 02:22:15,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have different touch points.

1458
02:22:15,269 --> 02:22:19,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you might have your school liaison call you and introduce themselves at the beginning of the year.

1459
02:22:20,173 --> 02:22:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have your IEP meeting.

1460
02:22:21,774 --> 02:22:24,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You have more opportunity to reach those parents and talk to them.

1461
02:22:25,338 --> 02:22:28,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that input is significant.

1462
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:33,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does the school providing that, but it worked in both ways.

1463
02:22:33,282 --> 02:22:41,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just would want to add, Erin, thank you for that, but also thinking about trauma, students who have experienced trauma, and our English language learners as well in this scenario.

1464
02:22:41,046 --> 02:22:42,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So same thing, it's about universal design.

1465
02:22:44,948 --> 02:22:45,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1466
02:22:45,709 --> 02:22:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great presentation.

1467
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1468
02:22:49,150 --> 02:22:49,971
[SPEAKER_04]: All of you, thank you.

1469
02:22:51,879 --> 02:23:02,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael has a motion that the superintendent entertain the district-wide emergency preparedness committee and start thinking about formulating one from all of the individual schools.

1470
02:23:02,623 --> 02:23:03,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1471
02:23:03,723 --> 02:23:05,224
[SPEAKER_04]: The second on the floor by Mr. Russo.

1472
02:23:05,244 --> 02:23:06,044
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1473
02:23:06,444 --> 02:23:06,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1474
02:23:06,644 --> 02:23:07,264
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1475
02:23:07,324 --> 02:23:08,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1476
02:23:08,545 --> 02:23:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1477
02:23:12,483 --> 02:23:14,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up is negotiations and legal matters.

1478
02:23:14,405 --> 02:23:16,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to move this to the end of the calendar?

1479
02:23:16,687 --> 02:23:17,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

1480
02:23:17,788 --> 02:23:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: By Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1481
02:23:19,610 --> 02:23:20,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Vander Kloot.

1482
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:20,891
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1483
02:23:20,971 --> 02:23:21,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1484
02:23:21,832 --> 02:23:22,512
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1485
02:23:22,572 --> 02:23:23,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1486
02:23:24,174 --> 02:23:24,835
[SPEAKER_04]: New business.

1487
02:23:24,855 --> 02:23:29,919
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Robert Stenberg.

1488
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:33,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Stenberg taught graphic arts in Medford.

1489
02:23:34,093 --> 02:23:39,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Kretz.

1490
02:23:39,679 --> 02:23:42,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Tommy was the brother-in-law of school committee member Kathy Kretz.

1491
02:23:43,122 --> 02:23:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing makes a family stronger than love.

1492
02:23:45,385 --> 02:23:49,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Tommy brought love to our family and we are all blessed to have been a part of his life.

1493
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:52,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Could all rise for a moment of silence.

1494
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:11,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and that leaves us with negotiations and legal matters.

1495
02:24:12,454 --> 02:24:15,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to go into executive session by Ms.

1496
02:24:15,316 --> 02:24:17,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Dervisiero, seconded by Ms.

1497
02:24:17,257 --> 02:24:17,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Kretz.

1498
02:24:17,518 --> 02:24:18,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, Ms.

1499
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:18,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustone.

1500
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:20,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
