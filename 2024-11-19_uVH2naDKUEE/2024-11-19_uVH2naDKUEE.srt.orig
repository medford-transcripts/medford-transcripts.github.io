[SPEAKER_10]: Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

20
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:35,475
[SPEAKER_03]: United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:47,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

22
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,100
[SPEAKER_10]: 21-598 offered by Councilor Morrell.

23
00:00:52,549 --> 00:01:10,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that the city council request that the health department and building department me to discuss any existing policies around masonry dust caused by outdoor dry cutting report back to the council on the city city administration's plan in the interest of public safety council morale.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:20,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, yeah I've actually had a number of residents reach out with concern over this with our hilly landscape and Medford there's no shortage of masonry and walls in the community.

25
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:26,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes what comes with that is dry cutting where you can see clouds of dust, emitting from these cutting activities and.

26
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:33,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Oftentimes this dust can actually contain very incredibly dangerous materials like crystalline silica.

27
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:40,923
[SPEAKER_08]: There are OSHA requirements around this, but again I feel the complaints from residents who are seeing this go on in their neighborhood.

28
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:45,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I've connected with Building Commissioner Moki about this and I'm just curious to see

29
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:51,770
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a way we can perhaps set some policies or guidance that people can get when they're pulling a permit.

30
00:01:51,811 --> 00:02:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I know not all of these projects require permits, but if they're pulling a permit or something we can share just with the public because this actually is a very dangerous material that gets emitted, you know, on our streets in our neighborhoods that people might not know.

31
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:16,286
[SPEAKER_08]: give them the opportunity to flag this because there are abatement and engineering controls that can be easily done as far as vacuuming the dust or vacuum systems for the dust and water delivery systems.

32
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:21,990
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just seeking if it's possible to have these apartments meet and see if there are recommendations that can come out.

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:32,776
[SPEAKER_08]: for a policy so that we can point to this, we can inform residents and we can inform workers because they're the ones that are most directly impacted by this very dangerous dust.

34
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So I move approval.

35
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:35,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

36
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:40,301
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Knight.

37
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:42,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Any discussion?

38
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:44,283
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

39
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:44,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

40
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:45,864
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

41
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:47,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes. 21599.

42
00:02:51,009 --> 00:03:09,998
[SPEAKER_10]: and 21609 offered by Councilor Morrell and President Caravaglio be it so resolved that the City Council receive an update on the timeline of the Eversource project and paving and offered by President Caravaglio be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss the Mystic Avenue paving done Saturday night into Sunday morning.

43
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:11,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morrell.

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:22,297
[SPEAKER_08]: As we're nearing the completion of construction season, we got an update at the beginning of this project launching once again with the work earlier in the spring.

46
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The council had concerns about the speed at which this would be completed.

47
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we still had projected another potential two to three years.

48
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:32,624
[SPEAKER_08]: We pushed back on that because part of that was held up by detail.

49
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:38,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe they ended up having at least two crews going at once based on my experience driving through the area.

50
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it would be great to have an update on, you know, what is the forecasted completion date?

51
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:49,634
[SPEAKER_08]: When can residents expect to see this, you know, the length of this project repave curb to curb?

52
00:03:50,135 --> 00:04:00,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there are any places for residents to have input that haven't already been decided, it would be great for residents to know that because I know there's, you know, there are plans for a number of crosswalks, but also

53
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:04,523
[SPEAKER_08]: decisions around bike lanes and things of that nature, I think would be great.

54
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:17,571
[SPEAKER_08]: And residents would appreciate after this extremely long project, hopefully someday wrapping up, you know, having their input on what the future of their neighborhood looks like, particularly because they have been bombarded with the impacts of this project for so long.

55
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So seeing an update when we can expect completion, when is that curve to curve paving going to happen?

56
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are other ways residents can provide input?

57
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:26,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council Member.

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:35,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And on my motion, I've got concerns about the paving that was already done.

59
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:42,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I had an opportunity to go by the part of Mystic Avenue that was done Sunday night into Monday.

60
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:47,405
[SPEAKER_10]: If you drive by there now, you can see it's pooling all over the place.

61
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:50,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, it's either it's uneven.

62
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:56,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I know very little about paving, but I can see that there's a pooling in several different areas.

63
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:08,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's already coming up in some spots you can you can see the, you can see there's no seals around the edges and say it's a, my opinion, it's shoddy work at best.

64
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:14,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And if this council is going to get blamed for the things that are done and say, I want to hold people accountable.

65
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:23,135
[SPEAKER_10]: who did the lousy work over there, because if this is what they did over here, we've got another few miles of street that has to be paved by Eversource.

66
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:28,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And they say, if this is the way they're gonna do it, it's not right.

67
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:31,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they paved in the, it's raining all week.

68
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Who paves in the rain?

69
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I went up and looked at paving statutes,

70
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:43,771
[SPEAKER_10]: says you shouldn't be paving when you know there's going to be three, four or five days of rain, because it never cures.

71
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I think Tim's on the line here and I think we have Mr. Karen's here.

72
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:51,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I, in my opinion, I think that should be torn up and refixed again.

73
00:05:53,715 --> 00:06:02,438
[SPEAKER_10]: To make it up to the where it should be the same status because at the end when it comes up, who's going to fit the bill for us, it's gonna be the taxpayers in the city of Medford.

74
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,519
[SPEAKER_10]: So Kevin, did you want to speak on that?

75
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Mr. President and members of the council.

76
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,446
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a disgrace.

77
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put it to your point blank, all right?

78
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:34,272
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the paving is concerned, as far as the timetable, all right, between the time it began and the records for the details and everything else, and Tim can speak a little bit more on it, all right, everything was pretty much completed before the rain actually started.

79
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:37,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It started a light rain, all right?

80
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:53,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my opinion, with many years in the business, all right, and I have Mr. Tenaglia, the highway foreman, same thing, many, many years, in our opinion, all right, there was not enough hot tub applied, all right?

81
00:06:54,227 --> 00:07:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, of course, we've had rain ever since, and yes, there's puddling, okay, which obviously with the rain that worked in our favor as far as seeing where the divots were and, you know, the low valley areas,

82
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:12,608
[SPEAKER_02]: but now we've gotta wait for it to dry, all right, to closely examine the overall surface, all right?

83
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: They did three pulls, which is, in our term, three passes, all right, as far as application is concerned.

84
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:28,002
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, based on what we've observed, in our opinion, all right, maybe they only applied two inches.

85
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have maybe applied three, all right?

86
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:40,297
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some basins out there that clearly show, okay, the lack of, all right, the lack of the asphalt, all right?

87
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:54,849
[SPEAKER_02]: The highway department, prior to them paving both South Street and Mystic Ave, completely rebuilt 21 castings, or catch basins, as you wanna call it, in six days in preparation for them to come in.

88
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they came in, all right, on time,

89
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:02,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, all right, we're not satisfied.

90
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:07,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I did talk to the city engineer about South Street.

91
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:13,435
[SPEAKER_02]: South Street is penciled in for Thursday during the day.

92
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:19,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, based on the weather, okay, I know there's gonna be puddles out there and everything else.

93
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's any kind of water on the existing road,

94
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,278
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not gonna be allowed to pay till the road is dry.

95
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:32,161
[SPEAKER_10]: According to what I read, it says that the road should be dry for at least two days.

96
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, exactly.

97
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, depending on the condition of it tomorrow afternoon, it's considerable puddles out there on the asphalt that still exists.

98
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not be coming in and paving over puddles on South Street.

99
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:56,373
[SPEAKER_02]: The South Street job is going to be a daytime job, where Mr. Gabb was a night job, when it does occur.

100
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a representative on site when this work is being done?

101
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yep.

102
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,918
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was their opinion when that work was being done?

103
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:08,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, same thing.

104
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:12,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim McGiven can add to what I'm saying, Mr. President.

105
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, was there a representative from the city on site on Sunday and Monday night?

106
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:20,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we have a field engineer for the whole job, AI.

107
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't received the report yet.

108
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:26,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk to him this morning, actually yesterday morning, when I was talking to you as well.

109
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:31,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the report, as Mr. Karen said, was that they completed before rain.

110
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:43,833
[SPEAKER_00]: The two most important things, as I wrote to all the counselors in my email today, the two most important things when we're talking about paving is the temperature of various things, as well as whether or not there are puddles, standing moisture,

111
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,874
[SPEAKER_00]: on the milled surface or any surface that you're paving.

112
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty critical.

113
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:52,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, our field engineer AI, they're well versed in this.

114
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:53,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well versed in this.

115
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with mass.spec.

116
00:09:56,576 --> 00:10:03,318
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the most important thing is during the compaction process, it's not raining on the material while it's being compacted.

117
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't happen, but we're going to keep a close eye on it.

118
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:16,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, like I said in my email, you know, Mr. Cairns, as well as Steve Tanaglia have brought up that there are some areas that maybe are lower or didn't get enough coverage.

119
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:22,462
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we'll talk to our field engineer and see what, you know, we usually get information on depth of coverage and things like that.

120
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:27,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the city would have to accept the work in accordance to the agreement before we move forward.

121
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:39,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time watching paving operations in other places and it's pretty consistent to pave in windows and then have it rain.

122
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:49,540
[SPEAKER_00]: But from my perspective and from my professional opinion, as long as the compaction and the sealing of the surface, which happens during the final compaction, happens,

123
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,581
[SPEAKER_00]: before rain, you're in good shape.

124
00:10:51,961 --> 00:11:02,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually as Mr Karen was saying, sometimes rain afterwards can actually help you see, see deficiencies in the payment job so those steps don't need to happen.

125
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:06,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I've driven it myself but I haven't, you know, gotten up close and inspected things.

126
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Our field engineer is good at calling me directly if there's any issues.

127
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:17,275
[SPEAKER_00]: They're writing me and they didn't have any issues right away that they need to contact us about.

128
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And I await their field report.

129
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them at the end of the week.

130
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,659
[SPEAKER_10]: But Tim, they knew it was going to rain all week.

131
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So did I. Yeah, I actually greenlighted it.

132
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I green lighted it because it met mascot specs.

133
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:37,096
[SPEAKER_00]: And my concern was that they get it done before the rain and they were able to do that.

134
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:46,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Mr. Cairns mentioned, there is a window on Thursday, but I've already given them the red light for Thursday because it is raining all day tomorrow, most likely.

135
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:52,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, one of the critical elements is that there's no standing water on the milled surface.

136
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:55,330
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's standing water on the milled surface, potting,

137
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive moisture, that's a full stop because that is touching the hot asphalt before it gets compacted and the compaction is actually the most important process in the whole laying of asphalt.

138
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's what I'm looking for.

139
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:24,488
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many other variables, you know, travel time, temperature of the mix, temperature of the scupper, what type of hopper that they're using, all of these things.

140
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:29,272
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of factors, but the ones that I described are really the critical ones.

141
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:40,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing is if there was some sort of mistake made, a field engineer missed something or they skimped by with a depth or something like that, it's usually pretty obvious.

142
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:44,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And they usually pavements like that that are put down faulty don't last a winter.

143
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Every source is around probably for another year.

144
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I know Councilor Morrell was talking about an update.

145
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:54,875
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is South Street, obviously it's milled now where

146
00:12:55,362 --> 00:13:06,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for a window to green light paving, it's probably not going to be Thursday, I've already said no to that it's most likely going to be Monday or Tuesday, that weather looks good enough time for the surface to dry.

147
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:17,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're probably looking at another construction season to tell you the truth, they say a partial construction season but knowing their pace, it's probably going to be a full construction season next year, and that would

148
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:23,827
[SPEAKER_00]: cap things off with the repaving of Winthrop Street and the rest of the project that they didn't pay this year.

149
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:30,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mass dot section of Mystic Avenue and Winthrop Street and the section of Main Street in front of the police station.

150
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, Mystic Avenue is probably one of the heaviest traveled roads in the city of Medford.

151
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Trucks going down it all day and night.

152
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And with skimping on the hot tub.

153
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,341
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even sealed around the edges.

154
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:45,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, not acceptable.

155
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,520
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to get blamed for this.

156
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, yeah, we're not.

157
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,482
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Eversource's job.

158
00:13:53,622 --> 00:13:56,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're providing oversight, but this is Eversource's job.

159
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't seal, no one seals asphalt at the edges.

160
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:07,531
[SPEAKER_00]: You seal it at where you abut existing pavement and you seal at the castings because that water can seep in.

161
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:11,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tack coat that goes on around the castings, a tack coat that goes on the

162
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:14,594
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have butt edges, but up against the curb, it's usually not sealed.

163
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:21,675
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tack coat right at the milling surface, right below where it butts up against the curb.

164
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:32,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually this should be, if I look at it closely and they're not, I don't know if it's a problem or not, I have to look at it, but there should be a little bit of a lip at the curb where the roller doesn't quite make it up against the curb.

165
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:35,558
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically what you see, but you know,

166
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:46,467
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to kind of like look at the whole thing and say, acceptable, not acceptable, you know, and see what needs to be redone when they come back, you know, after the winter, basically.

167
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,271
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the DPW director saying that there's not enough hot sauce there.

168
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to come back and put more hot sauce down?

169
00:14:54,108 --> 00:15:08,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we have to, we have to wait and see what our field engineer saw and also I believe there was a number specified in in the MOU so you know we look at how much asphalt was put down what the depth was that the scope was set for the for the actual paving.

170
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all that, that, you know, I expect to see that information in the report.

171
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Mr. Cairns and I, you know, I trust his opinion.

172
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:20,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if there are areas that he feels that, you know, there wasn't enough put down, it's simple.

173
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cut a little chunk out and we measure it.

174
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:28,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not to depth that as specified, then we find out what the limits are and they have to redo it.

175
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very simple.

176
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,306
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are they going to carry all those spots with this with this pooling of water right now.

177
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:49,697
[SPEAKER_00]: So the this so the mo you the mo you does not have any regrading or elimination of low spots, it was a resurfacing just a million overlay that you know basic Milan overlay so it doesn't solve regrading or low points or anything like that, however.

178
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,488
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are low points that were not there before.

179
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that should be pretty obvious.

180
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:04,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Then that means one of them is someone that I went by this morning and there was people there taking pictures this morning.

181
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:05,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

182
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would hope that they're gonna be there to go.

183
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:21,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would insist that you have them take all the bonds for the next 10 years to cover this, because in the end, they're gonna be gone, and the taxpayer benefit are gonna be footing the bill for this, and we're gonna be complaining.

184
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:28,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would insist that you make them put all the bonds for their work to hold them liable.

185
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:30,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morocco.

186
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:44,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think you just addressed this, but the question is, you know, if we find that there are, this is not up to snuff, is it going to be a full pass again, or is it going to be piecemeal work already?

187
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:54,951
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on, it depends on if, you know, if they missed the depth in the whole thing, or if the mix was the wrong temperature.

188
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would have been notified by our field engineer if they had

189
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:00,037
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, waited too long.

190
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,078
[SPEAKER_00]: The mix was cold.

191
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:06,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think, well, I think they moved pretty quickly actually, because they had to do three passes in about six hours.

192
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's quick.

193
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved quick.

194
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not anticipating that there's going to be issues with temperature.

195
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was, uh, 50 degrees or so at the lowest point.

196
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:23,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but if it was, yeah, I mean, if it was a, um, uh, you know, uh, a subpar or unacceptable job, not to spec.

197
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,766
[SPEAKER_00]: then the whole job wouldn't be acceptable.

198
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,872
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are large swaths that are acceptable, that's good asphalt.

199
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:34,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan necessarily of ripping up asphalt that's in good shape.

200
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a petroleum product.

201
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,505
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a product that

202
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:57,663
[SPEAKER_00]: uh you know once it gets into place if it's in good shape it should last its life if it's put into spec so um we are looking at all of those and it is our job to look at all of that information and either accept the work or not accept it or create a punch list for repair and to hold the

203
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:14,532
[SPEAKER_00]: entity that is doing the work accountable, just like we did with Comcast when they did Medford Square, just like we're going to do with the developer who's paving a portion of Medford Street next week, you know, just like we do with any contractor who is coming into the city to pave a public way, basically.

204
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would hold them accountable just like anybody else.

205
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And President Carviel, that is certainly a suggestion we will take up for consideration, some sort of bond, if it turns out that there are, you know,

206
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,679
[SPEAKER_00]: significant issues with that.

207
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:36,886
[SPEAKER_00]: If I believe, Mr. Kearns believe, our field engineer believes that there are significant concerns where we feel like there needs to be a bond in place for 10 years and hold them accountable.

208
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:43,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, that is their work and it has to be either accepted or not accepted by the city.

209
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:47,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next phase of the process, basically.

210
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's your position that's the final decider as far as it being accepted or not?

211
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:54,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine so, yeah.

212
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:57,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

213
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Box.

214
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

215
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,076
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two department heads before us tonight.

216
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna make sure they're here and they're not intimidated by being here before the Medford City Council.

217
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:14,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a question?

218
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they both fine with being here?

219
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:20,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm intimidated appearing before the Memphis City Council.

220
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

221
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:25,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not intimidated by being in front of the Memphis City Council.

222
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Engineer.

223
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Have the deficiencies that have been pointed out by the city DPW staff been brought to the attention of Eversource as of tonight?

224
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they have not, not yet.

225
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

226
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: When do we plan on bringing this forward to Eversource?

227
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:50,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have, um, I, you know, I want to get the field engineers field report.

228
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:58,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a look at myself and, uh, you know, um, I do need to sit down with Brian and Steve and make sure we list out what, what they saw.

229
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:07,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we can put eyeballs on it and make sure that, uh, um, we confirm the observations that they've made and make sure that we're, um,

230
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:11,527
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, organizing that information, that material correctly, so it can be addressed.

231
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some issues as well.

232
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:23,375
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues with ADA ramps out there that I think are, you know, serious issues with how they decided to do the ADA upgrade.

233
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:24,556
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's disagreement there.

234
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:34,302
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, other things like they considered curb to curb, gutter to gutter when they first did the milling.

235
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:40,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been on these guys quite a lot to do things per Medford standards.

236
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:44,156
[SPEAKER_00]: They're falling short in places and we are calling them out on it.

237
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a weekly meeting with them on Thursdays.

238
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:54,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So I plan to try to have a pretty concise list of issues with work that they've completed so far on Thursday, so it can be reported out.

239
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's in the process right now then?

240
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:00,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

241
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's absolutely in the process.

242
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's just part of the work that we do.

243
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:12,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so if we can just be kept abreast of how that goes along would be helpful.

244
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:19,635
[SPEAKER_03]: The second question I had is where do we stand with the mitigation items with Eversource?

245
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Have some of the items been completed to date and where do we stand?

246
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:32,827
[SPEAKER_00]: The items in the MOU, like the Winthrop Street sidewalk and the Winthrop Circle ramps and things like that.

247
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:33,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

248
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:37,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the mitigation items are on South Street.

249
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:41,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they do the South Street paving, those will come to fruition.

250
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,592
[SPEAKER_00]: The striping of South Street and some raised tables for traffic calming.

251
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:52,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So those will be, as soon as they basically do the paving, we'll see those.

252
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:57,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they do the striping, we'll see that striping work.

253
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:07,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the Winthrop Street sidewalk goes and the ramps in the circle, we have the contractors queued up.

254
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,348
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we got contracts open with contractors.

255
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:16,732
[SPEAKER_00]: We are most likely going to do that work in coordination with the

256
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:21,358
[SPEAKER_00]: the development that is redoing a portion of Lorain Road.

257
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:25,341
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with them over the last couple of months to coordinate that layout.

258
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:29,043
[SPEAKER_00]: So residents may see that layout actually marked out in the field.

259
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:40,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be for our contractor when they get that sidewalk work in before the restoration, the full restoration work, sometime later in the season, whenever Swiss does that.

260
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:46,795
[SPEAKER_00]: So that winter tree work is gonna happen early, mid next construction season.

261
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so that was actually very helpful to get that update.

262
00:22:51,089 --> 00:23:00,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sidewalk work that was originally included in the MOU did not include the sidewalk up to Playstead Road, from Lorraine to Playstead Road.

263
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:08,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And this council requested by unanimous vote to have that sidewalk done as part of this project.

264
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it fair to say that that's not gonna happen?

265
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:21,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not fair to say that so I've been I've been advocating for that, um, you know, and I believe, you know, I'm trying to make it happen put it that way.

266
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:27,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd like to get get the funding to get the sidewalk and curbing all the way up to place that.

267
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,208
[SPEAKER_00]: There are challenges associated with that.

268
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,729
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sidewalk from Smith Lane to Playstead.

269
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It's skinny.

270
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:35,009
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no curbing.

271
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:37,970
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some areas where the grass strip has been paved.

272
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,171
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are potentially some design issues that we have to overcome.

273
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:48,272
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm trying to get that work done before the Winthrop Street restoration.

274
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:54,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made any commitments to anybody, but I'm pursuing that to see if we can figure out a way to do it.

275
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,955
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm hoping that it works out.

276
00:23:59,577 --> 00:23:59,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

277
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:00,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Kearns.

279
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:07,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic's not on.

280
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:09,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's on.

281
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:10,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.

282
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.

283
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's on.

284
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it?

285
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

286
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, when we get a break in the weather.

287
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:20,377
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm gonna walk, Mr. Gaffney.

288
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:30,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive it every day, a dozen times, all right, and you can see, you know, a lot of things as you drive it, but I'm gonna walk it once, okay, it dries out.

289
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:38,867
[SPEAKER_11]: What if vice president, I'm hearing the city engineer say that we have somebody that's on site that works for the city.

290
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is the DPW commissioner walking it if we have somebody that's on site that's supposed to be doing this anyway?

291
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:51,829
[SPEAKER_11]: We have somebody on site that's saying that's supposed to be overseeing the project and we have the highway superintendent, the DPW commissioner saying that's not up to specs.

292
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:54,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say this.

293
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,713
[SPEAKER_02]: If in fact, councillor, I totally disagree again with the report.

294
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:03,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the report hasn't been filed yet with the city engineer.

295
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:08,678
[SPEAKER_02]: If I disagree with it, then they're gonna be before me and explain why.

296
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,184
[SPEAKER_11]: They are saying apples I'm saying oranges, what I'm saying I guess is why is it gotten to this point if we have somebody that's there.

297
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:17,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's supposed to be overseeing the project anyway.

298
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:23,531
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if in your expert opinion and in this gentleman's expert opinion, it doesn't cut the mustard.

299
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:27,634
[SPEAKER_11]: We have somebody that we've appointed and put in a position to be overseeing this project.

300
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:29,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it getting to this point.

301
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for starters, obviously, I cannot speak right for, you know, the engineer statements to Tim.

302
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they get the finalized report, they sit down.

303
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:44,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the question, who is responsible for the oversight of the project?

304
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:45,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.

305
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:49,408
[SPEAKER_02]: The engineer that the city engineer has assigned to the job.

306
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, who is that?

307
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

308
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:52,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim?

309
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That's AI engineers.

310
00:25:55,723 --> 00:26:16,113
[SPEAKER_11]: They were hired before I started so it's not it's so it's not a it's not a person that works in this community that's assigned to do that it's a consultant or a contractor it's it's an outside source that's responsible for doing the oversight oversight it's not it's not like we have George Connie in the engineer's office that's responsible for it we've had some outside entity that we've contracted.

311
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:23,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so every source paid for gave the city money to have a field engineer there, they report directly to me.

312
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:33,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're responsible for making sure that the work is done to Medford standards to the agreements that were established.

313
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:36,093
[SPEAKER_00]: with every source.

314
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:48,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will tell you that we have had to supplement that work, you know, whether it's George, myself, someone else from my office to go out and look at something to confirm something.

315
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:54,458
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that on a regular basis, but usually construction jobs require full-time observation.

316
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:56,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what AI is doing, full-time observation.

317
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:06,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we have AI engineering, who's the city's contract for the oversight of the project.

318
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:16,189
[SPEAKER_11]: How often do they report back to the engineer's office with the specs and the like on progress of the project?

319
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:20,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, if there are any immediate issues, I usually get a phone call or an email right away.

320
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,232
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, I get daily reports on a weekly basis.

321
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:28,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So every Friday, I basically receive the weekly reports for the week.

322
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:39,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, did I understand you correct when you said that it's not part of the city's MOU or method standards to include regrading in this type of contract.

323
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:40,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

324
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:46,867
[SPEAKER_00]: And can I just ask why I don't know the agreement was made before my time.

325
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:52,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all kinds of questions like that, Councilor Knight with with this particular agreement, and that's, that's one.

326
00:27:52,934 --> 00:28:03,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I should tell my you and I have a number of conversations and I think we share some of the same concerns but I mean ultimately, if the community is going through years and years of inconvenience to get these type of projects, taking care of.

327
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,821
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be some sort of measurable mitigation that we can receive.

328
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:17,671
[SPEAKER_11]: would make sense to if they're going to be tearing up our streets in entirety to when they resurface them, resurface them at a gradient that's smooth, right?

329
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:22,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think that that would only make sense to be included as part of the MOU and the specs.

330
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:36,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, you know, I appreciate the fact that we do have a field engineer, but I think that the work that is being conducted needs to be looked at a little bit harder and it needs to be inspected a little bit stronger.

331
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And the field engineer needs to be a little bit more calm.

332
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:45,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

333
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

334
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:47,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

335
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to, Mr. President, I agree with you.

336
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:51,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you made a very good point.

337
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: You take a look at Mystic Ave.

338
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:58,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It is probably one of the most heavily traversed streets in our city.

339
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been ripped up.

340
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been ripped up for a while.

341
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:03,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one chance to get this done and get it done right.

342
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have some serious concerns now.

343
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:09,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,

344
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, I mean, we all knew it was gonna rain Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

345
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:19,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is that really the best time to put down hot top or asphalt?

346
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:21,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is that the best time?

347
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:24,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, could we wait another week?

348
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand the rush at this point.

349
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,061
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already pushed back and delayed.

350
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody knows that there are issues with the milled surface and raised castings.

351
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a hazard.

352
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:39,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So this window was acceptable and it met specs.

353
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:44,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they got the green light to do it on Sunday.

354
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:50,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there is never an ideal situation where everything is done perfectly to spec.

355
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:04,624
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you read mass.spec, and I mean, I've been working with this for, you know, going on 10 years now, you know, they typically even allow when it starts raining for the last load to be put down and paved.

356
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's on your highways that you drop.

357
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:14,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, like I said, the most important from an engineering standpoint is the compaction process and making sure that the temperature is correct.

358
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:22,795
[SPEAKER_00]: the right type of roller is used, and the asphalt is compacted during dry weather, and the surface is dry that it's adhering to.

359
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,836
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are critical.

360
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:29,161
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of other variables, and it's almost never perfect.

361
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:37,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was within the specification and within the green light

362
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:45,515
[SPEAKER_00]: That and that's that's it and we're getting up to the end of the season, every day that goes by now, it's going to be getting colder, higher chances of rain.

363
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:48,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So, towards this time of year, the plants close in November 15.

364
00:30:50,385 --> 00:31:02,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Every window is looked at, and if you, any city, any operation, paving operation, when they're trying to do work around this time of year, these are the type of windows that you get.

365
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:07,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Eversource wants to pave it Thursday, but the problem with that is it's going to rain Wednesday.

366
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's raining two or three days before you pave, that is a problem.

367
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:17,713
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to rain after you pave and after you've compacted and sealed the pavement, it's not that big of a deal.

368
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,273
[SPEAKER_00]: It really isn't.

369
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,251
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, what you're looking for, are there puddles?

370
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:33,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going, when it gets compacted, is that compaction going to be negatively impacted by water falling from the sky or on the road?

371
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what we're looking for.

372
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:40,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Rain damages pavement, even if pavement's been sitting there for 20 years and it's nice and secure, rain damages it.

373
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time it rains, all of our pavement gets damaged.

374
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,862
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes freshly done pavement, and that includes pavement that's been there for 20 years.

375
00:31:50,322 --> 00:32:07,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's not ideal, but what would be ideal is if asphalt was allowed to cure for many, many days without any vehicles on it and with no rain and perfect humidity and perfect temperature, but we never, ever get that.

376
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:09,872
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that answers the question.

377
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand, and I understand there's never a perfect time for this, but I guess my other concern now is, you know, we're talking about, it's been resurfaced.

378
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:25,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're talking about the quality of the resurfacing and whether or not there was enough asphalt put down.

379
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:31,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's been raining for three days by the time this is all said and done.

380
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:37,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And now if it needs more asphalt on top, I would imagine that moisture is gonna set in.

381
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,934
[SPEAKER_07]: You know-

382
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,322
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put asphalt on top.

383
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:55,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were short by half an inch, you don't put a half an inch on top, you cut out the section that is insufficient and you put down the correct amount and it gets tapered in.

384
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:59,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's not, you don't just put it on top.

385
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same, so it's the same spec.

386
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:07,274
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're putting a top course on a binder course, it works the same.

387
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,361
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's standing water, standing moisture on the asphalt surface, you don't pave.

388
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:22,204
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is, is because the oil that's in the asphalt, the bitumen, that material, it hits the water and it repels.

389
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't adhere.

390
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:35,067
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put down pavement, you want all of the particles of sand and gravel to adhere to the bitumen and for the bitumen to adhere to the surface.

391
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,368
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compact it, you push it all together.

392
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:43,069
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's water in there, it's going to be detrimental to the pavement.

393
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:50,976
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no water in there, and you compact and you seal, then you have good pavement, and it was put down to spec.

394
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:52,178
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking for.

395
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,680
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what folks like MassDOT are looking for.

396
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,543
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what every probably city engineer that's looking for in my position.

397
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:02,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, if it meets the spec, that's what we want to see.

398
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:08,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see operations that meet the spec as far as the temperature, rain, the conditions, all of that.

399
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:14,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, MassDOT does go into detail in their specification about what weather limitations are allowed.

400
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,894
[SPEAKER_00]: It really focuses on temperature because that's a key thing.

401
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:22,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's 40 degrees or lower, no paving because you're just not going to get good pavement.

402
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:30,617
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounds like there are pieces of this, of this road that we could possibly dig up to make sure it's done right if it wasn't done right the first time.

403
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:41,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there are methods that you can use to determine whether it like if, like, for example, you know, Mr. Karen says, oh, this area, it looks like it's short, you didn't put enough down, or maybe they milled too much or something.

404
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:43,305
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a core.

405
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:48,628
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a little core and it tells you how deep the pavement was, whether or not it met spec

406
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:49,567
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.

407
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:51,888
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, it's usually pretty easy.

408
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,729
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does, it's usually pretty easy.

409
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:57,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically straightforward stuff.

410
00:35:00,672 --> 00:35:04,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm just concerned that we're digging up new pavement already.

411
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems to be one of the biggest complaints I get is when we're putting down new roads and all of a sudden, you know, someone's in there a week later digging up

412
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:15,325
[SPEAKER_07]: pavement right away.

413
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:28,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the last thing I think anyone wants to see is that we're going to be digging up roads, when it was just recently resurfaced so that that's definitely a concern, and I always think about the structural integrity after that because I feel like anytime you dig into a road.

414
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:34,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Afterwards, I mean, it's always just, you just get potholes, it's falling apart.

415
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:39,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look throughout our community, you know, infrastructure is a major issue.

416
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:46,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have potholes no matter what neighborhood you go to, there are potholes throughout this city that need to be addressed.

417
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really concerned that we're having this road, it's recently been paved, and I feel like it could very,

418
00:35:54,395 --> 00:36:08,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very possible that there could be issues already so that that's, that's one of my big concerns I'm also concerned about, you know, the AI engineers, you know, I mean how to do they they will burst and what our standards are here in the city of Medford with regard to paving.

419
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:17,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we so I mean we use typical mass dot specifications for asphalt and for placement, and I will say just to comment on your.

420
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:20,182
[SPEAKER_00]: your statements there.

421
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:27,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're talking about surfaces, like removing surface that was not put down to spec, that's different than actually digging to the road.

422
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,571
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have an issue with a contractor digging into High Street after we repaved it.

423
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was furious about that, including myself.

424
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:36,375
[SPEAKER_00]: That was completely uncalled for and unacceptable.

425
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:38,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were supposed to be there two days before the paving.

426
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that do happen.

427
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:45,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe on 4th Street, after we paved 4th Street, there was a water main break on 4th Street.

428
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:51,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes there's gas leaks after we pave, and then National Grid will come in and fix the leak.

429
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree, it's not OK to happen.

430
00:36:55,005 --> 00:37:01,567
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our best to coordinate that type of work, and we try to get the gas lines, get National Grid in there to replace the gas lines beforehand.

431
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's work that we're doing in my office now, trying to coordinate the next round of paving with the new pavement management plan and all the new information that we have.

432
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:24,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they put down the road and they resurface the road, AI engineers are present and they're evaluating the process and making sure that it meets the standards that are set forth by your office, I'm assuming.

433
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:28,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So if something's not right, are you notified right away?

434
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:33,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an engineer in your office notified right away or do you wait for the weekly report?

435
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:34,148
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that work?

436
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:43,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually notified right away if it's a if it's an issue like say they're trenching and they come across a utility that they didn't anticipate or they break something that they didn't anticipate.

437
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:46,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually get a phone call right away.

438
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:52,184
[SPEAKER_00]: But if usually no news is good news if I don't hear from them I get the weekly reports and.

439
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:56,468
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I see if they're, if usually it's, you know, everything is fine.

440
00:37:57,428 --> 00:38:00,611
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, occasionally, I do get notified right away.

441
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's the day after if it's not an immediate thing, or if they need an answer on something.

442
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:10,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So with regard to the road surfacing, in this case, was were you notified right away?

443
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Or did AI wait a few days?

444
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,420
[SPEAKER_07]: How did that work?

445
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:21,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was told when I checked in with them on Monday morning that they felt it was placed per specification.

446
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:28,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what their, just their verbal report was to me.

447
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll wait and get the report and see if there's any additional information in there.

448
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:34,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I need more information, I'll be asking them.

449
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:34,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

450
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:38,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the process from here on out?

451
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so if you know there's an issue, do you go down right away and check it out so it can be, you know,

452
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:49,247
[SPEAKER_07]: remedy right away or do you just wait for the report and go from there?

453
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,690
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't remedy the asphalt right away.

454
00:38:53,230 --> 00:39:00,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we will do is collect information from Mr. Cairns, Mr. Tanaglia,

455
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:13,363
[SPEAKER_00]: If the field engineer has any observations that include deficiencies, any deficiencies that I see, Mr. Blake sees with the crosswalks or ADA compliance or anything like that on the sidewalks.

456
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:20,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is put into a report to say these are all the deficiencies and why we can't accept your work or this work.

457
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:22,388
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that work has to be remedied.

458
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:34,233
[SPEAKER_00]: If that remedy is asphalt related, so that surface coast that they put on, we would have to coordinate with them to figure out what they need to fix, the limits of what they need to fix.

459
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it would be in a situation like this.

460
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:42,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, just a hypothetical example, if it turns out they didn't put down enough thickness in an area and created a low point,

461
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:49,760
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you draw the line to say okay well you have to replace this section from here to here or something like that.

462
00:39:50,581 --> 00:40:05,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we would go about that and it's fresh pavement so you have some time to make the budding seals nice as opposed to you know waiting a few years and trying to tie something in which never works out that great.

463
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:11,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's opportunity to fix it, but it's not going to happen right away.

464
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:19,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we don't want it to happen right away because it has been raining and there are issues with water on the surface.

465
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:30,109
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they go to fix what we say is a low point and then they put the pavement down and it's wet and standing water, then it's no good now anyway.

466
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:38,995
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the idea is to put a comprehensive list together of any deficiencies that we believe exist.

467
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:44,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might need to be tested, for example, like a core or something like that.

468
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:53,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we would solicit proposals from Eversource on how to repair the situation.

469
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:57,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a rough outline of the process.

470
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, last question.

471
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:06,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilmarks mentioned earlier about those sidewalks going from Lorain Road to Playstead.

472
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:08,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you said you're working on that.

473
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:13,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any type of a timeframe as to when you think you might have an answer as to whether or not that's something that we can do?

474
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:19,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping over the winter to suss that out completely.

475
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding and design, if we need design.

476
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:23,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.

477
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:27,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we secured the well not secured that's not the right word.

478
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:37,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We completed our coordination and design and bidding and getting a contractor for the work that we do have queued up so now that that's done that.

479
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:51,072
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us the opportunity to work on trying to get the rest of it, to get it funded, because it's, you know, putting $50,000 worth of sidewalk in, it's not much.

480
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:58,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do the next, whatever it is, 800 feet or 1,000 feet down to playstead, that's significant money that's not in the Eversource agreement.

481
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:00,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to, you know,

482
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already mentioned it to the mayor, and we're gonna have to sit down again.

483
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:11,362
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be opportunities to move some things around in the Eversource agreement to get that done.

484
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,984
[SPEAKER_00]: There's $75,000 for a stormwater BMP.

485
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not exactly sure why we need that.

486
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been given a good answer yet.

487
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:22,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that might be opportunity to use some of that money for a sidewalk.

488
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:26,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know yet, but hopefully over the winter, Councilor Falco will have everything sussed out.

489
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:28,157
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that would be my goal.

490
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:31,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And I couldn't hear that though.

491
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,602
[SPEAKER_07]: You said that there was a stormwater something.

492
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:35,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you repeat that please?

493
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:36,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.

494
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:44,530
[SPEAKER_00]: In the MOU, there's $75,000 set aside for a stormwater BMP or best management practice on South Street.

495
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been inquiring here and there about the purpose for that and the reason and all that.

496
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:52,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still not quite sure what that is.

497
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:55,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't make sense to do it if there's no good reason to do it.

498
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:00,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, we might be able to, you know, work with that resource.

499
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it would be a renegotiation of that item.

500
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:07,808
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially put it towards sidewalks on Winthrop Street.

501
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:26,511
[SPEAKER_00]: No promises but that's kind of in my head that's what I would like to try to do to at least open up that money to do that and I think the city would still need to supplement because you know it's significantly longer and may require design as well which always adds complexities.

502
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:33,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never really easy just to add curbing in the sidewalk and I know residents just want us to add curbing in the sidewalk but

503
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:36,354
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy as that.

504
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, thank you very much for your help.

505
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:39,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

506
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:40,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

507
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:41,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

508
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:43,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

509
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:46,816
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm gonna go at this a few different ways.

510
00:43:46,856 --> 00:44:03,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim, first of all, thank you for listening to us and giving us the answers as a department head the best you can, because we've been accused of being bullies in sense to other department heads, but I think people don't understand.

511
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:09,877
[SPEAKER_12]: When this isn't a console Scott Pelley issue of console Falco show council moral issue.

512
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,258
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an issue that we get from our constituents.

513
00:44:12,638 --> 00:44:14,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I think all of us got calls saying is this crazy.

514
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at Mr. Gav, what a mess, what are they doing.

515
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:22,517
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a reflection to how we feel.

516
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:25,759
[SPEAKER_12]: We're the voices that people call to ask these questions.

517
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,341
[SPEAKER_12]: So first, I wanna thank you just for doing the best you can to answer these questions.

518
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:40,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they're not ideal answers that we all wanna hear, because we all wanted to hear you say tonight, Tim, is okay, it's all gonna be repaved, everything's gonna be perfect, and we'll do it right.

519
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:43,587
[SPEAKER_12]: But we know that's not the case, but we do have to figure this out.

520
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe not Mr. Cabot as we move forward.

521
00:44:47,458 --> 00:45:01,576
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked year after year of a clerk of work, someone that represents the city of Medford and what the city of Medford requires to their specifications for what this council is going to be asked on and answer these questions.

522
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:11,761
[SPEAKER_12]: not a consultant and I asked at the budget meetings, the chief of staff responded by saying, we would like to look into I think was a resolution put in place that we'd asked that.

523
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:22,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't we as we bring all these projects into Medford, ask for part of a fee to go to a clerk of the works that's hired.

524
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:36,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the city of method that knows our specs understands what we expect in this community, because I'm sure I'm sure that the engineer that they hired is a qualified engineer, but at that engineers there to collect a check from ever source.

525
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:40,058
[SPEAKER_12]: And that person is going to look at that and say hey it looks great.

526
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:43,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I will tell you in the community I work in.

527
00:45:44,523 --> 00:46:04,553
[SPEAKER_12]: If they know there's rain coming in on a Monday and a Tuesday, like they have, and they've got their trucks out there that night before, I'm gonna tell you straight out, I know these people, they're gonna say, absolutely not, because I'm not sitting there at a city council meeting the next week, like we are today, dealing with this, because now we're talking about ifs and what ifs.

528
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:06,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the problem now.

529
00:46:07,922 --> 00:46:31,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and again, this isn't about you, Tim, you're doing the best job you can, and I appreciate that, but I'd like to make an amendment to this, that we ask the city administration to look into, with the city solicitor, a proper form of funding that with all these projects that are coming in, that we have a clerk of the works that works for the DPW director,

530
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:43,254
[SPEAKER_12]: that answers to the DBW director, not that the DPW director has to ask the engineer who has to ask the Eversource engineer that they paid for it to see what happened or what's going on.

531
00:46:45,016 --> 00:46:55,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked for a resolution was I asked for all the paving projects that was that were put out there for the last two years I got the report back which is great is all of the small

532
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:59,410
[SPEAKER_12]: jobs that were put out there, the Tufts, the C.J.

533
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Daugherty companies, you have the addresses.

534
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:11,059
[SPEAKER_12]: What I really wanted to see is all of the national grids, the Eversources, and what I got back was national grid, no address.

535
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:20,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Because when I drive to an area and a constituent has an issue with, oh, they cut this up, who is they?

536
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:41,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So they give me a time frame, so at least I can refer back as I drive by and say, oh, that looks like a job in front of 17 Butler Street, that that was a gas recut and they had to go back in because now that road is sinking, it's easy to go back and tell National Grid as we move forward, this is the work that you're doing.

537
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:56,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, it's frustrating to the point that we sit up here and people in the city that don't know the process and what happens come up here and the braid us because, and I don't begrudge them for that.

538
00:47:56,899 --> 00:48:03,163
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what we're here for, but they braid us because the streets of this and the streets of that and the sidewalks of this and sidewalks of that.

539
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:09,467
[SPEAKER_12]: And most of the time, there's nothing to do with this body or the city employees.

540
00:48:09,827 --> 00:48:12,229
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to do with the outside agencies that come into the city.

541
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:33,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So I implore that the city administration, there are definitely ways to do this, whether it's working directly with the DOT, Eversource, National Grid, these companies have big bucks, and we have to find a way that we can subsidize

542
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:44,713
[SPEAKER_12]: their funding to make this happen, to bring in a clerk of the works that'll make sure they're doing what's best for the city of Medford, not for what the company that's giving them their paycheck by the end of the day.

543
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:48,136
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, Tim, again, this is no reflection on you.

544
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:53,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this is a difficult position you're in and that's all we keep hearing.

545
00:48:54,101 --> 00:49:01,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody here has been campaigning and all you keep hearing is infrastructure, streets, roads, sidewalks, curbs,

546
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:04,936
[SPEAKER_12]: catch basins, you hear it everywhere.

547
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:12,400
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we don't have the things in place as we move forward, this is only gonna get spiral even more out of control.

548
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:28,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a huge issue, because I think you're right, Council President, we're gonna be sitting here, whether I'm on the other side of the rail, this side of the rail in six years, we're gonna be talking about how deplorable Mystic Ave looks again, and shame on you, because this came in front of this body back then, and we just threw it away.

549
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:30,089
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

550
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:31,418
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best.

551
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:32,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with much of what my colleagues have said.

553
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a couple of questions for you, Tim.

554
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,821
[SPEAKER_01]: The first ones, and these are meant to be, I think, short, reasonable questions.

555
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:50,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you expect that the issues that have been identified will be addressed by November 15th?

556
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:59,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that we will be accepting the project or will it just be a temporary fix and they might have to go back at it next spring?

557
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:12,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, November 15 is fast approaching so if there are first I need to understand what all the issues are, what can be resolved for November 15, if they can be.

558
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:22,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, most likely if there's fixes or repairs that happened before November 15 I'm going to be concerned about them anyway because we have winter coming.

559
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:27,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter will tell you a lot, especially if there's a lot of freeze-thaw cycles.

560
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:34,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Any pavement that didn't adhere to the pavement underneath the milled surface will surely come right up.

561
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in the city for another year.

562
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:45,532
[SPEAKER_00]: We pushed to get Mystic Avenue and South Street done this year, because we knew the conditions of those roads.

563
00:50:46,132 --> 00:50:47,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that answers your question.

564
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:50,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really an I don't know, but it's explained I don't know.

565
00:50:52,202 --> 00:51:05,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds to me like you're gonna try to get as much done as you can before November 15th, but likely that there'll be this project, this section of the project you won't be accepting until next season when you know what the winter has done to it.

566
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:13,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in general, we're not accepting it, we're not going to be accepting things until after the after the winter anyway, and making making that known.

567
00:51:16,428 --> 00:51:20,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, and then second kind of set of questions, hopefully relatively quick.

568
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:23,934
[SPEAKER_01]: This MOU came before you were the city engineer.

569
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you now include regrading in MOUs and will that be included going forward?

570
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:36,204
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been an MOU with a utility company like that.

571
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:40,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this was a sort of a one-time rare thing.

572
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:43,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you put in your project conditions, Tim?

573
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:44,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?

574
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you put it in project conditions.

575
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:59,106
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very project specific console various so like for example, there's a developer who's going to be milling and overlay up on Medford street near the Somerville line.

576
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:02,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an area that we looked at.

577
00:52:03,817 --> 00:52:06,579
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface grade currently is acceptable.

578
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:09,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be no reason for any recreating to happen.

579
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:11,742
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a project.

580
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,944
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would put that into the project conditions.

581
00:52:14,744 --> 00:52:16,805
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a low point, something like that.

582
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:17,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

583
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:22,409
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at projects, so I do all the project reviews for the city as well with the engineering division.

584
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:30,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's elements like that, or issues like that, that are existing within the reasonable limits of the project, then I have them fix it.

585
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:38,335
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also have them, one of the things that I've been trying to do since I started is have all the frontages repaired on any project.

586
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:50,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So sidewalks redone, all the utilities, all the patches redone with a large, you know, homogenous mill and overlay after 90 days.

587
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:57,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things I'm trying to implement in my office to catch up with a lot of the things that have happened over the years.

588
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:03,416
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest ones is that we, and I think lots of people know this because the pavement management report came out.

589
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:10,260
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't spend nearly enough money or resources on our asphalt and sidewalk assets just as a city.

590
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:12,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to think hard about that.

591
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:16,985
[SPEAKER_00]: That pavement management report really lays it out for us.

592
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:22,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to call attention to that as much as I can.

593
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks Tim and I agree with you.

594
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've brought it up a few times and I think it raised alarms across the board, across the city.

595
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:34,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I agree we definitely need more resources.

596
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:42,938
[SPEAKER_01]: On the engagement with these companies, specifically the larger utilities, which we work with regularly.

597
00:53:46,088 --> 00:54:01,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible for us to send a list of preferred contractors that, I mean, I know these companies are the ones doing the projects, I guess, either A, is it possible for us to say, Eversource, we're gonna hire the people, we're gonna manage the people, and we're gonna bill you?

598
00:54:01,478 --> 00:54:02,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that we can do?

599
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:10,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, is it possible for us to come up with a list of vendors that we trust to do quality work and have them choose from those vendors?

600
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:14,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So we typically try to get

601
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:30,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Any private entity that's doing work to do to do their own work, and then review and accept it to try to do other people's work and that one suggestion you had would be too difficult and would just suck away resources we I mean we have capital projects that we're having.

602
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:40,889
[SPEAKER_00]: TAB, Mark McIntyre TV & Recording): trouble working on so to then put I call pbos projects by others for me to assign my staff to pbos all we would be doing would be pbos so.

603
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:50,795
[SPEAKER_00]: TAB, Mark McIntyre TV & Recording): that's very difficult your second suggestion is a good one, we do that with drain layers so anyone who worked as any pipe work in the city man will work pipes anything like that.

604
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:54,256
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be a licensed drain layer, so that it's a review process.

605
00:54:54,596 --> 00:55:06,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as paving and things like that, you know, typically the paving companies are, they're bigger companies like the EJ Pavings, the Riley Brothers is the one doing Eversource's work.

606
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:12,042
[SPEAKER_00]: They're known, they do massed out work, they, you know, they're familiar with the specifications and things like that.

607
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:17,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, could we create a list of paving companies?

608
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:18,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that's on the table for sure.

609
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:22,554
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we haven't done, I don't think, but it could be something.

610
00:55:24,194 --> 00:55:24,694
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks.

611
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:26,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that.

612
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:30,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, they're not doing their job.

613
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:35,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to find ways to hold them accountable to do a good job, I think is important.

614
00:55:35,656 --> 00:55:40,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So any way that we can do that without overburdening our own people, I think is important.

615
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:43,233
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I had, thank you.

616
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:45,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

617
00:55:47,315 --> 00:55:47,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

618
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:49,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

619
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:51,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Meeks.

620
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:53,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick question to Tim.

621
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:05,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, did I understand you correctly when you stated that AI consultants did not bring any concerns regarding deficiencies with the paving on Mystic Ave?

622
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:06,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

623
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:07,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

624
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:08,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

625
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:14,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And considering they are the oversight and the watchdog for the city of Medford.

626
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:23,677
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do find out that there are deficiencies that have not been pointed out by AI, but rather pointed out by the city.

627
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:38,986
[SPEAKER_03]: what are our next steps, because this project is far from over, to ensure that we have the proper oversight, and knowing that that may not be accomplished by this current company, what are the next steps?

628
00:56:41,948 --> 00:56:49,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say probably looking at the qualifications of the individual inspector, so who was on site that day, and whether or not they understand

629
00:56:50,800 --> 00:57:02,166
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that they're dealing with, whether it's city utility standards or mass dot paving standards that we adopted or anything like that, to see if that person is qualified to confirm if they are or not.

630
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:09,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not, then to request from AI that a different inspector be put on the job that has those qualifications.

631
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:10,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that's not the case.

632
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:23,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it's just a total failure of AI, then that would be a breach of contract if they're not qualified to be doing the work or they're not doing the work that we expect, then we shouldn't be paying them.

633
00:57:24,412 --> 00:57:25,472
[SPEAKER_00]: They do contract with us.

634
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:26,773
[SPEAKER_00]: We get reimbursed from Eversource.

635
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:28,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't get paid directly from Eversource.

636
00:57:28,854 --> 00:57:29,494
[SPEAKER_00]: They get paid from us.

637
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:32,615
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be the next steps, Councilor Marks.

638
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:34,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

639
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:36,577
[SPEAKER_03]: In your professional opinion,

640
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:44,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Would an oversight of that nature just say it's regarding not having sufficient coverage?

641
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:47,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So it only has two inches compared to three inches.

642
00:57:48,837 --> 00:57:52,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that sufficient in nature to ask for a termination of contract?

643
00:57:54,499 --> 00:58:05,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how extensive it is and if it was a... So I used to do this work and at the time my client wanted measurements every 100 feet or so for depth and we took

644
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,423
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, measurements every hundred feet.

645
00:58:07,724 --> 00:58:20,398
[SPEAKER_00]: But if in between those measure markers, if there was a dip in the pavement depth or there was an issue with the scupper or something like that, that wouldn't be picked up by the inspector.

646
00:58:24,736 --> 00:58:36,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what they're looking at and what they're measuring and if the contractor is trying to get things by on purpose or if it was, you know, a legitimate mistake with the machinery or something like that.

647
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:39,605
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole host of issues that can go wrong.

648
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:40,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

649
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:50,619
[SPEAKER_00]: from the dump truck and how it opens to how the hopper accepts the pavement, whether or not the hopper is heated correctly, to whether or not it's putting it out in the correct width.

650
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inspector is looking at many, many, many, many different things.

651
00:58:55,603 --> 00:59:01,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a question of judgment, my judgment, if they, you know, hey, how did you guys miss so many things?

652
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:04,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it just one or two things that you missed?

653
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:05,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that appropriate?

654
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, will you just,

655
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,973
[SPEAKER_00]: have your blind, you know, have a blindfold on the whole time or whatever.

656
00:59:11,993 --> 00:59:14,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I'm just, you know, these are hypotheticals.

657
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:21,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what they were looking at until I see their report.

658
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Their reports are good.

659
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:29,005
[SPEAKER_00]: They have pictures and they have a good description of what they looked at and what they observed during the operation.

660
00:59:29,085 --> 00:59:31,206
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you should see that report on Friday.

661
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:32,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

662
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:37,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So there potentially may be some ramifications after we find out what,

663
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: happened on that particular site.

664
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:42,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

665
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:47,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if they had their blindfold on and they were sipping coffee and not paying attention, then you know, obviously, that's, that's a problem.

666
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:49,052
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unacceptable.

667
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:50,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

668
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:51,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

669
00:59:53,055 --> 01:00:00,460
[SPEAKER_10]: So Tim, um, so this company is going to be charged with paving the entire length of Mr Avenue, correct?

670
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:16,650
[SPEAKER_00]: The scope of Eversource's agreement would be the rest of Missick Avenue, so the state controlled portion, which is about where they left off, near Crescent Street, north of Atlas Liquors, to the Somerville line.

671
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:30,001
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on the slate for paving, as well as the area of Main Street in front of the police station, South Street, and Winthrop Street from approximately the garden site all the way up to Winchester.

672
01:00:31,622 --> 01:00:38,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So this company is going to be in charge of paving probably some of the heaviest travel roads in the city of Medford.

673
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:44,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And like Councilor Falco said, we only have one shot to get this done right.

674
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got to get done on someone else's dime.

675
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:54,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I don't think there's a councilor behind this rail on the other side of the rail who doesn't have that on their literature.

676
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,221
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest concern is the conditions of our streets.

677
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:13,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, if they're doing 100 yards of poor construction on a small section of Missing Avenue, how is this gonna be impacted for the rest of Missing Avenue, South Street, and Winter Street?

678
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:16,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, some of the heaviest travel roads in the city of Medford.

679
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:18,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to be put on notice right now?

680
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:21,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not sure if it's the same company.

681
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:23,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So Riley Brothers was this contract.

682
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:26,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultimately, it's either Eversource or McCourt, correct?

683
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:30,294
[SPEAKER_00]: McCourt is not involved in the paving.

684
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:38,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wouldn't, the purpose of charging the paving, I think they should be put on notice now that this is not going to be tolerated going forward.

685
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:39,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

686
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:46,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So we meet with, we meet with Eversource on a weekly basis and we'll certainly be discussing this on our Thursday afternoon meeting for sure.

687
01:01:48,102 --> 01:01:57,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to call that putting on notice, that the commissioner and myself, and we've seen some deficiencies, then yeah, they get put on notice.

688
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:05,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're going to end up going with the same contractor for the rest of the work, but you are correct.

689
01:02:05,947 --> 01:02:11,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Eversource, it is their project, and they are the ultimate responsibility for this work.

690
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

691
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Kearns?

692
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I may add to what Tim is saying.

693
01:02:18,387 --> 01:02:33,818
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, when this project all began in Charlestown, came up, Mr. Gav, as we know it, the original contractor at that time was the Bond Brothers, not McCourt.

694
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the middle of the winter, before they were ready to enter our city, oh, by the way, Commissioner, we have a new contractor, McCourt, all right?

695
01:02:47,327 --> 01:02:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaughn brothers had already leased out a parcel of land to stage his equipment in the city and everything else.

696
01:02:54,352 --> 01:02:55,853
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened, I don't know.

697
01:02:57,174 --> 01:03:06,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But also keep in mind that once everything as we visually see is done, they're not done.

698
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Because afterwards, okay, they're gonna start pulling the cables through everything they're putting in the ground.

699
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:23,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so to realistically think, all right, in my opinion, they're gonna be done this time, oops, this time next year and just leave the city?

700
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:32,238
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because they're gonna start pulling that cable, all right, and that's a very, very technical, slow process.

701
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:34,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they gonna be digging up where they just paved?

702
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:44,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no, they won't be digging it up, okay, they'll be feeding the spools of cable into the pipes that they're currently laying underground.

703
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:50,537
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but okay, you have to pull them very carefully and they have to be taught.

704
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:56,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but not too tight because if you break it, all right, now, okay, where are you?

705
01:03:56,543 --> 01:04:02,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the, what we visually see every day, all right, the job is not finished.

706
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:05,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they got to run the line all the way down.

707
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:14,734
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from probably Charlestown, I don't know exactly where, but at least from Medford all the way right down, okay, and right up Winthrop Street.

708
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:17,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So they still got a ways to go.

709
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, any further discussion?

710
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:28,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Morella, Councilor Kerrio-Viela, seconded by- Amended by, have an amendment?

711
01:04:28,259 --> 01:04:30,079
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Councilor Scott Kelly.

712
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:37,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I also amended it, Mr. President, asking for a report.

713
01:04:38,057 --> 01:04:41,520
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is amended by Councilor Marks.

714
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:43,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

715
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:45,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Bares.

716
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:47,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

717
01:04:55,713 --> 01:04:56,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bares.

718
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:57,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

719
01:04:58,156 --> 01:04:58,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

720
01:04:58,716 --> 01:04:58,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

721
01:04:59,337 --> 01:05:00,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight?

722
01:05:00,037 --> 01:05:00,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

723
01:05:00,918 --> 01:05:01,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

724
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:01,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

725
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:02,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell?

726
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:03,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

727
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

728
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:04,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

729
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:05,481
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caravaglio?

730
01:05:05,561 --> 01:05:06,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

731
01:05:07,062 --> 01:05:08,103
[SPEAKER_10]: None in that motion passes.

732
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:10,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Steve, for coming up.

733
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:12,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

734
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:15,368
[SPEAKER_10]: 21602, offered by Councilor Falco.

735
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

736
01:05:18,371 --> 01:05:22,073
[SPEAKER_10]: 21600, offered by Councilor Morrell.

737
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:25,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And 21601, offered by Councilor Falco.

738
01:05:25,396 --> 01:05:26,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Being so resolved at City Council,

739
01:05:27,865 --> 01:05:39,891
[SPEAKER_10]: receive an update on the continued blasting at 541 to 551 with the street project be a result of the administration update city council regarding the blasting that is occurring with the street.

740
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:48,016
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is it, what is it is doing to protect the residents of the neighborhood and the students and staff at the school from the effects of this work.

741
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:48,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

742
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:53,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

743
01:05:54,952 --> 01:06:11,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course, let Councilor Falco speak I'm sure he has to want to extrapolate this on this more but I mean this is something I understand that the blasting company received a permit for two months worth of blasting, and I believe it began on August 31, so we are pretty much at that two month point.

744
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:17,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like an update on how much longer they're going to be blasting, how the weather impacts this.

745
01:06:17,953 --> 01:06:19,934
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about the end of construction season.

746
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the end of blasting season?

747
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:23,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this something that's going to pick up again in the spring?

748
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:30,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I think residents are feeling this and hearing this much farther than they anticipated.

749
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:39,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I think partly because, and I live right over here, the neighborhoods are on a lot of ledge and they're essentially on the same ledge that's being blasted

750
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:41,043
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a quarter of a mile away.

751
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:44,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this, you know, conduction that's getting to people's houses.

752
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:51,346
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think some people are starting to see issues that may not have done the insurance assessment because they thought they were far enough out.

753
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:56,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So in addition to getting an update on, you know, how long is this blasting going to continue?

754
01:06:57,067 --> 01:07:06,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to know what avenues residents have who are being impacted by this, who did not expect to be impacted by it, and what it's doing to their homes.

755
01:07:06,952 --> 01:07:20,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, I just, it's an unnerving situation, I think, for a lot of people in the area, because some days there's no blasting, some days there's one blast, some days there's two blasts, and it impacts people in different living situations in different ways.

756
01:07:20,718 --> 01:07:22,019
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd really like to get an update

757
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:26,021
[SPEAKER_08]: and have, you know, have this information be open to the public.

758
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:36,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the fact that residents have to chase down this information when they're, you know, yards feet away from this massive blasting project, it's not right.

759
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:42,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that they have to chase us down and then we chase people down to try to get these answers is kind of ridiculous.

760
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:44,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd really like to see an update on that.

761
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:48,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And I pass on to Councilor Falco if you'd like to add.

762
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:49,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

763
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:51,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

764
01:07:51,076 --> 01:07:52,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

765
01:07:53,278 --> 01:08:04,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I have received many calls as well from residents in that neighborhood, because as Councilor Morrell said, there are many residents that are impacted on Winthrop Street with regard to this project.

766
01:08:05,365 --> 01:08:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are students impacted as well.

767
01:08:07,006 --> 01:08:09,368
[SPEAKER_07]: There's many students walking to and from school.

768
01:08:10,168 --> 01:08:11,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a blasting area.

769
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:12,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dangerous.

770
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right, as far as getting information, you know everybody's trying to get information and it seems like sometimes it's absolutely impossible to get.

771
01:08:19,817 --> 01:08:27,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I would, I would ask you, Mr. President, if you schedule committee the whole week and talk specifically about this development.

772
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,374
[SPEAKER_07]: with regard to the blasting in all, there's many other areas that this impacts.

773
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:36,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, specifically there's some questions that I like answered.

774
01:08:36,577 --> 01:08:45,766
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could read them off now, and Mr. Clark, if you wouldn't mind recording these, but first and foremost, you know, the pre-blast survey, what homes were included?

775
01:08:45,947 --> 01:08:48,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know exactly what homes are included in this neighborhood.

776
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:53,554
[SPEAKER_07]: There's really, there are many, many residents that are being impacted and this needs to be addressed.

777
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,156
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Medford High School is next door.

778
01:08:56,736 --> 01:08:59,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, when are the blasts actually occurring?

779
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:00,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they on schedule?

780
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it, you know, X amount per day?

781
01:09:03,341 --> 01:09:06,904
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems to be all over the place from people that I've talked to in the neighborhood.

782
01:09:07,365 --> 01:09:12,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be great to get a clear, concise answer as to when these blasts are occurring.

783
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:14,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it limited to so many per day?

784
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:18,133
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the protocols for, you know, before they blast?

785
01:09:18,193 --> 01:09:23,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know, I believe you can get text messages, but if we can get clarification on that,

786
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:24,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I greatly appreciate it.

787
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:30,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there any impact on the school, Medford High School?

788
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:39,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd appreciate if we can get an answer maybe from the high school administration to see if there's any impact with regard to the students.

789
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:41,528
[SPEAKER_07]: traveling to and from school.

790
01:09:42,549 --> 01:09:46,312
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a sidewalk that's on the same side as a school.

791
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:49,334
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure our students are safe traveling in that area.

792
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:59,262
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to the residents that actually live in that area, we need to make sure everyone's safe, but the students are traversing back and forth to and from school on the sidewalks.

793
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:00,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that that's addressed as well.

794
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:09,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as the vibration, vibration can have an effect, I think, as we all know, with regard to rodents in the rodent population.

795
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:15,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've received calls, I think all of us, with regard to rodents throughout our city.

796
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:25,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to know from the Board of Health, is there an increase of calls with regard to rodents in this neighborhood with blasting, the grounds moving on a regular basis up there?

797
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:32,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know, there are increased calls to the Board of Health Department with regard to road, so if you can get an answer on that.

798
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, the Water Department.

799
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:39,182
[SPEAKER_07]: When there's blasting, there's pipes underground.

800
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:44,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to know if there are any reports of pipes that have been broken.

801
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:59,767
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath the ground, city pipes, you know, blasts, we have blasting repeatedly like that, it has a toll on the infrastructure, and we need to make sure that infrastructure is safe, and that if there are any issues, we should know about that.

802
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:02,891
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think counselor morale for bringing this forward.

803
01:11:03,812 --> 01:11:06,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she's probably received some calls that I'm getting.

804
01:11:07,035 --> 01:11:19,269
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you know, to live in that situation like that we're, you know, the company is coming in and they're blasting day after day after day for, you know, months on end, it's, it's, it hasn't.

805
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:22,088
[SPEAKER_07]: a horrible impact on your quality of life.

806
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:24,089
[SPEAKER_07]: These issues need to be addressed.

807
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:29,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to know, and the residents need to know, what is the plan moving forward?

808
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,594
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is this project going to take?

809
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the end point?

810
01:11:34,016 --> 01:11:36,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Should they see an end to blasting soon?

811
01:11:36,478 --> 01:11:38,299
[SPEAKER_07]: These questions all need to be answered.

812
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you could schedule a committee, the whole TANF, all these questions, and I'm sure my colleagues probably have more, I'd greatly appreciate it.

813
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Residents need to have answers to these questions and we should have these answers as well.

814
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:50,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

815
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:51,765
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best?

816
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

817
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:55,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and my colleagues for putting this on the agenda.

818
01:11:55,266 --> 01:11:57,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely been something I've heard a lot about.

819
01:11:59,547 --> 01:12:08,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I did connect the residents with Mr. McGibbon and Director Hunt and the building commissioner and representatives of the fire department.

820
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in terms of an update that I did get from them,

821
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:16,298
[SPEAKER_01]: The project, well, this is quoting Director Hunt's email.

822
01:12:16,518 --> 01:12:22,803
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke with the project manager today, this was yesterday, and he let us know that they are halfway through blasting.

823
01:12:22,823 --> 01:12:25,524
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done 22 days of blasting, and they're expecting 20 more.

824
01:12:25,665 --> 01:12:28,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's not happy or welcome news, but I wanna be honest about the project.

825
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:35,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone involved has said that the property owners do have a right to do this.

826
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:41,556
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it is being controlled and monitored, it is, at the end of the day, allowed under

827
01:12:42,515 --> 01:12:43,677
[SPEAKER_01]: under what we allow here at Metro.

828
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Scapelli.

829
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:47,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

830
01:12:47,203 --> 01:12:50,248
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate Councilors bringing this forward.

831
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:52,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that we have many phone calls myself.

832
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:59,285
[SPEAKER_12]: when you're not getting the information that's needed, because I think that's the biggest frustrating point now.

833
01:12:59,785 --> 01:13:01,006
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the cat's out of the bag.

834
01:13:01,046 --> 01:13:04,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everybody knows that they have the right and it's going to happen.

835
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:13,472
[SPEAKER_12]: But what the problem right now is not understanding when, how the quality of life is being uprooted and the damages that's going to happen.

836
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,173
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I'm going to request

837
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:24,922
[SPEAKER_12]: that we call for all of the people involved, a representative from that team and the city administration again.

838
01:13:26,062 --> 01:13:39,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And we go to that site because if we're not getting the answers, if the constituents aren't getting the answers they need when they're contacting different departments or asking for help, we have to take it to the street.

839
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:44,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate, again, we've done it before, it worked out well, I think that

840
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:53,611
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, people weren't happy at times, but at least they got the answers questioned and they asked the question to the right people.

841
01:13:53,711 --> 01:14:01,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Because again, we're getting, I'm sure all of you are getting the same email from the same people who aren't getting the answers that they need.

842
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:12,878
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, so I'd like to amend this if we can, to call for a meeting as soon as possible, because we're talking about 20 more days of blasting, that we bring all the parties involved,

843
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:18,766
[SPEAKER_12]: to the neighborhood, you know, and we have a community meeting at the site.

844
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:19,767
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

845
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

846
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

847
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,151
[SPEAKER_11]: If they've done 22 days of blasting,

848
01:14:29,182 --> 01:14:35,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like that breaks down to about five blasts a year, because this project has been going on for as long as I can remember.

849
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:41,976
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I mean, four years that we've seen this rock wall with a fence around it over there on winter street with no progress.

850
01:14:42,997 --> 01:14:47,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that the frustration is the fact that we've gone such an inordinate time.

851
01:14:47,762 --> 01:14:52,646
[SPEAKER_11]: with this parcel looking awful, they clear-cut all the trees, they started blasting, and then they just stopped.

852
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: They stopped everything, Mr. President.

853
01:14:55,068 --> 01:14:58,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And now all of a sudden, they start back up, but nobody knows what's going on.

854
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:03,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows why the project stopped and what brought us back to blasting today.

855
01:15:04,056 --> 01:15:05,878
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that's really what the frustration is.

856
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:07,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I live in the neighborhood.

857
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:07,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I live across the street.

858
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:13,844
[SPEAKER_11]: The blasting doesn't particularly bother me, Mr. President, not as much as the unsightly

859
01:15:15,122 --> 01:15:19,964
[SPEAKER_11]: awful looking curb appeal that that parcel brings to the community after what it was previously.

860
01:15:20,704 --> 01:15:23,125
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a beautiful lot that had hundreds of trees on it.

861
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Those trees were all ripped down, taken down.

862
01:15:26,507 --> 01:15:29,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have a rock wall and we've had a rock wall for four years.

863
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:39,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is a perfect example of some of the reasoning why we need to streamline our permitting processes, Mr. President.

864
01:15:40,907 --> 01:15:43,850
[SPEAKER_11]: and some of the reasons why we need to have better communication.

865
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:53,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I've said in the past, abutters advisory committees that can bring up the issues that affect the abutters in the neighborhood, the projects and where the projects exist.

866
01:15:55,002 --> 01:15:57,966
[SPEAKER_11]: An abutters advisory committee in an instance like this would be perfect.

867
01:15:59,085 --> 01:16:00,346
[SPEAKER_11]: would be perfect, Mr. President.

868
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:05,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I would re-introduce my call for about his advisory committees from the administration.

869
01:16:05,668 --> 01:16:08,549
[SPEAKER_11]: However, that would be out of order because I had offered- I mean, in that form of amendments?

870
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:11,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had offered it previously, it would be out of order, Mr. President.

871
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:12,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I rest my case.

872
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:19,795
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I do think that there's a great deal of frustration based upon the inordinate amount of time that it's taken to get this project to be done.

873
01:16:20,635 --> 01:16:27,038
[SPEAKER_11]: The condition of the site prior to the clear cutting of the trees versus the condition of it now, and the need for us to move forward

874
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:31,808
[SPEAKER_11]: redevelop the parcel at this point, because what we have there right now is unacceptable.

875
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:34,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President.

876
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:36,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you have to understand the frustration of these people.

877
01:16:36,849 --> 01:16:43,111
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been four years of between the blasting and drilling, stopping and starting the Eversource project.

878
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:46,732
[SPEAKER_10]: These people that live in that section of Winthrop Street, they haven't gotten a break.

879
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:50,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Up all night, between banging and construction.

880
01:16:52,094 --> 01:16:52,674
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair.

881
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:55,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, these are projects that are never ending.

882
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:59,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Cousin Roe.

883
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:00,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

884
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:05,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And you bring up an excellent point of just trying to navigate that area, particularly when people are trying to get to high school.

885
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:07,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely crazy.

886
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:09,938
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to get through three work crews.

887
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:16,983
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times in the morning, the work crew that does the blasting lines up on Winthrop Street near the cemetery, completely blocking viewpoints.

888
01:17:17,704 --> 01:17:19,185
[SPEAKER_08]: It's absolute chaos in the morning.

889
01:17:19,605 --> 01:17:26,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think to Vice President Knight's point, this has been going on for so long, and neighbors were pushing back against it for so long, and then it kind of went quiet.

890
01:17:27,451 --> 01:17:30,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden we get an email that blasting starts next week.

891
01:17:30,494 --> 01:17:39,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's why a lot of neighbors were caught off guard and maybe did not have the insurance assessment or have done what they needed to get done beforehand to protect them in this situation.

892
01:17:39,963 --> 01:17:50,112
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I really want answers on is what kind of recourse do residents have that are being impacted by this, that thought that they were far enough away that they wouldn't be impacted by this.

893
01:17:50,912 --> 01:17:51,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

894
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:51,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

895
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:54,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

896
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:56,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:17:56,373 --> 01:17:58,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

898
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Council Vice President Knight hit the nail on the head.

899
01:18:02,143 --> 01:18:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, typically a project comes and goes.

900
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the gift that keeps on giving.

901
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it never ends.

902
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:14,753
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been blasting, as they said, for I think three or four years now.

903
01:18:15,573 --> 01:18:27,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a law for a period of time, and I guess there was some confusion whether the developer could build certain amount of parcels and so forth, and whether you could expand or not, and whether they had an access road.

904
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of different questions, Mr. President.

905
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:32,183
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one thing surprises me,

906
01:18:32,904 --> 01:18:43,573
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've been to a number of community development board meetings, board of appeals meetings, and I've seen them reject projects in this city, Mr. President, for not having enough frontage.

907
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:47,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're two feet short frontage, the project goes nowhere.

908
01:18:47,996 --> 01:18:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you don't have, you're missing three parking spots, the project goes nowhere.

909
01:18:52,960 --> 01:19:00,887
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Mr. President, you have a project that's taken four years of blasting in a neighborhood, and it goes through with flying colors.

910
01:19:02,632 --> 01:19:06,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about the biggest impact that you can have on a residential area.

911
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not missing a parking spot.

912
01:19:09,263 --> 01:19:15,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a foot of frontage that may be missing, but blasting, as Councilor Morrell mentioned.

913
01:19:16,712 --> 01:19:39,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We advised all the residents in the area at the time to make sure if they don't do it, to have someone videotape the interior of their property, walls, ceilings, so they could have at least some proof, ultimately, if something does happen and foundations are shook or altered, Mr. President, that they'd have some proof.

914
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope that many residents took that advice.

915
01:19:44,003 --> 01:19:48,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But the recourse is probably not going to be much, unfortunately.

916
01:19:51,067 --> 01:19:53,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think this has gone on far too long.

917
01:19:53,909 --> 01:20:01,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to say, Mr. President, when it originally started the blasting, that they weren't even cordoning off the sidewalks appropriately.

918
01:20:01,474 --> 01:20:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was flying debris

919
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:22,471
[SPEAKER_03]: They put tops down and heavy, heavy tops down to stop some of the debris, but there were rocks I had residents that live across the street, send me some of the rocks and other debris that filter down onto Winthrop and across with them street, very dangerous situation that I have to say has alleviated itself.

920
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:26,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the developers doing a much better job.

921
01:20:26,814 --> 01:20:29,695
[SPEAKER_03]: and securing the area, in my opinion, from what I'm hearing.

922
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: But originally, that wasn't the case, Mr. President.

923
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:38,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that, you know, to me, the blasting should have been done over a set period of time.

924
01:20:38,437 --> 01:20:41,257
[SPEAKER_03]: The city should have said, okay, this is what we're going to approve.

925
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:42,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing outside of that.

926
01:20:43,158 --> 01:20:50,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We're giving you a two-week, three-week, whatever it is, time frame, and nothing outside, because this developer cannot blast without the city's approval.

927
01:20:51,299 --> 01:20:53,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, to leave it car blanche and open-ended,

928
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:57,357
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, creates this angst in the neighborhood.

929
01:20:57,397 --> 01:20:59,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're seeing now, Mr. President.

930
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

931
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:02,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

932
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:02,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Council President.

933
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I agree with my colleagues entirely.

934
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:17,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, number one, and I don't know what they're doing now at this point, but if it's a Monday morning, put a sign out in front of the project, we're going to be blasting Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

935
01:21:17,268 --> 01:21:21,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not that complicated, and that's a low-tech solution these days.

936
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:32,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people drive by a lot of people walk by and if they're new every week to look at the schedule, or if the schedule is being emailed out through in a butters committee or whatever other element I think that would be really helpful.

937
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:49,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The second piece of this, just because residents did bring this up as part of the questioning around this, and I did hear from the city engineer that they are going to have the design done and, you know, redoing the sidewalks and adding the sidewalk along the section of Winthrop Street that currently does not have sidewalk and that should be done next spring.

938
01:21:49,862 --> 01:22:00,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it's a little bit off the topic of blasting, but as it relates to this project and the Eversource project, there should be some pretty significant improvements coming up on Winthrop Street within the next year.

939
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:08,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, if I may console appears to you, you mentioned the sidewalk, you talking about the sidewalk from Lorraine to place that?

940
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the yeah.

941
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:18,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city engineer, I think you're talking on the other side, you're talking with the Boston school, right?

942
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:20,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about both both sides of the street.

943
01:22:20,985 --> 01:22:26,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told that there would be I'll go back and read the email because it because city engineer given was it was a

944
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:34,442
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he was working on it, which this sounds like he doesn't even know about it, which concerns me a bit.

945
01:22:34,642 --> 01:22:39,905
[SPEAKER_01]: We said regarding curbstone from Wildwood to Playstead, we are pursuing options to expand the current scope of planned sidewalk improvements.

946
01:22:40,366 --> 01:22:41,666
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a definitive project.

947
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:45,589
[SPEAKER_01]: The improvements will be taking on the sidewalk gap from the gas station to Smith Lane.

948
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:49,251
[SPEAKER_01]: The improvements will be taking place in the spring before restoration activities begin.

949
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are planning on lining this up before that happens.

950
01:22:51,612 --> 01:22:53,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping not too much design is needed.

951
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:53,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's that from?

952
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:54,594
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Tim.

953
01:22:57,743 --> 01:23:02,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not confirmed, which I think is something residents continue to look for, understandably so.

954
01:23:02,426 --> 01:23:10,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And they, you know, email after email kind of get this understandably, you know, mixed messaging about what's actually going to happen.

955
01:23:11,013 --> 01:23:16,237
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, and that's, I think the reason why we need that community, the whole meeting, so everybody can get on the same page.

956
01:23:16,377 --> 01:23:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like everyone, especially the residents, you know, they need to,

957
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,917
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that the residents know what's happening on a daily basis.

958
01:23:24,957 --> 01:23:29,239
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got the blasting traffic, you know, the police details that are gonna be there or not.

959
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,301
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's some really serious safety concerns that need to be addressed.

960
01:23:33,782 --> 01:23:35,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have a meeting on that.

961
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may, Mr. Clerk, on my first amendment I made with regard to the pre-blast survey, can you just add in there what addresses were included?

962
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:49,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I said what homes were included, but I can say what addresses.

963
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:50,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect, thank you.

964
01:23:51,740 --> 01:24:00,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, just one last point is I do sincerely hope it would be great to have the company there to confirm that it's, you know, only 20 more blasts because you drive by that project.

965
01:24:01,429 --> 01:24:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to believe it's only 20 more blasts for them to put 10 houses in there.

966
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:07,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and to counselor bears point.

967
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:11,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now you get a text message a couple hours before a blast.

968
01:24:11,177 --> 01:24:14,700
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know if it's a two blast day, a no blast day, a one blast day.

969
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:17,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, that's really unnerving for a lot of people.

970
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love to see a schedule, but right now, you know, it's a couple hours notification and that's, you know, it doesn't work for a lot of people.

971
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:26,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

972
01:24:26,468 --> 01:24:31,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, Mr. Clark, if you could reflect my request, they put up a sign with a weekly schedule as an amendment.

973
01:24:31,932 --> 01:24:32,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

974
01:24:32,492 --> 01:24:32,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So

975
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:40,313
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councillor Morrell, Councillor Fletcher, seconded by Vice President Knight.

976
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:40,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

977
01:24:41,113 --> 01:24:41,713
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended.

978
01:24:42,733 --> 01:24:57,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, while we're on that subject, I just want to thank resident Chris Donovan, who lives across the street, took it upon himself, Mr. President, to go and speak with the developer of that particular lot, and he was able to sit down

979
01:24:58,357 --> 01:25:04,060
[SPEAKER_03]: with the developer and get some improvements in front of the high school and along that stretch of the road.

980
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was just a resident on his own that reached out and said, how come you're not giving anything back to the community?

981
01:25:10,184 --> 01:25:11,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You're causing all this disruption.

982
01:25:12,225 --> 01:25:13,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was able to set up a meeting.

983
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he includes the city administration, but it was thanks to Chris Donovan for setting that up, Mr. President.

984
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank him personally.

985
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:27,461
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Falco, seconded by I think Councilor Baez?

986
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:40,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Baez, as amended by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Scapelli, as amended by Councilor Knight, and amended by Councilor Baez, and a request for an immediate committee of the whole meeting.

987
01:25:40,831 --> 01:25:43,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight withdrew his.

988
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:44,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

989
01:25:46,115 --> 01:25:50,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion, all those in favor?

[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1036

[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1.

1037
01:27:53,816 --> 01:28:01,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I would appeal that we were missed not to congratulate our new position.

1038
01:28:05,846 --> 01:28:08,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

1039
01:28:08,928 --> 01:28:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1040
01:28:09,829 --> 01:28:14,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very much.

1041
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:17,615
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to do an excellent job in that role.

1042
01:28:17,995 --> 01:28:18,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1043
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:44,728
[SPEAKER_10]: 21602, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration report back to the City Council on the plans of the DPW to address the condition of our streets and sidewalks and how many claims have been made for personal injury and property damage, as well as potholes and street defects across our city in the last year.

1044
01:28:45,508 --> 01:28:46,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1045
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:47,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1046
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,092
[SPEAKER_07]: As we all know, as we traverse the city,

1047
01:28:51,604 --> 01:29:01,853
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what neighborhood you go into, there are major issues with regards to infrastructure, potholes, sidewalks, streets in disrepair, and this has gone on for some time.

1048
01:29:01,873 --> 01:29:08,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, it has an impact on everyone throughout our community, a real negative impact.

1049
01:29:09,759 --> 01:29:10,679
[SPEAKER_07]: a quality of life.

1050
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:12,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And this needs to be addressed.

1051
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:17,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, no matter what neighborhood you go into, it's a major concern.

1052
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:24,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just basically asking for a report back from the DPW as to how the

1053
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:42,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm basically requesting a report back from the city administration as to how the DPW is going about filling potholes throughout the city.

1054
01:29:43,413 --> 01:29:49,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, no matter what neighborhood you go into, it's a concern, it needs to be addressed, and they are all over the place.

1055
01:29:49,896 --> 01:29:56,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the plan that the DPW and the administration is coming up with to

1056
01:29:57,388 --> 01:30:00,490
[SPEAKER_07]: to fill these potholes and make sure that these issues are addressed.

1057
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:12,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And in addition, I wanted to add the following question answered by our city solicitor, Mr. Clerk, and that's basically how many claims in the past year have there been for street defects in potholes?

1058
01:30:13,839 --> 01:30:14,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Got that?

1059
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1060
01:30:18,922 --> 01:30:20,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight.

1061
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:30,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank Councilor Falco for putting this agenda item on this evening, Mr. President, I think it's very important for us to really take a look at the financial impact

1062
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:44,228
[SPEAKER_11]: relative to personal injury and property damage that surrounds our lack of investment in infrastructure, and our inability to provide reliable consistent delivery of basic city services like the maintenance of Iraq keeps roads and parks.

1063
01:30:44,568 --> 01:30:50,675
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think consulate faculty put in this agenda item on the, the agenda this evening Mr President, I'm looking forward to seeing those figures.

1064
01:30:53,202 --> 01:31:07,420
[SPEAKER_11]: being an individual who spoke a little bit about his property damage claim a couple of weeks ago driving down Mystic Avenue, that there have been close to 70, maybe 80 claims for tires alone relative to portals on Mystic Avenue.

1065
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,263
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would be an interesting figure to take a look at, Mr. President.

1066
01:31:10,343 --> 01:31:11,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank the council for putting it forward.

1067
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1068
01:31:16,256 --> 01:31:16,956
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1069
01:31:17,276 --> 01:31:17,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1070
01:31:17,696 --> 01:31:18,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1071
01:31:18,617 --> 01:31:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: The ayes have it.

1072
01:31:19,777 --> 01:31:20,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is adopted.

1073
01:31:20,777 --> 01:31:23,458
[SPEAKER_03]: 21-603 offered by Councilor Falco.

1074
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:27,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Be resolved that Encore Casino agreement be discussed.

1075
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:28,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1076
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1077
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going through some documents with regard to the Encore agreement.

1078
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:39,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have the surrounding community agreement with Encore.

1079
01:31:39,902 --> 01:31:41,843
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been in place for many years now.

1080
01:31:42,543 --> 01:31:48,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And back in 2019 at the Mayor Burke, there was a committee that was set up.

1081
01:31:48,205 --> 01:31:54,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And the committee was basically the Metric Community Fund.

1082
01:31:54,486 --> 01:31:57,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it did is the casino gives $125,000 a year as part of the agreement.

1083
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:03,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's in section five, the Medford Community Fund.

1084
01:32:03,613 --> 01:32:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: The parties recognize the importance of supporting the Medford community and share a mutual desire to utilize this agreement to provide ongoing support to the many important nonprofit organizations throughout the city of Medford.

1085
01:32:16,136 --> 01:32:20,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes on to in section 5.2a, an annual payment of $125,000 is made from Encore each year to the city of Medford.

1086
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:39,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in 2019, Mayor Berk had set up a committee that put it, and that committee put a process in place where they were called AIM grants, A-I-M, AIM grants.

1087
01:32:40,043 --> 01:32:42,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was All In for Medford, All In Medford.

1088
01:32:43,366 --> 01:32:50,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And those two nonprofits could apply for those grants, the grants were given out, and we would give out the whole $125,000.

1089
01:32:52,918 --> 01:32:56,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was some really, some great nonprofits that received money.

1090
01:32:56,801 --> 01:33:18,620
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a list of them, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Community Cupboard Food Pantries, Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Friends of Meffitt Rowing, Veterans Preservation Project, Meffitt Education Foundation, Mystic River Watershed, Cache, Trees Meffitt, West Meffitt Open Studios, Friends of the Meffitt Family Network, Meffitt Farmers Market, and the list goes on.

1091
01:33:19,801 --> 01:33:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: My point is this.

1092
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:28,839
[SPEAKER_07]: That committee has not met in two years and the city has received $125,000 each year.

1093
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:43,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that there's $250,000 that has come in and no process has been, as far as I know, that committee has not met to disperse those funds or to even get that process going where nonprofits can apply for funds.

1094
01:33:45,585 --> 01:33:48,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question to the administration is what is the plan?

1095
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:51,467
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the plan for this committee to meet

1096
01:33:52,980 --> 01:34:00,367
[SPEAKER_07]: and get the ball rolling with regard to giving out this $250,000 that has come in from Encore Casino within the past two years.

1097
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plenty of nonprofits throughout our community that could use this money.

1098
01:34:08,274 --> 01:34:10,916
[SPEAKER_07]: $250,000 can go a long way in the nonprofit community.

1099
01:34:11,397 --> 01:34:13,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are plenty of nonprofits throughout our city.

1100
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,660
[SPEAKER_07]: This needs to be addressed.

1101
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I can tell this, I mean, they haven't met in two years.

1102
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:21,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the plan to me?

1103
01:34:22,302 --> 01:34:26,584
[SPEAKER_07]: This money needs to be, like I said, plenty of nonprofits can use this money.

1104
01:34:27,124 --> 01:34:30,186
[SPEAKER_07]: There's $250,000 that could go out.

1105
01:34:30,366 --> 01:34:32,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's here, it's with the city of Medford.

1106
01:34:32,487 --> 01:34:34,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of the Encore Casino Agreement.

1107
01:34:35,308 --> 01:34:37,949
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is to the administration, what is the plan?

1108
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:39,430
[SPEAKER_07]: When is this going to begin?

1109
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:42,551
[SPEAKER_07]: This committee met last under Mayor Burke.

1110
01:34:42,771 --> 01:34:45,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it has met once under this administration.

1111
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question is, what is it going to be?

1112
01:34:49,521 --> 01:34:53,525
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the process where nonprofits can apply and receive some of this funding?

1113
01:34:54,326 --> 01:34:55,066
[SPEAKER_07]: This is valuable.

1114
01:34:55,126 --> 01:35:01,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is a valuable source of funds that many nonprofits in our community can use, especially now more than ever.

1115
01:35:04,815 --> 01:35:06,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1116
01:35:06,136 --> 01:35:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1117
01:35:07,437 --> 01:35:12,201
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of seconded by councilor Scott Perry, Mr. President.

1118
01:35:13,361 --> 01:35:16,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Richard Caraviello, 74 Prescott Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1119
01:35:17,642 --> 01:35:25,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I am also the chair of the Mitigation Committee for Zone A and also represent Medford.

1120
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:39,829
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have several grants applications pending with the Mitigation Committee for the city on top of the monies that Councilor Falco has also

1121
01:35:41,678 --> 01:35:43,280
[SPEAKER_10]: recommend, you know, has brought up.

1122
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:50,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want people to know that there are, you know, there are, hopefully there will be other funds coming forward through the mitigation committee, which I chair.

1123
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:52,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1124
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:54,409
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just to set the record straight.

1125
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:55,350
[SPEAKER_07]: This is separate.

1126
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,331
[SPEAKER_07]: This is part of the agreement.

1127
01:35:56,351 --> 01:35:57,332
[SPEAKER_07]: This $125,000 comes in automatic every year.

1128
01:36:02,613 --> 01:36:04,234
[SPEAKER_07]: and none of it has been dispersed.

1129
01:36:04,254 --> 01:36:07,676
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $250,000 that has not been dispersed to the community.

1130
01:36:08,237 --> 01:36:08,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1131
01:36:08,997 --> 01:36:09,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1132
01:36:09,938 --> 01:36:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1133
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,181
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1134
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:14,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1135
01:36:14,761 --> 01:36:15,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1136
01:36:15,702 --> 01:36:16,282
[SPEAKER_03]: The ayes have it.

1137
01:36:16,302 --> 01:36:17,303
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is adopted.

1138
01:36:18,163 --> 01:36:20,724
[SPEAKER_03]: 21-604 offered by Councilor Felco.

1139
01:36:21,425 --> 01:36:36,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration report back to the City Council on its plan to transition into parking program, including how it intends to gather the input of residents and businesses community during this transition.

1140
01:36:36,532 --> 01:36:37,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Felco.

1141
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:38,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1142
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: We recently received word that the administration has hired someone to run the parking program, which is great news, but I would like to know, we should, I'd like to receive an update from the administration as to what is the timing of the transition process?

1143
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:57,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it moving on time?

1144
01:36:58,607 --> 01:37:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, is it, when you think about it, there's only, I think about maybe 72 days or around that period of time before the end of the year.

1145
01:37:08,136 --> 01:37:09,237
[SPEAKER_07]: This needs to be addressed.

1146
01:37:11,438 --> 01:37:17,020
[SPEAKER_07]: When I talked to someone at the parking company, I believe they said it was going to be, it takes a while to transition this process.

1147
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an easy process.

1148
01:37:18,581 --> 01:37:22,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you flip a switch and all of a sudden everything transitions over to the city of Medford.

1149
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:30,424
[SPEAKER_07]: The administration just hired someone, which is definitely good news, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done.

1150
01:37:30,944 --> 01:37:38,972
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to receive an update from the administration as to whether or not this is going to be completed on time.

1151
01:37:39,012 --> 01:37:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: At 1231, is this city going to be ready to take on a parking program?

1152
01:37:42,615 --> 01:37:44,536
[SPEAKER_07]: The city's never run a parking program before.

1153
01:37:45,237 --> 01:37:46,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have concerns there.

1154
01:37:46,259 --> 01:37:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that those concerns are addressed.

1155
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:51,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure my colleagues have concerns as well.

1156
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:54,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd also like to specifically know if the

1157
01:37:56,621 --> 01:38:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Administration has reached out to Republic Parking for an extension.

1158
01:38:01,704 --> 01:38:04,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone had told me that the other day, that that's what they had heard.

1159
01:38:04,365 --> 01:38:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if that's true, but they had heard that from someone within the Park Method office.

1160
01:38:10,749 --> 01:38:12,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want clarification on that as well.

1161
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:18,713
[SPEAKER_07]: The administration said they were taking it in-house, but it sounds like maybe they're not taking it in right away.

1162
01:38:18,753 --> 01:38:21,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can get an answer to that question, I greatly appreciate it.

1163
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:22,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1164
01:38:23,776 --> 01:38:24,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Member Kilbike and Minda.

1165
01:38:25,873 --> 01:38:35,819
[SPEAKER_10]: to ask what's gonna happen with the $5 million in uncollected fines that is due?

1166
01:38:36,059 --> 01:38:41,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that go to Park Medford, Republic Parking, or do we get that back?

1167
01:38:43,263 --> 01:38:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine with me.

1168
01:38:45,224 --> 01:38:46,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may amend further,

1169
01:38:49,453 --> 01:38:49,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.

1170
01:38:49,973 --> 01:38:50,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1171
01:38:50,334 --> 01:39:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: If I meant further, you know, is a plan unfolds, you know, how does the mayor plan to get input from residents, business owners and chamber in the chamber of commerce with regard to the new parking program?

1172
01:39:03,842 --> 01:39:07,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That's key, you know, the involvement of the community.

1173
01:39:07,124 --> 01:39:10,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can get that question answered, I greatly appreciate it.

1174
01:39:10,266 --> 01:39:10,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1175
01:39:11,747 --> 01:39:11,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1176
01:39:14,216 --> 01:39:14,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr President.

1177
01:39:14,977 --> 01:39:18,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this issue up.

1178
01:39:19,323 --> 01:39:22,428
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an issue I raised in June, Mr President.

1179
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,421
[SPEAKER_03]: when we were going through the fiscal budget.

1180
01:39:26,201 --> 01:39:35,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed that the mayor was taking this in-house and the parking budget, I think consisted of 300 and I wanna say $65,000.

1181
01:39:36,266 --> 01:39:46,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time I raised the question to the chief of staff stating that how can he run a full fledged parking program for that amount of money?

1182
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:51,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And he more or less said that was a startup or, you know,

1183
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:55,738
[SPEAKER_03]: a place card within the budget to get the program off the ground.

1184
01:39:56,539 --> 01:40:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I'm seeing right now Mr President is, I'm not hearing about any public meetings.

1185
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:09,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hearing as Councilor Falco mentioned about any stakeholder meetings with the business community, the Chamber of Commerce,

1186
01:40:09,723 --> 01:40:13,506
[SPEAKER_03]: with area residents, with area businesses, Mr. President.

1187
01:40:14,106 --> 01:40:22,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can recall the days I sat on the original parking enforcement committee, that it was open and notorious.

1188
01:40:23,133 --> 01:40:25,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were ample meetings for everyone to give input.

1189
01:40:26,996 --> 01:40:31,500
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern, Mr. President, is that when you take a program of this nature in-house,

1190
01:40:32,605 --> 01:40:34,386
[SPEAKER_03]: and take over citywide.

1191
01:40:34,927 --> 01:40:38,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the ultimate question that I have.

1192
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:45,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the mayor intend to start the program as it was left off by Park Medford?

1193
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:50,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we gonna be patrolling all the resident permit parking streets?

1194
01:40:51,058 --> 01:40:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: that are currently patrolled by Park Medford?

1195
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my first question.

1196
01:40:55,543 --> 01:41:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: The second question is the administration, and I believe it was the previous administration, put together a consultant that they hired that came in regarding resident permit parking.

1197
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:21,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made a recommendation that they were going to start off doing a pilot program in Salt Method and the hillside, which never happened, Mr. President.

1198
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:24,339
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was a recommendation made by the consultant.

1199
01:41:24,919 --> 01:41:29,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we going to move towards some type of citywide permit parking?

1200
01:41:30,523 --> 01:41:31,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And when will that take place.

1201
01:41:32,806 --> 01:41:38,493
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking, you have to think about it when you do enforcement, and we met with, I think it was seven or eight communities.

1202
01:41:38,993 --> 01:41:45,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, when we were thinking about taking it in house, and you have to remember, there's enforcement.

1203
01:41:45,802 --> 01:41:47,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to hire enforcement officers.

1204
01:41:48,405 --> 01:41:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: There's collections.

1205
01:41:49,946 --> 01:41:54,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same people that are doing enforcement are not the people that are doing collections.

1206
01:41:55,608 --> 01:41:59,570
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have that in a program, someone that's giving out tickets and also collecting the money.

1207
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:01,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to be doing the hearings?

1208
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: That that's a big part of any type of parking enforcement program.

1209
01:42:07,978 --> 01:42:09,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have a maintenance.

1210
01:42:10,381 --> 01:42:15,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there are four distinct departments within parking enforcement.

1211
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:17,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hear any discussion.

1212
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: other than the hiring of a head of parking, which is great.

1213
01:42:22,353 --> 01:42:27,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a first step, but I think that step should have happened, honestly, a year ago.

1214
01:42:27,738 --> 01:42:34,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And over this past year, working on the eventual taking over of the parking program.

1215
01:42:34,764 --> 01:42:38,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how you do that in a month and a half, two month span.

1216
01:42:38,748 --> 01:42:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't see how this is gonna take off, Mr. President, and be successful.

1217
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:50,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I think residents were sold a bill of goods that were taking this over in-house, but there's no plan.

1218
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,181
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, show me a plan.

1219
01:42:55,441 --> 01:42:56,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to it.

1220
01:42:57,082 --> 01:43:00,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a plan in place and give us something to look forward to.

1221
01:43:01,364 --> 01:43:06,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are the questions that I have, Mr. President, that I think need to be asked.

1222
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:15,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if we're looking at taking this on and if we're looking at having a full-fledged parking enforcement department,

1223
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:22,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, our parking, if you notice, we don't have kiosks in every business district.

1224
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:40,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some business districts that have kiosks, and those particular businesses are subjected to someone coming out, feeding the kiosk, or they're subjected to someone saying, I'm not going to go to that particular business, because I can go to this other business that provides the same service, and I don't have to pay for a kiosk.

1225
01:43:41,336 --> 01:43:47,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were some inequities in the original program and we were sold a bill of goods that that was phase one.

1226
01:43:48,519 --> 01:43:50,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that was some 10 years ago, I believe.

1227
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That was phase one.

1228
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The city never rolled out phase two.

1229
01:43:55,443 --> 01:43:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the street sweeping program.

1230
01:43:57,644 --> 01:44:01,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still working on a pilot program for street sweeping.

1231
01:44:01,645 --> 01:44:04,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've had a pilot program since I've been on the council, 20 years.

1232
01:44:05,307 --> 01:44:06,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on a pilot program.

1233
01:44:07,857 --> 01:44:11,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're past the pilot program now, and this is no different.

1234
01:44:11,839 --> 01:44:13,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We started off with a parking program.

1235
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't implement it citywide.

1236
01:44:15,821 --> 01:44:20,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We only did certain business districts, which made no sense, Mr. President.

1237
01:44:20,563 --> 01:44:21,644
[SPEAKER_03]: We have kiosks now.

1238
01:44:22,024 --> 01:44:23,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the mayor gonna go to meters?

1239
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:28,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard the outcry when the kiosks were in the streets, that they were too complicated.

1240
01:44:29,248 --> 01:44:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: There were problems reading the screens and so forth.

1241
01:44:31,749 --> 01:44:33,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to a double-headed meter?

1242
01:44:34,965 --> 01:44:37,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how is this program going to operate?

1243
01:44:37,127 --> 01:44:47,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people have the right to know, Mr President, that if we're taking this in house, so, um, you know, I'm not gonna be on the council when this gets rolled out, but I could tell members that are new to this council.

1244
01:44:48,677 --> 01:44:56,024
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably remember, Mr President, that the angst that was out in the community when this was given to an outside entity

1245
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:59,297
[SPEAKER_03]: and allowed them to come in, Mr. President.

1246
01:44:59,337 --> 01:45:01,038
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of angst in this community.

1247
01:45:01,478 --> 01:45:02,759
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of unknowns.

1248
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:19,551
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to revamp the program a million times, Mr. President, to deal with resident permit parking, to deal with overnight parking, to deal with, you know, people that wanted to run into a store for five minutes, but had to feed the kiosk.

1249
01:45:20,171 --> 01:45:25,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they put meters in certain areas to try to resolve that, but not in every area.

1250
01:45:26,636 --> 01:45:27,897
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to look at signage.

1251
01:45:28,157 --> 01:45:30,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge issue, Mr. President.

1252
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:35,642
[SPEAKER_03]: When we looked at this years ago, one of the larger issues, believe it or not, was signage.

1253
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Because our signage in the city is not consistent.

1254
01:45:41,026 --> 01:45:43,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Go anywhere, it's not consistent, Mr. President.

1255
01:45:43,989 --> 01:45:45,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And then mapping out the parking spots.

1256
01:45:46,931 --> 01:45:51,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The city's not gonna take that on and map out the 1,200 parking spots in the business districts.

1257
01:45:53,148 --> 01:45:54,849
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the capability of doing that.

1258
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the things that really should be underway now that actually should be happening now.

1259
01:46:00,313 --> 01:46:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the things that we should be talking about, who's going to be mapping out the spots, are we going to meet and so we, you know, in the mayor point to the committee, they did yeoman's work, they came back with a great report, Mr. President.

1260
01:46:13,123 --> 01:46:18,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that the working document that we're working off to create this program?

1261
01:46:19,193 --> 01:46:26,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a member that served on that committee that came to me and said, geez, after all that service, I didn't even know they hired a parking enforcement director.

1262
01:46:27,818 --> 01:46:33,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent all that time putting all this together, all these hours, and no one had the common courtesy to say, hey, you're on the committee.

1263
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:35,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We hired a parking enforcement director.

1264
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:41,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a lot of what ifs with this program, and the residents deserve better.

1265
01:46:41,743 --> 01:46:44,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank my colleague, Councilor Felco, for bringing this up.

1266
01:46:45,064 --> 01:46:45,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1267
01:46:46,186 --> 01:46:47,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Fevella.

1268
01:46:47,187 --> 01:46:47,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1269
01:46:47,707 --> 01:46:48,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank Councilor Marks.

1270
01:46:49,149 --> 01:46:52,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, you have a lot of great questions that need to be answered, need to be addressed.

1271
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think one of the other questions is ticketing software.

1272
01:46:56,796 --> 01:47:01,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that is completely different from, you know, anything that we currently use today.

1273
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:07,025
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bottom line is the best question of all, what is the plan?

1274
01:47:08,486 --> 01:47:09,087
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the plan?

1275
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Marks asked it, what is the plan?

1276
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to be made aware of that.

1277
01:47:15,882 --> 01:47:26,365
[SPEAKER_07]: If revenues fall short, if this doesn't go right on time and revenues fall short, that's money that the city probably figures they're gonna be getting.

1278
01:47:26,405 --> 01:47:30,506
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're not getting all the revenue that we're supposed to be getting, that's a concern when it comes to budget time.

1279
01:47:31,047 --> 01:47:33,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to make sure that everything is being addressed.

1280
01:47:33,567 --> 01:47:38,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I can tell right now, it doesn't seem like much of anything is getting addressed.

1281
01:47:38,805 --> 01:47:48,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would actually, I would ask that you please schedule a committee the whole meeting so we can meet with the administration, at least meet through the director of parking and find out what is the plan?

1282
01:47:49,112 --> 01:47:50,713
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the plan moving forward for parking?

1283
01:47:51,233 --> 01:47:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Great questions regarding kiosks, meters, are we switching over?

1284
01:47:54,155 --> 01:47:55,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we not switching over?

1285
01:47:55,456 --> 01:47:57,037
[SPEAKER_07]: If you switch over, it's more expensive.

1286
01:47:57,778 --> 01:48:01,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We're inheriting equipment that's seven to 10 years old, I believe.

1287
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a concern as well.

1288
01:48:03,722 --> 01:48:05,583
[SPEAKER_07]: These things need to be upgraded over time.

1289
01:48:06,003 --> 01:48:08,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any upgrades that are coming up that need to be addressed?

1290
01:48:09,426 --> 01:48:15,031
[SPEAKER_07]: These are questions that need to be asked, and they need to be answered, and the administration needs to provide answers to those questions.

1291
01:48:15,652 --> 01:48:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So I respectfully ask that you set up a committee of the whole meeting to address all of these issues sooner than later, please.

1292
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:23,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1293
01:48:23,478 --> 01:48:23,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1294
01:48:24,019 --> 01:48:36,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had planned to invite the director to the next meeting, if she would come, so we could introduce her, and maybe she could answer some of the questions before we had a committee, or just so.

1295
01:48:37,443 --> 01:48:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: The community got to know the person.

1296
01:48:39,665 --> 01:48:42,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco.

1297
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:43,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I could.

1298
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:45,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Matz.

1299
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:47,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a word of caution to my colleagues.

1300
01:48:48,499 --> 01:48:52,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably the worst vote I ever took on this council in 20 years.

1301
01:48:53,523 --> 01:49:00,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But after making the recommendation, sitting on a committee, a parking enforcement committee, for two years, I was appointed by Mayor McGlynn.

1302
01:49:00,589 --> 01:49:09,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on it with Chief Sacco, Gwen Blackburn, Ron DeFranco, business owner in the community, and a number of residents, Mr. President.

1303
01:49:10,037 --> 01:49:11,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent two years.

1304
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:15,582
[SPEAKER_03]: We presented the paper to the Mayor McGlynn at the time.

1305
01:49:16,525 --> 01:49:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll never forget the meeting we had, Mayor McGlynn came out and did everything opposite of our recommendations.

1306
01:49:25,246 --> 01:49:36,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember to this day, Mr. President, and because I didn't want to look like I was anti, I went along with it after sitting after two years, Mr. President, saying that we should take the program in-house.

1307
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:39,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not take it in-house so we have control?

1308
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:45,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And after this many years, I think what we found out was you lose control when you do an outside

1309
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:46,892
[SPEAKER_03]: parking agency.

1310
01:49:47,153 --> 01:49:48,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we found that out the hard way.

1311
01:49:49,297 --> 01:49:52,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing, Mr. President, why not get the lion's share of the revenue?

1312
01:49:53,005 --> 01:49:55,510
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of the money was going out the door.

1313
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It made no sense when we can use it here.

1314
01:49:58,641 --> 01:50:01,701
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about all the time that we'd like to have other revenue streams.

1315
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:04,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been a perfect revenue stream, Mr. President.

1316
01:50:05,082 --> 01:50:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And the recommendation after meeting with all these communities was to put double head meters, Mr. President, that had the technology to be able to call in if you're inside a restaurant and update the meter or use a credit card or so forth.

1317
01:50:20,946 --> 01:50:23,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had all the latest technologies.

1318
01:50:23,926 --> 01:50:26,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mayor decided to use kiosk

1319
01:50:26,567 --> 01:50:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: which we were told over and over again, are typically used in parking lots and not on the streets.

1320
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:39,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were told, secondly, they won't accept dollar bills because of the rain and the moisture.

1321
01:50:39,698 --> 01:50:40,919
[SPEAKER_03]: They mess up the machines.

1322
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:45,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were told a lot of reasons not to use kiosks, Mr. President.

1323
01:50:45,543 --> 01:50:50,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just caution my colleagues, eventually when the administration comes out with their recommendations,

1324
01:50:51,592 --> 01:50:54,215
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be you that gets blamed when things don't happen.

1325
01:50:54,855 --> 01:50:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't just go along to get along.

1326
01:50:56,918 --> 01:50:58,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was my mistake, Mr. President.

1327
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And I regret it till this day.

1328
01:51:00,201 --> 01:51:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1329
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:14,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to point out that the vote that came before this council when parking enforcement was implemented here in the city of Medford was nothing more than a vote to allow the administration to negotiate a contract in excess of 36 months.

1330
01:51:15,565 --> 01:51:17,446
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the only authority we gave the administration.

1331
01:51:17,767 --> 01:51:23,651
[SPEAKER_11]: It was to negotiate a contract in excess of 36 months to create a parking program for parking enforcement here in this community.

1332
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:25,332
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the authority we gave.

1333
01:51:25,352 --> 01:51:28,575
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the program that they came up with.

1334
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:29,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, that is 100% right.

1335
01:51:29,455 --> 01:51:44,687
[SPEAKER_10]: The vote that we took that night was exactly what, Councilor, was just to extend the agreements and the administration was going to come back to us with a plan and the company that they chose, but we just got the company.

1336
01:51:46,178 --> 01:51:47,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1337
01:51:47,179 --> 01:51:58,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, and if when we have that meeting if we could also invite the parking commission that came up with a report of parking committee and if we can invite them to the meeting.

1338
01:52:05,494 --> 01:52:06,234
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a great job.

1339
01:52:06,334 --> 01:52:07,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem with the report.

1340
01:52:07,615 --> 01:52:08,275
[SPEAKER_07]: They came back.

1341
01:52:08,975 --> 01:52:25,160
[SPEAKER_07]: They presented this to us previously in Committee of the Whole, but I believe firmly that they should be at that meeting as well to make sure that the recommendations that they offered, see if the administration is going to follow through on those.

1342
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:26,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thank you.

1343
01:52:26,421 --> 01:52:27,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Is your committee still intact?

1344
01:52:29,522 --> 01:52:32,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it hasn't been disbanded, it just hasn't been meeting.

1345
01:52:33,524 --> 01:52:37,946
[SPEAKER_10]: But are you still, is this still an active committee or is your task done?

1346
01:52:38,407 --> 01:52:45,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the task is complete, but I think the committee is still active in the sense that it can be engaged whenever needed.

1347
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco.

1348
01:52:48,611 --> 01:52:50,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if I could just further amend that.

1349
01:52:50,964 --> 01:53:01,808
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be great to have the parking committee there, but if we're gonna be talking about what this program is gonna look like via fans, what's, how's, and the like, I think it's also very important that we have representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and our Disability Commission there as well.

1350
01:53:03,148 --> 01:53:03,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1351
01:53:04,349 --> 01:53:10,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by- Mr. President.

1352
01:53:10,751 --> 01:53:12,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1353
01:53:12,932 --> 01:53:16,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. Castanetti, name and address of the record, please.

1354
01:53:18,563 --> 01:53:23,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you can unmute Mr. Castagnetti, gentleman from East Medford.

1355
01:53:27,028 --> 01:53:28,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's Mr. Castagnetti.

1356
01:53:30,009 --> 01:53:30,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Mr. Castagnetti.

1357
01:53:30,910 --> 01:53:32,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address on the record, please.

1358
01:53:32,531 --> 01:53:37,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, East Ford, Massachusetts.

1359
01:53:39,214 --> 01:53:40,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I coming across?

1360
01:53:41,595 --> 01:53:42,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're coming across, sir.

1361
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:44,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1362
01:53:45,237 --> 01:53:47,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add some historical information to this

1363
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,571
[SPEAKER_05]: parking enforcement business.

1364
01:53:52,312 --> 01:54:00,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go backwards to when I got my license, when Papageno's used to be in the middle of Memphis Square, they had the parking meters 50 years ago.

1365
01:54:01,497 --> 01:54:05,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And it costs like whatever, a nickel for 10 minutes, half hour.

1366
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:15,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after a couple of four or five years, it seemed that we pulled all the meters out from the cement curb.

1367
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:21,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we added signs that said two-hour parking only.

1368
01:54:22,735 --> 01:54:29,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And for whatever reasons or reasons, it was not enforced very well, except for our old friend Vinnie the Cop.

1369
01:54:30,721 --> 01:54:36,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would write up a few of those fluorescent orange tickets in probably multiple squares.

1370
01:54:38,107 --> 01:54:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to me that the people from Stonehenge, Melrose,

1371
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Winchester, Malden, etc.

1372
01:54:50,415 --> 01:55:05,892
[SPEAKER_05]: They would drive down to Meffitt Square, they would park their car there for 8-10 hours and take the express buses that you people took from Meffitt Square and come back and they tied up all the parking spots for the local businessmen.

1373
01:55:07,454 --> 01:55:07,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1374
01:55:08,391 --> 01:55:20,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like that's when we got serious, and as Councilor Penta said, we hired the bounty hunters, and we found it out, we subbed that job out, et cetera.

1375
01:55:21,437 --> 01:55:27,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it is, eight, 10 years later, who knows where we're gonna go with this now.

1376
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:29,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And Councilor Machford brought up a good point.

1377
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:36,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the new enforcers be able to effectively police

1378
01:55:37,396 --> 01:55:42,398
[SPEAKER_05]: near resident parking, which is like whatever, five, seven miles of the city.

1379
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:51,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tough situation, and I wish us all good luck, or else we're gonna be back in the same soup like 50 years ago.

1380
01:55:52,661 --> 01:55:53,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1381
01:55:53,162 --> 01:55:53,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Kessler.

1382
01:55:55,122 --> 01:55:56,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Felco.

1383
01:55:57,582 --> 01:56:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Kerrio-Ville, Councilor Falco, Councilor Moxon, Councilor Knight, and a request for a committee of the whole meeting.

1384
01:56:08,952 --> 01:56:09,773
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1385
01:56:10,033 --> 01:56:10,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1386
01:56:10,594 --> 01:56:10,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

1387
01:56:10,974 --> 01:56:11,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1388
01:56:11,975 --> 01:56:22,384
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-1-6-0-5, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration provide report to the Memphis City Council on the condition of Homel Stadium and its plans for improvements.

1389
01:56:22,404 --> 01:56:23,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1390
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:41,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, I had the opportunity recently to take a walk through Hormel Stadium and really take a look at the condition of Hormel Stadium and it seems like there are a number of issues that have that really need to be addressed sooner than later.

1391
01:56:41,337 --> 01:56:45,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Among them are the press box I know that there's a hole in the roof.

1392
01:56:46,482 --> 01:56:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a hole in the floor.

1393
01:56:48,845 --> 01:57:00,561
[SPEAKER_07]: If you walk through the stands there are a couple of issues where the flooring is, they have like an orange cone in the middle of the floor you really can't walk near that so that is you walk through the stadium.

1394
01:57:01,685 --> 01:57:03,065
[SPEAKER_07]: The stadium is starting to show its age.

1395
01:57:03,766 --> 01:57:11,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you walk underneath the stadium in the, let's see, kind of the bays or the locker room areas, that's showing its age as well.

1396
01:57:12,088 --> 01:57:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Floors are cracked, sinking.

1397
01:57:14,689 --> 01:57:17,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are issues that really need to be addressed.

1398
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:26,053
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, my question is, you know, what's the plan for Hormel Stadium in trying to, you know, at least refurbish it or bring it into a, make sure it's,

1399
01:57:28,036 --> 01:57:43,500
[SPEAKER_07]: suitable for, you know, I mean, they have games here, of course, and everything seems fine, you know, from a game perspective on the field, but, you know, behind the scenes, you know, and underneath where they, you know, you know, it's really starting to show its age.

1400
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,980
[SPEAKER_07]: These issues need to be addressed.

1401
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,120
[SPEAKER_07]: They're long overdue.

1402
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:51,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's been any capital spending on the stadium for many years.

1403
01:57:51,701 --> 01:57:53,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question, once again, is what's the plan?

1404
01:57:54,462 --> 01:57:57,464
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the plan for when they'll stating the future of Cornell Stadium?

1405
01:57:57,544 --> 01:58:00,166
[SPEAKER_07]: How can these issues get addressed and repaired?

1406
01:58:00,987 --> 01:58:15,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these might be short fixes, but when you walk through and you see that the press box has a hole in the roof, the vinyl sidings falling off the side, I mean, you go outside into the parking lot, the benches are in disrepair.

1407
01:58:15,978 --> 01:58:17,760
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a gateway to our community.

1408
01:58:18,415 --> 01:58:25,142
[SPEAKER_07]: When you think about Hormel Stadium, there are people that are coming in each and every week, because Hormel Stadium is probably busier than it's ever been.

1409
01:58:26,003 --> 01:58:28,205
[SPEAKER_07]: People are coming in from all over the place.

1410
01:58:29,206 --> 01:58:30,707
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a gateway to our community.

1411
01:58:30,727 --> 01:58:38,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they see the stadium and they see, in some aspects, the condition it's in, you know, I think they really start to wonder, well, what does the rest of the city look like?

1412
01:58:39,136 --> 01:58:40,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to make sure that, you know,

1413
01:58:41,402 --> 01:58:45,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The stadium's kept up, and I know the people that work there, they do a fine job.

1414
01:58:45,205 --> 01:58:56,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing everything they can, but there also needs to be an infusion of capital to make sure that this stadium is, you know, kept properly for the long term.

1415
01:58:57,534 --> 01:59:03,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question, once again, is what's the plan with regard to renovations for Hornall Stadium?

1416
01:59:03,859 --> 01:59:06,881
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could get a report back from the administration on that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1417
01:59:06,921 --> 01:59:07,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1418
01:59:07,322 --> 01:59:07,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1419
01:59:07,942 --> 01:59:08,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, on that point,

1420
01:59:10,626 --> 01:59:26,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to point out, we shouldn't be sitting here talking about how are we going to find investments in Hormel Stadium, when we have a Hormel Commission that's very capable and does a very good job, working on setting policy and establishing policy for our Hormel Stadium field.

1421
01:59:27,615 --> 01:59:31,757
[SPEAKER_11]: The Hormel Commission has the opportunity to generate revenues, Mr. President, when the stadiums open.

1422
01:59:32,597 --> 01:59:34,478
[SPEAKER_11]: We probably have the ability to generate.

1423
01:59:34,498 --> 01:59:43,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's probably say anywhere between three to $5,000 per week council Scott Kelly might be able to correct me if I'm wrong to rental fees of the one third field alone.

1424
01:59:43,883 --> 01:59:48,205
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot more money, so a lot more so so how much council Scott probably per week you think we'd be able to.

1425
01:59:51,542 --> 01:59:57,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So between $7,500 and $10,000 per week, per week, when the stadium's open.

1426
01:59:58,165 --> 02:00:05,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've established a revolving account, Mr. President, so that the stadium has funds available so that it will become self-sufficient.

1427
02:00:06,188 --> 02:00:18,853
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this last budget, what we saw was a self-sufficient Hormel Commission, a self-sufficient athletic department that was booking the fields and generating quite a bit of money weekly.

1428
02:00:20,391 --> 02:00:27,314
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration thought it would be a good idea to create a new job, $70,000 a year, and use revolving funds to pay for it.

1429
02:00:27,634 --> 02:00:30,095
[SPEAKER_11]: When we had somebody, the athletic director, that was doing it for free.

1430
02:00:31,436 --> 02:00:36,778
[SPEAKER_11]: When you talk about investment in the community, Mr. President, when you talk about investment in the community, we had someone doing the job.

1431
02:00:37,459 --> 02:00:39,560
[SPEAKER_11]: We created a job, duplicative spending, $70,000.

1432
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:47,243
[SPEAKER_11]: That $70,000 could have gone back into the field, could have gone to the press box, could have gone to ADA accessibility at the field.

1433
02:00:49,058 --> 02:00:54,020
[SPEAKER_11]: When we talk about fiscal responsibility and elimination of wasteful and duplicative spending, this is something we have to look at, Mr. President.

1434
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:55,940
[SPEAKER_11]: We had someone doing the job for free.

1435
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:57,241
[SPEAKER_11]: We created a new job for $70,000.

1436
02:00:57,421 --> 02:01:00,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense.

1437
02:01:00,882 --> 02:01:01,522
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense.

1438
02:01:02,883 --> 02:01:06,844
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have made sense if Hormel wasn't performing, but Hormel was performing.

1439
02:01:06,944 --> 02:01:08,444
[SPEAKER_11]: The money was coming in, Mr. President.

1440
02:01:09,045 --> 02:01:16,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only were the revenues coming in, but there was a community need that was being met on behalf of our youth groups and organizations.

1441
02:01:19,197 --> 02:01:20,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very concerned about what's going on with home health.

1442
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:23,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very concerned about what's going on with LeConte Skating Rink.

1443
02:01:24,221 --> 02:01:30,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very scared about the future and whether or not we see privatization come and take over these two facilities.

1444
02:01:30,025 --> 02:01:32,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very concerned about it, Mr. President.

1445
02:01:32,567 --> 02:01:34,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank Councilor Falco for putting the matter on the agenda.

1446
02:01:35,529 --> 02:01:35,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1447
02:01:36,109 --> 02:01:45,636
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Caravaglio, Councilor Falco, Councilor Marks, and Councilor Knight, and the Committee of the Whole has been requested.

1448
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1449
02:01:47,117 --> 02:01:47,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1450
02:01:47,637 --> 02:01:48,218
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1451
02:01:49,137 --> 02:01:49,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1452
02:01:49,957 --> 02:01:54,280
[SPEAKER_10]: 21-606, offered by Councilor Falco.

1453
02:01:54,300 --> 02:02:01,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the administration provide a report to the Memphis City Council on the plans to resurface Field of Dreams at Medford High School.

1454
02:02:01,423 --> 02:02:02,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1455
02:02:02,804 --> 02:02:03,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1456
02:02:04,264 --> 02:02:06,446
[SPEAKER_07]: This actually is a...

1457
02:02:08,397 --> 02:02:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So feel the dreams.

1458
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:14,023
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had feel the dreams now for probably about 10 years, 10, 11 years.

1459
02:02:14,223 --> 02:02:23,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And the life, usually the life of the athletic field and the councilor Scott probably could probably tell me, could probably clarify this too, is probably around 10 years, I believe.

1460
02:02:24,849 --> 02:02:31,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we're getting into that range now where you know that field probably needs to be addressed soon.

1461
02:02:31,172 --> 02:02:37,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a couple years ago we had a number of people that came before us with the same same question.

1462
02:02:37,996 --> 02:02:48,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And those people actually did a lot of hard work and, you know, getting the field built, and they had the same concerns as to when is that turf going to be replaced.

1463
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that that has not been addressed in the past couple of years.

1464
02:02:52,933 --> 02:02:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question again, I guess, is what is the plan to actually have that resurfaced?

1465
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:02,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, you mentioned rentals.

1466
02:03:02,463 --> 02:03:06,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there is money that does come in, but what is the plan to have it resurfaced?

1467
02:03:07,468 --> 02:03:11,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can get a report back from the administration as to what the plan is, greatly appreciate it.

1468
02:03:11,252 --> 02:03:11,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1469
02:03:12,067 --> 02:03:17,274
[SPEAKER_11]: But point of information, Mr. President, I do believe that we have a revolving fund at the field of dreams as well.

1470
02:03:17,454 --> 02:03:17,855
[SPEAKER_11]: You're correct.

1471
02:03:17,875 --> 02:03:19,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the field of dreams, we have two fields.

1472
02:03:20,358 --> 02:03:26,426
[SPEAKER_11]: So according to Counselor Scott Tully's figures, if managed correctly, then that would bring us close to somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 a week in season.

1473
02:03:30,994 --> 02:03:32,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1474
02:03:32,855 --> 02:03:35,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda.

1475
02:03:36,316 --> 02:03:37,177
[SPEAKER_01]: School committee member Ms.

1476
02:03:37,197 --> 02:03:45,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Stone and I had been talking to Mr. Maloney and some other folks at Medford High School, just because we've been getting a lot of complaints about the condition of the field.

1477
02:03:46,181 --> 02:03:50,703
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously in poor condition, the rubber is all over, you know,

1478
02:03:51,385 --> 02:03:52,945
[SPEAKER_01]: taking over the turf, if you will.

1479
02:03:54,366 --> 02:03:59,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And he assured us that they had a, I don't know if it was a plan in place, but that it would be addressed soon.

1480
02:03:59,467 --> 02:04:05,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you putting this on the agenda because it really needs to happen ASAP.

1481
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:12,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about two months ago that Mia and I were asking about it and it still hasn't been done.

1482
02:04:17,646 --> 02:04:39,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I think God brings forward I actually am honored to have been on that original committee, and the hard work by grassroot organization with Bill Carr and Jay Sharma that started that program, and they were, they were, they were

1483
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:49,997
[SPEAKER_12]: we tried our best to build in a system that part of that fees 10 years ago, 12 years ago would go to what we're talking about right now.

1484
02:04:50,717 --> 02:04:52,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's obviously not happened.

1485
02:04:53,939 --> 02:04:54,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish it, I hope it did.

1486
02:04:55,280 --> 02:05:08,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe there is something in that account, but we put out to the state for one of our stadiums two, three years ago, and we are finally now,

1487
02:05:10,425 --> 02:05:13,626
[SPEAKER_12]: resurfacing turf at Dillboy Stadium.

1488
02:05:14,246 --> 02:05:18,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is in that field is probably about a year away.

1489
02:05:19,148 --> 02:05:23,970
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the biggest things you'll hear the geo studies, a concussion test study.

1490
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:31,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's going to be, you know, you might get to a point where you don't have any options once that test comes back and it fails.

1491
02:05:32,474 --> 02:05:33,515
[SPEAKER_12]: you're not going to have any options.

1492
02:05:33,936 --> 02:05:34,717
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be closed.

1493
02:05:36,099 --> 02:05:44,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that it's important that bringing this forward today, I think it's important that we move on this and it's not cheap.

1494
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:48,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe there's a way to look into the

1495
02:05:51,357 --> 02:05:56,059
[SPEAKER_12]: the monies the federal government gave us to, if there's a way to, with infrastructure needs.

1496
02:05:56,780 --> 02:06:04,964
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's gonna be daunting, but I appreciate you bringing this forward, and it's something that this administration has to work on yesterday.

1497
02:06:05,364 --> 02:06:05,845
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

1498
02:06:05,865 --> 02:06:14,069
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could just amend the paper, Mr. President, to request that we get a copy of the debt service schedule for the Field of Dreams to be sure that all of our bonded indebtedness has been paid off at that location.

1499
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:18,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question.

1500
02:06:25,292 --> 02:06:26,733
[SPEAKER_10]: seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

1501
02:06:28,035 --> 02:06:28,795
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1502
02:06:29,196 --> 02:06:29,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1503
02:06:29,936 --> 02:06:30,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

1504
02:06:30,577 --> 02:06:33,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1505
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:43,749
[SPEAKER_10]: 21607 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration provide a report to the Memphis City Council regarding the lack of hot water in the shower area at the swimming pool at Medford High School.

1506
02:06:43,769 --> 02:06:44,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1507
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:46,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1508
02:06:46,471 --> 02:06:50,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I was up at the Medford High School swimming pool recently and

1509
02:06:51,943 --> 02:07:03,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really one of the hidden jewels in our community to have a pool that big in our community is, you know, most most communities throughout the Commonwealth do not have a swimming pool like that.

1510
02:07:03,793 --> 02:07:08,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are plenty of people that swim and they love to swim and they make it part of their day.

1511
02:07:11,304 --> 02:07:27,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was up there recently and one of the big questions that came up was the hot water, it appears that there's no hot water in for the showers in the men's and ladies room and that needs to be addressed I mean a lot of people go they take a swim they go to work afterwards.

1512
02:07:27,837 --> 02:07:30,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably don't want to show up to work, smelling like chlorine.

1513
02:07:31,662 --> 02:07:43,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could please have, receive a report back from the, I guess it'd be the school administration to find out why there is no hot water in the locker rooms at the high school in the swimming area.

1514
02:07:43,809 --> 02:07:45,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I greatly appreciate it.

1515
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:47,291
[SPEAKER_07]: People pay to use this pool.

1516
02:07:47,811 --> 02:07:55,275
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve to be able to take a hot shower before they, or at least have access to hot water before they get home with their day.

1517
02:07:55,335 --> 02:07:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that we receive a report back on that issue.

1518
02:07:58,777 --> 02:07:59,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1519
02:08:00,258 --> 02:08:04,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight, I think there's a bigger concern that we have here.

1520
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,401
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all sitting here with masks on our face, right?

1521
02:08:07,581 --> 02:08:11,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We're being told to wash our hands 2,550 times a day.

1522
02:08:12,543 --> 02:08:17,305
[SPEAKER_11]: When we use the facilities, we're supposed to wash our hands when we're done.

1523
02:08:17,925 --> 02:08:25,348
[SPEAKER_11]: When we're going into a locker room and you have no ability to properly wash your hands,

1524
02:08:26,718 --> 02:08:30,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Mr. President, we might have a concern relative to the state sanitary code.

1525
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:39,944
[SPEAKER_11]: The pool is secluded in possible off area to the pool open to the public during certain hours and the rest of the school is not.

1526
02:08:40,724 --> 02:08:51,029
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm using the pool and I need to use the restroom, am I supposed to wander around Medford High School to find a bathroom that has hot water so that I can wash my hands?

1527
02:08:52,088 --> 02:08:53,449
[SPEAKER_11]: think you'll find them mostly closed.

1528
02:08:54,570 --> 02:08:55,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, exactly.

1529
02:08:55,751 --> 02:08:57,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And the one that is open is no hot water.

1530
02:08:59,635 --> 02:09:06,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to just request Mr. President, the Board of Health takes a visit up there to be sure that we're in compliance with the state sanitary code.

1531
02:09:09,884 --> 02:09:13,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this is not something that's new to the years of the school administration.

1532
02:09:13,307 --> 02:09:15,449
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that they've heard about before the summer.

1533
02:09:16,642 --> 02:09:17,582
[SPEAKER_11]: something that should have been addressed.

1534
02:09:17,922 --> 02:09:22,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here we are in 40 degree weather, and it's still not something that's been fixed.

1535
02:09:24,084 --> 02:09:24,524
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best.

1536
02:09:25,165 --> 02:09:37,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. President, quite frankly, you know, the conditions in the gym, it's a little separate from the pool, but the conditions in the locker rooms for students going to PE classes, pretty dismal as well.

1537
02:09:37,808 --> 02:09:46,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it's an issue across the whole backside of E building or whatever it might be, but it's pretty rough.

1538
02:09:47,793 --> 02:09:48,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1539
02:09:48,654 --> 02:09:48,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1540
02:09:48,974 --> 02:09:54,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Knight to have the Board of Health look into this.

1541
02:09:55,418 --> 02:09:56,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

1542
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1543
02:09:59,301 --> 02:10:00,041
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1544
02:10:00,562 --> 02:10:00,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1545
02:10:00,862 --> 02:10:01,462
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1546
02:10:01,722 --> 02:10:02,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1547
02:10:04,308 --> 02:10:15,633
[SPEAKER_10]: 21608 offered by Vice President night and President care bill, be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Jane McDevitt on her recent passes, Vice President night.

1548
02:10:16,194 --> 02:10:17,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1549
02:10:18,815 --> 02:10:23,738
[SPEAKER_11]: For many years the McDevitt family have been very good to me family that I consider very close friends.

1550
02:10:24,795 --> 02:10:26,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack was my favorite teacher at Medford High School.

1551
02:10:26,676 --> 02:10:27,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael and I are very close friends.

1552
02:10:27,916 --> 02:10:37,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had the opportunity to hear all of Jack's stories about Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Penelope, as he used to call them, when we were in first period law class my senior year in high school.

1553
02:10:38,059 --> 02:10:45,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And since that time as the president, through the friendship that we've been able to develop through recent involvement in various public service organizations.

1554
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:50,312
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, very recently, Mr. McDevitt lost his wife Jane.

1555
02:10:51,253 --> 02:10:54,494
[SPEAKER_11]: She battled with a long public illness and was infirm for a number of years.

1556
02:10:55,134 --> 02:11:00,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And she had recently been put on hospice and was no longer able to keep up the fight.

1557
02:11:01,477 --> 02:11:03,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And she will be sadly missed, Mr. President.

1558
02:11:03,658 --> 02:11:06,720
[SPEAKER_11]: She was a woman of great faith, an educator like her husband.

1559
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:08,940
[SPEAKER_11]: someone who was very involved in the St.

1560
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:11,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph's Parish, and someone who will be certainly missed.

1561
02:11:12,121 --> 02:11:19,163
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to join in and extend the condolences to the McDevitt family during their time of loss.

1562
02:11:19,783 --> 02:11:25,104
[SPEAKER_11]: If you know the McDevitts, you know them to be people that put Medford first, the people that have public service in their veins.

1563
02:11:26,124 --> 02:11:30,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael was just appointed American Legion post five member of the year.

1564
02:11:31,566 --> 02:11:36,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Jack McDevitt has a list of students for the last 40 years at Medford High School that called him

1565
02:11:37,347 --> 02:11:41,609
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the most inspirational, motivational, and favorite teachers that I've ever had.

1566
02:11:42,230 --> 02:11:46,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jane did such a great job working with the students that she had in the city of Boston and beyond.

1567
02:11:46,572 --> 02:11:51,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to extend these condolences to the family.

1568
02:11:51,915 --> 02:11:52,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1569
02:11:53,436 --> 02:11:58,238
[SPEAKER_10]: On the same note, again, I've known the McDevitt family for many years.

1570
02:11:59,019 --> 02:12:04,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, Jack, teacher, I had him in junior high school.

1571
02:12:05,992 --> 02:12:07,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Good man, good family.

1572
02:12:08,074 --> 02:12:12,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I know she suffered at the end there, but she's in a better place now.

1573
02:12:17,766 --> 02:12:18,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Rise for a moment of silence, please.

1574
02:12:35,419 --> 02:12:37,241
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

1575
02:12:37,321 --> 02:12:37,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1576
02:12:37,561 --> 02:12:38,822
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1577
02:12:38,842 --> 02:12:39,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1578
02:12:40,003 --> 02:12:41,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the Clerk.

1579
02:12:44,167 --> 02:12:49,391
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councillor Nights, seconded by Councillor Beers.

1580
02:12:49,531 --> 02:12:50,111
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

1581
02:12:50,131 --> 02:12:50,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1582
02:12:50,892 --> 02:12:51,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1583
02:12:54,932 --> 02:12:56,433
[SPEAKER_10]: offered by the entire council.

1584
02:12:56,993 --> 02:13:04,456
[SPEAKER_10]: He resolved that a moment of silence be held for a longtime resident and deputy police officer, William Billy Butts, on his recent passing.

1585
02:13:05,776 --> 02:13:06,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

1586
02:13:08,277 --> 02:13:10,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1587
02:13:11,078 --> 02:13:11,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Billy Butts was

1588
02:13:14,363 --> 02:13:31,232
[SPEAKER_11]: a one of a kind, as they'd say, started out a career in public service, working in government, if I do remember correctly, and went on to become a police officer, Mr. President, and he was one of those police officers that wasn't afraid to get out of the car, that did the job the right way, that put the community first.

1589
02:13:31,672 --> 02:13:33,253
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a proud parent.

1590
02:13:33,613 --> 02:13:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to meet his sons socially on a number of occasions, and someone who really loved this community and loved serving the public as a police officer.

1591
02:13:42,838 --> 02:13:46,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And just earlier last week, he suddenly passed away.

1592
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:59,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was much to the dismay and sadness of many of us here in this community who had the opportunity to call him a friend, and who had the opportunity to see Billy in action and see him help so many people as a police officer here in the city of Medford.

1593
02:13:59,969 --> 02:14:05,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would defer to you for further comment, but he will be sadly missed.

1594
02:14:06,593 --> 02:14:09,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, times like this are very difficult.

1595
02:14:09,475 --> 02:14:12,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The gentleman, I don't think was retired from more than a year.

1596
02:14:13,923 --> 02:14:17,164
[SPEAKER_11]: as a member of the Metro Police Department for three decades plus.

1597
02:14:17,945 --> 02:14:20,665
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you hear that happen to somebody, it's very sad.

1598
02:14:21,046 --> 02:14:24,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it happens so suddenly, the impact that it has on the family is tremendous.

1599
02:14:25,107 --> 02:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, thank you.

1600
02:14:27,748 --> 02:14:31,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

1601
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:40,092
[SPEAKER_12]: These are one of the deaths that happen in a community that stop everything.

1602
02:14:40,952 --> 02:14:41,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And

1603
02:14:42,004 --> 02:14:44,024
[SPEAKER_12]: it's instantly felt across the community.

1604
02:14:45,285 --> 02:14:54,047
[SPEAKER_12]: As he was called the unofficial mayor of Medford, I think, and he had the right to hold that because he had a great demeanor about him.

1605
02:14:54,087 --> 02:15:10,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, I remember back as a young man in high school, first being introduced to Officer Butts, and he really tried to look at situations and really try to use common sense

1606
02:15:11,630 --> 02:15:14,072
[SPEAKER_12]: to come to an end result to help, especially kids.

1607
02:15:15,453 --> 02:15:26,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And he gave so much, that's one of the things you hear so much as you talk about him throughout the community, how much Billy Butts gave to kids and how much he gave to his community.

1608
02:15:26,983 --> 02:15:33,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And it took the wind out of my sails because he was a pretty special person.

1609
02:15:35,238 --> 02:15:36,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And our family, St.

1610
02:15:36,259 --> 02:15:38,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis, I know that my mom really loved him.

1611
02:15:38,701 --> 02:15:39,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Dad really loved him.

1612
02:15:40,363 --> 02:15:43,425
[SPEAKER_12]: He left that impact on anybody who came across him.

1613
02:15:44,126 --> 02:15:51,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know I've talked to a few of his brother and sister, police officers, and they were punching the gut.

1614
02:15:51,493 --> 02:15:54,836
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that really threw everybody for a loop.

1615
02:15:54,876 --> 02:15:58,099
[SPEAKER_12]: So condolences to his family.

1616
02:15:58,619 --> 02:16:01,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Know that Billy Butts leaves a legacy.

1617
02:16:02,596 --> 02:16:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: like no other and a legacy that people should be proud of if you've known him, if you didn't listen to a story, understand the person and try to emulate what he's done because he's a great role model and great example of a human being and a police officer.

1618
02:16:22,343 --> 02:16:26,304
[SPEAKER_12]: So rest in peace, my friend, he will definitely be missed.

1619
02:16:30,453 --> 02:16:33,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I wanna thank my colleagues for their comments.

1620
02:16:34,196 --> 02:16:49,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was in January of this year that this council offered a council citation, recognizing for his over three decades of service to the citizens of this community.

1621
02:16:50,367 --> 02:16:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're recognizing him for his untimely passing, Mr. President, which is a true shame.

1622
02:16:58,683 --> 02:17:05,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you think about Officer Butts, you know, what comes to mind to me is community policing.

1623
02:17:07,649 --> 02:17:11,651
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like having a family member on the Method Police Department.

1624
02:17:13,158 --> 02:17:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had a family member of the Memphis Police Department, but Billy Butts was like having an older brother on the police department.

1625
02:17:20,446 --> 02:17:24,270
[SPEAKER_03]: He cared about everyone that he came in contact with.

1626
02:17:24,691 --> 02:17:32,219
[SPEAKER_03]: He went the extra mile, Mr. President, to make sure that things were taken care of and that people didn't get hurt.

1627
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:43,567
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and when I say hurt, I mean physically hurt, but he was the type of guy that would try to iron out situations without having them escalate and grow, and he was good at it.

1628
02:17:44,028 --> 02:17:45,109
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really good at it.

1629
02:17:46,089 --> 02:17:46,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know,

1630
02:17:47,940 --> 02:18:03,804
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when you talk about community policing, he was the type of police officer that you'd imagine back in the 30s and 40s in the city that would go around to each door in the business district and shake it to see if they were locked after hours.

1631
02:18:04,444 --> 02:18:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was truly that type of officer that, you know, really, I think you don't come by nowadays.

1632
02:18:11,885 --> 02:18:14,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had that special gift of communication.

1633
02:18:15,306 --> 02:18:17,247
[SPEAKER_03]: and being able to communicate with people.

1634
02:18:17,588 --> 02:18:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And you always felt comfortable with Billy Butts.

1635
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:28,134
[SPEAKER_03]: He always had a smile, although he looked kind of intimidating that, you know, if you did the wrong thing, it'd take care of you as well.

1636
02:18:28,174 --> 02:18:33,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But he always had a smile on his face, a good word to say.

1637
02:18:33,838 --> 02:18:38,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, someone that passes before their time, Mr. President,

1638
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:41,363
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, is an awful, awful tragedy.

1639
02:18:42,004 --> 02:18:46,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And truly, Billy Butts is a tragedy, Mr President, because

1640
02:18:47,415 --> 02:19:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, in this day and age, you don't find police officers that have that skill of communication, the skill of community building, of community policing, old-fashioned policing, which I like to call it.

1641
02:19:03,845 --> 02:19:16,793
[SPEAKER_03]: When an officer knew your name and you felt a tie with the police department, Mr. President, it wasn't just a car driving through the neighbor, but you knew it was Officer Butts, and he'd pull over and talk to you.

1642
02:19:17,443 --> 02:19:19,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the type of officer he was.

1643
02:19:19,524 --> 02:19:30,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, as Council Scott Pelley mentioned, he's a true friend and it's a great loss for this community, Mr. President.

1644
02:19:30,746 --> 02:19:31,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1645
02:19:31,707 --> 02:19:32,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1646
02:19:32,867 --> 02:19:36,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank Councilman for bringing this forward and my colleagues for their kind comments.

1647
02:19:37,908 --> 02:19:39,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I was absolutely shocked when I found out.

1648
02:19:39,670 --> 02:19:44,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I had just seen Billy a couple of weeks ago at a local restaurant.

1649
02:19:44,614 --> 02:19:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right, Council Member, I mean, someone who is so easy to talk to, just a great person, always gave great advice, and someone who will be missed dearly throughout our community.

1650
02:19:57,526 --> 02:20:01,289
[SPEAKER_07]: He served on the Memphis Police Force for many years, over 30 years.

1651
02:20:02,897 --> 02:20:04,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And not a lot of people do that these days.

1652
02:20:05,259 --> 02:20:08,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So my thoughts and prayers to his family and thank you.

1653
02:20:09,761 --> 02:20:10,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1654
02:20:10,782 --> 02:20:16,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew Billy long before he was a policeman and he was a friend.

1655
02:20:16,305 --> 02:20:21,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said, when he got on the police force, it's a job he took seriously.

1656
02:20:21,908 --> 02:20:23,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, he was a friend to all.

1657
02:20:24,370 --> 02:20:30,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I think plenty has been said about him and just condolences to his family.

1658
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:33,380
[SPEAKER_10]: on a sudden loss.

1659
02:20:36,762 --> 02:20:38,522
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could rise and take a moment of silence, please.

1660
02:20:38,542 --> 02:20:59,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So the motion by Councilor Falco is seconded by Councilor

1661
02:21:00,228 --> 02:21:02,309
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1662
02:21:02,509 --> 02:21:02,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1663

[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Records.

1665

[SPEAKER_10]: Records.

1666
02:21:09,613 --> 02:21:16,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Table of records of the meeting of October 12th, 2021 were passed to Councilor Morrell.

1667
02:21:16,597 --> 02:21:18,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morrell, how did you find those records?

1668
02:21:18,558 --> 02:21:20,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I found them to be in order and with approval.

1669
02:21:20,659 --> 02:21:23,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, on the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Knight.

[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

02:21:26,042 --> 02:21:26,503
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1673
02:21:26,523 --> 02:21:27,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1674
02:21:27,797 --> 02:21:32,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Records of me on October 19th, 2021 will pass to Councilor Scott Pele.

1675
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:34,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott Pele, how did you find those records?

1676
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:42,519
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pele, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1677
02:21:42,599 --> 02:21:43,280

[SPEAKER_10]: Election day is next Tuesday.

1682

[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck to all my colleagues and everybody running for office.

1683
02:21:58,779 --> 02:22:05,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a great deal of determination and work for everybody that chooses to run the public office.

1684
02:22:09,226 --> 02:22:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, Mr. President.

1685
02:22:10,727 --> 02:22:13,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little sprinkle of insanity too.

1686
02:22:13,549 --> 02:22:14,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta mix that in.

1687
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:19,794
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, Mr. President, I would like to send a personal thank you down to Baird Haley.

1688
02:22:20,877 --> 02:22:30,602
[SPEAKER_11]: and Mrs. Joyce down in the elections office who have been a big help throughout this whole entire process with all the paperwork and everything else that's necessary for being filed and the like.

1689
02:22:30,622 --> 02:22:38,146
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a great staff down there in the elections office and I want to make sure the clerk has me say this to him today before the election.

1690
