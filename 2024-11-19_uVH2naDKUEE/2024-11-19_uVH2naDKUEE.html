    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=22.712s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=23.033s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=24.113s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=26.953s">United</a>  States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=46.098s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=47.639s">21-598</a>  offered by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=52.549s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the city council request that the health department and building department me to discuss any existing policies around masonry dust caused by outdoor dry cutting report back to the council on the city city administration's plan in the interest of public safety council morale.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=70.94s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, yeah I've actually had a number of residents reach out with concern over this with our hilly landscape and Medford there's no shortage of masonry and walls in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=80.647s">And</a>  sometimes what comes with that is dry cutting where you can see clouds of dust, emitting from these cutting activities and. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=87.792s">Oftentimes</a>  this dust can actually contain very incredibly dangerous materials like crystalline silica. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=94.077s">There</a>  are OSHA requirements around this, but again I feel the complaints from residents who are seeing this go on in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=100.983s">I've</a>  connected with Building Commissioner Moki about this and I'm just curious to see <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=106.207s">If</a>  there's a way we can perhaps set some policies or guidance that people can get when they're pulling a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=111.811s">I</a>  know not all of these projects require permits, but if they're pulling a permit or something we can share just with the public because this actually is a very dangerous material that gets emitted, you know, on our streets in our neighborhoods that people might not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=124.178s">give</a>  them the opportunity to flag this because there are abatement and engineering controls that can be easily done as far as vacuuming the dust or vacuum systems for the dust and water delivery systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=136.326s">So</a>  I'm just seeking if it's possible to have these apartments meet and see if there are recommendations that can come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=142.45s">for</a>  a policy so that we can point to this, we can inform residents and we can inform workers because they're the ones that are most directly impacted by this very dangerous dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=153.096s">So</a>  I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=154.677s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=156.718s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=161.381s">Any</a>  discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=163.582s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=164.303s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=164.863s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=166.604s">Motion</a>  passes. 21599. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=171.009s">and</a>  21609 offered by Councilor Morell and President Caraviello be it so resolved that the City Council receive an update on the timeline of the Eversource project and paving and offered by President Caraviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the Mystic Avenue paving done Saturday night into Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=190.859s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=191.97s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=193.231s">As</a>  we're nearing the completion of construction season, we got an update at the beginning of this project launching once again with the work earlier in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=202.817s">The</a>  council had concerns about the speed at which this would be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=205.979s">I</a>  believe we still had projected another potential two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=209.882s">We</a>  pushed back on that because part of that was held up by detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=212.724s">I</a>  do believe they ended up having at least two crews going at once based on my experience driving through the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=219.248s">But</a>  I think it would be great to have an update on, you know, what is the forecasted completion date? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=224.051s">When</a>  can residents expect to see this, you know, the length of this project repave curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=230.135s">And</a>  if there are any places for residents to have input that haven't already been decided, it would be great for residents to know that because I know there's, you know, there are plans for a number of crosswalks, but also <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=241.261s">decisions</a>  around bike lanes and things of that nature, I think would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=244.563s">And</a>  residents would appreciate after this extremely long project, hopefully someday wrapping up, you know, having their input on what the future of their neighborhood looks like, particularly because they have been bombarded with the impacts of this project for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=257.671s">So</a>  seeing an update when we can expect completion, when is that curve to curve paving going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=262.914s">And</a>  what are other ways residents can provide input?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=265.969s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=268.09s">And</a>  on my motion, I've got concerns about the paving that was already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=276.575s">I</a>  had an opportunity to go by the part of Mystic Avenue that was done Sunday night into Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=283.061s">If</a>  you drive by there now, you can see it's pooling all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=288.626s">Obviously,</a>  it's either it's uneven. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=290.968s">I</a>  know very little about paving, but I can see that there's a pooling in several different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=298.895s">Um,</a>  it's already coming up in some spots you can you can see the, you can see there's no seals around the edges and say it's a, my opinion, it's shoddy work at best. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=309.143s">And</a>  if this council is going to get blamed for the things that are done and say, I want to hold people accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=315.512s">who</a>  did the lousy work over there, because if this is what they did over here, we've got another few miles of street that has to be paved by Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=323.435s">And</a>  they say, if this is the way they're gonna do it, it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=328.337s">I</a>  mean, they paved in the, it's raining all week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=331.819s">Who</a>  paves in the rain? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=334.78s">I</a>  went up and looked at paving statutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=339.329s">says</a>  you shouldn't be paving when you know there's going to be three, four or five days of rain, because it never cures. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=344.251s">So</a>  I think I think Tim's on the line here and I think we have Mr. Karen's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=348.893s">I,</a>  in my opinion, I think that should be torn up and refixed again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=353.715s">To</a>  make it up to the where it should be the same status because at the end when it comes up, who's going to fit the bill for us, it's gonna be the taxpayers in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=363.479s">So</a>  Kevin, did you want to speak on that?</p>
