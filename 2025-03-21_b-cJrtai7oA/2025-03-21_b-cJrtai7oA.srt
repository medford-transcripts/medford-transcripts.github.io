[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl Rodriguez, funding request for supplies for Robert's School Art Mural.

74
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:20,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

75
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:21,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Rodriguez?

76
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:27,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

77
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:37,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez, and I'm a parent at the Roberts Elementary School, and I'm involved in the art show that's happening in May.

78
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the teacher was my mom.

79
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:43,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We were fortunate to get a grant this year from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

80
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:45,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have arts and residents in here.

81
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:54,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a student author come in, and she's going to be helping the students, every student who's going to participate.

82
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,359
[SPEAKER_05]: and create a mural on the second floor outside the art room.

83
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be a mosaic.

84
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:06,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he ran probably the entire cost of the art, and we were able to get some funding.

85
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:11,189
[SPEAKER_05]: But supply would be too, of course, for cover.

86
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:18,049
[SPEAKER_25]: The superintendent, it was my understanding that at some point there was some money that was put aside for art projects.

87
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:25,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and this would seem, uh, without knowing too much about it, uh, uh, to be the perfect candidate, uh, for it.

88
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:33,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, so I wonder if you could, uh, let us know how, uh, the PTO, uh, the Roberts could go about getting this, this, uh, project funded.

89
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,703
[SPEAKER_12]: So upon approval of the school committee,

90
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:45,514
[SPEAKER_12]: We will ask the city to allow us to utilize the money from the public art funds that were appropriated for us.

91
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:57,638
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'd like to make a motion that after review by the superintendent that the funds be appropriated for this project at the Roberts.

92
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:58,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

93
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,646
[SPEAKER_17]: seconded by Mr. Scurry and Mr. Benedetto.

94
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:06,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a picture of what the art will look like on the theater?

95
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:07,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not.

96
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:12,570
[SPEAKER_05]: All students voted that the final theme is the many cultures of the Roberts.

97
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, in one day, our teacher asked everyone in their country of origin, and we had 41 countries from one day.

98
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to have to design something to try to incorporate all those cultures.

99
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,775
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be a record of them coming out.

100
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,736
[SPEAKER_05]: The project is supposed to start in May.

101
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:57,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll all come together make one they'll be mounted on like separate bars So they'll be able to be removed if so it won't damage the wall But they'll be supported and we have talked to the buildings department to make sure it's safely installed.

102
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:57,985
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be installed

103
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:09,767
[SPEAKER_09]: meet the needs of the school, that it's easily changed, or new students get that opportunity as well.

104
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:14,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really like the idea that it's placed on and not directly on the wall.

105
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:23,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see it at some point, or pictures of it, or a draft of the ideas, but I have no problem with moving forward.

106
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:25,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

107
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:26,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuno.

108
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:31,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, actually, the question was going to be exactly what my colleague said.

109
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:36,120
[SPEAKER_18]: I know in the past when we've done murals, and correct me if I'm wrong, I believe Ms.

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:48,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Van der Kloot would know this, no disrespect to anyone else, but I think when we first started the murals, we had said we were going to put them on particular boards or frames at the schools so that way we can remove them down the road.

111
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:54,105
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to say that a couple of weeks ago something came before us and we didn't ask that question.

112
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,285
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to make sure that

113
00:04:55,865 --> 00:05:10,078
[SPEAKER_18]: It does continue doing that because we don't want to ruin the artwork of the children and we want to make sure that it does get preserved and that it can be removed from one wall to another wall without ruining the artwork or the wall.

114
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

115
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,545
[SPEAKER_19]: We are, if possible, you are getting the supplies.

116
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:35,966
[SPEAKER_19]: I reached out to a couple of artists, my niece is an artist, and I spoke with somebody that also, I believe, works with the Art Council, and she mentioned there's a company, Blick, and they have high-quality art supplies, very high quality, used by a lot of artists, and they also have

117
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:47,585
[SPEAKER_19]: like what's called an art room aid where you can select items and almost like a wish list where you can select the items that you want to choose for the supplies.

118
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:55,251
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if this would be a recommendation, but it was mentioned that when you do this art room aid,

119
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:59,475
[SPEAKER_19]: You can actually request donations with this company.

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:05,157
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, and I'm not sure, but I think the Andrews Middle School, they did something like that.

121
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:10,780
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm not really too sure what it was when they were doing their, you know, the most recent art mural.

122
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,641
[SPEAKER_19]: But I didn't really have time to reach out to them.

123
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:19,830
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, the Anderson Middle School without having this any sooner, you know what I mean, than just receiving it over the weekend.

124
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:27,322
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wasn't sure if that was something that you were thinking about or, you know, I wasn't sure.

125
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go into Blick personally, and they said they had never heard of that program.

126
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:34,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone did make me aware that this program exists.

127
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,985
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is something I'm still exploring.

128
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:43,486
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a membership to extras for creative reuse, which I recommend for all the art teachers.

129
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:43,986
[SPEAKER_05]: $80 for the year.

130
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go in 10 times and take as much as you want.

131
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone in and gotten a lot of tile that we'll be incorporating into the mosaic.

132
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:56,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We also use that for the art show, and we're using that for our science night, so it really cuts our supply costs.

133
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm doing as much as I can to mitigate the costs, but there will be some.

134
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:01,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

135
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:14,296
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you know if the Andrews Middle School has any supplies left over from their art mural, even if it was paintbrushes that could be shared between the schools?

136
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:19,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not sure if that's something that's possible, but I was thinking of recycling some of the supplies.

137
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,334
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually not painting.

138
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:24,376
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a tile mosaic and will be grouted.

139
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:29,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I can certainly reach out to them, see if they have any extra supplies.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely reach out as far as I can.

141
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, I can attest that I reach far and wide.

142
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:37,665
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

143
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:38,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

144
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:38,786
[SPEAKER_25]: Van der Kloot.

145
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:44,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I just wanted to ask one question about the timing of this project again.

146
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,172
[SPEAKER_25]: When were you hoping to do it with the kids?

147
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,422
[SPEAKER_05]: We have already begun the brainstorming.

148
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:52,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the voting.

149
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be unveiled on May the 26th.

150
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:59,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bills will be in the two to three weeks prior to that.

151
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:10,009
[SPEAKER_25]: So this means if the committee approves my motion that the superintendent needs to review as quickly as possible so that we can put this on the fast track.

152
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:22,501
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of an up to $800 expenditure for art supplies for the mosaic, seconded by Mrs. Carey.

153
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to speak on this?

154
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else that wants to speak on this particular topic?

155
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:26,886
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

156
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:28,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

157
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:29,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval.

158
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:30,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call, please.

159
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:37,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

160
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

161
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:41,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

162
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have invitations for the... Oh, great.

163
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:44,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

164
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,895
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe there are others in the audience that would like to speak on public participation.

165
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:51,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.

166
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:52,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Your name, please.

167
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:53,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Angela Moore.

168
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?

169
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:55,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Angela Moore.

170
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

171
00:08:56,623 --> 00:09:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, and thank you to the school committee and the mayor and Mr. Superintendent for allowing me to speak.

172
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice to see some new faces in the crowd.

173
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it recently came to my attention that Superintendent Belson's contract is due to expire in June of 2017.

174
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:18,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the first question I have is if Mr. Belson, do you plan on retiring or are you planning on seeking an extension of your contract?

175
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I've made no decision at this time and that's up to the committee.

176
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:27,290
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I'm ready to make a decision and the committee is ready to make a decision, we'll do that.

177
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,352
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's no decision at this time.

178
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,556
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's understandable.

179
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:35,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like the process of selecting a new superintendent, it's a lengthy one.

180
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:42,499
[SPEAKER_03]: In order for it to be carried out properly, a search committee should be convened before the 2016 school year ends.

181
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:50,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's imperative that the time over the summer is not wasted and that the process is started before the start of the 2016-2017 school year.

182
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, if you are planning on retiring, a candidate would be able to work throughout the school year with you to ease the transition.

183
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:07,328
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't plan on retiring, then there's been some issues and concerns that have been in the forefront this school year and they should be addressed.

184
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:18,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I think throughout the recent mayoral election it became evident that the citizens of Medford really expressed a strong desire for change and to move beyond the status quo that's been governing our city.

185
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:24,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That same desire for change and to eradicate stagnation extends to the school system as well.

186
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:30,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford public school system, the students, and the parents do not exist within these chambers.

187
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:37,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You, the school committee members, need to reach out to the constituents you represent and determine the future they want for Medford schools.

188
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: This job mandates that you act in the best interest of the school system and the students it educates, and that decisions made regarding the schools are made with input from the community.

189
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking each of you to do your research regarding what the citizens want and to be proactive rather than reactive.

190
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,217
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to filling the position of superintendent.

191
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, and since time is of the essence, I would like to suggest that a transparent succession plan be in place by June of this year, 2016.

192
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

193
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:08,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

194
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:13,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak during public participation?

195
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Hearing, seeing none, close that portion.

196
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,367
[SPEAKER_17]: for Zoom to reports.

197
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent would like to make an announcement in regards to an event that occurred today at Medford High School.

198
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

199
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,433
[SPEAKER_12]: With us is the headmaster of the high school, Dr. Perrella.

200
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:38,816
[SPEAKER_12]: This morning, as you know, you were notified that there was a bomb scare sent to Medford High School by robocall.

201
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:43,258
[SPEAKER_12]: This was also sent to many other schools in the area, including Somerville City Hall.

202
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,460
[SPEAKER_12]: There are at least 10 other school districts.

203
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I provided you with a handout from one of the,

204
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,368
[SPEAKER_12]: newspaper outlets as well.

205
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the high school handled it exceptionally well.

206
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,193
[SPEAKER_12]: They did everything that was according to their protocol.

207
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,554
[SPEAKER_12]: You have the report in front of you.

208
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:05,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Local police and fire officials were on hand to assist with the sweep of the building.

209
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:06,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Students were kept in place.

210
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:14,444
[SPEAKER_12]: When stabilization took place, students and faculty were notified, and a robocall went out to parents in the community very quickly.

211
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:15,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Perrella is here.

212
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:19,228
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to answer any questions that he has and that you may have for him.

213
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:20,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Brown.

214
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:28,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, could you go over the timeline of the events of this morning, please?

215
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course.

216
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning at approximately 7.45, I received a phone call.

217
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:39,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote an automated phone call, repeating in a loop, a bomb has been placed in the building.

218
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, the background of the call itself had music in it, so when we listened to it for a few times, it kept repeating itself.

219
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:52,413
[SPEAKER_02]: After receiving the call, we had immediately called together the leadership team.

220
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:56,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We informed the police departments and the fire departments of the issue.

221
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:00,976
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, we went immediately into a stay-in-place mode at the high school.

222
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something we practiced a few times over the past few weeks, so it kind of worked good as far as we were prepared for this.

223
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:16,171
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into the state of place, we administrated a sweep of the building in conjunction with the police and fire departments.

224
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,577
[SPEAKER_02]: secure the exterior of the building and stay in place.

225
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:20,458
[SPEAKER_02]: All the doors are locked.

226
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:24,862
[SPEAKER_02]: All students remain inside the classroom until further told what to do.

227
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,305
[SPEAKER_02]: The sweep lasted for about 35 minutes.

228
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone call itself was extremely vague.

229
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't mention a time, a place, a motive, or even the building.

230
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It just basically said a bomb has been placed in the building.

231
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,057
[SPEAKER_02]: At the conclusion of the sweep, we

232
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:46,069
[SPEAKER_02]: met as a team after we notified the building that this had taken place.

233
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:54,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We notified the students and the faculty separately, one over the intercom, and also emailed to the faculty with a little bit more detail of the situation.

234
00:13:54,992 --> 00:14:00,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we've completed those steps, I made a phone call to the community, also to express what had happened.

235
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:05,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So what time do you think the duration of the whole thing?

236
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:11,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we received the phone call, we went immediately into stay-in-place.

237
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the beginning of period one, so before the period ended, within 50 minutes, we had completed the entire process.

238
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:18,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

239
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a question.

240
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right at arrival time, isn't it, that you got that call?

241
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:27,111
[SPEAKER_02]: The call came immediately after announcements were made.

242
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:27,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

243
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's right when students were getting into period one class.

244
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so it wasn't while you were trying to bring children in.

245
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:38,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm glad for that because that could just make it more difficult to secure all the areas.

246
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:42,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the follow-up and following the procedure.

247
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate through you to

248
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:54,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that the quickness in response to letting all community members know.

249
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That is imperative.

250
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:59,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We learned that from the last situation that we just went through.

251
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So we actually put in place what we had hoped to.

252
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that some parents wanted us to put a timeline to how quickly we were going to

253
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is actually earlier than any timeline that we would have put in place.

254
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hate to put a number on people when they're dealing with crisis situations.

255
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is exactly how it's supposed to work.

256
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:26,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm grateful that there was no bombs, and that our children and our staff were saved.

257
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, I'm glad the protocol works, and thank you, headmaster.

258
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:34,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

259
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:35,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandeput.

260
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:46,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Dr. Perrella, we, the school committee, were concerned and expressed our concern about the possibility of some students being very nervous once they were informed or uncomfortable.

261
00:15:46,332 --> 00:16:00,576
[SPEAKER_25]: And I am curious whether, in fact, any parents came up to get students, and these students expressed the desire to go home, or whether any students were particularly bothered by this information and how you followed up.

262
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did receive a few parent calls asking for clarification just to sort of check in and see what the status was and if they could get any more information.

263
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:22,735
[SPEAKER_02]: All the parents were pretty happy with what had taken place as far as the communication and were, after the conclusion of the phone call, they felt that the building was secure and the students were safe.

264
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:28,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The students did not, I did not get any reports of students that did any sort of counseling.

265
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:41,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I was under the impression when part of the communication to the faculty was sort of to model the calmness and patience and sort of that we had things under control and now we just continue with the day as usual.

266
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't experience any disruption in the day.

267
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:45,189
[SPEAKER_25]: Great, thank you.

268
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:45,830
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

269
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry.

270
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,312
[SPEAKER_17]: You agree?

271
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:49,612
Okay.

272
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:51,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

273
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:51,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Kurtz?

274
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:58,727
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I just wanted to say that I did speak with a couple of parents, including my son.

275
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:04,828
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of his friends said that the message was very calm, and that all the students were very calm.

276
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:08,729
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was a very well-recorded message.

277
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,710
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people were really impressed with the very calmness in your tone.

278
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,351
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was a really good message.

279
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:18,592
[SPEAKER_19]: And the students were very, I guess because of the training,

280
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:23,967
[SPEAKER_19]: They weren't nervous, because I had asked my son, were kids nervous?

281
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:24,787
[SPEAKER_19]: And he said, no.

282
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody was very calm.

283
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything was very, you know, they were notified.

284
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,689
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to share that I received some positive feedback on the message.

285
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:34,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

286
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:35,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

287
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Dr. Perla.

288
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

289
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:41,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, Mr. Benedetto.

290
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:51,174
[SPEAKER_09]: When we set the protocols in place, we also said that within 24 hours we would get a completed update to parents.

291
00:17:51,635 --> 00:18:04,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's any additional information for parents to know, like maybe just, I don't know, an email or I don't know how you do it best, just say, you know, today was a good day, we had no further threats.

292
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:12,727
[SPEAKER_09]: But we, in the protocol, we said if they had more details, we would follow up after the initial, letting them know there is a situation.

293
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:17,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And once you had more details, you would follow up within the next day, by the next day.

294
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:21,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you just look into that and just make sure that all protocols are followed all the way through?

295
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:23,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

296
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,273
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, or even have a public relations person put out something that would be helpful.

297
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:37,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as an aside, I had spoken to a few colleagues at different school systems, including Melrose.

298
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:47,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And my phone rang as well immediately after I made the robo call from Melrose's school, basically saying the same thing that happened in his school department.

299
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So I contacted their administrator, and we had a conversation about it as well.

300
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a lot of communication among schools.

301
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

302
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:55,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

303
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, it's a new normal right now.

304
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

305
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:01,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Moved by Ms.

306
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanderbilt, seconded by Ms.

307
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:03,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuno.

308
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:04,404
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

309
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:05,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

310
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:05,905
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

311
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:06,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

312
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:12,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Presentation by Medford Public Library Youth Services Librarian.

313
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:12,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

314
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Fednik, please step forward.

315
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,430
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

316
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing well, thank you.

317
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:20,712
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Sam Sednick.

318
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I am the head of youth services at Medford Public Library.

319
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:30,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was asked here today because we'd like to start a bit of a partnership between the public library and the schools.

320
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:37,000
[SPEAKER_16]: In particular, right now our drive is to try and get every child a library card.

321
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,182
[SPEAKER_16]: And, ooh, sorry guys, I'm gonna make computers work.

322
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:44,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

323
00:19:56,302 --> 00:20:05,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to give a very condensed kind of rundown on why I think it would be really great to have every kid have a card, and every teacher for that matter.

324
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:18,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I know for a fact that Medford Public Schools have wonderful library facilities in all of their elementary schools and their middle school and their high school, but the library can't give you additional materials without

325
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,510
[SPEAKER_16]: costing you anything, really.

326
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:34,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford Public Library is part of the larger Mass Board of Library Commission, and as such, we have a lot of databases and online research tools available to your students.

327
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:39,506
[SPEAKER_16]: And the only thing they need to access these databases is a library card.

328
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:47,412
[SPEAKER_16]: And so just kind of a general run on why we feel that the databases are very important.

329
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:54,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time I have a conversation with a child about how they do their research, this is the answer I get.

330
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:56,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone goes to Google.

331
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:56,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I use Google.

332
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,500
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great.

333
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:01,424
[SPEAKER_16]: But Google really isn't the end all for research.

334
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:05,067
[SPEAKER_16]: And in general, it's not really the best place for research.

335
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:15,913
[SPEAKER_16]: If I'm doing a lazy Google search, and you can see up at the top I typed in Martin Luther King Forgot the Junior and just pushed enter, the first thing that's going to come up is Wikipedia.

336
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:26,158
[SPEAKER_16]: The next thing that's going to come up is something called martinlutherking.org, a true historical examination, which seems super legitimate.

337
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:29,719
[SPEAKER_16]: So I might use that on my research.

338
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,300
[SPEAKER_16]: And off to the side, you can see more Wikipedia stuff.

339
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,401
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm going to go to the .org site.

340
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:35,281
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an organization.

341
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,661
[SPEAKER_16]: It must be good information, right?

342
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, this is martinlutherking.org.

343
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:46,025
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm a little suspicious when it's like rap lyrics.

344
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:49,507
[SPEAKER_16]: and whatnot.

345
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:53,570
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I ask kids is, how do we know if this is good information or not?

346
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:58,593
[SPEAKER_16]: And the answer is always, we have to know who writes it.

347
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:03,117
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we do a little searching around on this website, we can find that it is hosted by Stormfront.

348
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:10,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're not 100% sure what that means, you can find out that if you click on it, you end up at White Pride Worldwide.

349
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:16,307
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is the third search you get when you type in Martin Luther King into Google.

350
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:29,733
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we like to do at our library is trying to get kids to learn how to research, to learn how to use the tools that are available to them, and to be better at getting good information.

351
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:45,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Our website is www.medfordlibrary.org, and if you hover over children, you're gonna see all sorts of things, from our news and events to book lists, but the really important one is our youth electronic resources.

352
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:50,888
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a page that has everything from pre-K all the way down to 8th grade.

353
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,830
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have one for the teens on the teen section.

354
00:22:54,451 --> 00:23:11,424
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has things like Encyclopedia Britannica, Kids InfoBits, OverDrive, TumbleBooks, and these are all resources that instead of just Google popularity search, are giving you vetted and factually accurate information when you do your searches with them.

355
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,374
[SPEAKER_16]: For example, this is Britannica.

356
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:18,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Britannica lets you kind of come in at whatever level you're at.

357
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:24,557
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to have the elementary Britannica, they make it super cute and make it super easy to read.

358
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:30,800
[SPEAKER_16]: If you have a slightly older kid, they can come in at a medium level for the middle school.

359
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:36,389
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, of course, the high school level is pretty much the adult Britannica.

360
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:45,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Britannica has a dictionary built in, so if kids don't understand words, they can double-click on them, and it will define them right there on the page.

361
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:49,253
[SPEAKER_16]: It has reading levels, so if a kid is struggling, they can move it down or up.

362
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:52,054
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes the information super accessible.

363
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,034
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all right there.

364
00:23:53,154 --> 00:24:01,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, you don't have to worry about tripping off into, like, an unfortunate website when you are accessing the information through Britannica.

365
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:15,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Better yet, Britannica is free because the Mass Board of Library Commissioners have paid for that for us, and so as long as a child has a library card, they have access to the entire encyclopedia online through our website.

366
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,413
[SPEAKER_16]: There are other really great resources.

367
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:23,758
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Biography in Context, and if you look over to the far side, I know it's really hard to see with the tiny, tiny print,

368
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:34,008
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see that there are 1,400 newspaper articles, there's podcasts in there, there's videos in there, there's primary sources.

369
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:38,232
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really just a wonderful site with fantastic information.

370
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:44,178
[SPEAKER_16]: And I understand that at the high school level that you guys have Gmail accounts for students.

371
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:54,088
[SPEAKER_16]: The Gale databases will let the kids sign in with their Google accounts and make highlighted notes that will save automatically onto their drive.

372
00:24:54,969 --> 00:25:02,557
[SPEAKER_16]: So it makes their research super easy, citations are right at the bottom, and it helps out when they're doing their projects.

373
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:10,098
[SPEAKER_16]: So we also have electronic books, we have audio books, and we have free streaming media, including videos.

374
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,859
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of this is available, again, with just a library card.

375
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:21,281
[SPEAKER_16]: The last thing I wanted to highlight here is we pay for something called Mango Languages, which is a language learning software program.

376
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:24,702
[SPEAKER_16]: There are 71 languages that you can pick and choose to learn.

377
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:29,923
[SPEAKER_16]: My favorite one is How to Speak Like a Pirate, but there are legitimate languages in there as well.

378
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:33,944
[SPEAKER_16]: But they also have English for other learners.

379
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:38,926
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are all of the different examples for your English language learners.

380
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:47,910
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you have someone who is speaking Portuguese in their home, they might be able to use this website to get a little extra English practice on the side.

381
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the only thing they're going to need is that library card.

382
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,993
[SPEAKER_16]: So my proposal, honestly, is that we

383
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:01,757
[SPEAKER_16]: on your school supply list that you print public library card.

384
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:07,239
[SPEAKER_16]: We are more than happy to, all summer long, make sure that we work getting all the kids' cards.

385
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:21,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And then next school year, if your teachers wanted to use all of these resources in their classroom, they could just get that 14-digit number off the back of their students' cards and use it in your schools at no cost to anyone.

386
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:24,688
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, we'd like to make

387
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:35,555
[SPEAKER_16]: better, stronger relations with all of your students so that they feel comfortable coming to us when they need a little extra research help or, you know, the next novel that they want to read.

388
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:35,916
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

389
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:38,858
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

390
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:39,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Sam.

391
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:41,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

392
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Cugno was first.

393
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

394
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the presentation.

395
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,042
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is absolutely wonderful.

396
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:52,786
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always wonderful to see other avenues for our students to learn.

397
00:26:53,587 --> 00:27:06,317
[SPEAKER_18]: My question to you is that, is there a way of, instead of like our students somehow, because it is difficult for some students, especially the younger ones to come to the library sometimes because their parents are working or things like that.

398
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:19,714
[SPEAKER_18]: if it's possible for our students to sign up for the card in the classroom and then somehow get that list to the library, set up the library cards and somehow distribute them back to the classroom.

399
00:27:58,062 --> 00:28:07,067
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wasn't asking for all the kids in the classroom, all the students in the school at once, but let's say we had a particular first grade or a particular kindergarten.

400
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:13,250
[SPEAKER_18]: If, let's say, the teacher came to get those applications prior to having the students come to the library.

401
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:22,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so there is a different way of doing it rather than everybody coming to the library separately.

402
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:28,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so if we could get that information out to our teachers, that would be great.

403
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:32,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

404
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:32,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

405
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:09,348
[SPEAKER_11]: They even give it to their English teachers at every grade level and show that we have a strong website and know how much we can do to help our faculty in this industry.

406
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:55,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bell, sir, is there a way that we can work on a school-wide, a district-wide program to get every child in Method Public Schools a library card?

407
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,192
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a good, it's a great idea.

408
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:01,456
[SPEAKER_12]: It's another example of how the city and school work together under the mayor's leadership.

409
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:04,199
[SPEAKER_12]: So the reality is that, sure, we can make it happen.

410
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:08,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can, good idea about putting it part of the registration.

411
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:11,990
[SPEAKER_12]: We can move that along and we're electronic so we can pass it to them.

412
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we could have it in different languages so that parents who English isn't their first language, that they understand what they're signing.

413
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if they got a temporary library card and had to go to the library to get the actual one.

414
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:30,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way it reminds them, oh, and they bring something home and say, I have my library card.

415
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to go to the library kind of thing.

416
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:38,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And they get points or extra credit or however we need to get them in the door and show them what we have to offer.

417
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,580
[SPEAKER_12]: All that's possible, and it's all good ideas.

418
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we set up a program?

419
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:47,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we identify someone in the school district to work on this program?

420
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

421
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:48,982
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

422
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:51,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And can we set a timeline for this to happen?

423
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:55,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we certainly would work on it this spring, and then have it ready going into the next school year.

424
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:55,843
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

425
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:57,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be great.

426
00:30:57,643 --> 00:30:58,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

427
00:30:58,383 --> 00:30:59,884
[SPEAKER_09]: You put in parent information as well?

428
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:03,444
[SPEAKER_12]: We put in parent information and things of that sort as well.

429
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,885
[SPEAKER_16]: You got shut off, I think.

430
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:22,406
[SPEAKER_16]: The library has gone out to several PTO meetings and done this workshop at Columbus and Brooks and Roberts, and so most of the principals have already gone through my run on databases before.

431
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:29,712
[SPEAKER_08]: public school, like how many students, how many people have library cards, how many children?

432
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:33,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh goodness, not off the top of my head, I don't.

433
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:37,057
[SPEAKER_16]: We do keep statistics on that so I could, I could figure that out for you.

434
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:46,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we can work with the liaison from the schools and see what percentage we're at and then do a drive or do a sign up and then see how successful it was.

435
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:51,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, and if we can get, the hottest children to get are the ones who's, you know,

436
00:31:51,755 --> 00:32:05,118
[SPEAKER_09]: whose parents are working two jobs, or English isn't their first language, and we don't want to ignore those children, so we want to have a list of who we're missing, and really follow up, and really make sure children in Method have this opportunity.

437
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:10,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that way they don't even have to go to the library, they can read books from there.

438
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:13,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of families don't have the money or the time to go there.

439
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:20,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And if a child gets to read a book when they're bored instead of playing on a computer, it might be a, you know, it's a win or a fault.

440
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:23,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, they are using the computer to read.

441
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:29,851
[SPEAKER_12]: As you see from your packet, you also have museum passes and other things too, so it's not just resources.

442
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:30,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

443
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:32,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry.

444
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Mayor, through you to the superintendent,

445
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:42,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask that we look at May as a starting point and perhaps our director of public information to get out a press release to local press.

446
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:53,018
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we put something on our school website urging parents that their children don't have a library guide, May is the time to sign up so that they'll be able to use it all during the summer.

447
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:57,222
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of enrichment, a lot of great things happen at the library.

448
00:32:57,302 --> 00:33:04,129
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great way to probably partnership with the children's library and we can work in unison to get the message out across the community.

449
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:13,710
[SPEAKER_12]: We can certainly do all that and we can certainly hype it, you know, over the next several months so that going into the fall is even more robust.

450
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:18,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that we take the word can up and we'll do it and get it done as soon as possible.

451
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:23,234
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a great resource on High Street and I think a lot of children should take advantage of it.

452
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:24,795
[SPEAKER_15]: We think it's a great idea.

453
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:25,683
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

454
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,224
[SPEAKER_25]: Van der Kloot.

455
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:33,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Sam, I was just curious about how many classrooms come to visit the library.

456
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:43,857
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that my daughters receive library cards when they came in that we had to sign in advance and they went down to the library and they were all so excited and they came home with their library card.

457
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:51,343
[SPEAKER_25]: So how many, you know, is there schools who send all their first graders or

458
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:53,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, how does it exist now?

459
00:33:53,889 --> 00:34:00,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I sent an email out to the principals in about March and invite them to come visit us.

460
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:07,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say at this point we're getting maybe three quarters of the kindergartners, half the first graders, and McGlynn third graders.

461
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:14,726
[SPEAKER_16]: coming in during the May-June time to have library tours and get cards if they don't have them.

462
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:20,569
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is a good chunk of kids already kind of just making their way there with the schools, but it is not all of them.

463
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,632
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we'd like to snag the rest.

464
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:26,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

465
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:44,392
[SPEAKER_25]: And probably, I mean, part of it always is the cost of transportation, the buses, but it would seem that it might make a whole lot of sense, and again, it's just the cost of the transportation, but to do a drive, I mean, there's been some good suggestions here about other ways to do it.

466
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:48,456
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that there is value in getting the kid actually into the library.

467
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:50,897
[SPEAKER_25]: and having you talk to them.

468
00:34:51,937 --> 00:35:03,841
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that I'd like to also throw about and discuss the possibility of making it consistent, like in the fifth grade, all the fifth graders go

469
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,322
[SPEAKER_25]: on some field trips.

470
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:10,127
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, maybe this should be the field trip for all the kindergartners or first graders or whatever.

471
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:20,598
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just want to think about that as a potential, too, so that it's not just this kid at this school, but this is one of the things that the Medford public schools do.

472
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:21,759
[SPEAKER_25]: All kids are going to go to

473
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,640
[SPEAKER_25]: visit the Medford Public Library.

474
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,004
[SPEAKER_25]: And I, of course, am understanding your timing, you know, before the summer, so that they've got the resources during the summer.

475
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:35,908
[SPEAKER_25]: We might not be able to get all of those kids to do it, but maybe if we look at that towards the future, it would make a lot of sense.

476
00:35:36,528 --> 00:35:42,632
[SPEAKER_25]: Lastly, Sam, I just would like to thank you for your incredible energy and enthusiasm that you bring to everything that you do at the library.

477
00:35:43,493 --> 00:35:45,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

478
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:45,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

479
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:45,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Cugno.

480
00:35:47,995 --> 00:36:01,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to get some clarification because everything that everyone has said here tonight, my colleagues, the drive and getting everyone registered, it sounds wonderful, but I also want to make sure that we don't get everything up on our side and bombard you on the other side.

481
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:11,723
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it sounds great that we have, you know, we'll sign up our students and have them register, but I also want to make sure that you have the manpower on your side to keep up.

482
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,583
[SPEAKER_18]: with those cards.

483
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:16,364
[SPEAKER_18]: So as my colleague has said, Ms.

484
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Koot has said, try to get our students into the library.

485
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally agree with that.

486
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:24,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe if it's a little bit more difficult for our younger students, totally understand.

487
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:33,231
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think in all, to see the whole picture, I think it's actually better if we could try to get at least our third graders in, up into the library.

488
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,111
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to see everybody get into the library.

489
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:39,053
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to make sure, I don't want to promise anything on the school side.

490
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:44,354
[SPEAKER_18]: and say, it's great, we're going to do a drive, we'll stop registering everybody under the sun.

491
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:49,856
[SPEAKER_18]: And then on the flip side of that, not have the manpower to keep up with that.

492
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:56,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Because what's going to happen to us is that we're going to start getting phone calls saying, I signed up for the library card, where is it?

493
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:58,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been waiting for it, where did it go?

494
00:36:58,778 --> 00:36:59,578
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened to it?

495
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:00,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

496
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we don't...

497
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:03,136
[SPEAKER_18]: mail out library cards.

498
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:10,179
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but I don't want our kids and their parents that sign up through us thinking something like that.

499
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:10,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

500
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, um, my, my one hope would be that if they do sign up through you, those forms just go straight to us.

501
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:22,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, we, um, I've already talked to our, our, our new director as of today.

502
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:25,127
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, we do have an announcement to make.

503
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:25,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

504
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:29,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Barbara Kerr has been named the director of the library effective today.

505
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:29,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

506
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:30,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

507
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:42,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have assessed how many library cards we have and we're confident that we could pull through with the kids that are not registered currently.

508
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam, I want to thank you for coming out tonight.

509
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:55,006
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm really excited about the library card plan.

510
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:56,667
[SPEAKER_19]: And we talked about it a couple of weeks ago.

511
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:03,474
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just love the idea of promoting the literacy and the community participation at the library.

512
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:11,902
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was some ideas that we talked about possibly for having maybe, and I don't know if something like this would be possible to have,

513
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:27,843
[SPEAKER_19]: maybe like an orientation night at the McGlynn School where Sam could go there and do a presentation for the middle schools one night or for the elementary schools so that the parents could take their children and maybe possibly watch the orientation.

514
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:37,995
[SPEAKER_19]: or have something at the high school, at the Karen Theater, after hours, something in the evening for parents and students to go.

515
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:45,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Even if they didn't get their application at registration time, they could get one at that time, pick it up.

516
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:53,714
[SPEAKER_19]: but I definitely think it should be part of the new, um, or this year's orientation folder.

517
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:59,180
[SPEAKER_19]: And if possible, I agree with Bob scary that we should try to implement it as soon as possible.

518
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:01,782
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, once again, thank you.

519
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,023
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just really excited.

520
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:03,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

521
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:07,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you on the motion that

522
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:14,129
[SPEAKER_17]: application be put in the new student packet, that it be also be put down in the Parent Information Center.

523
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:17,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe school libraries as well have applications.

524
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:21,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of the great suggestions that were made around the rail on that motion.

525
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:22,759
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

526
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,200
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

527
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

528
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:26,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Ms.

529
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:26,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Sedney.

530
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:45,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Our next item, recommendation to approve donation of a records board to Medford High School pool.

531
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:45,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

532
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:47,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Judge.

533
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:55,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

534
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:55,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

535
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:56,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, how are you?

536
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:56,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Good, thanks.

537
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:57,579
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing?

538
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:58,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Good, thank you.

539
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:05,784
[SPEAKER_21]: The Feely family have their, this family's been in Medford for three generations at least.

540
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:06,865
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, four?

541
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:08,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Been a while.

542
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:09,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

543
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:16,094
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been through the school systems, and they're all athletes.

544
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,541
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the past, I want to say,

545
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:31,934
[SPEAKER_21]: almost, yeah, 20 years plus, the Feeley-Feelmey has been donating scholarships, athletic scholarships, to the school, to Bedford High.

546
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:42,340
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Feeley-Feelmey approached me a couple of years ago and asked me, knowing that the pool was coming back online, what could we

547
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,588
[SPEAKER_21]: use, and I said, a record board.

548
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,211
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we've been researching the record board.

549
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:52,333
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been going around, and actually we found one in Cambridge, Virginia Latin.

550
00:40:53,434 --> 00:41:01,541
[SPEAKER_21]: And I contacted the designer, and they came up with a record board for us.

551
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,782
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to pass that out for you.

552
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:22,057
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Philly family has been so supportive with our schools and just everything.

553
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:29,022
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is going to be more of a permanent reminder that there's family around and they are willing to help us.

554
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:31,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful.

555
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:34,316
[SPEAKER_17]: This is such a fabulous gesture on behalf of your family.

556
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:35,397
[SPEAKER_17]: We really appreciate it.

557
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's so needed.

558
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:39,119
[SPEAKER_17]: The swim team is dying to get this up, I'm sure.

559
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:39,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

560
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Jerry Powell.

561
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,581
[SPEAKER_21]: She's the matriarch.

562
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:45,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And the whole family's out there?

563
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:46,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

564
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much on behalf of the city and the school department.

565
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:55,349
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to say, none of this would be possible without Mary, because I just asked her.

566
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,370
[SPEAKER_11]: She has been working on this.

567
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:05,809
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor by Ms.

568
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot, seconded and third.

569
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:10,334
[SPEAKER_17]: I think everybody, we all would like to sign on to this.

570
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

571
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:12,317
[SPEAKER_17]: We really appreciate it.

572
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, please.

573
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:17,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, Mr. Skerry.

574
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

575
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:39,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion approved.

576
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:44,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

577
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:47,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

578
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,052
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was honored to

579
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:58,346
[SPEAKER_15]: to be a member with Kevin of the first grade class at the Franklin School, and John, Kevin and I went to high school together.

580
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,550
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've always been there for the athletes and the students, and we really appreciate it.

581
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:03,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

582
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:04,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

583
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:10,598
[SPEAKER_17]: The next item, recommendation to approve student trip to Italy, April 2017.

584
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:11,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Carlos.

585
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:11,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

586
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:30,510
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, I'm Rita DiCarlo from the news director and I'm here tonight to request your approval for a trip, student trip to Italy in April, during April vacation of 2017.

587
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:41,019
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had many trips in the past and these trips have a huge impact on students by expanding their horizons.

588
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:50,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Students who have participated in these trips in the past return with a much larger and in-depth understanding of the world around them.

589
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:58,114
[SPEAKER_23]: They all say that it's a life-changing experience and talk about the positive impact on their lives.

590
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:09,212
[SPEAKER_23]: For this next trip that we're planning, we are planning to have Miss Nicole Chalfon, an Italian teacher, to be the lead teacher.

591
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:14,014
[SPEAKER_23]: She was a chaperone on our last trip to France and Italy in April of 2015.

592
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:25,679
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're going to use the same agency they were used in 2015, because we were very happy, very pleased with the value they gave us.

593
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:37,863
[SPEAKER_23]: For 2017, we've put together an exciting trip where students will visit three of Italy's major cities, namely Venice, Florence, and Rome.

594
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:44,645
[SPEAKER_23]: And additionally, they will visit the city of Siena, Pompeii, and Sorrento.

595
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:48,986
[SPEAKER_23]: You have the full itinerary in the packet that I gave you.

596
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:53,087
[SPEAKER_23]: And if I can answer any questions for you, I'll be glad to do that.

597
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I ask just a quick question from the floor?

598
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:56,008
[SPEAKER_17]: From the chair, sorry.

599
00:44:56,555 --> 00:45:00,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there cancellation insurance included in this, just in case?

600
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:08,706
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to require students to purchase the cancellation insurance, cancel for any reason insurance, and it's an extra $100.

601
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:10,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good, thank you.

602
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry.

603
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:20,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you to Mr. Kowal, are there any scholarships available if a student wanted to go and couldn't fully pay the fees?

604
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,133
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't have anything.

605
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:38,579
[SPEAKER_23]: We tried to do fundraising a few years ago, and to tell you the truth, what we made isn't worth the trouble, even if you make, you know,

606
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:45,116
[SPEAKER_23]: $4,000 it comes to about $100 a student when parents are spending that much.

607
00:45:48,158 --> 00:45:48,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

608
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,443
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know where we could get funds for that, but thanks.

609
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:54,284
[SPEAKER_25]: A couple questions.

610
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,667
[SPEAKER_25]: I couldn't quite figure out what the cost of the trip would be.

611
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,508
[SPEAKER_25]: It's around $4,000.

612
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:58,908
[SPEAKER_25]: It's expensive.

613
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:07,895
[SPEAKER_25]: And also, I was curious, last time you went to both Italy and France.

614
00:46:08,315 --> 00:46:11,197
[SPEAKER_25]: This time you're doing a more in-depth trip in Italy.

615
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:13,158
[SPEAKER_25]: Was there any particular reason?

616
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Was that because of political concerns?

617
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:18,041
[SPEAKER_23]: Was that because just a desire to... Oh, that we're leaving France out?

618
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:19,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that what you're saying?

619
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:24,509
[SPEAKER_23]: 2015 was the first time that we did France.

620
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,933
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, the French teacher wanted to do a France trip.

621
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:33,520
[SPEAKER_23]: We didn't have enough students, so we figured we'd combine it with the Italian trip, and that's why we did that one.

622
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:37,204
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so this is strictly the Italian trip?

623
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:44,411
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to mention that I talked to my aunt.

624
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,633
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a flight attendant and she travels to Italy a lot.

625
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:52,479
[SPEAKER_19]: She said that this is an amazing trip and that it's something that if I could go, I should go.

626
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:56,302
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanted to say that I would love to go if you need a school committee member.

627
00:46:56,322 --> 00:47:04,670
[SPEAKER_19]: And she said for the students, and I agree that it's a trip of a lifetime for them before they go on their educational journey.

628
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,991
[SPEAKER_19]: or career journey after high school.

629
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:10,952
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's expensive, but it is a trip of a lifetime.

630
00:47:11,232 --> 00:47:17,953
[SPEAKER_19]: She said that the rates were actually reasonable with where they're going in the 10 days.

631
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:20,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Considering that it covers everything.

632
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,995
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a lot, but that's what you would pay.

633
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:25,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

634
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:26,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuno.

635
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:27,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

636
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:31,617
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of questions to start off with.

637
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:37,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I know last year you did the France and the Italy, but that was because the French teacher didn't have enough students.

638
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you already know how many students are interested?

639
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:45,686
[SPEAKER_23]: We had an interest meeting, and there were quite a few students that came to the meeting.

640
00:47:45,726 --> 00:47:49,027
[SPEAKER_23]: They were interested, about 40, over 40 students.

641
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:51,288
[SPEAKER_23]: 40 for the Italy tour?

642
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:52,929
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, but we don't know.

643
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:56,130
[SPEAKER_18]: How about for the French one, do you know?

644
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,971
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not doing a French one.

645
00:47:58,171 --> 00:48:00,452
[SPEAKER_23]: The French teacher is not, right.

646
00:48:00,572 --> 00:48:02,753
[SPEAKER_23]: She just had a baby, so she won't be able to travel.

647
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:07,979
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that the students that went last year had an absolute fabulous time.

648
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:12,304
[SPEAKER_18]: It was an experience of a lifetime, it really was.

649
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:17,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, what is the breakdown for students and chaperones?

650
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:18,468
[SPEAKER_18]: The price?

651
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:20,869
[SPEAKER_18]: No, breakdown as far as chaperones.

652
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:21,989
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I'm sorry.

653
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,951
[SPEAKER_23]: For each six students, we get one chaperone.

654
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,991
[SPEAKER_23]: So one chaperone per six students.

655
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:32,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you going to limit this to a max of numbers?

656
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:33,733
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

657
00:48:33,853 --> 00:48:40,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Last time, we had to limit it to, and we actually even went over what we wanted, 36 students.

658
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:46,417
[SPEAKER_23]: We probably had about 50 ready to pay with the checks, but we just couldn't take that many.

659
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,655
[SPEAKER_18]: and the students are going to, are they gonna miss, they're going to miss school on Friday?

660
00:48:52,995 --> 00:48:56,019
[SPEAKER_23]: They're gonna leave on Thursday night, but they'll miss Friday.

661
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:02,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that will be an excused absence, of course.

662
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:08,536
[SPEAKER_18]: And as the mayor asked, we definitely are going to get the insurance for all students.

663
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:15,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Is the insurance coming all from one place, or is it going to be like their own selection of wherever?

664
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:15,902
[SPEAKER_18]: All from one place.

665
00:49:15,982 --> 00:49:17,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the company.

666
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:20,025
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's great.

667
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:22,027
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a fabulous trip.

668
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:22,848
[SPEAKER_18]: It really is.

669
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:24,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

670
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:26,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

671
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:27,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

672
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:35,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, so I just want to explain really well to parents that the insurance might not cover 100%.

673
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:41,049
[SPEAKER_09]: With a previous trip, it covered like 75% of the cost.

674
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:51,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever those rules are, I just wanna highlight it with the parents so they understand that they are taking a risk, especially because the world is so volatile right now.

675
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:59,836
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's any reason that the school committee feels it's not safe and has to cancel that trip, then they're aware that they're responsible for the difference.

676
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:04,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We did make a one-time exception this year, but we wouldn't be able to do that again.

677
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:06,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

678
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:07,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

679
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:15,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. DiCarlo, thank you again for doing this for so many years and giving so many children this opportunity in their life to do it.

680
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:18,142
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a gift that they'll carry forever.

681
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Great teachers do great things.

682
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:22,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

683
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:25,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion on the floor by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

684
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:25,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

685
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:27,145
[SPEAKER_17]: All those, a roll call?

686
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:27,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

687
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:28,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

688
00:50:28,565 --> 00:50:28,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

689
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:28,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

690
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:30,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Benedetto.

691
00:50:30,826 --> 00:50:31,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

692
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:31,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

693
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:31,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Gray.

694
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

695
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:46,937
[SPEAKER_17]: The next paper is a report on the regional science and engineering fair, and we have Mr. Chieri in the audience, coordinator of science.

696
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:53,508
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, everyone.

697
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:59,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really happy to be here this evening to report on the Regional Science and Engineering Fair.

698
00:51:00,592 --> 00:51:08,876
[SPEAKER_20]: On March 12th, at Somerville High School, our students participated in the Region 4 Science and Engineering Fair.

699
00:51:08,896 --> 00:51:15,140
[SPEAKER_20]: There were over 103 projects presented at that fair, and we had some successes.

700
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:19,783
[SPEAKER_20]: Five, actually six students won

701
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:24,204
[SPEAKER_20]: a cash award and advancement to the state fair.

702
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:27,387
[SPEAKER_20]: One of those students came in second place.

703
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:39,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Because she came in second place at that fair, she was invited to participate at the International Science and Engineering Fair.

704
00:51:40,045 --> 00:51:42,126
[SPEAKER_20]: in Phoenix, Arizona in May.

705
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:46,087
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're tremendously excited about that.

706
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:48,668
[SPEAKER_20]: Is she in the audience?

707
00:51:48,788 --> 00:51:50,108
[SPEAKER_20]: She absolutely is.

708
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:55,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Ann Lee, could you come up with one of them?

709
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:07,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Anne's currently a high school senior.

710
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:13,526
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have any questions about the research she did, she is the expert.

711
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:16,328
[SPEAKER_20]: There's not much I can add.

712
00:52:16,388 --> 00:52:17,428
[SPEAKER_17]: If we could pronounce it, no.

713
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:21,631
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can get through the pronunciation, you're good.

714
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:30,536
[SPEAKER_20]: So she's here to answer any questions you have and also for your recognition.

715
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:32,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And could you highlight your project for us?

716
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:34,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, sure.

717
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

718
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

719
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:39,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry?

720
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:41,162
[SPEAKER_17]: In layman's terms.

721
00:52:42,803 --> 00:52:43,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, sure.

722
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:48,466
[SPEAKER_22]: So my project focuses on tuberculosis.

723
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:57,411
[SPEAKER_22]: So specifically focused on developing this method to be able to track bacterial viability.

724
00:52:57,972 --> 00:52:59,993
[SPEAKER_22]: And this bacteria is like non-virulent,

725
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:02,714
[SPEAKER_22]: So it obviously won't, you know, make me sick.

726
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:13,600
[SPEAKER_22]: But the reason why we want to study this bacteria is because there's been tons of cases where people have been developing drug-resistant tuberculosis.

727
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:17,543
[SPEAKER_22]: And so that's where people take the drugs, but they're not working.

728
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:27,543
[SPEAKER_22]: And so by studying this bacteria, we can be able to see how it grows and sort of the function, the structure, and what it does during the growth process.

729
00:53:27,563 --> 00:53:35,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And by doing so, hopefully we can be able to create more effective forms of treatment in the future for tuberculosis.

730
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know where you'll be going to college next year?

731
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:45,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, actually, I just committed this past weekend to WPI.

732
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations.

733
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:49,644
[SPEAKER_22]: That's wonderful.

734
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:51,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

735
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:54,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

736
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:59,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto, where did you get to do all of your lab work?

737
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:05,442
[SPEAKER_22]: I did it at Tufts University during the school year.

738
00:54:05,482 --> 00:54:05,922
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

739
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:09,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you think having science labs has helped you?

740
00:54:09,786 --> 00:54:17,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're one of the first students that have gone through having a few years with the new labs.

741
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:23,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's your experience been using them compared to what we used to have at the high school?

742
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so in freshman year, I was in biology class.

743
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:29,552
[SPEAKER_22]: And I remembered I had Ms.

744
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:30,032
[SPEAKER_22]: Ensign.

745
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:36,615
[SPEAKER_22]: And she always wanted to do all these labs with us, but she wasn't able to have the equipment to do it.

746
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:40,856
[SPEAKER_22]: So we had to always do handmade labs.

747
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:46,158
[SPEAKER_22]: But in this year, in senior year, I'm now in AP Bio.

748
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:48,859
[SPEAKER_22]: So we do, obviously, a lot more labs.

749
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:52,020
[SPEAKER_22]: But now we've even created tons more.

750
00:54:54,602 --> 00:55:00,806
[SPEAKER_22]: more sophisticated labs and studies with the equipment that we have right now.

751
00:55:00,946 --> 00:55:02,287
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's been really helpful.

752
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:11,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Even in the physics and the chemistry sort of areas, a lot of the students and a lot of my friends have been really complimenting the stuff that they can use now.

753
00:55:12,735 --> 00:55:14,216
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been very nice to have.

754
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you get to grow your bacteria in any of our hoods?

755
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I love those hoods.

756
00:55:18,938 --> 00:55:19,178
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

757
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:20,239
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

758
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:31,385
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to work on that, Mr. Cieri, and bring the Tufts people down, because I think our facility is just as nice, if not better, than some of theirs, if I'm not mistaken.

759
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:39,433
[SPEAKER_22]: We do some E. coli stuff, but it's kept on the down low so it doesn't create an epidemic or something in the school.

760
00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:40,795
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

761
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:41,575
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really great.

762
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:47,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your perspective on that, because as a committee, we worked really hard to see that happen.

763
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:50,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm so happy that you had the opportunity to use them.

764
00:55:51,506 --> 00:55:52,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Mr. Cieri.

765
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:06,122
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm wondering, Anne, whether in your award you were awarded money to help cover the cost of your travel to Arizona.

766
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:14,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe it's actually covered by Intel already, so it's all covered by them.

767
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,125
[SPEAKER_22]: That's fantastic.

768
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,947
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, my daughter went to WPI, and she absolutely loved it.

769
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:21,067
[SPEAKER_25]: Great place.

770
00:56:21,407 --> 00:56:22,128
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

771
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:22,368
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

772
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:23,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

773
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:27,146
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd like to present you with a citation if you could step forward.

774
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:37,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, the Metro Public Schools is proud to congratulate Ann Lee for achievement to the State Science Fair and International Science Fair 2016.

775
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:02,609
[SPEAKER_07]: th th th

776
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:27,906
[SPEAKER_25]: to the audience.

777
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:32,649
[SPEAKER_25]: We just want to be in the picture so that when she wins the Nobel Prize, we can say we remember when.

778
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:33,462
Okay.

779
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,432
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Mayor.

780
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:19,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Mayor.

781
00:59:22,397 --> 00:59:30,060
[SPEAKER_25]: It's also remarkable that so many of our students did well getting into the top 43 and being recognized with cash rewards.

782
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:42,563
[SPEAKER_25]: We met many of these students earlier, but it certainly would make sense for us to send out to them a letter of congratulations from the school committee for their achievement at the regional science fair.

783
00:59:43,323 --> 00:59:49,785
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember going many years ago, and to have this many Medford students is definitely a very welcome sight.

784
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,834
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations, Mr. Seery.

785
00:59:54,575 --> 01:00:01,081
[SPEAKER_20]: I also wanted to add one notable to this to introduce to the committee.

786
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:11,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week, I sent an email inviting President Monaco from Tufts University to our schools to speak on some of the work he's done.

787
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,071
[SPEAKER_20]: And he graciously accepted.

788
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,555
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to have an event on May 24 with the president

789
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:26,941
[SPEAKER_20]: Tufts University, who has been an extraordinary partner to the science department, but to so many other departments in our school system.

790
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:35,788
[SPEAKER_20]: We're really excited to have him come see the labs and also share some of his research with some of our students.

791
01:00:36,228 --> 01:00:37,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful.

792
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:37,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

793
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:38,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Seary.

794
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:48,711
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion that we send thank yous to, congratulations to all the students that succeeded in the science fair offered by Ms.

795
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:51,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

796
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:52,572
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

797
01:00:52,892 --> 01:00:53,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

798
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,132
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

799
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:54,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

800
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:56,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

801
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:56,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock on.

802
01:00:56,873 --> 01:00:57,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock on.

803
01:00:57,213 --> 01:01:03,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of the superintendent.

804
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:06,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Update on gender identity non-discrimination policy.

805
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:07,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

806
01:01:07,936 --> 01:01:10,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as you know,

807
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:16,763
[SPEAKER_12]: We passed a gender non-discrimination policy in 2013.

808
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:34,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And this past period of time, many organizations have come together to support additional legislation in the Massachusetts Statehouse to deal with all public facilities being available to transgender individuals.

809
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,684
[SPEAKER_12]: public schools are already covered.

810
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:52,869
[SPEAKER_12]: However, this issue is critical to us because as our young people go out into society and they go out into the world, we want to make sure that what they learn in school and what they experience in school is available to them in the larger world.

811
01:01:54,189 --> 01:01:55,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Our current policy is a good one.

812
01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:03,692
[SPEAKER_12]: So one way to reinforce it is to give our support to the ongoing legislation that is being proffered at the state house.

813
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:04,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally,

814
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:32,397
[SPEAKER_12]: The site council of the high school, working together with the Gay-Straight Alliance and others, has tried to put forth a survey, and will put forth a survey, to help youngsters identify, it's anonymous and it's voluntary, so that we can better serve them, and we can make sure that we have everything in place that is necessary to accommodate our students.

815
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:39,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And that it's important that we also accurately report to the state on the various mandated reports.

816
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:50,541
[SPEAKER_12]: You have the survey questions that are here, you have additional information, you have our gender policy from 2013, and you have pieces of the legislation that is at the state house.

817
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:56,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So I present this report to you this evening to make sure you're fully aware of what we're doing.

818
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:05,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we get your support to go forward and to make sure that we can speak with a very clear voice at the state level.

819
01:03:06,303 --> 01:03:12,085
[SPEAKER_12]: That the Medford School Committee and the city of Medford is in full support of all our youth, including our transgender youth.

820
01:03:12,545 --> 01:03:14,806
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd recommend that we approve this this evening.

821
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:23,008
[SPEAKER_12]: We have individuals in the audience tonight that headmasters here, I believe a couple of students were here and they're no longer here.

822
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, a couple of them occurred, okay.

823
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:32,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them for you, but I ask that you extend your support this evening.

824
01:03:35,253 --> 01:03:37,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to disclose that I am on the site council.

825
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,318
[SPEAKER_18]: I definitely support this.

826
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:47,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I am just not, I don't think I'm, it would be right for me to put the motion out there, but I definitely support this and I am on that particular site council.

827
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,268
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval by Ms.

828
01:03:49,308 --> 01:03:49,908
[SPEAKER_17]: DiVenedetto.

829
01:03:49,948 --> 01:03:51,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

830
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:52,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Ms.

831
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:53,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Kreatz and Ms.

832
01:03:53,272 --> 01:03:53,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Discari.

833
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:55,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote please.

834
01:03:57,256 --> 01:03:57,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

835
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,081
[SPEAKER_17]: He has seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

836
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:06,781
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

837
01:04:09,923 --> 01:04:13,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Next paper, recommendation to reaffirm Medford Public Schools drug and alcohol policy.

838
01:04:14,846 --> 01:04:31,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, at our last meeting, we talked about the substance abuse drug and alcohol policy of the Medford Public Schools and the new legislation, the Opiate Act, if you will, that was passed in the legislature this past month and signed by the governor.

839
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:40,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Clearly, all of us are concerned, and at our last meeting, at your request, you asked that we withhold posting it until we brought it to you back to your attention.

840
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:53,185
[SPEAKER_12]: This evening, I brought that policy back to you, and I've also added a few things to keep it consistent with the new act, and to clear up a few things that would be inconsistent with the actual act.

841
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:58,847
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, eliminate the term CASPAR, which is no longer the program of choice here in the Medford Public Schools.

842
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:06,870
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've tried to put this together for you, and with your support, we will post this on our web page.

843
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:20,334
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will wait for additional guidance from the state, from DESE, from DBH, and others to further update it based on the deliberations that they have as they go forward in carrying out the legislation.

844
01:05:20,815 --> 01:05:24,656
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the interim, it's important that we're compliant with the law that I'll be able to post.

845
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:28,197
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

846
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:36,978
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see that I've also attached legal advisories from Murphy, Hesse, Toomey, and Lane, who represents us in various areas of special education.

847
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:43,000
[SPEAKER_12]: But they're also an excellent source of information in almost any legal matter.

848
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:49,441
[SPEAKER_17]: There's actually a recommendation that the school approve the recommended changes, Mr. Thompson.

849
01:05:49,561 --> 01:05:53,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and then also we'd be able to post it consistent with the law.

850
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,799
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion on the floor by Mr. Skerry to approve.

851
01:05:57,699 --> 01:05:58,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

852
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:12,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Can there be something in the policy that has all of our teachers, coaches, and anyone supervising children throughout the district have to sign that they've read this policy and that kept on record?

853
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:18,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I also would like that for parents as well, that parents are made aware of the drug and alcohol policy.

854
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:21,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's just at the high school, but even junior high.

855
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:30,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it's a handbook or a part of their registration that they've signed, that they've read, this is such an important document throughout the district.

856
01:06:30,703 --> 01:06:43,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want signed by every coach, every teacher, every everyone that they have read and they understand the policies and they're going to take appropriate action for any happenings.

857
01:06:43,992 --> 01:06:48,675
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know at the high school, we have a very specific form that people sign.

858
01:06:48,775 --> 01:06:50,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Perrella can speak to that.

859
01:06:51,164 --> 01:06:58,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that handbooks are turned out to parents at the lower grade schools, and I'm not sure they have to sign off on these things.

860
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:06,027
[SPEAKER_12]: It will require that we take a little bit of time and explain, because some people are concerned when they sign something that they don't fully understand it.

861
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:11,388
[SPEAKER_12]: So with your permission, we'll do it over the next period of time.

862
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:17,090
[SPEAKER_12]: But it takes a little bit of time to explain these things to people, because just to put it in front of them and say, sign your name,

863
01:07:19,282 --> 01:07:23,545
[SPEAKER_12]: probably wouldn't work with any great degree of, let's say, effectiveness.

864
01:07:23,946 --> 01:07:30,631
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'd like to sort of do it in small groups with parents and work it through the schools that way so that over the next year everyone signs in.

865
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:37,256
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we need to take our time and make sure that, otherwise we're just going to have people signing their name, they're not going to read it.

866
01:07:37,456 --> 01:07:41,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Understanding it is probably not going to be a very high either in some cases.

867
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:45,362
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be some very diligent people who will, but it won't be widespread.

868
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:55,269
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as teachers, staff, co-teachers, any policy change should be sent to them and they should have to sign off, especially in regards to this.

869
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:09,220
[SPEAKER_09]: My last comment was about Method Overcoming Addiction is having an event this Sunday night at 6 o'clock at the Karen Theater, I believe.

870
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a second annual vigil.

871
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:12,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

872
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sunday night at the high school.

873
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to put that out to the community as a reminder.

874
01:08:19,973 --> 01:08:37,385
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would like that to go in the policy that all teachers and staff and all coaching, whether they're voluntary or paid, they all need to sign that they have read and implement this alcohol and drug policy.

875
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:37,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Who can add that?

876
01:08:39,926 --> 01:08:41,668
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion that the Bedford

877
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:46,796
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

878
01:08:47,277 --> 01:08:53,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It says social probation substitute may not or will not be allowed to attend or participate in graduation.

879
01:08:55,083 --> 01:09:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the rationale is as a parent who will have graduation and kids make mistakes to have that set in stone without some conversation.

880
01:09:06,928 --> 01:09:10,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's a background you can tell me why it got changed to will not.

881
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:14,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently the policy reach will not be allowed.

882
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:22,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd like to change it to daytime so that we have some discretion because obviously there are some situations out there that require discretion.

883
01:09:22,752 --> 01:09:33,078
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that, I just want to pontificate for a minute if I can, get away with it, and that's simply this, is that we can't be afraid of having discretion.

884
01:09:33,538 --> 01:09:36,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes you make hard and fast rules and they don't apply to everybody.

885
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you're stuck with that rule.

886
01:09:39,983 --> 01:09:45,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's very important to make it may not so that we can look at a circumstance and make a determination.

887
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:53,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully we're being fair and even handed across the board, but when something becomes so hard and fast, it becomes necessary to enforce it with everyone.

888
01:09:53,561 --> 01:09:55,163
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why it may not came in.

889
01:09:59,705 --> 01:10:23,415
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I'm somewhat taken aback only because I didn't quite realize that was, I didn't quite grasp that it has been, will not, and in the past, the most difficult, one of the most difficult days of my life was the day when some sweet young ladies called me and they were going to be removed from social probation and not being able to attend.

890
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:33,677
[SPEAKER_25]: And one of the problems, of course, is that they were sweet young ladies with much less body weight than their male counterparts, but they were not allowed to attend.

891
01:10:33,818 --> 01:10:44,220
[SPEAKER_25]: And at the time, the principal, Dr. Kruger, headmaster Dr. Kruger said, you know, Paulette, I'd much rather have you have a hard time doing this than having to go to a funeral.

892
01:10:45,481 --> 01:10:49,622
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was pretty, you know, what could you say?

893
01:10:51,442 --> 01:11:03,869
[SPEAKER_25]: My concern here with this is that, of course, we're coming up to that time when we all get very nervous because there's so many events for our students, which traditionally we've done very, very well in Medford.

894
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:18,997
[SPEAKER_25]: But since Dr. Perel is here, just to please ask him to remind the students that this is a very important time in their lives for our seniors who are coming up and that they would not want to have a blight, even with

895
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:36,092
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, now if we're saying, well, we're going to be a little bit more thoughtful about giving out the punishment of will not attend graduation for the students we want them, we don't want it to even be a question for them to have to consider.

896
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:42,678
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's just so important and so very difficult for families if a child is not able to attend graduation.

897
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:44,119
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't want to even think about it.

898
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,220
[SPEAKER_25]: I want them to go smoothly.

899
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:54,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I was just kind of on what Paulette was saying, where it is approaching the prom season.

900
01:11:54,829 --> 01:12:07,661
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any special meeting that they have with the juniors and seniors to prepare them for the prom and to talk to them about being safe and not drinking?

901
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:09,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to kind of drill it in.

902
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:15,224
[SPEAKER_19]: their heads, that it's very dangerous, and what are the consequences if they're caught at the prom.

903
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:24,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that when my niece went a couple years ago, there was an all-night after party at Tufts University that was excellent.

904
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that still planned for this prom season?

905
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:30,208
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, excellent.

906
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:35,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so this is a topic, obviously, that we take very seriously.

907
01:12:36,664 --> 01:12:39,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And we begin in really ninth grade discussions about this.

908
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:46,279
[SPEAKER_02]: The first assembly I had this year, we brought this information up and made clear to the students.

909
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:55,167
[SPEAKER_02]: importance of what we're talking about, and really the fragility of all that we're experiencing.

910
01:12:55,207 --> 01:13:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that's essential to really everything that we express to the students.

911
01:13:00,531 --> 01:13:13,703
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a pre-prom assembly, there are pre-prom discussion groups, and there is communication to families as well regarding prom, prom activities, and all the things that they need to know about it.

912
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:25,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to speak to what Mr. Bellson proposed earlier, the mandatory sort of rulings and expectations that all students, under these circumstances, fall within.

913
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:35,390
[SPEAKER_02]: This sort of consequence, lessening that, gives us and the faculty a real capacity to work with students to individualize and personalize situations.

914
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it's a wonderful transition.

915
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:45,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you still do this?

916
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:50,005
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done, that comes around from time to time.

917
01:13:50,365 --> 01:13:52,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the schedule this year.

918
01:13:53,006 --> 01:13:55,787
[SPEAKER_02]: These will go from district to district, so they can reach out to us.

919
01:13:56,407 --> 01:13:59,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we're interested, they did not reach out to us this year.

920
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:04,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did have a distracted driver assembly, which was pretty powerful.

921
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:09,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that communication regarding alcohol use is brought up.

922
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:13,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, any distracted driving comes up in that assembly as well.

923
01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:22,308
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a little bit difficult for me because I wouldn't really...

924
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:30,793
[SPEAKER_18]: at the end when we had, when this was in place and it said, we'll not graduate, it was really difficult.

925
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:37,436
[SPEAKER_18]: As Paulette had mentioned, I was in a situation too with another gentleman who was not able to graduate.

926
01:14:38,356 --> 01:14:44,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not something that is just thrown at our 12th graders just like out of the blue.

927
01:14:45,759 --> 01:14:49,481
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that is really spoken to them.

928
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,003
[SPEAKER_18]: and to the families since kindergarten.

929
01:14:52,484 --> 01:15:00,231
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's easier said than done, especially when they do go up to the high school, the ramifications of what will happen.

930
01:15:01,232 --> 01:15:11,303
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, it was a very difficult and it broke my heart when I really had to, you know, relay the message to that family that we couldn't change anything.

931
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:20,266
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that being said, it's a slippery slope and I'm really worried because I just don't want to get to the point where

932
01:15:21,508 --> 01:15:23,629
[SPEAKER_18]: will take certain things into consideration.

933
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:25,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just don't want to get to the point.

934
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:27,791
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know I respect you immensely.

935
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:34,814
[SPEAKER_18]: I just don't want to get to the point where, well, it happens to be so-and-so's child over so-and-so's child.

936
01:15:35,274 --> 01:15:41,277
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to get to the point where it's this athlete over the person who's not an athlete.

937
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:47,660
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to get to the point where it happened to be that person who was in the play over the student who wasn't in the play.

938
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,282
[SPEAKER_18]: That is my biggest concern.

939
01:15:50,362 --> 01:15:51,763
[SPEAKER_18]: That is my biggest fear.

940
01:15:51,903 --> 01:15:56,627
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to make sure that everyone is going to be looked at and looked at upon equally.

941
01:15:56,647 --> 01:16:03,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want outside influences if we're going to change this.

942
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is my biggest fear.

943
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:24,426
[SPEAKER_18]: And having and seeing the atmosphere and the changes of the high school, and even though this is a very strict rule, I could honestly say I don't think we've had many incidences that have occurred, because I think students know that we're extremely serious about this, and the parents know how serious we are about this.

944
01:16:24,586 --> 01:16:30,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think anyone has really taken it upon themselves to really say, oh, they're only going to

945
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:33,452
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, fool around with it.

946
01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:51,089
[SPEAKER_18]: And as far as, you know, going back to Kathy and asking the questions that you had asked about the students being, you know, they told, I've had four now, my last two, my baby, he's, they're seniors, and I've participated in the overnight, you know, overnight

947
01:16:53,638 --> 01:16:55,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Up all night parties, yeah, and I've stayed up all night.

948
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,361
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also suggest, really, if parents want to get involved, that's a great night to get involved.

949
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:03,242
[SPEAKER_18]: It is really a lot of fun.

950
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:05,203
[SPEAKER_18]: The kids really appreciate it.

951
01:17:05,843 --> 01:17:12,826
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a great way of keeping our kids safe, sound, and I can't say enough for it.

952
01:17:12,906 --> 01:17:17,868
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is really my concern about this little word of may or will.

953
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:23,372
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really having second thoughts about that particular word.

954
01:17:24,053 --> 01:17:25,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, let me say it this way.

955
01:17:27,717 --> 01:17:35,044
[SPEAKER_12]: As school administrators, we make decisions about young people every day, who get something, who doesn't get it, because we have to.

956
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:36,646
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a human enterprise.

957
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:42,931
[SPEAKER_12]: abdicate our discretion or abdicate our judgment, we're basically just robots.

958
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:46,551
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just following mechanics when it comes to young people.

959
01:17:46,591 --> 01:17:54,173
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's important to understand the circumstances that young people find themselves in at different times and how they were involved.

960
01:17:54,193 --> 01:18:02,694
[SPEAKER_12]: A person could be at a site where alcohol is there and then not be a user themselves and might be blamed for it.

961
01:18:02,714 --> 01:18:06,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Another person could be there and actually be distributing it or distributing drugs.

962
01:18:07,504 --> 01:18:08,324
[SPEAKER_12]: There are differences.

963
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:09,765
[SPEAKER_12]: There are differences.

964
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:31,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And so our responsibility as your leadership team and management team is to be able to accept the responsibility of making discretionary judgments and not to abuse it and not to give away anything that isn't deserved or punish people in ways that are inappropriate, but rather to ensure that there is a review.

965
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:40,371
[SPEAKER_12]: and there is an understanding, because without that, we're basically on autopilot, and then I don't think we're being fair to our young people and our families.

966
01:18:41,012 --> 01:18:51,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So I understand the downside, but we make a lot of decisions about what goes on every day, and you need to trust us to do that, because if not, schools can't run.

967
01:18:54,733 --> 01:18:56,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Could I just follow up on that?

968
01:18:56,756 --> 01:19:05,367
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, would it be just Dr. Perrella's decision or would that be a collaboration of both you and Dr. Perrella?

969
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:06,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Perrella is the headmaster.

970
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:08,892
[SPEAKER_12]: If he has doubts, he'll come to me.

971
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:12,837
[SPEAKER_12]: If he has a clear understanding, I will respect his judgment.

972
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could answer that as well, this would be that those decisions are taken with utmost seriousness.

973
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:27,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those situations, I would seek out to support not only the superintendent, but the leadership team as well.

974
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:35,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be very transparent about any conversation or communication that took place, and with the family, with the students, and of course, the administrative team.

975
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:41,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, it's easier said than done.

976
01:19:41,135 --> 01:19:42,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been in that position.

977
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,437
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to be in that position.

978
01:19:45,098 --> 01:20:01,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also thought that in the past, even though it said will not, it has been investigated if it was a student who happened to be just there, really at the wrong time, at the wrong place, they still were.

979
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:09,377
[SPEAKER_18]: able to graduate, it was really the student that was really in the situation that was the situation.

980
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:15,982
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, even though that word was there, it was fully taken under consideration.

981
01:20:17,603 --> 01:20:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, one last thing.

982
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:22,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The seniors are reminded of this

983
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:36,144
[SPEAKER_02]: consequences, daily, basically, in the months of April and May, because there are so many events that take place before every event, we remind them of what's at stake.

984
01:20:37,024 --> 01:20:42,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, because it's an option wouldn't mean that it would be something that would be commonplace either.

985
01:20:43,108 --> 01:20:51,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be the capacity to look at things individually in personalized situations and differentiate between situations as well.

986
01:20:52,497 --> 01:20:53,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

987
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:54,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

988
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to talk a little bit about the post-prom party.

989
01:20:57,661 --> 01:21:02,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I was very involved with that while my children were up at the high school.

990
01:21:02,485 --> 01:21:05,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We have between 200 and 250 children that attend there.

991
01:21:05,187 --> 01:21:06,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's extremely well run.

992
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: They have so many offerings for our children, and I really encourage parents to send their junior children there.

993
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:22,831
[SPEAKER_09]: They're safe, they're locked in, and if they leave, the parents are called.

994
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:27,476
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't come, their parents are called to say, hey, your child hasn't come and they signed up.

995
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:39,790
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of fun, they have, you know, hypnotists, they have mechanical bulls, they have food all night, and a lot of things are donated to our community, which is really a lovely gesture.

996
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:44,634
[SPEAKER_09]: But the most important thing I really wanna talk about is the person who runs the Up All Night Party.

997
01:21:44,974 --> 01:21:46,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Her name's Ann Rapucci.

998
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:55,981
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been a parent in Medford School Systems for a very long time, and her youngest is graduating this year, Eric Rapucci.

999
01:21:56,342 --> 01:21:57,963
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's been running this event,

1000
01:21:58,643 --> 01:22:00,744
[SPEAKER_09]: for between 10 and 15 years now.

1001
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:05,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's over 10, and it might be just under 15, but it might even be that.

1002
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:07,828
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a phenomenal woman.

1003
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,329
[SPEAKER_09]: She gets the job done.

1004
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:10,589
[SPEAKER_09]: She organizes people.

1005
01:22:10,609 --> 01:22:12,090
[SPEAKER_09]: She gets things donated.

1006
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:15,192
[SPEAKER_09]: They do an event to raise the money for this.

1007
01:22:17,293 --> 01:22:25,057
[SPEAKER_09]: It's phenomenal, it's fun, it's for the safety of our children, and she runs many, many other things up at our high school.

1008
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:28,419
[SPEAKER_09]: She's the president of the PTO, a co-president for Metro Witch right now.

1009
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:43,368
[SPEAKER_09]: She's done a phenomenal job, and I'd like to honor her here at the school committee, so maybe we could do a plaque because of so many years of service, and maybe, if possible at graduation, have a seat for her as her youngest leaves our school.

1010
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: and as she leaves our community as a parent who has donated their time for so many consecutive years.

1011
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:55,393
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion.

1012
01:23:03,596 --> 01:23:09,282
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I think many of us have worked with Anne over the years and she has really is distinct.

1013
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:16,329
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, we have many, many parents who volunteer for long periods of time, but Anne has put so much energy into that up all night party and is

1014
01:23:17,149 --> 01:23:18,190
[SPEAKER_25]: really stands out.

1015
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:32,765
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember there was one year when she actually had a hiatus, I think, between children for a year, but it didn't stop her at all from making sure that that group of kids in between, before her next child entered into ninth grade, was well taken care of.

1016
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:38,410
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that she definitely is deserving of an honor, and if we would ask her,

1017
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:50,802
[SPEAKER_25]: We have other parents on stage, the parents of the valedictorian, the salutatorian, and the student from the vocational school, so we probably could fit two more seats up there.

1018
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:57,888
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, as opted by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Minnie.

1019
01:23:58,689 --> 01:23:59,450
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1020
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:00,891
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1021
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,453
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion carries.

1022
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:19,906
[SPEAKER_17]: On the recommendation to accept the amendments to the report, the recommended change is an authorized posting consistent with the law, in addition adding Mr. Benedetto's amendment that all teachers, coaches, staff, et cetera, sign off on the updated policy.

1023
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Mr. Andrew Lute.

1024
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:26,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me?

1025
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, he already seconded it.

1026
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:28,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1027
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:32,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote, please.

1028
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:32,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1029
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:39,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1030
01:24:39,778 --> 01:24:40,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1031
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:46,180
[SPEAKER_17]: The financial report.

1032
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mayor and School Committee.

1033
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:55,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot here for you tonight.

1034
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:06,276
[SPEAKER_06]: As of the writing of this report, we're 71.86% expended, right on target, pretty much, and paychecks are going out as planned.

1035
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:13,700
[SPEAKER_06]: The April 21 paycheck, which is for all 10-month and 12-month, will be paid out this week versus next week because of spring break.

1036
01:25:15,052 --> 01:25:20,733
[SPEAKER_06]: The business office has continued its program of personnel file maintenance for active and inactive employees.

1037
01:25:20,753 --> 01:25:24,674
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been real progress and location of call for items is timely.

1038
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Existing employees have been fingerprinted.

1039
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,435
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a requirement for all new hires.

1040
01:25:29,975 --> 01:25:36,557
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, last year we actually had three on-site visits and able to get all of our existing employees fingerprinted.

1041
01:25:36,617 --> 01:25:37,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a huge endeavor.

1042
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:44,779
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the process of recoring every three years and we do that on a natural rotation.

1043
01:25:46,821 --> 01:25:53,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Harper's payroll accounting update, which was to be minor, far exceeded the work expectation, is settling into a pattern for processing.

1044
01:25:54,227 --> 01:26:03,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Preparation for summer hiring has begun with folder preparedness, updating of forms, and the restoration of the superintendent's conference room every day during the summer from 9 to 11.

1045
01:26:05,197 --> 01:26:07,198
[SPEAKER_06]: point of contact for us.

1046
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:17,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually we wait for people to come in, and they go through the process, and they get interviewed, and then the determination is made by the department heads and the superintendent, and then we set them up for appointment.

1047
01:26:17,624 --> 01:26:22,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day this summer from 9 to 11, we have reserved a room, and it's just going to be an automatic process.

1048
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:26,289
[SPEAKER_06]: If you came and you have the right IDs, we can get you processed and out the door.

1049
01:26:26,309 --> 01:26:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go enjoy your summer.

1050
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:31,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Purchase order final notice is issued for April 22nd.

1051
01:26:32,513 --> 01:26:38,579
[SPEAKER_06]: All purchase orders must be in the accounts payable department with a few exceptions for spring sports, maintenance, and final grant spending.

1052
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:52,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, balance of spending must be encumbered no later than June 5th, and that allows us to get all the invoices in for June 30th, which means our carryovers are much less, which is very important to us and to the city.

1053
01:26:53,723 --> 01:26:54,425
[SPEAKER_06]: food service.

1054
01:26:55,066 --> 01:26:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: FY 15, you see the profit and loss for a food service on the big sheet of

1055
01:27:04,237 --> 01:27:22,485
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the trial balance, it is a negative $8,563.56, but in reality, if you add in the June federal aid and the June state, both were posted in August and July, the adjusted end-of-year balance is $88,920.65, which is just a little bit more than what we had anticipated.

1056
01:27:28,885 --> 01:27:31,546
[SPEAKER_06]: food service has been really busy.

1057
01:27:31,686 --> 01:27:36,867
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have the voted for price increase, and that has gone fine.

1058
01:27:36,987 --> 01:27:40,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We've not really seen any backlash on that.

1059
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:48,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a new employee in the food service department, Tom Dixie, and he's doing a fabulous job of introducing new quick meals.

1060
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And what those are is

1061
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:55,874
[SPEAKER_06]: For a reimbursable meal, it has to include three components.

1062
01:27:55,914 --> 01:27:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But the kids don't always want hot lunch, which is a reimbursable meal.

1063
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:03,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you put a bagel, a piece of fruit, and milk together, it's a reimbursable meal.

1064
01:28:04,339 --> 01:28:05,920
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also quick and ready to go.

1065
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:09,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Dixie's been very good about doing a lot of those items, especially at the high school.

1066
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:14,666
[SPEAKER_06]: We're up about 40 count per day at the high school level.

1067
01:28:14,746 --> 01:28:16,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's working on more new ideas.

1068
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything takes time, but he is starting.

1069
01:28:20,737 --> 01:28:24,662
[SPEAKER_06]: special education, out-of-district tuition continues to maintain stability.

1070
01:28:25,543 --> 01:28:26,904
[SPEAKER_06]: We are pretty much on target.

1071
01:28:26,924 --> 01:28:29,187
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a little bit of a contingency for unknown placements.

1072
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And as of April, we still can have those as we come into June.

1073
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Substitute teachers, MPS has expended $370,973 of the $573, $492 budget.

1074
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That gives us $255,000 roughly to get to June.

1075
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:44,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind that April, May, and June are our biggest sub-use months.

1076
01:28:44,082 --> 01:28:45,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will disappear rather quickly.

1077
01:28:56,232 --> 01:29:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: FY17 will see the integration of an ASAP subscription from Frontline Technologies to assist in managing our substitute teachers and employee attendants.

1078
01:29:05,042 --> 01:29:09,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That should do great things for us within the substitute filling world.

1079
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:11,430
[SPEAKER_06]: They say 95% fill rate.

1080
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:15,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am contacting other teachers.

1081
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:18,496
[SPEAKER_06]: During a good economy, you don't have a lot of substitute teachers.

1082
01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many jobs that those people who generally go to those jobs find things that pay better or are more consistent.

1083
01:29:25,562 --> 01:29:29,125
[SPEAKER_06]: But even with a good economy, they are having a really good fill rate.

1084
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:30,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will help us out at the lower levels.

1085
01:29:33,082 --> 01:29:39,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school telephone conversion will be completed April 15th with the porting of the high school from Verizon to DSDI.

1086
01:29:40,487 --> 01:29:44,490
[SPEAKER_06]: The complexity of the high school building brought about a slightly slower conversion.

1087
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:46,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Just did not want to rush this.

1088
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:50,614
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a really big building with a lot of phones and a lot of 1970s infrastructure.

1089
01:29:52,676 --> 01:30:00,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And along with all the telephone stuff that has been going on, we also had to integrate the paging system into the new phone system.

1090
01:30:01,506 --> 01:30:06,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time you go to do something, even the buzzer to the front door is integrated into the phone system.

1091
01:30:07,453 --> 01:30:10,337
[SPEAKER_06]: everything you bring in through the wires has to talk to something else.

1092
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:11,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've taken our time.

1093
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:19,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just a little bit beyond where we wanted to be, but we're still within scope, within budget, and I think it's going very well.

1094
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:23,756
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a training session April 14th, and that goes on all day from 9 to 12.

1095
01:30:25,451 --> 01:30:31,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Transportation, bus routes are running smoothly, and of course, during the lighter than normal winter, MPS experienced few reported issues.

1096
01:30:33,278 --> 01:30:37,022
[SPEAKER_06]: In January, all of Eastern Bus Company drivers were trained in the use of EpiPens.

1097
01:30:37,482 --> 01:30:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Toni Bento took care of this for us.

1098
01:30:39,785 --> 01:30:41,927
[SPEAKER_06]: She volunteered, and I thought it was a great thing.

1099
01:30:41,947 --> 01:30:45,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of the drivers have been instructed in how to use an EpiPen.

1100
01:30:47,854 --> 01:31:03,989
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned earlier, we're going to be using TransFinder RootFinder Pro program next year, so we're doing a lot of work with that, getting them our roots, uploading a confidential list of student riders' addresses, and of course, their contact information, which is going to be a huge plus for us next year.

1101
01:31:04,109 --> 01:31:07,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we do have an issue, we can reach out to those parents immediately.

1102
01:31:09,504 --> 01:31:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Utilities for the month of February, the district's buildings utilized 48% less therms than a year ago.

1103
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:24,136
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see that I provided you with a comparison spreadsheet from last year versus this year, so you could actually see the use across the buildings.

1104
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:31,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind that the readings were actually estimated for February, so I do see that that will be down a little bit more.

1105
01:31:31,825 --> 01:31:33,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were very nice to us.

1106
01:31:34,346 --> 01:31:42,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see us at being about 28% less thermeus than last year, which of course coincides with our actual price because we have not changed in price.

1107
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:50,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Electricity costs are running about 6% above last year and can be attributed to the first full year with the pool and science labs.

1108
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:55,700
[SPEAKER_06]: We're under contract for electricity through November 2016, so costs are in line with last year.

1109
01:31:56,541 --> 01:32:02,166
[SPEAKER_06]: The FY16 budget plan for the increased kilowatt expenses and should complete the year as planned.

1110
01:32:02,186 --> 01:32:04,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be at probably just at 1.8.

1111
01:32:06,357 --> 01:32:15,843
[SPEAKER_06]: The school year has had a share of unplanned maintenance issues, failed water heater, sewer cleanup, concrete work, but careful spending has thus far kept the budget aligned.

1112
01:32:16,843 --> 01:32:17,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

1113
01:32:18,564 --> 01:32:20,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry.

1114
01:32:20,705 --> 01:32:26,589
[SPEAKER_15]: As the city's energy office done a study at the high school,

1115
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:36,143
[SPEAKER_15]: recently to find out where we can conserve energy and how we can bring our electric bills down a little.

1116
01:32:36,163 --> 01:32:37,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent a lot of time at the high school.

1117
01:32:37,864 --> 01:32:38,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1118
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:39,125
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of time.

1119
01:32:39,145 --> 01:32:42,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a lot of things in the works and we're just waiting to see how they all pan out.

1120
01:32:42,868 --> 01:32:43,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the schools actually.

1121
01:32:44,129 --> 01:32:44,369
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1122
01:32:44,949 --> 01:32:45,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1123
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:46,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1124
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:46,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Vanderbloom.

1125
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:47,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1126
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:55,393
[SPEAKER_25]: This year we were blessed because of a warmer winter to have savings, just as many of us were at home too.

1127
01:32:55,453 --> 01:33:00,454
[SPEAKER_25]: I noticed that our bills were down as well, almost comparatively to the schools.

1128
01:33:00,934 --> 01:33:14,598
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's just that when we're planning for next year, we have to remember not this winter, but the winter before, just to make sure that when we do our budget sessions, we're not the incredibly optimistic,

1129
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:18,201
[SPEAKER_25]: of this year, but we are realistic to the year before.

1130
01:33:18,781 --> 01:33:23,566
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm just mindful of that because it looks so good this year.

1131
01:33:23,586 --> 01:33:33,156
[SPEAKER_25]: On the food service, I just want to, I think, reiterate that of the $88,000 surplus, that that money then is taken and will fold over into

1132
01:33:34,117 --> 01:33:38,719
[SPEAKER_25]: needed upgrades of different things in our food service.

1133
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:40,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that correct?

1134
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:40,999
[SPEAKER_25]: That is correct.

1135
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:48,482
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think that's very important for people to realize, because if you say 88,000 surplus, then you're asking, oh, why did we raise the cost of lunch?

1136
01:33:48,862 --> 01:33:58,225
[SPEAKER_25]: We raised it because we need to cover, it's a self-funding program, and it needs to cover other necessary items.

1137
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,486
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's the way we do it.

1138
01:34:00,066 --> 01:34:01,126
[SPEAKER_25]: So while it's a

1139
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:12,259
[SPEAKER_25]: that money was generated because there are expenses that need to be paid out of that money to keep us in good shape.

1140
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:12,860
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that correct?

1141
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,681
[SPEAKER_25]: That is correct.

1142
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:18,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And you should also keep in mind that the state says that we should have 10% of our annual revenues.

1143
01:34:19,788 --> 01:34:22,049
[SPEAKER_06]: in the fund to roll over into the next year.

1144
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:26,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not quite there again yet, but we are working in that direction.

1145
01:34:26,072 --> 01:34:35,197
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are keeping in mind, we just had the discussion about looking for our repair items and things that we might need to keep building on Mr. Dixie's ideas so that we have the equipment in place.

1146
01:34:35,377 --> 01:34:37,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, it sounds like he has some great ideas.

1147
01:34:37,519 --> 01:34:45,844
[SPEAKER_25]: I am also glad to see in the report that you attached that we're going to be able to continue the food service program during the summer that we began last year.

1148
01:34:45,884 --> 01:34:47,065
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you very much, Pat.

1149
01:34:47,085 --> 01:34:47,505
[SPEAKER_25]: You're welcome.

1150
01:34:48,896 --> 01:34:49,957
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion to receive.

1151
01:34:49,977 --> 01:34:53,359
[SPEAKER_17]: You just have to hit your button.

1152
01:34:53,499 --> 01:34:54,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1153
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1154
01:34:56,621 --> 01:35:09,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So through you to the superintendent, speaking of conserving energy, we had talked about the new lights at the Curtis School as well as the vocational school quite a while ago.

1155
01:35:09,349 --> 01:35:11,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And you were going to speak with Ms.

1156
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:13,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Hunt, and we were going to price it out.

1157
01:35:13,252 --> 01:35:18,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Because wasn't there an option that we could take a loan out

1158
01:35:18,955 --> 01:35:22,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the savings that we would make would pay back the loan.

1159
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:27,822
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm not mistaken, it's part of our grant for the green community staff this year.

1160
01:35:27,842 --> 01:35:30,424
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe the Curtis Tufts is one of the schools that's included.

1161
01:35:30,444 --> 01:35:31,865
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the Robins as well.

1162
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:33,647
[SPEAKER_17]: There are about three schools that are included.

1163
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:36,189
[SPEAKER_17]: I can confirm that tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure.

1164
01:35:36,389 --> 01:35:36,950
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

1165
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:40,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't hear that update, so that's terrific.

1166
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:47,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And my other questions were about maintenance and equipment for our lunch facilities.

1167
01:35:48,378 --> 01:35:54,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I know last year when we raised the rate, we did talk about items and that was part of the process.

1168
01:35:55,361 --> 01:36:00,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talked about not waiting until things were really bad about changing fees.

1169
01:36:00,483 --> 01:36:02,464
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't want to do big lump sum fees.

1170
01:36:02,864 --> 01:36:09,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just want to make sure that we have enough money to maintain the items we need to and not hit parents.

1171
01:36:10,287 --> 01:36:14,190
[SPEAKER_09]: with large increases over time, and that's just a reminder of that.

1172
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:25,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and we talked about, we went with phase two versus phase three, which would have provided substantial capital, and more or less making sure that we maintain what we have with phase two.

1173
01:36:25,478 --> 01:36:35,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and if there are items that need to come up in the next year or so, we need to maybe have that reported at our budget session so that way we can plan for them for next year.

1174
01:36:36,301 --> 01:36:47,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they are looking at things and they say, well, these things can be repaired and these things can't and these need to be replaced, then maybe we could bring them forward in the next month or two so we can look at that with our budget.

1175
01:36:48,644 --> 01:36:50,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, and thank you for your report.

1176
01:36:50,125 --> 01:36:50,705
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always great.

1177
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1178
01:36:52,546 --> 01:36:53,706
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, Ms.

1179
01:36:53,746 --> 01:36:54,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloots.

1180
01:36:55,773 --> 01:36:57,334
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion to receive and place on file?

1181
01:36:57,954 --> 01:36:58,395
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in?

1182
01:36:59,996 --> 01:37:00,476
[SPEAKER_17]: All those against?

1183
01:37:01,797 --> 01:37:02,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1184
01:37:03,938 --> 01:37:04,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1185
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:04,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Van der Kloot.

1186
01:37:04,578 --> 01:37:05,739
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just wondering.

1187
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:10,182
[SPEAKER_25]: I noticed that Mrs. DiCarlo is here, and we received a report on our desk.

1188
01:37:11,463 --> 01:37:16,406
[SPEAKER_25]: Perhaps before we go on to the lead counsel in school rentals, we might want to turn to this report.

1189
01:37:16,866 --> 01:37:18,227
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you presenting this tonight?

1190
01:37:21,656 --> 01:37:24,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to highlight it?

1191
01:37:24,157 --> 01:37:24,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

1192
01:37:25,898 --> 01:37:35,883
[SPEAKER_25]: We received in our packet a wonderful, this is more good news, Medford High School students of Italian win first prize in contest at Northeastern University.

1193
01:37:37,404 --> 01:37:38,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you want to take over?

1194
01:37:38,565 --> 01:37:38,785
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure.

1195
01:37:39,185 --> 01:37:39,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1196
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:42,287
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm happy to report that

1197
01:37:44,515 --> 01:37:56,906
[SPEAKER_23]: The ten students from Medford High School formed a team and they competed against other area high schools and they won first prize at Northeastern University this past Friday.

1198
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:03,412
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a more complete report than I'm just going to give you a brief summary.

1199
01:38:04,836 --> 01:38:14,223
[SPEAKER_23]: The group was made up of two students from Italian, two honors, two from Italian, four honors, and six students from Italian AP.

1200
01:38:15,084 --> 01:38:27,253
[SPEAKER_23]: They collaborated on Google Docs and created their script for the skit, and then they practiced after school under the guidance of their Italian teachers.

1201
01:38:27,933 --> 01:38:41,280
[SPEAKER_23]: The guidelines for participating in the contest were to create a five-minute original skit on an Italian feast or celebration, outlining its social characteristics and cultural tendencies.

1202
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,422
[SPEAKER_23]: The dialogue, of course, had to be in Italian.

1203
01:38:45,562 --> 01:39:02,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Our students chose Carnevale, which is Mardi Gras, as their topic, and the skit consisted of an imaginative fashion show dubbed Contest, in which students featured stock characters from La Comedia dell'Arte,

1204
01:39:04,631 --> 01:39:16,277
[SPEAKER_23]: Through their dialogue, elements and tendencies of Italian culture pertaining to the celebration of Carnevale came through with a humorous and modern twist.

1205
01:39:17,058 --> 01:39:23,322
[SPEAKER_23]: Judges for the presentations included professors of Italian from Northeastern University and Bentley College.

1206
01:39:24,622 --> 01:39:28,285
[SPEAKER_23]: The groups were judged on language use,

1207
01:39:29,234 --> 01:39:35,258
[SPEAKER_23]: creativity and performance, preparation, and adherence to theme and time limit.

1208
01:39:36,419 --> 01:39:43,564
[SPEAKER_23]: After the presentations, all students participated in a trivia game on Italian history and culture.

1209
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:54,111
[SPEAKER_23]: The first student with the right answer to a question would receive a special pencil donated from AATI, American Association of Teachers of Italian.

1210
01:39:54,870 --> 01:40:07,535
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition to winning first prize, Medford students walked away with the most pencils, which exemplifies the preparation and passion for the study of Italian culture.

1211
01:40:08,215 --> 01:40:14,057
[SPEAKER_23]: We are very proud of our students and they really represented Medford High School well.

1212
01:40:15,163 --> 01:40:27,926
[SPEAKER_25]: Mrs. DeCarlo, you missed the best line, though, which is Medford High School won first place, Lexington High School won second place, and Everett High School won third place.

1213
01:40:28,366 --> 01:40:29,086
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1214
01:40:29,166 --> 01:40:29,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1215
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:32,167
[SPEAKER_23]: Lexington was second and Everett third.

1216
01:40:32,187 --> 01:40:33,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford was first.

1217
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:37,268
[SPEAKER_23]: Medford was first, so they were very impressed, our students.

1218
01:40:40,109 --> 01:40:41,770
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the line I was going to repeat.

1219
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:46,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Although we're not supposed to be competitive, it's nice to be competitive.

1220
01:40:46,955 --> 01:40:55,502
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing is that through you, Madam Chair, to the superintendent to make sure that we send out letters of recognition to the students.

1221
01:40:56,463 --> 01:40:58,945
[SPEAKER_18]: And congratulations to you and to the students.

1222
01:40:59,045 --> 01:40:59,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Very well done.

1223
01:41:00,627 --> 01:41:01,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1224
01:41:01,227 --> 01:41:01,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1225
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:01,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1226
01:41:02,188 --> 01:41:03,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1227
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:10,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I just actually wanted to know if we could invite the students to come to the city council because it's the first year and hopeful.

1228
01:41:12,557 --> 01:41:12,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1229
01:41:14,559 --> 01:41:15,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long night.

1230
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,521
[SPEAKER_09]: School committee.

1231
01:41:17,242 --> 01:41:21,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So that we can present certificates of achievement to them and because they

1232
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:31,361
[SPEAKER_09]: They really modeled great behavior and great ability, and they kicked butt throughout the districts.

1233
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:37,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could invite them here and honor them for their achievement, that would be great.

1234
01:41:38,206 --> 01:41:41,208
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion offered by Mr. Benedetto and Ms.

1235
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandekloot, all those in favor?

1236
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:43,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1237
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:44,951
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1238
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:46,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1239
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Report of legal counsel on school rentals.

1240
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:53,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

1241
01:41:53,292 --> 01:42:03,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, our legal counsel, Howard Greenspan, is here to report on the matter that you referred to him and our committee the whole with regard to rental and school properties.

1242
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:08,141
[SPEAKER_12]: At this time, I'd like you to welcome Howard Turner.

1243
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:08,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Greenspan.

1244
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:12,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee.

1245
01:42:12,923 --> 01:42:19,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, I did forward to you an opinion that you requested in your March meeting.

1246
01:42:19,847 --> 01:42:33,540
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, as to, uh, a legal analysis, uh, regarding Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 71, Section 71, uh, which is the use of school property.

1247
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:41,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my opinion is strictly limited, uh, to the, uh, statute, uh, and the analysis of the statute.

1248
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:54,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not go into any of the facts or circumstances regarding any of the uses that have occurred with the community schools during the last year or couple of years.

1249
01:42:56,614 --> 01:43:04,336
[SPEAKER_00]: As I stated in my opinion, this is not a subject area of the law that there are a lot of reported cases on.

1250
01:43:05,056 --> 01:43:07,196
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there are very few reported cases.

1251
01:43:08,397 --> 01:43:09,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that have been

1252
01:43:11,067 --> 01:43:12,687
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back to 1941.

1253
01:43:12,967 --> 01:43:31,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, our Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that it's really up to the school committee to determine the use of its school buildings, which can't be interfered with with any other public body.

1254
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,651
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the cases say.

1255
01:43:35,731 --> 01:43:44,118
[SPEAKER_00]: The cases also say, and the statute also says, pursuant to its rules and regulations that the school committee may develop.

1256
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:56,108
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent faxed over to me four different school committee policies.

1257
01:43:58,009 --> 01:44:00,751
[SPEAKER_00]: which relate to the use of community schools.

1258
01:44:02,192 --> 01:44:06,714
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all under Section K of your school committee policies.

1259
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:10,796
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are four different policies that relate to rentals.

1260
01:44:11,717 --> 01:44:17,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I stated, in my opinion, some of these policies are somewhat contradictory.

1261
01:44:18,435 --> 01:44:43,346
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on my review of the statute and my review of the policies, it is my recommendation that the committee review the policies that I've attached to my report and maybe clarify or develop a new policy or decide which of the four policies you really want to stick with and implement.

1262
01:44:44,375 --> 01:45:01,789
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent also sent to me minutes of the March 19, 2012 school committee meeting in which there are a couple of things that went on in 2012 that relate to this opinion.

1263
01:45:02,849 --> 01:45:13,898
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that occurred was that the subcommittee for support services reported out to the full committee that it meant for the purpose that it met

1264
01:45:14,835 --> 01:45:19,478
[SPEAKER_00]: to review the community schools program back in 2012.

1265
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:40,957
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the committee members at that time expressed strong feelings that the program had great potential to generate revenue for the entire system and that there needed to be a defined schedule, fee structure, and personal support system in place.

1266
01:45:43,735 --> 01:45:58,728
[SPEAKER_00]: There was supposed to be, the committee accepted that report, and there was supposed to be a further meeting of the subcommittee on April 26th of 2012, which I asked the superintendent if there were any reports or minutes of that subcommittee meeting.

1267
01:45:59,389 --> 01:46:05,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my understanding from my discussion with the superintendent that that meeting did not occur.

1268
01:46:07,016 --> 01:46:10,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the next thing on the agenda that same evening,

1269
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:22,517
[SPEAKER_00]: was a recommendation to approve the MASC and working with the MASC to publish online the Medford School Committee policies.

1270
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:47,657
[SPEAKER_00]: The report states, and the minute states, from the superintendent that there was agreement on a substantial portion of the policies, but does not indicate that the entire MASC policy handbook had been approved up to that date by the school committee.

1271
01:46:48,480 --> 01:47:03,279
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in these policies, uh, that the superintendent sent to me, there are two policies which reference as a source Medford School Committee, and there are two policies that reference as a source the MASC.

1272
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:15,944
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another reason why I think there's some confusion as to which policies have been adopted by the committee, why you have to review these policies.

1273
01:47:16,364 --> 01:47:23,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Were the MASC policies relating to the use of community schools ever adopted by the committee?

1274
01:47:23,226 --> 01:47:27,828
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to tell from the minutes of the committee meetings back in 2012.

1275
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:33,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a brief summary of my opinion.

1276
01:47:33,243 --> 01:47:37,005
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer.

1277
01:47:37,025 --> 01:47:43,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, thank you, and thank you for looking into this matter.

1278
01:47:43,868 --> 01:47:53,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we have dates of when these policies were put into place, out of these four, which is the most recent that was approved?

1279
01:47:54,994 --> 01:47:57,936
[SPEAKER_12]: So researching the issue as well,

1280
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:13,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I found that, as Mr. Greenspan explained, that in the minutes of the March meeting, we indicated we would post those policies that had been approved of March of 2012.

1281
01:48:16,067 --> 01:48:25,811
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go online, and remember the online policies were posted by MASC based on the fact that we had approved them, and the ones we hadn't approved were still pending.

1282
01:48:26,706 --> 01:48:33,969
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the policies online, you will find that the policies, the four policies we're talking about, are not there.

1283
01:48:35,229 --> 01:48:38,551
[SPEAKER_12]: So what it means to me is that we didn't get to it.

1284
01:48:39,311 --> 01:48:53,396
[SPEAKER_12]: We hadn't really dealt with it yet, and that two of the policies that were MA Medford policies were older policies that we had had from older yearbooks that might have been available through hard copy, but they weren't available online.

1285
01:48:54,117 --> 01:48:55,037
[SPEAKER_12]: So as a result,

1286
01:48:55,829 --> 01:49:04,473
[SPEAKER_12]: It's clear to me, at least from my standpoint, you know, concurrent with our attorneys, is that we need to decide what you want to do.

1287
01:49:05,053 --> 01:49:14,998
[SPEAKER_12]: The law doesn't prohibit us, but the four policies either contradict themselves, and they weren't posted by MASC because clearly Jim Hardy, who was our consultant at the time,

1288
01:49:15,654 --> 01:49:21,319
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't get the go-ahead from the committee at that time to post it because we hadn't got that far.

1289
01:49:21,799 --> 01:49:26,202
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd done so much that we wanted to get as much as possible up, but we really didn't get that far.

1290
01:49:26,923 --> 01:49:31,807
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the interim, if I can, just for a little bit more and then certainly take any questions.

1291
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:48,885
[SPEAKER_12]: In the interim, Pat Bealy has convened a committee with community schools and several of us working on it to come up with a draft policy for your consideration, which obviously you can change, adjust, modify, add to, subtract, as you will.

1292
01:49:49,365 --> 01:50:00,788
[SPEAKER_12]: with a fee structure, and we would hope to present that to you very shortly, probably at our next meeting, so that you can look at it and begin the process of agreeing what you want to be the policy of the Medford Public Schools.

1293
01:50:01,029 --> 01:50:13,852
[SPEAKER_12]: It's much more comprehensive than anything we've ever had, it's much more detailed, and it also reflects a lot of the discussions that you've had in our discussions and meetings as to what you have indicated were concerns that you had.

1294
01:50:14,312 --> 01:50:15,713
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I think we're,

1295
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:23,935
[SPEAKER_12]: and attract to come up with a new policy, one that you will have obviously the final say over, and whatever you decide, we'll implement.

1296
01:50:24,436 --> 01:50:36,405
[SPEAKER_12]: But as Howard points out in his reference, in going over the issue of revenue, it becomes extremely important that we understand that revenue is key to keeping some of these facilities going.

1297
01:50:36,866 --> 01:50:39,007
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to understand the balance between

1298
01:50:40,168 --> 01:50:46,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Programs that provide revenue and programs that are simply community oriented, that we are supporting activities within the community.

1299
01:50:46,913 --> 01:50:47,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a balancing act.

1300
01:50:48,374 --> 01:50:53,297
[SPEAKER_12]: But having said that, I'll be happy to answer any other questions you have or I'm sure direct them to Mr. Greenspan.

1301
01:50:53,697 --> 01:50:55,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not finished yet.

1302
01:50:56,339 --> 01:50:57,760
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't really answer the question.

1303
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:03,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Which of these four policies are the one that we have enacting now and the most recent?

1304
01:51:03,664 --> 01:51:04,785
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question.

1305
01:51:04,805 --> 01:51:06,446
[SPEAKER_12]: My answer to that is I don't believe any of them.

1306
01:51:07,246 --> 01:51:09,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe they all were in discussion.

1307
01:51:09,928 --> 01:51:12,571
[SPEAKER_09]: We currently don't have a policy in place that we can rent.

1308
01:51:12,591 --> 01:51:13,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information?

1309
01:51:13,772 --> 01:51:13,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1310
01:51:13,952 --> 01:51:15,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Vander Kloof, point of information?

1311
01:51:15,873 --> 01:51:18,115
[SPEAKER_25]: I would put in a point of information.

1312
01:51:19,356 --> 01:51:30,906
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I sat on the committee that was going through the policy handbook, I need to, just for those of you who weren't there, to tell you it was an extraordinarily arduous task.

1313
01:51:31,326 --> 01:51:34,289
[SPEAKER_25]: We met night after night after night with Jim Hardy.

1314
01:51:34,749 --> 01:51:36,870
[SPEAKER_25]: going through all of these different policies.

1315
01:51:38,211 --> 01:51:50,939
[SPEAKER_25]: And when you see SOURCE, M-A-S-C, those were ones that he brought along and said, this is the M-A-S-C policy that many school districts have adopted.

1316
01:51:52,845 --> 01:52:08,988
[SPEAKER_25]: When Jim went to that place, and we posted this, since we had worked on this for so long, and it was finally time to post it, it's very clear to me now, looking backwards, that this must have just been set aside, probably to go to the subcommittee, and it was not.

1317
01:52:09,468 --> 01:52:19,570
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think to answer your question, Mrs. DiBenedo, is that unfortunately the two MASC policies would be, in my recollection, ones that Jim brought in for our

1318
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:27,312
[SPEAKER_25]: purview, and the other ones were ones that we found in our paperwork that had existed over some period of years.

1319
01:52:28,413 --> 01:52:37,796
[SPEAKER_25]: What the superintendent is recommending, and is clearly the logical thing to do, is now to sit down, take a look at all four, and develop our own, along with the fee structure.

1320
01:52:38,517 --> 01:52:44,159
[SPEAKER_25]: I will note that Mrs. DiBenedetto and I were able to attend Fiddler on the Roof this past week.

1321
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:45,599
[SPEAKER_25]: It was excellent.

1322
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:47,280
[SPEAKER_25]: We really had a very enjoyable time.

1323
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:58,988
[SPEAKER_25]: But afterwards it was, when we had a discussion with one of the teachers, it was clear that they had had to work around a rental that took place the previous weekend, which, to an outside vendor.

1324
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:00,950
[SPEAKER_25]: And that didn't make any sense at all.

1325
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:05,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Our kids needed that space to be able to prepare for their yearly spring musical.

1326
01:53:06,814 --> 01:53:16,942
[SPEAKER_25]: And we were both disheartened to hear that that had happened, because I think that the committee as a whole is of the priority that our Medford High School kids take first priority.

1327
01:53:17,462 --> 01:53:34,757
[SPEAKER_25]: So it would seem that this would be the logical thing to now send to a subcommittee and work out a new policy and a new fee structure and then finally be able to post this as our new policy.

1328
01:53:36,088 --> 01:53:37,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you.

1329
01:53:38,128 --> 01:53:42,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the point of information regarding that.

1330
01:53:42,529 --> 01:53:53,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that when I was researching this issue, the MASC source is the source that I got from our publications.

1331
01:53:54,052 --> 01:54:00,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this was the understanding I had when I went to that meeting on April, I mean,

1332
01:54:01,353 --> 01:54:03,155
[SPEAKER_09]: The 19th of last month, I believe.

1333
01:54:04,417 --> 01:54:07,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is why I brought this forward, March 19th's meeting.

1334
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:14,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what I brought to the meeting and handed to you, Mr. Superintendent, because this is what was posted.

1335
01:54:15,209 --> 01:54:15,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And on it...

1336
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:22,435
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe that this was our current lease.

1337
01:54:22,576 --> 01:54:26,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm all for changing it and making it new and creating it.

1338
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:34,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's why I would like to have a committee of the whole, not only to go over this issue, but to go over community schools as a whole.

1339
01:54:34,967 --> 01:54:40,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know who's renting our schools, what we pay to use the gym at the McGlynn compared to the Columbus.

1340
01:54:41,072 --> 01:54:44,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know everything, who's using our,

1341
01:54:44,656 --> 01:54:53,067
[SPEAKER_09]: our theater, what group it is, how much they pay, whether they're for profit, whether they're not for profit, if they take out insurance to use our buildings.

1342
01:54:53,087 --> 01:54:59,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a complete understanding of what's happening in this district, in these situations.

1343
01:55:00,296 --> 01:55:01,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know it.

1344
01:55:01,517 --> 01:55:03,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been asking for it for a month now.

1345
01:55:04,339 --> 01:55:09,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on our agenda because I asked for the list of things that were requested.

1346
01:55:09,502 --> 01:55:16,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also would like the date those things were requested on the back of our agenda as well, so we know how long they have been outstanding.

1347
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:18,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to move forward with this.

1348
01:55:18,667 --> 01:55:21,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want it to take another school year.

1349
01:55:21,509 --> 01:55:27,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want another company displacing any of our students because we're making our buildings

1350
01:55:28,633 --> 01:55:39,997
[SPEAKER_09]: available to for-profit companies and displacing students from practicing for plays, or using facilities, or any other thing that might come along.

1351
01:55:40,677 --> 01:55:53,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who's using them, I don't know what they're paying, if they're paying, who they're paying, so I want a whole understanding, and that's why I requested a meeting, and I think it needs to happen within the next three weeks.

1352
01:55:54,877 --> 01:55:58,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Madam Mayor, you know, we've agreed to do that.

1353
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,263
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not something that, you know, we need to say, oh, we've agreed to do that.

1354
01:56:03,744 --> 01:56:06,405
[SPEAKER_12]: But we first wanted a legal opinion.

1355
01:56:06,446 --> 01:56:08,487
[SPEAKER_12]: We now have a legal opinion.

1356
01:56:08,647 --> 01:56:20,316
[SPEAKER_12]: We told you that we've sat and worked on a comprehensive policy for you to review with a fee structure based on what we think is necessary to sustain the operation of the building.

1357
01:56:21,216 --> 01:56:24,619
[SPEAKER_12]: We will provide you with every renter, every user,

1358
01:56:25,288 --> 01:56:40,252
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also preparing for you a policy with regard to booster organizations, which will require that booster organizations register with the schools so that we have some access to their materials and we can track their materials.

1359
01:56:40,272 --> 01:56:43,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot that's coming forward to you.

1360
01:56:43,593 --> 01:56:45,113
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it just takes a little bit of time.

1361
01:56:45,744 --> 01:56:52,631
[SPEAKER_12]: We pulled it all together to do it right, and we waited for the appropriate legal opinion, and we did our homework.

1362
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:57,095
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that over the next month, you're going to see a lot, and you're going to have a chance to do it.

1363
01:56:57,675 --> 01:57:04,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reality is, is that going into the summer, into the next school year, you'll have a policy in place, assuming that you approve it.

1364
01:57:04,862 --> 01:57:07,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And that you'll have fees in place, assuming you approve it.

1365
01:57:08,417 --> 01:57:16,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have a structure that we believe will answer your questions and the questions of other people, and at the same time allow us to move forward in a constructive way.

1366
01:57:16,983 --> 01:57:22,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So I believe it's happening, and I believe that there's a lot of goodwill here, and I believe everybody wants it to work.

1367
01:57:22,226 --> 01:57:28,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And we certainly want to take any doubt away from anyone about the operation of the schools with regard to

1368
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:34,713
[SPEAKER_12]: nonprofit, community, and other groups.

1369
01:57:35,414 --> 01:57:49,465
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also important as we go forward that you help us to identify to what extent, if any, you want to allow certain groups to have a pass in terms of the rental or the use of the school facilities, such as community organizations.

1370
01:57:49,845 --> 01:57:52,928
[SPEAKER_12]: How often, how frequently, so that we can fairly distribute them.

1371
01:57:53,488 --> 01:58:01,410
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a very involved process because there are many, many people who see the schools as a place where they can conduct their activities.

1372
01:58:02,151 --> 01:58:04,891
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're going to get a very comprehensive report.

1373
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,032
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be very thorough.

1374
01:58:06,132 --> 01:58:16,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe that when we come out of this school year, you're going to have something very, very well thought through and something that you will have had a very strong hand in developing.

1375
01:58:19,765 --> 01:58:30,134
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just simply going to say that I did not think that we needed a motion because we had already had a motion earlier for all the things that Mrs. DiBenedetto mentioned, and I think we're all in agreement.

1376
01:58:30,414 --> 01:58:38,641
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, in the report that the superintendent gave us, it says very clearly we have been working on a new policy and free structure since our last committee of the whole.

1377
01:58:38,981 --> 01:58:41,864
[SPEAKER_25]: We would expect to have it ready for your review by the first meeting in May.

1378
01:58:42,905 --> 01:58:45,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Any new policy should be carefully studied and approved for the next school year.

1379
01:58:45,887 --> 01:58:53,315
[SPEAKER_25]: So I definitely believe we're on the right track and appreciate the Attorney Greenspan for coming out tonight.

1380
01:58:54,999 --> 01:58:59,221
[SPEAKER_17]: In the interim, though, I know that we did have a resolution about the cages in particular.

1381
01:58:59,361 --> 01:59:10,566
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've been approached, the superintendent's been approached by Little Leagues and Babe Ruth that they'd like to have the ability to practice up there when and if the school is covered.

1382
01:59:10,586 --> 01:59:20,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd ask that my colleagues consider allowing our member baseball and softball leagues to be able to practice up in cages until that policy is developed.

1383
01:59:21,171 --> 01:59:23,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion, do you have a motion?

1384
01:59:23,052 --> 01:59:24,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval.

1385
01:59:26,869 --> 01:59:29,992
[SPEAKER_25]: So, which organizations exactly?

1386
01:59:30,272 --> 01:59:33,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Our Medford Little League, Babe Ruth, and our softball.

1387
01:59:33,776 --> 01:59:35,317
[SPEAKER_25]: With the fee structure or not?

1388
01:59:35,337 --> 01:59:39,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Without the fee structure, there are people on the premises.

1389
01:59:40,242 --> 01:59:41,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Without the fee structure at this point.

1390
01:59:44,748 --> 01:59:50,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Our goal would be to allow our community groups to have access while we are developing things.

1391
01:59:50,572 --> 01:59:55,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, going forward, you may decide that there needs to be a modest fee or some type of fee.

1392
01:59:56,315 --> 01:59:59,777
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the short period of time that they would be inside, remember, this is April.

1393
02:00:00,638 --> 02:00:08,002
[SPEAKER_12]: For the short period of time they would have to remain inside, we'd like to sort of not try to construct some sort of artificial fee structure.

1394
02:00:13,805 --> 02:00:14,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Not for the batting cages.

1395
02:00:14,886 --> 02:00:16,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Not for the batting cages.

1396
02:00:17,647 --> 02:00:20,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion of approval.

1397
02:00:21,308 --> 02:00:23,929
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval.

1398
02:00:23,970 --> 02:00:26,251
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1399
02:00:26,631 --> 02:00:28,031
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1400
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:29,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it on this motion?

1401
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:47,612
[SPEAKER_15]: The last seven years, I don't know if I could come up with that, but I certainly will go back and ask for certificates.

1402
02:00:47,712 --> 02:00:49,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Insurance liability.

1403
02:00:50,783 --> 02:00:52,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1404
02:00:52,843 --> 02:01:02,365
[SPEAKER_09]: In regards to letting people use it, can we get a list of people that we would be voting to let use our facilities free of charge?

1405
02:01:02,765 --> 02:01:07,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we voted that there would be a monitor there at the last meeting.

1406
02:01:07,866 --> 02:01:10,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So who would be paying for that monitor to be present?

1407
02:01:10,606 --> 02:01:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And who's going to open and close the facility and make sure that it's picked up?

1408
02:01:16,067 --> 02:01:19,348
[SPEAKER_09]: There's more than just letting people go in and out of the building.

1409
02:01:20,888 --> 02:01:32,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not comfortable voting yes on this, and I actually don't approve for this to happen.

1410
02:01:32,741 --> 02:01:40,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Until we figure out what we're doing, we should do that as quickly as we can so that community members can access our facilities.

1411
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:44,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But we want to make sure it's done in the correct and appropriate way.

1412
02:01:44,453 --> 02:01:48,397
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone gets hurt up there and there's not a monitor in place, who are we hiring?

1413
02:01:48,697 --> 02:01:49,478
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we doing?

1414
02:01:49,878 --> 02:01:54,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not comfortable moving forward with this, and I would like to table it this time.

1415
02:01:55,564 --> 02:01:57,786
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion to table the paper at this time.

1416
02:01:58,346 --> 02:01:59,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, all.

1417
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:03,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to table is undeniable.

1418
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:07,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like to withdraw your motion so that she can ask a question?

1419
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's not up to you.

1420
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:15,266
[SPEAKER_17]: It's up to the person that offered the motion.

1421
02:02:15,326 --> 02:02:15,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

1422
02:02:15,506 --> 02:02:15,646
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1423
02:02:15,666 --> 02:02:16,206
[SPEAKER_15]: It's undebatable.

1424
02:02:16,267 --> 02:02:17,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to table.

1425
02:02:18,128 --> 02:02:19,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote.

1426
02:02:19,349 --> 02:02:20,010
[SPEAKER_17]: It's undebatable.

1427
02:02:23,673 --> 02:02:25,915
[SPEAKER_17]: We had begun and then got interjected.

1428
02:02:25,975 --> 02:02:27,596
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we tabling here?

1429
02:02:29,057 --> 02:02:35,561
[SPEAKER_17]: allowing the Little League and the softball league to use the facility until the crisis developed.

1430
02:02:36,422 --> 02:02:41,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Or insurance, or staff was there.

1431
02:02:41,845 --> 02:02:45,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct, if you table this paper.

1432
02:02:45,247 --> 02:02:46,728
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion to table.

1433
02:02:47,789 --> 02:02:51,971
[SPEAKER_09]: They can use the gym as they used to before the cages were.

1434
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:53,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not so that they can't.

1435
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:53,792
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion to table.

1436
02:02:53,832 --> 02:02:54,653
[SPEAKER_17]: It's undebatable.

1437
02:02:54,693 --> 02:02:55,593
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to take the vote.

1438
02:02:55,834 --> 02:02:57,915
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how it works.

1439
02:02:58,542 --> 02:02:59,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Sperry, call the roll, please.

1440
02:02:59,683 --> 02:02:59,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1441
02:02:59,803 --> 02:03:00,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

1442
02:03:02,965 --> 02:03:03,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto.

1443
02:03:03,766 --> 02:03:04,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1444
02:03:04,486 --> 02:03:04,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1445
02:03:04,687 --> 02:03:04,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

1446
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:11,872
[SPEAKER_17]: We take no action tonight.

1447
02:03:11,932 --> 02:03:13,593
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's tabled, we take no action.

1448
02:03:16,615 --> 02:03:21,239
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to vote to table it.

1449
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:23,801
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to support the tabling or not to table it.

1450
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to discuss anything?

1451
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry, continue.

1452
02:03:29,768 --> 02:03:29,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1453
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:30,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Buston.

1454
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:36,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Skerry, no.

1455
02:03:36,510 --> 02:03:36,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1456
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:37,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

1457
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:38,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke.

1458
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:39,111
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1459
02:03:39,131 --> 02:03:41,432
[SPEAKER_17]: One in the affirmative, six in the negative.

1460
02:03:41,452 --> 02:03:43,932
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion to table fails.

1461
02:03:44,472 --> 02:03:45,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Now it's back on the floor.

1462
02:03:45,533 --> 02:03:48,374
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion for approval offered by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1463
02:03:48,414 --> 02:03:49,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Van der Kloot.

1464
02:03:49,734 --> 02:03:50,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, Mr. Skerry.

1465
02:03:50,754 --> 02:03:52,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Cunoz.

1466
02:03:53,415 --> 02:03:53,595
[SPEAKER_17]: On it.

1467
02:03:58,171 --> 02:03:58,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to call.

1468
02:03:59,531 --> 02:04:02,051
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion is, yeah.

1469
02:04:02,071 --> 02:04:02,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1470
02:04:02,332 --> 02:04:02,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

1471
02:04:03,252 --> 02:04:04,292
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion's been called.

1472
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:05,632
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the middle of taking the roll.

1473
02:04:05,652 --> 02:04:12,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Before the roll is delivered, then you can ask a question.

1474
02:04:12,134 --> 02:04:13,354
[SPEAKER_15]: I yield to my colleague.

1475
02:04:13,914 --> 02:04:14,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Yielded.

1476
02:04:14,594 --> 02:04:15,614
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been withdrawn.

1477
02:04:15,654 --> 02:04:18,135
[SPEAKER_17]: So my colleague is independent of herself.

1478
02:04:42,515 --> 02:04:44,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So here's the way it would work, okay?

1479
02:04:46,275 --> 02:04:57,199
[SPEAKER_12]: If you approve it this evening, we will contact the individuals who run these organizations and talk to them about what their schedules they would like to see.

1480
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:05,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will try to work their schedules into times where we have existing supervision in that part of the facility.

1481
02:05:06,302 --> 02:05:07,783
[SPEAKER_12]: To the extent that we don't,

1482
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:18,684
[SPEAKER_12]: We will calculate as to whether or not the cost of supervision is extraordinary enough to worry about it, or if it's just marginal in order to help community organizations.

1483
02:05:19,265 --> 02:05:24,207
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's small enough, we probably would absorb it under our normal operational costs.

1484
02:05:24,847 --> 02:05:31,430
[SPEAKER_12]: If it were extensive and they wanted to use it, then we would have to say we can't do it unless you're prepared to pay for that supervision.

1485
02:05:33,057 --> 02:05:52,395
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we obviously recognize the legitimacy of the concern, but at the same token, we're trying to say we want our community groups to feel wanted, while at the same time, we want to make sure that we understand that this is a temporary measure and that all things will be put in place and we'll ask for their cooperation.

1486
02:05:54,947 --> 02:06:02,774
[SPEAKER_25]: it would be appropriate to add an amendment on to the main motion that, and I forget the exact wording of the main motion.

1487
02:06:03,835 --> 02:06:19,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, but that the superintendent will follow up with the organizations to make sure that adequate supervision and custodial services and insurance will cover, are in place.

1488
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:32,293
[SPEAKER_18]: How many players could be upstairs in that cage at the same time?

1489
02:06:33,605 --> 02:06:38,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are guidelines, and I will ask the athletic director to inform me.

1490
02:06:39,167 --> 02:06:46,870
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have to make sure that the youth programs that are there are also informed, because I don't want, like, everyone up there at the same time.

1491
02:06:47,451 --> 02:06:52,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly, if anything does happen, who is responsible for that?

1492
02:06:52,393 --> 02:06:57,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it our school that would be responsible for that, or is it the youth organization that would be responsible for child welfare?

1493
02:06:57,715 --> 02:06:59,976
[SPEAKER_12]: When you say something happens, would we talk about injury?

1494
02:06:59,996 --> 02:07:00,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1495
02:07:01,276 --> 02:07:02,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So if an injury were to happen,

1496
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,361
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no gross negligence on our part.

1497
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:06,921
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not responsible.

1498
02:07:06,941 --> 02:07:08,521
[SPEAKER_12]: We're only responsible for gross negligence.

1499
02:07:09,022 --> 02:07:12,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mr. Greenspan can comment if, in fact, I miss something.

1500
02:07:12,043 --> 02:07:27,227
[SPEAKER_12]: But with regard to the issue of general negligence and the like, we would expect that the people who are running the program would be responsible and that our supervisor would follow the rules that we set in front of them.

1501
02:07:27,988 --> 02:07:43,484
[SPEAKER_18]: As a school committee member, I just want to make this very, very clear and as transparent as possible that if this goes, we vote on this tonight, one, we're doing this because we don't have the policy in place of the rates.

1502
02:07:44,185 --> 02:07:52,689
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't mean that once our rates are in place that all of a sudden, you know, every person under the sun is going to think that they're going to go back up there for free.

1503
02:07:53,330 --> 02:08:05,756
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't mean that every other sport or youth sport or whatever saying, well, gee, they got it for free, how come we can't get it for free for a certain amount of time if we're going to use the turf, or if we're going to use this, or if we're going to use that.

1504
02:08:06,076 --> 02:08:13,560
[SPEAKER_18]: This is under a certain circumstance because we don't have the rates in place and because of the situation that's at hand.

1505
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:27,828
[SPEAKER_18]: But I, you know, we definitely have to make sure that we have to have the, that people are being looked upon up there too, especially when we have children running around at all different ages.

1506
02:08:28,429 --> 02:08:29,930
[SPEAKER_18]: God forbid anyone does get hurt.

1507
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:38,775
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I know that you, with all due respect, you have given me the explanation of it, but you just never know when you have so many kids up there, and if there's not enough supervision,

1508
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:48,503
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's really not fair to put that on just our school system because our administrators and our teachers have a lot of responsibilities going on too.

1509
02:08:48,784 --> 02:08:59,333
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I know that if we're going to be talking about the April vacation right now, I know that we're going to be having the April vacation camp going on up there.

1510
02:08:59,773 --> 02:09:07,222
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't be expecting the Councilors that are doing the April vacation now overseeing or monitoring the cages.

1511
02:09:07,602 --> 02:09:10,045
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot of things that really need to take in place.

1512
02:09:10,425 --> 02:09:16,031
[SPEAKER_18]: It's wonderful that we want to help everyone out, but we definitely have to make sure that everything is in place.

1513
02:09:16,051 --> 02:09:16,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1514
02:09:17,556 --> 02:09:18,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1515
02:09:18,536 --> 02:09:18,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1516
02:09:19,297 --> 02:09:24,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I would like a list of exactly which, which community groups you would do.

1517
02:09:24,398 --> 02:09:32,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like to know if they're nonprofit before we vote on this as a school committee, we need to know who's using our facilities and what we're voting on.

1518
02:09:33,121 --> 02:09:35,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that's very important to me at this point.

1519
02:09:35,742 --> 02:09:42,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like only nonprofit Medford community organized groups to be able to, um,

1520
02:09:42,605 --> 02:09:46,167
[SPEAKER_09]: to use the cages during this transition time.

1521
02:09:46,507 --> 02:09:55,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also don't understand why they can't use one of the cages which is what they would have used had the batting cages not been set up.

1522
02:09:56,264 --> 02:09:59,946
[SPEAKER_12]: So the answer to that is you can have us do anything you want.

1523
02:10:00,446 --> 02:10:05,308
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just making a suggestion that it might be possible to help out community groups.

1524
02:10:05,889 --> 02:10:09,290
[SPEAKER_12]: We're referring to the youth baseball activities that are in the community.

1525
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:10,611
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all we're referring to.

1526
02:10:10,651 --> 02:10:12,612
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not referring to outside groups.

1527
02:10:12,652 --> 02:10:13,592
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not referring to anyone.

1528
02:10:13,612 --> 02:10:14,773
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just referring to youth groups.

1529
02:10:16,877 --> 02:10:24,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And who's going to make sure that that's the only people using these cages?

1530
02:10:24,323 --> 02:10:25,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Who has the key to the cages?

1531
02:10:26,165 --> 02:10:28,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And who will be unlocking them and locking them when they leave?

1532
02:10:28,347 --> 02:10:31,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's what has to be, you know, worked out in the final analysis.

1533
02:10:31,089 --> 02:10:36,074
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we get to talk to these people, we'd say, I'll call a meeting of them or ask them to come in.

1534
02:10:36,777 --> 02:10:40,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll ask for some scheduling possibilities that they might like to have.

1535
02:10:40,899 --> 02:10:41,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they don't want to do it.

1536
02:10:41,799 --> 02:10:43,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they'll turn around and say, you know, it's not worth it.

1537
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:46,781
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, if it's worth it to them, we'll schedule it.

1538
02:10:47,161 --> 02:10:50,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'll determine who's going to open and close and, you know, and supervise.

1539
02:10:51,235 --> 02:11:01,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, on Mr. Maloney's recommendation to have somebody up at the cage area at all times when they're in use.

1540
02:11:01,766 --> 02:11:07,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was going to be used to pay for that was the usage fees that we were going to make.

1541
02:11:08,233 --> 02:11:12,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that we don't have usage fees and we're giving this out free,

1542
02:11:14,108 --> 02:11:20,110
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to make sure that that policy is still in place, because we voted on that already, that that was our intent.

1543
02:11:20,651 --> 02:11:26,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make sure that that's happening, and I would like to know how those funds are going to be covered.

1544
02:11:26,553 --> 02:11:31,535
[SPEAKER_12]: All I said to you a little bit before was that if it's a small amount of money that's required,

1545
02:11:32,075 --> 02:11:33,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's not someone else up there.

1546
02:11:33,817 --> 02:11:36,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, there's three different batting cages.

1547
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:40,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So if our team is using one of them, somebody can use the other two.

1548
02:11:40,582 --> 02:11:42,224
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, or whatever the case may be.

1549
02:11:42,264 --> 02:11:48,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, if we can't cover it with someone who's already going to be there, we'll assess the cost.

1550
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:53,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's minor, you know, a few hundred dollars, you know, for a few, for a couple weeks, then we'll absorb it.

1551
02:11:53,834 --> 02:11:58,458
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not, then we'll not allow it or ask them to pay it.

1552
02:11:58,867 --> 02:12:00,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also have one last question.

1553
02:12:00,868 --> 02:12:07,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the fire marshal or anyone have to inspect that area and give us an estimate of how many students can fit up there safely at a time?

1554
02:12:08,313 --> 02:12:09,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how is that determined?

1555
02:12:10,234 --> 02:12:12,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's an acceptable facility of the school.

1556
02:12:12,515 --> 02:12:17,338
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point in time, you know, the fire department hasn't found any problem with our use of it.

1557
02:12:17,779 --> 02:12:18,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they seen it?

1558
02:12:19,179 --> 02:12:20,080
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been in the pool.

1559
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,041
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been in that entire area.

1560
02:12:21,061 --> 02:12:24,443
[SPEAKER_17]: They've cleared the fire alarm system that ran through that entire area.

1561
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:27,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're aware that students are up there in that area.

1562
02:12:28,713 --> 02:12:31,997
[SPEAKER_12]: At any time, if something were to go wrong, certainly they could come in and change their mind.

1563
02:12:32,037 --> 02:12:35,742
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as I'm concerned, they've cleared it.

1564
02:12:35,942 --> 02:12:40,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like a list of people who currently have keys to that area.

1565
02:12:40,447 --> 02:12:42,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to check on that with Mr. Malone.

1566
02:12:42,773 --> 02:12:46,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, I'd appreciate that information, and I'll add that to the list.

1567
02:12:46,096 --> 02:12:54,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I could suggest that the Building and Grounds Committee receive this packet and start to do its work on this topic and set the rates.

1568
02:12:54,423 --> 02:12:55,484
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe Mr. Woodhouse is here.

1569
02:12:55,544 --> 02:12:56,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you're working on it.

1570
02:12:56,866 --> 02:12:57,947
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got a report coming in.

1571
02:12:57,987 --> 02:13:06,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Greenspan, you're going to be sent to the Buildings and Grounds Committee before we know what recommendations it has to receive.

1572
02:13:08,449 --> 02:13:16,837
[SPEAKER_15]: We already have a motion with an amendment on the floor.

1573
02:13:27,088 --> 02:13:28,569
[SPEAKER_12]: It's already been sent, we call it, to us.

1574
02:13:28,589 --> 02:13:30,071
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to bring you back a report.

1575
02:13:30,811 --> 02:13:32,432
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you want to send that back.

1576
02:13:32,573 --> 02:13:42,100
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion with the amendment had to do with the outside groups using the cages for the next short period of time.

1577
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:42,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1578
02:13:42,961 --> 02:13:44,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I just clarified a few ways.

1579
02:13:44,162 --> 02:13:49,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this may be two subcommittees, although we can roll on it.

1580
02:13:49,506 --> 02:13:50,667
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have to roll on it.

1581
02:13:50,687 --> 02:13:52,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Two separate, this is the same.

1582
02:13:52,369 --> 02:13:53,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that'll work.

1583
02:13:54,935 --> 02:14:06,583
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion to allow Medford Little League Softball and Baseball to utilize the cages for a nominal cost for the remainder of the term until policy and pricing is developed is one amendment.

1584
02:14:06,643 --> 02:14:11,146
[SPEAKER_17]: And also to send this paper to the subcommittee on building and grounds.

1585
02:14:11,406 --> 02:14:11,886
[SPEAKER_25]: A further one.

1586
02:14:11,906 --> 02:14:14,528
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have a citizen who's been waiting to speak.

1587
02:14:14,568 --> 02:14:15,789
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you wanting to speak on this?

1588
02:14:15,809 --> 02:14:16,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Your name, please.

1589
02:14:16,809 --> 02:14:17,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1590
02:14:17,129 --> 02:14:18,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Jean Martins on Cumming Street.

1591
02:14:20,735 --> 02:14:24,719
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to win this argument because the love of money is the root of all evil.

1592
02:14:24,759 --> 02:14:28,063
[SPEAKER_24]: But schools are built for kids, and that's my opinion.

1593
02:14:28,143 --> 02:14:30,445
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want my opinion on the record.

1594
02:14:30,485 --> 02:14:39,895
[SPEAKER_24]: So if a city near us, Melrose, Malden, their kids want to use our facilities for basketball practice or whatever, and they want to pay us for it, I'm good with that.

1595
02:14:39,915 --> 02:14:43,638
[SPEAKER_24]: I personally am against having adults from strange groups

1596
02:14:44,599 --> 02:14:48,201
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just, there's too many corners.

1597
02:14:48,761 --> 02:14:49,521
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a concern.

1598
02:14:49,541 --> 02:14:50,962
[SPEAKER_24]: I know I'm not going to win.

1599
02:14:51,022 --> 02:14:58,265
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that you're going to rent out the schools, but I want it on the record that I don't agree with having outside groups, especially if they're religious groups.

1600
02:14:59,157 --> 02:15:06,561
[SPEAKER_24]: in public buildings, and I just want that to go on the record, that there's a lot of issues, and I can't agree with Ms.

1601
02:15:06,581 --> 02:15:09,323
[SPEAKER_24]: DiBenedetto-Born and Ms.

1602
02:15:09,343 --> 02:15:09,783
[SPEAKER_24]: Coutinho.

1603
02:15:10,144 --> 02:15:12,585
[SPEAKER_24]: These concerns are real, and they need to be addressed.

1604
02:15:13,205 --> 02:15:15,427
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I just thank you very much for listening.

1605
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:23,452
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like the idea of outside groups of adults milling that we don't know anything about, milling around these schools, unsupervised,

1606
02:15:24,552 --> 02:15:34,674
[SPEAKER_24]: it's bad enough when the kids come in, what they could possibly do, you know, terrorize the school, graffiti, whatever, you know, it's bad enough when the kids are doing it.

1607
02:15:34,714 --> 02:15:37,815
[SPEAKER_24]: So we don't need to add fuel to the flames.

1608
02:15:37,835 --> 02:15:38,655
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's my opinion.

1609
02:15:38,695 --> 02:15:39,575
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you very much.

1610
02:15:40,295 --> 02:15:41,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1611
02:15:42,276 --> 02:15:43,076
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion.

1612
02:15:44,016 --> 02:15:45,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Scari, please call the roll.

1613
02:15:50,258 --> 02:15:51,218
[SPEAKER_17]: To allow the little league.

1614
02:15:52,453 --> 02:15:53,734
[SPEAKER_17]: And to send it to subcommittee.

1615
02:15:53,774 --> 02:15:54,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1616
02:15:54,315 --> 02:15:54,395
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1617
02:16:04,743 --> 02:16:06,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1618
02:16:06,404 --> 02:16:09,687
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion passes.

1619
02:16:09,707 --> 02:16:09,847
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1620
02:16:16,511 --> 02:16:18,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I've asked you this question before.

1621
02:16:18,632 --> 02:16:22,435
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to take you back up to the high school or any of our schools and visit them.

1622
02:16:22,835 --> 02:16:24,276
[SPEAKER_18]: There is really no more graffiti.

1623
02:16:25,217 --> 02:16:34,403
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of the things that you have seen many, many years ago don't exist anymore and I would love to take you up there or you could go up there on your own and see that our schools

1624
02:16:34,543 --> 02:16:37,765
[SPEAKER_18]: have changed a lot, and you'd be very proud of what our kids do today.

1625
02:16:38,126 --> 02:16:58,480
[SPEAKER_18]: And as you can see tonight, winning first place in a contest against Lexington, or having one of our science students come up and winning such a wonderful award and going to WPI, it's not the schools of yesterday, it's the schools of the future, and we're very proud of it.

1626
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,221
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to let you know that.

1627
02:17:00,541 --> 02:17:01,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

1628
02:17:01,281 --> 02:17:02,922
[SPEAKER_18]: But I still stand by the principle.

1629
02:17:02,942 --> 02:17:03,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand.

1630
02:17:03,523 --> 02:17:05,424
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to make sure that I tell you.

1631
02:17:05,444 --> 02:17:05,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1632
02:17:05,984 --> 02:17:06,464
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1633
02:17:06,524 --> 02:17:07,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1634
02:17:07,104 --> 02:17:07,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1635
02:17:08,445 --> 02:17:11,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to move item nine to the end of the agenda.

1636
02:17:11,167 --> 02:17:11,887
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1637
02:17:11,927 --> 02:17:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1638
02:17:12,027 --> 02:17:13,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Opposed?

1639
02:17:13,568 --> 02:17:14,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1640
02:17:15,349 --> 02:17:16,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Old business.

1641
02:17:16,109 --> 02:17:21,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Authorization to submit letter to our legislative delegation recommending rejection of a chartered cab lift.

1642
02:17:22,312 --> 02:17:23,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent.

1643
02:17:23,492 --> 02:17:47,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, at a previous meeting you asked me to draft a letter that to some degree paraphrased the letter sent by the Ludlow School Committee to our legislative delegation with regard to the Charter School cap lift, recommending that the legislature reject that particular item.

1644
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:52,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, specifically, the State Senate,

1645
02:17:53,737 --> 02:17:56,798
[SPEAKER_12]: passed a bill the other day through the Senate.

1646
02:17:57,398 --> 02:18:16,504
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't legislative, it isn't law, but it passed through the Senate, which is a comprehensive approach to the charter school issues that have been discussed throughout the Commonwealth, much more broadly based than some other discussions have been, and dealing with much more than the charter cap lift.

1647
02:18:18,044 --> 02:18:20,105
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be some debate on Beacon Hill.

1648
02:18:22,226 --> 02:18:38,437
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe that the Senate bill in its entirety is going to be accepted by the House or approved by the Governor, but there may be elements of it that are acceptable by the House and by the Senate, and maybe even by the Governor down the road.

1649
02:18:38,497 --> 02:18:44,742
[SPEAKER_12]: But certainly, the House and the Senate would probably get together and have a discussion about it.

1650
02:18:46,783 --> 02:18:49,105
[SPEAKER_12]: From our standpoint, I drafted a letter.

1651
02:18:50,057 --> 02:18:56,562
[SPEAKER_12]: which would be consistent with it, but it wasn't done in the context of the Senate's passage of this bill.

1652
02:18:57,683 --> 02:19:06,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask that you study this material, and maybe I would draft another letter since this is going to be a pending discussion going forward.

1653
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:12,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think that the letter that I originally drafted for you is probably a little bit out of date,

1654
02:19:15,635 --> 02:19:21,437
[SPEAKER_12]: the fact that there is a change in what's going on on Beacon Hill.

1655
02:19:21,957 --> 02:19:27,399
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll do whatever you want, but I think that there's quite a bit of ferment going on.

1656
02:19:27,419 --> 02:19:37,182
[SPEAKER_12]: And it may be that the Rise Act that is consistent with the charter school legislation is something you want to take into consideration.

1657
02:19:37,702 --> 02:19:43,104
[SPEAKER_12]: The letter that I drafted for you is on the back page, the last page of this.

1658
02:19:44,104 --> 02:19:49,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you haven't had a chance to read it, maybe you should take a few seconds and read it.

1659
02:19:50,370 --> 02:19:59,879
[SPEAKER_12]: But it paraphrases or closely paraphrases the letter that was sent from Ludlow with a few changes that reflect more of a Medford issue.

1660
02:19:59,919 --> 02:20:05,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Because since our issues are not totally Ludlow's issues and our numbers are slightly different.

1661
02:20:09,555 --> 02:20:17,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to tell you that the preliminary numbers on charter schools have been posted by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1662
02:20:18,017 --> 02:20:21,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year we have 344 students attending charter schools.

1663
02:20:21,838 --> 02:20:28,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Next year the department is projecting we have 315, a substantial reduction of 29 students.

1664
02:20:28,539 --> 02:20:33,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's not necessarily a final number, it could be a change up or down.

1665
02:20:33,865 --> 02:20:48,694
[SPEAKER_12]: But it certainly is a trend that we were hoping for because obviously that puts junctures back in our schools and also deals with money as opposed to it going outside of our schools.

1666
02:20:49,975 --> 02:20:54,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So happy to answer any questions you have or continue the discussion.

1667
02:20:56,643 --> 02:21:08,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Since it was my recommendation to have this letter drafted, I would say to go ahead to the superintendent, make the edits that are needed.

1668
02:21:08,866 --> 02:21:14,747
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do ask that we send out the letter as soon as possible because it has been dragging for a couple of weeks.

1669
02:21:14,868 --> 02:21:23,129
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess it's better that now we have the updated information and we have the information on the letter that coincides with it.

1670
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:24,370
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'd like to get this

1671
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:27,951
[SPEAKER_18]: ready to go as soon as possible.

1672
02:21:28,711 --> 02:21:28,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1673
02:21:29,932 --> 02:21:36,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also want to say that, you know, we have a meeting May 2nd, so that I would probably bring it back to you for approval on May 2nd.

1674
02:21:36,814 --> 02:21:52,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Then I would ask respectfully that I know there was a concern at the last meeting with one of my colleagues, and I hope that you will have an answer, if not tonight, but at least by May 2nd, so we can approve this and let it go.

1675
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:54,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1676
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:54,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1677
02:21:55,620 --> 02:22:01,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get a ruling from the state ethics, and I am allowed to vote on this issue.

1678
02:22:01,281 --> 02:22:12,384
[SPEAKER_09]: But at this time, I would like to go with the superintendent's request in this report is to withhold the letter due to the changes that are taking place.

1679
02:22:13,144 --> 02:22:19,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure that those might be complete by the May 2nd, because it will have to go to the House's representative.

1680
02:22:19,566 --> 02:22:21,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a great bill on the floor.

1681
02:22:22,846 --> 02:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_09]: There are great parts of it, but there are parts that need

1682
02:22:26,027 --> 02:22:34,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I've read the whole bill that needs some tweaking and some changing, and I believe that that's going to happen in the House of Representatives, and then again at the Statehouse.

1683
02:22:34,972 --> 02:22:38,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we send this, it might not be good timing.

1684
02:22:38,634 --> 02:22:39,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already in debate there.

1685
02:22:40,455 --> 02:22:47,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, we could write a letter based on what we think the bill is like, and that's, I think, more relevant.

1686
02:22:51,076 --> 02:22:57,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't necessarily based on just what the Senate was going to say or the House was going to say.

1687
02:22:58,324 --> 02:23:07,292
[SPEAKER_18]: The letter was supposed to be based on how it reflects us as a district and how a charter school or the charter schools will reflect us as a district.

1688
02:23:08,193 --> 02:23:17,896
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm saying it's imperative that I mean the whole Commonwealth is already signed on board and have already written their own letters I think it's imperative that we write our own letter.

1689
02:23:17,956 --> 02:23:36,503
[SPEAKER_18]: We have already been sitting on this for a while I agree with the superintendent that we do our edits, but I really don't want to hold on to this until you know Everyone starts agreeing because if we're going to write if we're going to write a letter until everyone agrees We'll be sitting on this letter for the next 10 years So I don't believe

1690
02:23:37,323 --> 02:23:44,007
[SPEAKER_12]: that necessarily we're going to get agreement in a short period of time with the legislature and with the governor and everyone else like that.

1691
02:23:44,087 --> 02:23:50,932
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do believe that there are some pieces in the Senate's legislation that we should be supportive of.

1692
02:23:51,652 --> 02:23:55,055
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for example, within the Senate's legislation is full funding.

1693
02:23:56,588 --> 02:24:00,511
[SPEAKER_12]: the school districts, as opposed to partial funding that we're getting now.

1694
02:24:01,011 --> 02:24:08,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Within the Senate's piece, there is a piece that calls for a reimbursement formula that's more realistic.

1695
02:24:08,938 --> 02:24:13,201
[SPEAKER_12]: So reality-wise, we should probably want to reference those items.

1696
02:24:13,501 --> 02:24:20,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I'm not going to reference the items about good, bad, or indifferent about charter schools, because that's not what I think you're asking me to do.

1697
02:24:22,268 --> 02:24:29,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to be sure that we're able to be on record as saying is that there is a bill out there that is asking for full funding.

1698
02:24:30,278 --> 02:24:31,980
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a bill that is asking for that.

1699
02:24:33,998 --> 02:24:40,680
[SPEAKER_12]: that there be reporting, that individuals would know who's going and who's not going, that there be better demographics taken across the board.

1700
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:44,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Not necessarily, some schools have done well, but other schools have not done well.

1701
02:24:44,562 --> 02:24:53,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I think those are things that we should want to be on record and show that we're knowledgeable of the latest things that are being discussed on the Hill, as opposed to being four weeks behind.

1702
02:24:54,783 --> 02:25:10,850
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that that's, you know, I think that makes us much sound much more intelligent when we present a letter to the Commonwealth saying that we're aware of what's being discussed rather than we wrote something a month ago and still sending it.

1703
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:18,433
[SPEAKER_25]: I certainly understand what you're saying, um, Mr. Superintendent, but the only concern I have is that our May 2nd meeting is three weeks off.

1704
02:25:19,314 --> 02:25:20,214
[SPEAKER_25]: So in three weeks off,

1705
02:25:20,815 --> 02:25:37,445
[SPEAKER_25]: you know, right now, I mean, part of the, I think that part of the intent initially was that you go on record and you say, at least for the, the intent of the motion would be that we're against any legislation that raises the current

1706
02:25:38,405 --> 02:25:40,825
[SPEAKER_25]: current cap on charter schools.

1707
02:25:41,246 --> 02:25:46,206
[SPEAKER_25]: And then secondarily, we are for full funding of the foundation budget.

1708
02:25:46,626 --> 02:25:48,387
[SPEAKER_25]: I really think that that's what it comes down to.

1709
02:25:48,847 --> 02:25:55,388
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just concerned that we're now talking about saying you're going to bring us back something in three weeks after the debate is all done.

1710
02:25:55,988 --> 02:26:06,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Perhaps it would make more sense to, and you know, I don't know whether what the vote of this committee would be on those two very simply put items.

1711
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:08,431
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I put it very simply.

1712
02:26:09,171 --> 02:26:15,695
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are scheduling a committee of the whole on April 25th, that's a week sooner.

1713
02:26:16,335 --> 02:26:19,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, we still happen to have vacation week in between this then.

1714
02:26:19,157 --> 02:26:22,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but what I would do is I would send it out to you well in advance.

1715
02:26:23,099 --> 02:26:28,162
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd draft it this week and send it out to you over the vacation period and let you look at it.

1716
02:26:28,242 --> 02:26:34,105
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it came in April 25th, we'd make it a standalone item along with the committee of the whole reports.

1717
02:26:34,855 --> 02:26:36,676
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could go from there, that would be a week earlier.

1718
02:26:36,716 --> 02:26:41,138
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do think you should have some of the latest stuff.

1719
02:26:41,218 --> 02:26:46,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't think you should be talking about things that may not be in play right now going forward.

1720
02:26:48,642 --> 02:26:54,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, well, we obviously all can still talk to our legislators separately.

1721
02:26:54,425 --> 02:26:59,387
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that bringing it forth to us the week sooner at the Committee of the Whole would make a lot of sense.

1722
02:27:00,748 --> 02:27:01,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1723
02:27:03,718 --> 02:27:05,158
[SPEAKER_18]: We're discussing April 25th.

1724
02:27:06,099 --> 02:27:08,299
[SPEAKER_18]: April 26th is Day of the Hill.

1725
02:27:08,499 --> 02:27:16,241
[SPEAKER_18]: If any of my colleagues would like to join us at the state house, please register or please contact the superintendent.

1726
02:27:16,961 --> 02:27:20,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is the day you definitely want to come and advocate.

1727
02:27:21,122 --> 02:27:24,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Please do it soon so I can really reach them and get you in.

1728
02:27:25,452 --> 02:27:26,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1729
02:27:26,633 --> 02:27:27,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1730
02:27:28,654 --> 02:27:36,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Through you to the superintendent, I agree with you regarding this issue because there is so many changes taking place right now.

1731
02:27:37,258 --> 02:27:40,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a copy of the bill that was passed in the Senate.

1732
02:27:40,979 --> 02:27:47,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Pat Jalen was kind enough to send that to me and asked me to go over a few things and my opinions with her.

1733
02:27:49,363 --> 02:27:51,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll be doing that in the next few weeks.

1734
02:27:53,732 --> 02:28:00,134
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really think that we as a school committee want to represent ourselves as educated as possible.

1735
02:28:00,174 --> 02:28:02,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll be happy to forward that to you.

1736
02:28:02,514 --> 02:28:05,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can then forward it on to the other colleagues.

1737
02:28:05,135 --> 02:28:07,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they want to review what's on there now.

1738
02:28:08,015 --> 02:28:11,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see some valid points about reimbursement.

1739
02:28:12,196 --> 02:28:19,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And this bill is very important because it brings up the conversation that needs to be had throughout the state.

1740
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:29,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also has a few things in there that really, really aren't in the best light for either side.

1741
02:28:29,613 --> 02:28:37,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I plan on sitting with our state senator and talking to her about that as an individual.

1742
02:28:40,004 --> 02:28:51,548
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really agree with you, Superintendent, about being really aware of what's going on out there before we send a letter that makes us look like we're a few weeks behind.

1743
02:28:51,568 --> 02:28:56,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I may also mention that I gave you an article this evening, it was in the American Prospect.

1744
02:28:57,290 --> 02:29:04,533
[SPEAKER_12]: The individual who wrote the article used to write for Commonwealth Magazine, now writes as a deputy editor for

1745
02:29:06,253 --> 02:29:12,058
[SPEAKER_12]: American Prospect, which is a very progressive publication out of Washington.

1746
02:29:12,679 --> 02:29:20,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert Kuttner, Robert Reich are, you know, part of the editorial board of this particular group.

1747
02:29:20,946 --> 02:29:23,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's fairly strong.

1748
02:29:24,749 --> 02:29:26,951
[SPEAKER_12]: magazine, if you will, or commentary.

1749
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:29,093
[SPEAKER_12]: But it talks about the great diversion.

1750
02:29:29,153 --> 02:29:32,316
[SPEAKER_12]: It talks about the money moving away from the traditional schools.

1751
02:29:33,017 --> 02:29:36,680
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not passing judgment on whether or not charters are good, bad, or indifferent.

1752
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:42,285
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just asking the question, can you support two school systems with a finite amount of money?

1753
02:29:42,786 --> 02:29:45,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really sort of the harder part of this discussion.

1754
02:29:46,630 --> 02:29:47,510
[SPEAKER_12]: can we really do that?

1755
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:57,633
[SPEAKER_12]: So I recommend you read it and become familiar because there's a lot of stuff going on that's affecting other communities, not affecting us as much right now, but it could going forward.

1756
02:29:58,053 --> 02:30:03,035
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's the kind of discussion that's going to happen over the next several months, especially if it goes to a ballot question.

1757
02:30:03,635 --> 02:30:06,976
[SPEAKER_12]: So you need to know these things, and it's important that you stay up on it.

1758
02:30:09,117 --> 02:30:09,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1759
02:30:11,878 --> 02:30:12,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto?

1760
02:30:14,163 --> 02:30:21,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry and I had the opportunity to meet with a few of our state representatives regarding a homeless transportation issue.

1761
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:26,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only in our community, but the whole homeless situation as a whole.

1762
02:30:26,875 --> 02:30:31,479
[SPEAKER_09]: So Representative Christine Barber is actually working on an amendment to

1763
02:30:33,329 --> 02:30:48,867
[SPEAKER_09]: this year's budget to really look at it and create a committee at the state level on looking at how vouchers are given out, maybe a district-wide list of students, and really trying to place

1764
02:30:49,327 --> 02:30:52,810
[SPEAKER_09]: families close to where children go to school.

1765
02:30:53,991 --> 02:31:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity to meet with her again this week, and Mrs. Skerry was able to come to the last meeting.

1766
02:31:00,896 --> 02:31:07,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be meeting with her and maybe speaking there about homelessness.

1767
02:31:07,441 --> 02:31:15,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the superintendent presented us a few weeks, maybe two months ago, with an amount of like $71,000 the district had paid.

1768
02:31:16,287 --> 02:31:18,529
[SPEAKER_09]: for homeless transportation at that point.

1769
02:31:18,609 --> 02:31:22,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is at this point, and I know it's growing every day and the cost of it.

1770
02:31:22,691 --> 02:31:36,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really want to take an active role in being proactive with those funds and keeping people in their homes rather than paying for them to be housed and transported to school after they've been presented homeless.

1771
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:42,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to give you an update on that and to let you know that work is being done.

1772
02:31:42,704 --> 02:31:48,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll continue to update you as things progress.

1773
02:31:48,627 --> 02:31:54,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The rep was going to put our notes together and write up the amendment and send it to me.

1774
02:32:01,832 --> 02:32:03,373
[SPEAKER_09]: school vacation as well.

1775
02:32:03,713 --> 02:32:13,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So there might be a little bit of delay in some of the progress with this, the bill that we were talking about previously, and this as well.

1776
02:32:13,118 --> 02:32:15,339
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are moving forward with this.

1777
02:32:15,559 --> 02:32:28,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And the superintendent's been nice enough to offer to provide me some more data, so that way we can really help the homeless children, not only in the city of Medford, but in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and their families as well.

1778
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:32,184
[SPEAKER_12]: We are putting data together for you based on your request.

1779
02:32:32,725 --> 02:32:33,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1780
02:32:33,726 --> 02:32:34,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1781
02:32:40,809 --> 02:32:46,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Carol Caroni Mastromaro.

1782
02:32:46,552 --> 02:32:52,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Carol was a graduate of Medford High School, class of 1967, and also a history teacher at Medford High School for many years.

1783
02:32:53,815 --> 02:32:59,717
[SPEAKER_17]: School committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Marjorie Bennett.

1784
02:33:00,098 --> 02:33:04,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Mrs. Bennett was a lifelong Medford resident and secretary for Medford High School for many years.

1785
02:33:04,379 --> 02:33:06,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you all please rise and take a moment of silence?

1786
02:33:20,428 --> 02:33:30,451
[SPEAKER_12]: While we're up, I also heard today that the passing of Linda Houston, who once was a secretary of the school.

1787
02:33:30,492 --> 02:33:32,632
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a member of the DePasquale family.

1788
02:33:33,552 --> 02:33:36,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And I met her, so if you could take another second.

1789
02:33:36,653 --> 02:33:36,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1790
02:33:36,933 --> 02:33:46,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

1791
02:33:46,756 --> 02:33:48,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Negotiations and legal matters.

1792
02:33:53,176 --> 02:33:54,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a couple of quick things for you.

1793
02:33:55,197 --> 02:34:00,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'll send you out information on our beginning of the pre-budget season on April 25th.

1794
02:34:00,419 --> 02:34:02,680
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll send out the materials early next week.

1795
02:34:03,372 --> 02:34:14,497
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll have them to go over and begin to look at various departments and programs to give you a preview of the kinds of concerns we may have going into budget, so you can begin to ask questions about that.

1796
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:27,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally, in the back of your packet, we have the responses that I sent to the city council based on the various things that they had asked over the last

1797
02:34:28,692 --> 02:34:32,473
[SPEAKER_12]: a few months with regard to security and substance abuse and the like.

1798
02:34:32,913 --> 02:34:39,714
[SPEAKER_12]: So please review that so that if you're asked whether or not we sent that, this used to be, you know, some question as to what we did, we did.

1799
02:34:40,454 --> 02:34:51,496
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing is, is that some of you were able to attend, but I do have some information from Robert Brooks, who spoke at the Symposium on Addiction.

1800
02:34:51,556 --> 02:34:53,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was an excellent program.

1801
02:34:54,196 --> 02:34:57,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that some people made it, approximately 80, 90 people there.

1802
02:34:59,314 --> 02:35:00,815
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought some of the things went well.

1803
02:35:00,915 --> 02:35:14,258
[SPEAKER_12]: We would have liked more people to have been there, but I understand that's Saturday, and sometimes it doesn't work, but it's an important activity, and it does continue our efforts to inform the community about these matters and keep them involved.

1804
02:35:14,318 --> 02:35:25,241
[SPEAKER_12]: You all know that the play was this past weekend, and many of you attended, and I know that you've all told me how wonderful it was, and I think that, you know, it's another

1805
02:35:25,874 --> 02:35:32,157
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an important accomplishment of our young people, so I think it's important that we recognize them at some point going forward.

1806
02:35:32,237 --> 02:35:39,159
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion to go into executive session to discuss legal matters and negotiations.

1807
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:41,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Skerry, please call the roll.

1808
02:35:47,983 --> 02:35:49,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1809
02:35:49,984 --> 02:35:53,225
[SPEAKER_17]: We will now go into executive session, and we will end the meeting.

1810
02:35:53,905 --> 02:35:55,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have to come off for a moment.
