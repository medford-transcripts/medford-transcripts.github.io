00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,132
All right, thanks so much for being here with me today.

10
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:45,275
Today's the day before the day before Christmas.

11
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:46,536
So thanks for making the time.

12
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,598
If we could just start by introducing yourself.

13
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:53,101
So if you could say your name, your pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

14
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,144
Sure.

15
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,185
My name is Diane Noel.

16
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:58,986
She, hers.

17
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:06,552
I am a mom in Medford that is interested in starting or continuing the wrestling program.

18
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,594
Thank you.

19
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,693
I am Marella Zaccaraccio.

20
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:23,059
I'm she, her, and also a mom in Medford and wanting to really see this program take off and, you know, do great things at the high school level.

21
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,860
Well, thank you both.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,281
Yeah.

23
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,942
I'm interested in hearing a lot more about wrestling today.

24
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:36,467
Before we get into that, though, I'm going to ask you both the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

25
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:38,260
Nice.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,102
So I'm from Medford.

27
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,787
I have a lifelong history with Medford, so it's tough to pick.

28
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,970
So I'm going to go with a classic.

29
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:53,681
And I choose Bocelli's, which used to be Di Pasquale's when I was growing up, but it's always been a pizza place.

30
00:01:54,582 --> 00:02:00,764
Um, and the thing I like to eat there, uh, everything there is good, but my favorite is actually the sea bass piccata.

31
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:10,728
Um, I know it's like tough to get and it's always so good and it's a surprising, um, item on the menu, but it's my favorite thing there.

32
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:11,408
So.

33
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,409
That one has not come up yet that specific.

34
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:15,830
I'll have to try it.

35
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,510
It sounds really good.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,090
Yeah.

37
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,392
It's seasonal, so you're not going to get sea bass all the time, but, um, it's worth it.

38
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,593
It's worth it if you get it.

39
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:23,773
Thank you.

40
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:24,724
Yeah.

41
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:27,705
My favorite restaurant.

42
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:28,045
Hmm.

43
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:34,666
Well, I have to say I really like Real Gusto.

44
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:45,429
There isn't much I don't like on their menu, but I really like, I like their pizzas because I like that gourmet-ishy type of pizza.

45
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:47,209
So, yeah.

46
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,487
Yeah, that's a favorite spot of ours, too.

47
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:55,013
I think it's encouraging, though, to hear you guys have older kids talk about places that don't only serve pizza.

48
00:02:55,053 --> 00:03:00,238
I feel like that's how we eat with little kids, who has what they'll eat.

49
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,620
So great.

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,080
Well, thank you.

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,162
So we're here to talk about wrestling.

52
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:09,387
So I wonder if you guys could just give us a little bit of an introduction about what wrestling is.

53
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,554
Yeah, so wrestling, just a quick intro.

54
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,975
So wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world.

55
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:25,696
Literally, it was, you know, in Greek and Roman times, it was a competition between, you know, two individuals.

56
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,717
It is the sixth most popular high school sport in the United States.

57
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:36,058
It is open to boys and people of all genders.

58
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,119
The team in Medford is actually

59
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,279
mixed gender team.

60
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,528
It is based on weight class.

61
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,037
And so you can have

62
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,243
kids as low as like 90 pounds up to 285 plus.

63
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:59,788
It's an individual sport in that it's, you know, you compete against one other person, but it's also a team sport.

64
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:02,310
So the team has an overall score.

65
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:11,517
It's a great sport if you are into calisthenics or boxing or hitting the gym.

66
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:17,642
It's a good sport if you are into an individual sport

67
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,828
competing individually while also being recognized on a team.

68
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,452
A fabulous way to stay in shape in the winter.

69
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:28,418
It's a winter sport, you know, when there's not a lot else going on.

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,563
So yeah, Marilla, would you add anything to that?

71
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,586
Oh, if you love a little combat.

72
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:35,267
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:47,896
If you like structured chaos, it's yeah, I think that you can see it provides this sense of confidence.

74
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,279
And I feel like

75
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,246
people just love it when they get into it.

76
00:04:56,386 --> 00:05:07,850
You know, it's just, I don't know if it's an adrenaline rush or what it brings on, but there's this self-empowerment that happens and it's, yeah.

77
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,471
And then they hug at the end.

78
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,192
Yeah, that's very, yeah, very important.

79
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:18,974
They also, it also is, the coaches say that, and the kids will say that it's as much mental as it is physical.

80
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:21,455
So it's a lot about your head space

81
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:29,701
And yeah, as Marilla said, like your confidence and perseverance, um, it's very intense to watch.

82
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:39,225
It's like these huge bursts of energy, like two minutes at a time and inches and seconds last like forever.

83
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:40,946
Um, yeah.

84
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:42,927
So very popular, very exciting.

85
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,748
Um, it's an awesome sport.

86
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:46,483
Thank you.

87
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:50,385
Yeah, we have a lot of informal wrestling matches just on the floor here.

88
00:05:50,425 --> 00:06:01,691
So, yeah, I think that, you know, we've talked to some other folks on the podcast about team sports and sort of the benefits of having kids play together on teams.

89
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,872
It sounds like what you're describing wrestling as those like are pretty inclusive.

90
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:11,276
It sounds like all body types are welcome, all genders, and that there's a sort of competition

91
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:33,336
um with with your team but also with yourself and so i'm wondering what like i know you both of your kids are wrestlers and sort of what you know why that was important to them why it's important to you why you think wrestling is important to the kids in medford yeah for sure so my son personally um was

92
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:46,626
We had played team sports growing up, you know, soccer, baseball, basketball, and you know he enjoyed them but when when the pandemic came sort of all sports stopped.

93
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,233
And he was also middle school so that by the time he gets high school, sort of reevaluated.

94
00:06:52,188 --> 00:07:00,517
What was going on, and he had also during the pandemic gotten really into like weightlifting and boxing so things you can do like by yourself in your garage or whatever.

95
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,622
And so he wasn't really gravitating toward a team sport at that point.

96
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:13,971
But of course, you know, us as parents, my husband and I really wanted him to be involved with the high school and, you know, find something.

97
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:25,375
that was sports related, because we really believe that sports teaches you so much beyond just winning and being an athlete.

98
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,457
It's just great for life.

99
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:34,086
So he had said, I don't know, if I could do anything, if I could do any sport, it would be wrestling.

100
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,220
And Medford didn't have a wrestling team at that point.

101
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,504
So I had reached out to the athletic director and asked how we could get involved in starting a wrestling program.

102
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:53,029
Because when I went to Medford High back in the nineties, eighties and nineties, there was a wrestling team, but for whatever reason it sort of dissolved.

103
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,392
So at that point, Bobby Maloney, the athletic director said, well, he could co-op with Malden.

104
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:03,258
Um, there's a GBL co-op and there's a coach over there and kids over there.

105
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,260
So, um, that's how our journey started.

106
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:12,085
The reason why it was great for our son, uh, is because it was just what he was looking for.

107
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:24,094
He, he wanted something where he could individually compete, um, that involves strength and perseverance, but where winning and losing was entirely on him.

108
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,007
And it really is the perfect sport for him.

109
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:30,793
He, it's a challenging sport.

110
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:32,457
It's very physically demanding.

111
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,912
but he loves it.

112
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,174
And even though it's an individual sport, there's a huge sense of community.

113
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,576
The team itself is very tightly bonded.

114
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,560
And you're talking about kids who in other sports are competed against each other, right?

115
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,142
So this is Malden, Everett, Chelsea, it's the GBL co-op.

116
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:54,765
So these are all the kids we compete against throughout the year.

117
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,426
But for wrestling, we're all on the same team.

118
00:08:57,447 --> 00:09:02,410
And it's a wonderful community, it's very welcoming.

119
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,835
Um, but it's also, yeah, great for, um, perfect fit for my son.

120
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:11,938
Okay.

121
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:23,407
So, so Chris is, you know, the last of three and all my kids have been involved in, in sports.

122
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:29,593
The others were more traditional stuff and he just never really, nothing ever stuck.

123
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:35,466
Um, always liked wrestling, but didn't know enough about it.

124
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:38,629
I remember asking him in maybe second grade, do you want to, do you want to wrestle?

125
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,150
And he's no, no.

126
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,596
And a lot of it is because he was just kind of, if I don't think I'm going to be good at something right off the bat that I'm just not even going to try.

127
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:54,543
Um, he played golf for years and years and years and was like, wow, this site, this is just not, don't want to do this anymore.

128
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:55,464
Um,

129
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:05,087
So one day he called me, he was leaving school and they had made an announcement that there was going to be a meeting about this co-op wrestling.

130
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,730
And he said, I think I want to do this.

131
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,190
I said, OK.

132
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:18,461
Signups came and went he didn't go because he was nervous about it So I said, okay and you know talked to him try to convince them.

133
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:28,830
It was an impossible task I went ahead and signed him up and You know had him cleared and I remember dropping him off one day at the bus stop and saying oh by the way You're you're all set to wrestle.

134
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,871
You've been cleared and he just kind of looked at me like what?

135
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,593
And said, yep, you're good to go.

136
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:34,914
So that was probably

137
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:39,598
I don't know, maybe the beginning of November, and it didn't start till December.

138
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:43,360
And he was definitely a nervous wreck up until the very first day he had to go.

139
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,623
And so he went to that.

140
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:51,886
And I know his thinking was, all right, well, I'm going to try this too.

141
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:58,350
Probably going to quit, add it to my list of, I don't know, failures for him.

142
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,753
So he went, wanted to go back.

143
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,213
loved it immediately.

144
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:09,635
Um, even, you know, he's like saying things like, well, he got tossed around today.

145
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:10,115
It was great.

146
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:10,676
Right.

147
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,757
And just wanted to keep on going.

148
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:21,241
And for him, I think what wrestling did for him is it changed the way he perceived himself.

149
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,603
Um, he learned not only about

150
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,281
physical but mental toughness and resilience, right?

151
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,482
Trying things, not giving up.

152
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:37,004
It's okay if you're not the best at it right off the get-go.

153
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:41,586
I think it taught him to face fears, what perseverance is.

154
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:47,389
And how about overcoming the idea that just because other peers his age

155
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:53,789
were athletes for so long, it doesn't mean that they weren't any better than him, right?

156
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,049
He just didn't find his passion at that point.

157
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:15,273
So it, I think it, he scratched his way to the surface by wrestling and to claim that self-confidence and self-worth, you know, and he pushed himself beyond his comfort zone, which is something I wasn't sure he was ever gonna be able to do, because he's always so cautious.

158
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,492
And I think, you know, it created discipline for him.

159
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:26,300
It was hard work, accountability.

160
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,827
Then he found himself, like, just contributing by

161
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:38,770
going over to the rec center and, and wanting to volunteer and like wanting to, now I want to do something for the, the young kids.

162
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,111
Like, mom, why didn't you make me do this when I was little, when I said, no, why'd you let me say no?

163
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:47,772
I'm like, okay, well, maybe you, maybe you started it exactly when you were supposed to start it.

164
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,232
And now guess what?

165
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,633
You're involved in this youth program.

166
00:12:53,974 --> 00:13:04,898
And you're getting little kids excited to do something so that when they are, you know, up at the middle school, high school level, they already have some experience and are going to be like, yeah, I remember doing this and I want to continue doing this.

167
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:16,002
So, um, he, you know, so he just felt like, you know, it's, it's, there's, he'll describe the team or wrestling as like, there's respect.

168
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,100
They encourage each other, they support each other.

169
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,972
There's life lessons through winning and losing and enduring difficulty to improve and achieve personal success.

170
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,999
Um, so he's just feels like, you know, he's, he's grateful.

171
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:41,741
Um, he thinks it's, you know, it's a sport that if somebody feels sort of indifferent, like, what do I don't know if I want to do this, I want to try this.

172
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:42,581
I'm kind of nervous.

173
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:49,564
Um, he thinks it's once they started, it's an opportunity that they'll see that they can better themselves and they'll want to try new things.

174
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:54,226
So he wants to be able to, I know he wants to take that passion for wrestling and.

175
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:01,103
you know, be able to establish something with youth someday.

176
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:17,309
So that, you know, whether it's through business, whether it's through coaching, whether it's I know, he's already thinking that, you know, for me, it, it helped me face obstacles and gave me again, this discipline, this self respect, determination, and more love and compassion for himself and others.

177
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,210
Yeah.

178
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:25,315
So it's just, it's, it was so much more for him and you know, when he loses, is he mad that he lost?

179
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:25,716
Sure.

180
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:26,376
Right.

181
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,357
We love to win.

182
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:36,003
Of course, winning feels great, but you know, he knows it's so much more for him and he's appreciates every coach he's, he's had.

183
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:46,511
Can I just add to Mirella that, um, um, you know, Chris was a junior when he started and had never played before and he,

184
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:57,931
you know, to his credit, he worked his tail off and then he worked off season like every minute he could to get better at the sport.

185
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:12,415
And I mean, now he's progressed to the point where he's a leader on the team and was appointed captain of the wrestling team for the GBL co-op, which is,

186
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:27,899
Again, to me, it's like amazing to watch Chris's journey because he went from literally like, as you heard Morella not wanting to do it to leading, um, the GBL co-op and they're, and they're having a really good season this year.

187
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:39,103
I remember last year, um, I went to the first tournament and, um, Morella didn't go because, you know, Chris, Chris was like, don't, don't come, don't come.

188
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:40,224
And, uh,

189
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,953
And he won, he won his meet that day.

190
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,894
And I was excited to share it with her.

191
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:55,258
And then fast forward this year to this first tournament, and he is dominating on the mat.

192
00:15:55,938 --> 00:16:00,620
And Marella is standing literally right in front of him videotaping the whole thing.

193
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
And that's what brought me to tears.

194
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:08,303
Because it was a kid that was so unsure of himself a year ago, just trying something out.

195
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:16,544
The transformation I've seen in Chris and my own son over the past year because of the sport is just, it really is inspiring.

196
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:35,948
And I think I speak for Morello when I say we want that for all the kids in Medford, which is why we're here today and to talk about not just our journeys, but the journey that we see for kids in Medford that are younger and just starting out and looking for that thing.

197
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:44,708
Yeah, because there are so many kids that just don't, aren't interested, have tried, aren't interested in your, you know, your, your, I guess your typical sports.

198
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:53,052
And this is something that is so inclusive and it's, it's just, it's fun out there.

199
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,894
It's fun and you can see there's the teammates.

200
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,134
There's a lot of love between them.

201
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:00,395
Yeah.

202
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:08,566
I like hearing the difference in your two stories, where one son knew what he wanted to do, the other one didn't know what he wanted to do.

203
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:17,069
And they both had you guys helping them to figure it out, and also finding this for them, and supporting them, and finding this thing.

204
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,130
And it sounds like they're both really thriving on this team.

205
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:23,052
So I think it's a good message for people to hear.

206
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:34,200
you know, wrestling can be for everybody and that you can kind of, you know, if there's, you know, if they're sort of struggling in other sports or other sports aren't for them, this is a nice one to try.

207
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:53,214
And I hear this a lot about, like, the more individual sports, that it does have this different kind of character building element where, like, you know, we hear, like, cross-country runners are, like, really focused on their, like, academics or, like, that this, this, like, sort of individual drive in athletics helps with an individual drive in other things.

208
00:17:54,494 --> 00:18:02,957
That's lovely, yeah, and it sounds like, you know, you guys have just sort of gotten this, gotten some momentum built for kids in Medford that are part of this team.

209
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:07,118
So how do you want to continue that or what can people know to get involved?

210
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:08,658
Yeah, for sure.

211
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:14,720
So what we also realized, you know, about halfway through the season last year was that if you don't start

212
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:21,871
If you wait to start wrestling until you're in high school, you're a little bit behind the eight ball.

213
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,473
So it's a tough sport to just pick up.

214
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,975
Although you can, as Chris did, as Peter did.

215
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:33,719
But we thought in order to really grow the sport in Medford, we need to start younger.

216
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:50,147
So we approached the rec center, the Medford Rec Center last winter with the idea of starting a youth program, starting in grade school and middle school to really get the next generation interested in the sport.

217
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:57,073
And the guys there were great, Kevin and Danny, very supportive.

218
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,514
They were all for it.

219
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,958
They had time on Saturday, but what they didn't have was a wrestling mat.

220
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:09,166
which is really the only barrier to the sport.

221
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:14,632
Actually, I should mention the other great thing about wrestling is little to no cost.

222
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:21,180
You really just need a pair of wrestling shoes, and even then you can wrestle in your socks, like when you're little.

223
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,828
And so what but what you do need as a facility is is the mat.

224
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,253
So I said okay well if that's the only barrier I'm, you know, we're going to get a mat, we're going to find a mat.

225
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:40,658
And then I researched how much they cost, and they are thousands and thousands of dollars brand new.

226
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:57,600
So I hit Facebook again and there's a bunch of wrestling mass wrestling websites, I'm sorry, you know pages on Facebook and I just asked out I just asked the universe like, is anybody looking to donate an old Matt or use Matt, so that we can start a wrestling program.

227
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:03,457
Um, and, uh, I got a response from, um, Excel Academy.

228
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:07,120
Um, uh, the coach's name is coach Brad.

229
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,842
He's a very, he's a great guy.

230
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,484
He's, he goes to all these events, um, as well.

231
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:19,332
And he was a real, is a real advocate for growing programs, um, in, you know, in cities and towns like Medford.

232
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:20,933
So they had an old Matt.

233
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:34,459
And I rented a U-Haul, and there was a dad who was a real, he was like the third leg of this parent team last year.

234
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:39,221
He moved, unfortunately, or fortunately for him, he moved over the summer.

235
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:45,122
But he and I went to Excel Academy with a bunch of wrestlers, loaded the mat onto a U-Haul,

236
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,021
you know, drove it back to the rec center and plopped it in the space.

237
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,143
And so I was like, okay, now you have it.

238
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:53,445
So let's run the program.

239
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,023
We just needed coaches now, right?

240
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,063
That's right.

241
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:00,764
So then Morelia, go ahead.

242
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:15,275
Yeah, so then I just again posted it out all over the place everywhere I could find on social media and got some responses and we have a coach for the rec center.

243
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,337
I think I got him from like this, you know, the Somerville Facebook site and

244
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:26,400
It was somebody who had experience and he's been with us since and he's done great.

245
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,861
His name is Jacob.

246
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:36,904
And then we're like, okay, so now let's see if we can get somebody, a coach to represent Medford.

247
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,985
So here we have a co-op team and we've got somebody from Malden and Everett and Chelsea.

248
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,007
And we don't have Medford.

249
00:21:47,885 --> 00:22:00,672
I again posted it all out and we got a handful of responses and I kind of just would pass it along to the Superintendent Cushing.

250
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:07,055
And he just recently, I want to say within the last week, hired one of them.

251
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:10,937
So we have somebody that will be joining and representing the Medford group.

252
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:22,813
This is like, I think so in doing this podcast, like I feel like there's so many people in Medford that have this sort of energy to like, well, if it doesn't exist, we're going to like make it happen.

253
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:38,121
And this and like, it's just like really gives me a lot of hope, like for the future, like for like the kids now and for the future, that like there are these parents and like community members in Medford that really want to create these opportunities for the younger generations.

254
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:39,162
And so thank you for doing that.

255
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:42,384
I mean, it sounds like you've really worked hard to bring this together.

256
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:47,905
We have and it's been a team effort for sure.

257
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:52,909
And, you know, obviously we have to thank the city for supporting us.

258
00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:02,336
You know, Bobby and Rachel and Dr. Cushing, Peter at the administration level, all of the, geez, all of the,

259
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:09,846
people that have volunteered along the way, like Brad with the mat and Claudia's the coach.

260
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:17,192
Yeah, so many people, but it is, you know, Medford's a big city and it's a diverse city.

261
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:21,595
And that can be like a positive and a negative.

262
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:28,301
It can be hard to get things done, but it's also an opportunity to really get like-minded people together.

263
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:31,764
and really push things forward that you wanna push forward.

264
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:38,888
So just like any grassroots thing, you just have to persevere and have a goal.

265
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:41,630
And these have been incremental goals.

266
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:50,295
The first was start wrestling at the high school, then find a coach, then start a youth program, get a mat.

267
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:54,157
So if you have these micro goals along the way,

268
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,552
and folks that are dedicated to doing it.

269
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:01,935
It's, yeah, Medford can be a wonderful city to get things done.

270
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,897
Yeah, and so how can people become involved?

271
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:13,122
How can they, if they're interested in having their kids start wrestling, if they wanna support your team, how can they do that?

272
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:19,466
Yeah, well, first of all, like sign up.

273
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,508
So the rec center is, we are a part of

274
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:27,990
They're offering every, I think it's every eight weeks, they offer a new program.

275
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,452
And so they are offering winter session too.

276
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:33,515
I think that starts at like end of January.

277
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:36,478
So sign up, check it out.

278
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:39,109
Get involved, for sure.

279
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:43,153
Reach out to myself or Mirella.

280
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:44,995
We're always looking for more parents.

281
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:51,141
Right now, it's sort of a two-woman show.

282
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:58,169
Although we really love it, our kids are getting older and sort of on to the next journey, so we're really looking to

283
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:06,626
hook up with some parents and caregivers that are looking to, you know, keep it going.

284
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:11,670
So I would say, yeah, we have a Facebook page, Friends of Medford Wrestling.

285
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:28,723
We have a, oh, we're also, sorry, I forgot to mention, the rec center, Mirella and I met with the Friends of Medford Recreation, which is the fundraising nonprofit arm of the rec center.

286
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:36,737
and we proposed to them what we really need to grow the sport in Medford is a regulation mat.

287
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:41,524
So the mat we have right now is a remnant and it's also

288
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,634
well-loved, pre-loved, let's say.

289
00:25:44,974 --> 00:26:00,906
And so, you know, it was good to get the program started, but in order to actually really get the kids ready for competition and meets and even host competitions and clinics ourselves, we really need to invest in a

290
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:02,769
proper mat.

291
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,954
And so we had a conversation with the friends of they are in full support.

292
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:16,340
And so they are actually starting a fundraising campaign to get a new mat for the rec center, which we hope to have by the fall.

293
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:29,372
Or even the summer, you know, summer clinics are huge, all the other towns around, which I should point out, by the way, Danielle is every other town around Medford, for some reason has a very robust and

294
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:34,137
You know, active youth and high school program so.

295
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:39,529
We are not alone in having wrestling as a sport.

296
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,611
We just have to have the infrastructure to support it.

297
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:47,774
So yeah, donate, reach out, sign your kid up.

298
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:48,555
Sign up.

299
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,376
That's the big one.

300
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:50,136
Sign up.

301
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:50,736
Sign up.

302
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:53,518
We want that youth group to really grow.

303
00:26:54,439 --> 00:27:03,105
We want it to just go from the fall, the winter, spring sessions to summer clinics, which would be

304
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:07,359
just really is going to get a lot of kids involved.

305
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:14,622
I think summer clinics are really important because parents are always looking, working parents are looking to have their kids be involved in something.

306
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:26,186
So I know my kid had to go to other cities and towns to do a lot of the clinics and it would be great if we could just have it right here at home.

307
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:32,872
So I'll make sure to put some of that information in our show notes so people can find it easily.

308
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,936
But anything else that you want to make sure that we mention before we wrap up?

309
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, just again, all the thanks.

310
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:45,584
Just thanks to everybody that's helped us along the way.

311
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:48,247
I hope I mentioned everybody that needed to be mentioned.

312
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,690
It's just been a huge team effort.

313
00:27:53,568 --> 00:28:08,594
You know, and yeah, the journey's just starting and we really hope that it will take off and we just really see a bright future for the kids in Medford and we just want to offer the same opportunities to them that our kids had.

314
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:10,475
So yeah.

315
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,717
And if kids want to watch one of the meets, how do they do that?

316
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,251
Great question.

317
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:21,352
There's, um, yeah, there's a yeah go ahead.

318
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,854
The high school meets we we we have a schedule.

319
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:35,320
I'm actually not sure if it is posted anywhere in terms of like method athletics, but we do have a schedule and

320
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,098
Anybody can go to them.

321
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:44,980
The larger, like the tournaments, anybody can also go to those, but there is an entrance fee.

322
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,942
But for matches and quads, anybody can go.

323
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:54,204
We actually have a home one coming up.

324
00:28:56,605 --> 00:29:00,026
I want to say it is the second week of January.

325
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,286
So there'll be one.

326
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,227
It's a quad meet at Malden High.

327
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:10,134
We can give you the, you can also post calendar, I guess, in the show notes.

328
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:15,896
Also the GVL Co-op is hosting the sectionals this year, which is huge.

329
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:18,797
So that is like an all day event, like seven to seven.

330
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:27,820
And there is an entry fee, but that's gonna be, that's how actually, when Peter was a freshman, we were like, okay, you wanna try wrestling?

331
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,821
Let's go to sectionals and so you can see it.

332
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:35,163
And that sold us because we were like, wow, there's like hundreds of people.

333
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,324
It's such a huge event.

334
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:40,444
It's like, I'm literally getting chills just talking about it.

335
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:41,985
It's really great.

336
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:48,347
If you just wanted to go and watch live wrestling, come to sectionals at Malden High this year.

337
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,548
I think it's like February 10th or something.

338
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:58,410
Yeah, that's a great, to me, that's, if you're not sold watching that, then wrestling's not for you.

339
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:10,704
Yeah, we found going to like the high some of the different high school sports with the kids and then also some of the tough teams like going to watch like it's really it's a good way to get through a weekend.

340
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:16,107
But also the kids love it like to have like older role models doing the things that they love is really great.

341
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:22,211
Speaking of which I should mention that Peter and Chris and our other son Nate

342
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:26,420
They volunteer at the rec center for the wrestling program.

343
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,263
So for them, it's a, and I know that Mirella had mentioned it, it is a way to give back.

344
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:34,267
And also, like you said, be that role model for the little kids.

345
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:37,830
Yeah, Peter got like a little thank you card yesterday.

346
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,575
Yeah, for which he's like, you know, so proud of, because he's seen as like, you know,

347
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:44,811
The old guy.

348
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,493
So I love that.

349
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:50,876
I love like the idea of it's not just about you.

350
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:51,997
It's about community.

351
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:56,039
It's about, you know, inspiring others that therefore inspire you.

352
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,301
So yeah, it's been great.

353
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:00,483
Thank you.

354
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:01,143
Yeah.

355
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:05,586
Thank you both for teaching us all about this and hopefully we can make it to a match.

356
