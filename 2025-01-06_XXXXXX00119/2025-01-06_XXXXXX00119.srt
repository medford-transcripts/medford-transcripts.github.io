00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,132
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks so much for being here with me today.

10
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's the day before the day before Christmas.

11
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:46,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for making the time.

12
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,598
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could just start by introducing yourself.

13
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:53,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could say your name, your pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

14
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

15
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,185
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Diane Noel.

16
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: She, hers.

17
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:06,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a mom in Medford that is interested in starting or continuing the wrestling program.

18
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

19
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Marella Zaccaraccio.

20
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:23,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm she, her, and also a mom in Medford and wanting to really see this program take off and, you know, do great things at the high school level.

21
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you both.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

23
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in hearing a lot more about wrestling today.

24
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:36,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into that, though, I'm going to ask you both the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

25
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:38,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm from Medford.

27
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lifelong history with Medford, so it's tough to pick.

28
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go with a classic.

29
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:53,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And I choose Bocelli's, which used to be Di Pasquale's when I was growing up, but it's always been a pizza place.

30
00:01:54,582 --> 00:02:00,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the thing I like to eat there, uh, everything there is good, but my favorite is actually the sea bass piccata.

31
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:10,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know it's like tough to get and it's always so good and it's a surprising, um, item on the menu, but it's my favorite thing there.

32
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:11,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

33
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,409
[SPEAKER_01]: That one has not come up yet that specific.

34
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:15,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to try it.

35
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,510
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds really good.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

37
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seasonal, so you're not going to get sea bass all the time, but, um, it's worth it.

38
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it if you get it.

39
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:23,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

40
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:24,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

41
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:27,705
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite restaurant.

42
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:28,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

43
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:34,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have to say I really like Real Gusto.

44
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:45,429
[SPEAKER_05]: There isn't much I don't like on their menu, but I really like, I like their pizzas because I like that gourmet-ishy type of pizza.

45
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:47,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

46
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a favorite spot of ours, too.

47
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's encouraging, though, to hear you guys have older kids talk about places that don't only serve pizza.

48
00:02:55,053 --> 00:03:00,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's how we eat with little kids, who has what they'll eat.

49
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So great.

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here to talk about wrestling.

52
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:09,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if you guys could just give us a little bit of an introduction about what wrestling is.

53
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so wrestling, just a quick intro.

54
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world.

55
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, it was, you know, in Greek and Roman times, it was a competition between, you know, two individuals.

56
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the sixth most popular high school sport in the United States.

57
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:36,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It is open to boys and people of all genders.

58
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,119
[SPEAKER_04]: The team in Medford is actually

59
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,279
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed gender team.

60
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It is based on weight class.

61
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can have

62
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,243
[SPEAKER_04]: kids as low as like 90 pounds up to 285 plus.

63
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:59,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an individual sport in that it's, you know, you compete against one other person, but it's also a team sport.

64
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:02,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So the team has an overall score.

65
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:11,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great sport if you are into calisthenics or boxing or hitting the gym.

66
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good sport if you are into an individual sport

67
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,828
[SPEAKER_04]: competing individually while also being recognized on a team.

68
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,452
[SPEAKER_04]: A fabulous way to stay in shape in the winter.

69
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:28,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a winter sport, you know, when there's not a lot else going on.

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Marilla, would you add anything to that?

71
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, if you love a little combat.

72
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:35,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

73
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:47,896
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like structured chaos, it's yeah, I think that you can see it provides this sense of confidence.

74
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like

75
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,246
[SPEAKER_05]: people just love it when they get into it.

76
00:04:56,386 --> 00:05:07,850
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just, I don't know if it's an adrenaline rush or what it brings on, but there's this self-empowerment that happens and it's, yeah.

77
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they hug at the end.

78
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's very, yeah, very important.

79
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: They also, it also is, the coaches say that, and the kids will say that it's as much mental as it is physical.

80
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:21,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot about your head space

81
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:29,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, as Marilla said, like your confidence and perseverance, um, it's very intense to watch.

82
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:39,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like these huge bursts of energy, like two minutes at a time and inches and seconds last like forever.

83
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.

84
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So very popular, very exciting.

85
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's an awesome sport.

86
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:46,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

87
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:50,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a lot of informal wrestling matches just on the floor here.

88
00:05:50,425 --> 00:06:01,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that, you know, we've talked to some other folks on the podcast about team sports and sort of the benefits of having kids play together on teams.

89
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,872
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like what you're describing wrestling as those like are pretty inclusive.

90
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:11,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like all body types are welcome, all genders, and that there's a sort of competition

91
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:33,336
[SPEAKER_01]: um with with your team but also with yourself and so i'm wondering what like i know you both of your kids are wrestlers and sort of what you know why that was important to them why it's important to you why you think wrestling is important to the kids in medford yeah for sure so my son personally um was

92
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: We had played team sports growing up, you know, soccer, baseball, basketball, and you know he enjoyed them but when when the pandemic came sort of all sports stopped.

93
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was also middle school so that by the time he gets high school, sort of reevaluated.

94
00:06:52,188 --> 00:07:00,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What was going on, and he had also during the pandemic gotten really into like weightlifting and boxing so things you can do like by yourself in your garage or whatever.

95
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he wasn't really gravitating toward a team sport at that point.

96
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:13,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, you know, us as parents, my husband and I really wanted him to be involved with the high school and, you know, find something.

97
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:25,375
[SPEAKER_04]: that was sports related, because we really believe that sports teaches you so much beyond just winning and being an athlete.

98
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just great for life.

99
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:34,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So he had said, I don't know, if I could do anything, if I could do any sport, it would be wrestling.

100
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And Medford didn't have a wrestling team at that point.

101
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had reached out to the athletic director and asked how we could get involved in starting a wrestling program.

102
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:53,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I went to Medford High back in the nineties, eighties and nineties, there was a wrestling team, but for whatever reason it sort of dissolved.

103
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So at that point, Bobby Maloney, the athletic director said, well, he could co-op with Malden.

104
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:03,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's a GBL co-op and there's a coach over there and kids over there.

105
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, that's how our journey started.

106
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:12,085
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why it was great for our son, uh, is because it was just what he was looking for.

107
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:24,094
[SPEAKER_04]: He, he wanted something where he could individually compete, um, that involves strength and perseverance, but where winning and losing was entirely on him.

108
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really is the perfect sport for him.

109
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:30,793
[SPEAKER_04]: He, it's a challenging sport.

110
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:32,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very physically demanding.

111
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: but he loves it.

112
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though it's an individual sport, there's a huge sense of community.

113
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,576
[SPEAKER_04]: The team itself is very tightly bonded.

114
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're talking about kids who in other sports are competed against each other, right?

115
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Malden, Everett, Chelsea, it's the GBL co-op.

116
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:54,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all the kids we compete against throughout the year.

117
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But for wrestling, we're all on the same team.

118
00:08:57,447 --> 00:09:02,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a wonderful community, it's very welcoming.

119
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it's also, yeah, great for, um, perfect fit for my son.

120
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:11,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

121
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:23,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so Chris is, you know, the last of three and all my kids have been involved in, in sports.

122
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: The others were more traditional stuff and he just never really, nothing ever stuck.

123
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:35,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, always liked wrestling, but didn't know enough about it.

124
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:38,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember asking him in maybe second grade, do you want to, do you want to wrestle?

125
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's no, no.

126
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it is because he was just kind of, if I don't think I'm going to be good at something right off the bat that I'm just not even going to try.

127
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:54,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he played golf for years and years and years and was like, wow, this site, this is just not, don't want to do this anymore.

128
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:55,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

129
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:05,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So one day he called me, he was leaving school and they had made an announcement that there was going to be a meeting about this co-op wrestling.

130
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, I think I want to do this.

131
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, OK.

132
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:18,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Signups came and went he didn't go because he was nervous about it So I said, okay and you know talked to him try to convince them.

133
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:28,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an impossible task I went ahead and signed him up and You know had him cleared and I remember dropping him off one day at the bus stop and saying oh by the way You're you're all set to wrestle.

134
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,871
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been cleared and he just kind of looked at me like what?

135
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And said, yep, you're good to go.

136
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:34,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was probably

137
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:39,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe the beginning of November, and it didn't start till December.

138
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:43,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was definitely a nervous wreck up until the very first day he had to go.

139
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he went to that.

140
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:51,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know his thinking was, all right, well, I'm going to try this too.

141
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:58,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably going to quit, add it to my list of, I don't know, failures for him.

142
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went, wanted to go back.

143
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,213
[SPEAKER_05]: loved it immediately.

144
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:09,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, even, you know, he's like saying things like, well, he got tossed around today.

145
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:10,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

146
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:10,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

147
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And just wanted to keep on going.

148
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:21,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And for him, I think what wrestling did for him is it changed the way he perceived himself.

149
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he learned not only about

150
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,281
[SPEAKER_05]: physical but mental toughness and resilience, right?

151
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying things, not giving up.

152
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:37,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay if you're not the best at it right off the get-go.

153
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it taught him to face fears, what perseverance is.

154
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:47,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And how about overcoming the idea that just because other peers his age

155
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:53,789
[SPEAKER_05]: were athletes for so long, it doesn't mean that they weren't any better than him, right?

156
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: He just didn't find his passion at that point.

157
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So it, I think it, he scratched his way to the surface by wrestling and to claim that self-confidence and self-worth, you know, and he pushed himself beyond his comfort zone, which is something I wasn't sure he was ever gonna be able to do, because he's always so cautious.

158
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:21,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, it created discipline for him.

159
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard work, accountability.

160
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he found himself, like, just contributing by

161
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:38,770
[SPEAKER_05]: going over to the rec center and, and wanting to volunteer and like wanting to, now I want to do something for the, the young kids.

162
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, mom, why didn't you make me do this when I was little, when I said, no, why'd you let me say no?

163
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:47,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay, well, maybe you, maybe you started it exactly when you were supposed to start it.

164
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And now guess what?

165
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You're involved in this youth program.

166
00:12:53,974 --> 00:13:04,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're getting little kids excited to do something so that when they are, you know, up at the middle school, high school level, they already have some experience and are going to be like, yeah, I remember doing this and I want to continue doing this.

167
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:16,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, he, you know, so he just felt like, you know, it's, it's, there's, he'll describe the team or wrestling as like, there's respect.

168
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: They encourage each other, they support each other.

169
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There's life lessons through winning and losing and enduring difficulty to improve and achieve personal success.

170
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so he's just feels like, you know, he's, he's grateful.

171
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:41,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he thinks it's, you know, it's a sport that if somebody feels sort of indifferent, like, what do I don't know if I want to do this, I want to try this.

172
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:42,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of nervous.

173
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he thinks it's once they started, it's an opportunity that they'll see that they can better themselves and they'll want to try new things.

174
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:54,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So he wants to be able to, I know he wants to take that passion for wrestling and.

175
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:01,103
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, be able to establish something with youth someday.

176
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:17,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, you know, whether it's through business, whether it's through coaching, whether it's I know, he's already thinking that, you know, for me, it, it helped me face obstacles and gave me again, this discipline, this self respect, determination, and more love and compassion for himself and others.

177
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

178
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:25,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just, it's, it was so much more for him and you know, when he loses, is he mad that he lost?

179
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:25,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

180
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:26,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

181
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to win.

182
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, winning feels great, but you know, he knows it's so much more for him and he's appreciates every coach he's, he's had.

183
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:46,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just add to Mirella that, um, um, you know, Chris was a junior when he started and had never played before and he,

184
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to his credit, he worked his tail off and then he worked off season like every minute he could to get better at the sport.

185
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:12,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, now he's progressed to the point where he's a leader on the team and was appointed captain of the wrestling team for the GBL co-op, which is,

186
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:27,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, to me, it's like amazing to watch Chris's journey because he went from literally like, as you heard Morella not wanting to do it to leading, um, the GBL co-op and they're, and they're having a really good season this year.

187
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:39,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember last year, um, I went to the first tournament and, um, Morella didn't go because, you know, Chris, Chris was like, don't, don't come, don't come.

188
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh,

189
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And he won, he won his meet that day.

190
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was excited to share it with her.

191
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:55,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And then fast forward this year to this first tournament, and he is dominating on the mat.

192
00:15:55,938 --> 00:16:00,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And Marella is standing literally right in front of him videotaping the whole thing.

193
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what brought me to tears.

194
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:08,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was a kid that was so unsure of himself a year ago, just trying something out.

195
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:16,544
[SPEAKER_04]: The transformation I've seen in Chris and my own son over the past year because of the sport is just, it really is inspiring.

196
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:35,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I speak for Morello when I say we want that for all the kids in Medford, which is why we're here today and to talk about not just our journeys, but the journey that we see for kids in Medford that are younger and just starting out and looking for that thing.

197
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:44,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there are so many kids that just don't, aren't interested, have tried, aren't interested in your, you know, your, your, I guess your typical sports.

198
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:53,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something that is so inclusive and it's, it's just, it's fun out there.

199
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun and you can see there's the teammates.

200
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,134
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of love between them.

201
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:00,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

202
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:08,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I like hearing the difference in your two stories, where one son knew what he wanted to do, the other one didn't know what he wanted to do.

203
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:17,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both had you guys helping them to figure it out, and also finding this for them, and supporting them, and finding this thing.

204
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like they're both really thriving on this team.

205
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:23,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a good message for people to hear.

206
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:34,200
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wrestling can be for everybody and that you can kind of, you know, if there's, you know, if they're sort of struggling in other sports or other sports aren't for them, this is a nice one to try.

207
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:53,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear this a lot about, like, the more individual sports, that it does have this different kind of character building element where, like, you know, we hear, like, cross-country runners are, like, really focused on their, like, academics or, like, that this, this, like, sort of individual drive in athletics helps with an individual drive in other things.

208
00:17:54,494 --> 00:18:02,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That's lovely, yeah, and it sounds like, you know, you guys have just sort of gotten this, gotten some momentum built for kids in Medford that are part of this team.

209
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:07,118
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you want to continue that or what can people know to get involved?

210
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:08,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.

211
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we also realized, you know, about halfway through the season last year was that if you don't start

212
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wait to start wrestling until you're in high school, you're a little bit behind the eight ball.

213
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a tough sport to just pick up.

214
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Although you can, as Chris did, as Peter did.

215
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:33,719
[SPEAKER_04]: But we thought in order to really grow the sport in Medford, we need to start younger.

216
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:50,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So we approached the rec center, the Medford Rec Center last winter with the idea of starting a youth program, starting in grade school and middle school to really get the next generation interested in the sport.

217
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guys there were great, Kevin and Danny, very supportive.

218
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,514
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all for it.

219
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: They had time on Saturday, but what they didn't have was a wrestling mat.

220
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:09,166
[SPEAKER_04]: which is really the only barrier to the sport.

221
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:14,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I should mention the other great thing about wrestling is little to no cost.

222
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:21,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You really just need a pair of wrestling shoes, and even then you can wrestle in your socks, like when you're little.

223
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what but what you do need as a facility is is the mat.

224
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said okay well if that's the only barrier I'm, you know, we're going to get a mat, we're going to find a mat.

225
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I researched how much they cost, and they are thousands and thousands of dollars brand new.

226
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:57,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hit Facebook again and there's a bunch of wrestling mass wrestling websites, I'm sorry, you know pages on Facebook and I just asked out I just asked the universe like, is anybody looking to donate an old Matt or use Matt, so that we can start a wrestling program.

227
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:03,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, I got a response from, um, Excel Academy.

228
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:07,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, the coach's name is coach Brad.

229
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,842
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a very, he's a great guy.

230
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,484
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he goes to all these events, um, as well.

231
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:19,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was a real, is a real advocate for growing programs, um, in, you know, in cities and towns like Medford.

232
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:20,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had an old Matt.

233
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And I rented a U-Haul, and there was a dad who was a real, he was like the third leg of this parent team last year.

234
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: He moved, unfortunately, or fortunately for him, he moved over the summer.

235
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:45,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But he and I went to Excel Academy with a bunch of wrestlers, loaded the mat onto a U-Haul,

236
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, drove it back to the rec center and plopped it in the space.

237
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was like, okay, now you have it.

238
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:53,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's run the program.

239
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: We just needed coaches now, right?

240
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

241
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:00,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So then Morelia, go ahead.

242
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:15,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so then I just again posted it out all over the place everywhere I could find on social media and got some responses and we have a coach for the rec center.

243
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got him from like this, you know, the Somerville Facebook site and

244
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:26,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It was somebody who had experience and he's been with us since and he's done great.

245
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,861
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Jacob.

246
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:36,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're like, okay, so now let's see if we can get somebody, a coach to represent Medford.

247
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,985
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we have a co-op team and we've got somebody from Malden and Everett and Chelsea.

248
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have Medford.

249
00:21:47,885 --> 00:22:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I again posted it all out and we got a handful of responses and I kind of just would pass it along to the Superintendent Cushing.

250
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:07,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And he just recently, I want to say within the last week, hired one of them.

251
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:10,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have somebody that will be joining and representing the Medford group.

252
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:22,813
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, I think so in doing this podcast, like I feel like there's so many people in Medford that have this sort of energy to like, well, if it doesn't exist, we're going to like make it happen.

253
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:38,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And this and like, it's just like really gives me a lot of hope, like for the future, like for like the kids now and for the future, that like there are these parents and like community members in Medford that really want to create these opportunities for the younger generations.

254
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:39,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you for doing that.

255
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:42,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like you've really worked hard to bring this together.

256
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:47,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We have and it's been a team effort for sure.

257
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:52,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, obviously we have to thank the city for supporting us.

258
00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:02,336
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Bobby and Rachel and Dr. Cushing, Peter at the administration level, all of the, geez, all of the,

259
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:09,846
[SPEAKER_04]: people that have volunteered along the way, like Brad with the mat and Claudia's the coach.

260
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:17,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so many people, but it is, you know, Medford's a big city and it's a diverse city.

261
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:21,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can be like a positive and a negative.

262
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:28,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be hard to get things done, but it's also an opportunity to really get like-minded people together.

263
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: and really push things forward that you wanna push forward.

264
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:38,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like any grassroots thing, you just have to persevere and have a goal.

265
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And these have been incremental goals.

266
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The first was start wrestling at the high school, then find a coach, then start a youth program, get a mat.

267
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:54,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have these micro goals along the way,

268
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,552
[SPEAKER_04]: and folks that are dedicated to doing it.

269
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:01,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, yeah, Medford can be a wonderful city to get things done.

270
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so how can people become involved?

271
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:13,122
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they, if they're interested in having their kids start wrestling, if they wanna support your team, how can they do that?

272
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:19,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, first of all, like sign up.

273
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rec center is, we are a part of

274
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:27,990
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering every, I think it's every eight weeks, they offer a new program.

275
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are offering winter session too.

276
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:33,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that starts at like end of January.

277
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:36,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So sign up, check it out.

278
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:39,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Get involved, for sure.

279
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:43,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Reach out to myself or Mirella.

280
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:44,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always looking for more parents.

281
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:51,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, it's sort of a two-woman show.

282
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:58,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we really love it, our kids are getting older and sort of on to the next journey, so we're really looking to

283
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:06,626
[SPEAKER_04]: hook up with some parents and caregivers that are looking to, you know, keep it going.

284
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:11,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say, yeah, we have a Facebook page, Friends of Medford Wrestling.

285
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:28,723
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a, oh, we're also, sorry, I forgot to mention, the rec center, Mirella and I met with the Friends of Medford Recreation, which is the fundraising nonprofit arm of the rec center.

286
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:36,737
[SPEAKER_04]: and we proposed to them what we really need to grow the sport in Medford is a regulation mat.

287
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:41,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mat we have right now is a remnant and it's also

288
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: well-loved, pre-loved, let's say.

289
00:25:44,974 --> 00:26:00,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it was good to get the program started, but in order to actually really get the kids ready for competition and meets and even host competitions and clinics ourselves, we really need to invest in a

290
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:02,769
[SPEAKER_04]: proper mat.

291
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we had a conversation with the friends of they are in full support.

292
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:16,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are actually starting a fundraising campaign to get a new mat for the rec center, which we hope to have by the fall.

293
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:29,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even the summer, you know, summer clinics are huge, all the other towns around, which I should point out, by the way, Danielle is every other town around Medford, for some reason has a very robust and

294
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:34,137
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, active youth and high school program so.

295
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:39,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not alone in having wrestling as a sport.

296
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to have the infrastructure to support it.

297
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:47,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, donate, reach out, sign your kid up.

298
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:48,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign up.

299
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big one.

300
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:50,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign up.

301
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:50,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Sign up.

302
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:53,518
[SPEAKER_05]: We want that youth group to really grow.

303
00:26:54,439 --> 00:27:03,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to just go from the fall, the winter, spring sessions to summer clinics, which would be

304
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:07,359
[SPEAKER_05]: just really is going to get a lot of kids involved.

305
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:14,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I think summer clinics are really important because parents are always looking, working parents are looking to have their kids be involved in something.

306
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know my kid had to go to other cities and towns to do a lot of the clinics and it would be great if we could just have it right here at home.

307
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:32,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll make sure to put some of that information in our show notes so people can find it easily.

308
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,936
[SPEAKER_01]: But anything else that you want to make sure that we mention before we wrap up?

309
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:40,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just again, all the thanks.

310
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:45,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Just thanks to everybody that's helped us along the way.

311
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I mentioned everybody that needed to be mentioned.

312
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just been a huge team effort.

313
00:27:53,568 --> 00:28:08,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and yeah, the journey's just starting and we really hope that it will take off and we just really see a bright future for the kids in Medford and we just want to offer the same opportunities to them that our kids had.

314
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

315
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And if kids want to watch one of the meets, how do they do that?

316
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.

00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:21,352
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, um, yeah, there's a yeah go ahead.

[SPEAKER_05]: The larger, like the tournaments, anybody can also go to those, but there is an entrance fee.

00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the GVL Co-op is hosting the sectionals this year, which is huge.

329
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:18,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is like an all day event, like seven to seven.

330
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:27,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is an entry fee, but that's gonna be, that's how actually, when Peter was a freshman, we were like, okay, you wanna try wrestling?

331
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to sectionals and so you can see it.

[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like February 10th or something.

338
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:58,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a great, to me, that's, if you're not sold watching that, then wrestling's not for you.

339
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:10,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we found going to like the high some of the different high school sports with the kids and then also some of the tough teams like going to watch like it's really it's a good way to get through a weekend.

340
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:16,107
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the kids love it like to have like older role models doing the things that they love is really great.

341
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:22,211

343
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So for them, it's a, and I know that Mirella had mentioned it, it is a way to give back.

00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:34,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, like you said, be that role model for the little kids.
