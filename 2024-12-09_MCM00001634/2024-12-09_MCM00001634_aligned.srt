1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:00,911
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:02,391
Thanks for coming today.

3
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:05,292
We're going to call to order.

4
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:08,493
I'm going to do a quick roll call.

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,253
Kayla Lesson?

6
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:12,013
Present.

7
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:15,254
Roberta Cameron?

8
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:16,354
Here.

9
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:18,935
Carrie Weaver?

10
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:22,796
Penny Taylor?

11
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:24,736
Present.

12
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:26,476
Lisa Sun?

13
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:27,697
Present.

14
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,812
and Lisa Ann Davidson present.

15
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:40,136
The next item on the agenda are the minutes, approving of the minutes.

16
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:45,640
Did everybody get a chance to read the October and November minutes that Aditi sent?

17
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:56,568
And if there are no edits to the meeting minutes, excuse me, from October 2nd, 2024, I'd like to request a motion to approve the minutes.

18
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:58,330
So moved.

19
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:01,232
Second.

20
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:07,299
And then we'll do a roll call for a vote.

21
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:08,940
We've got Kayla.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,060
Aye.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,901
Roberta made the motion.

24
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:13,801
Penny.

25
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,802
Aye.

26
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:21,644
Lisa made, seconded, and I also approve.

27
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:24,965
And let's see.

28
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:32,787
If there are no edits to the minute meetings for November 6, I would like to make a request to a motion to approve the minutes.

29
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:35,955
So moved.

30
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:39,536
Second.

31
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:44,798
Okay, we'll call for approving.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,398
Kayla?

33
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:46,318
Aye.

34
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:49,039
Roberta made the motion.

35
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,499
Penelope seconded it.

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,279
Lisa?

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,640
Aye.

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,380
And Lisa-Ann?

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:54,980
Aye.

40
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:58,021
Both minutes have been approved.

41
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:09,016
Next item on the agenda is the working groups, and we've got the Declaration of Trust.

42
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:12,317
The Declaration of Trust is ready to be signed by all members.

43
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:21,280
However, since tonight's meeting is a virtual one, I would like to postpone the execution of the Declaration of Trust to the next meeting in January.

44
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,802
Do we need a vote on that?

45
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:29,663
I don't think so.

46
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,103
I don't think so either.

47
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:41,299
And then the second, the next is the action plan committee and Roberta.

48
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:50,401
So, um, yeah, I will talk through the data that I sent to everyone.

49
00:02:50,421 --> 00:03:05,050
Um, so the action plan committee has been working on gathering background data on housing needs and, um, housing conditions in the city that will inform the action plan.

50
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,454
And in addition, we've been preparing to host some stakeholder, some, um,

51
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:22,586
focus groups with stakeholders to learn more about their perception of housing needs and priorities in the city.

52
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:23,527
So,

53
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:32,428
I will talk more about the stakeholder meetings after I first just give a rundown of what we've learned about the data.

54
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:40,391
I prepared a two-page summary of what we've learned so far, and that's what was submitted in the meeting packet.

55
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:51,357
And I would love if you could all indulge me in running through a presentation that we prepared that we're going to use for the stakeholder groups as well as the

56
00:03:54,967 --> 00:04:00,271
a later public meeting or a series of public meetings in the spring.

57
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:03,773
However, we do this after the new year.

58
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:12,919
So this just gives us a chance to rehearse and learn, get some feedback from you if there's some changes that we need to make.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,180
I'll give Kerry.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,881
Roberta, sorry to intervene.

61
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,563
I think Kerry Weaver has joined us.

62
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:27,982
I'll wait a moment.

63
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,664
And do I have the ability to share the screen?

64
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,385
Yes, I'll make you the co-host in a minute.

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,211
I think you can now share the screen.

66
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:05,449
And then I'm going to turn this into a slideshow if I can see the screen.

67
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,973
There we are.

68
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,277
From the beginning.

69
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:16,978
Okay.

70
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,401
So just click through slides that don't have data.

71
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:28,306
Introductory slides about the Affordable Housing Trust and the purpose of the meetings.

72
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:34,948
So the data highlights, the first thing that we looked at is who actually lives in Medford.

73
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,629
And we learned some interesting things.

74
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:56,552
The population of Medford has grown slightly in the last decade between 2010 and 2020, but most significantly, all of that growth occurred in young adults between the ages, sorry, I have to,

75
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,707
I'm going to minimize you all on my screen.

76
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:23,252
Between the ages of, I think, 20 and 35, we've gained over 4,000 young adults in that age cohort, while all of the other age groups, younger, older, stayed the same, roughly, or declined slightly over this period.

77
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:38,038
So as you might expect with this change in population, we're seeing more non-family households, which is how the census would describe households with roommates.

78
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:46,360
By the way, I meant to say that the picture on the left here may or may not be an actual photo of my next door neighbors who moved in a few months ago.

79
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:52,844
The population is also gaining.

80
00:06:52,864 --> 00:07:12,537
We have a higher proportion of people of color and people who have immigrated to this area, which may be because Medford is still sadly relatively affordable compared with other communities as much as it is feeling unaffordable to many of us.

81
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:30,591
And another interesting thing that I noticed is a smaller proportion of people with disabilities in Medford, which could be accounted for because of the age of our housing stock and the lack of accessible housing stock.

82
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,373
So, sorry, I'm trying to go to the next page.

83
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,835
So then we looked at what does Medford's housing look like?

84
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:46,262
And on the screen, you see a chart to orient you as to what this chart is telling us.

85
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:53,268
The bars represent the amount of housing that was built in each time period shown at the bottom.

86
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:56,831
My apologies that I can't make the time periods.

87
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:11,239
appear any clearer than they are, but that the first small column is before 1900, and then the very large column is houses that were built between 1900 and 1920, and then it's 1920 to 1940,

88
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:21,224
1940 to 1960 1960 to 1980 and then 99 is 80 to 99 is the 2nd to last in the last column is housing built since 2000.

89
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:35,451
The colors represent different types of housing.

90
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:41,038
So the blue, the bright blue color is single family homes.

91
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,542
The lighter pink is two family homes.

92
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:49,168
The darker pink is small multifamily, three to eight units.

93
00:08:50,049 --> 00:09:05,095
And then the purple is condominiums, which among the condominiums that we see in the older housing stock tend to be conversions from original multifamily, small multifamilies.

94
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:12,579
And the condos built since 1960 are typically purpose-built condominiums.

95
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:22,064
I'm sorry, the purple is large multifamily, and the very pale green is condominiums.

96
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:26,464
And then there are miscellaneous other types of housing.

97
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:35,006
And public housing, you'll see, was mostly constructed in the mid-20th century, not very much of it, and none since 1980 or 1990.

98
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,466
So you can see, first of all, that the very

99
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:47,690
uh... the diversity of housing that we we have a fairly diverse housing stock uh...

100
00:09:49,199 --> 00:10:04,446
I don't have the numbers visible to me that you can see on the spreadsheet that I need to see what are some of the numbers to go along with the diversity.

101
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:11,529
But we stopped building diverse housing basically in the 20th century after 1939.

102
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:23,705
So a lot of our housing is very old, and we saw that the housing units are large relative to the households.

103
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:38,612
The number of one-person households is much bigger than the number of one-bedroom units, which is also perhaps part of what's driving the non-family households.

104
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:43,475
People are combining with roommates to be able to live in larger housing units.

105
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:53,155
And finally, the housing is very expensive, and we're seeing assessor's data showing us that the cost of housing is really increasing.

106
00:10:53,175 --> 00:11:13,352
And especially newer housing is more expensive, and housing in the fewer units in a building, housing tends to be more expensive as well, relative to when the housing was built.

107
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:18,522
So who is struggling with housing costs in Medford?

108
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:27,064
About 5,500 households have less than 50% area median income in Medford.

109
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,925
That's out of around 22,000 households overall.

110
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:37,827
And of those households below 50% area median income, two thirds are housing cost burdened.

111
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:51,129
About one third of all homeowners in the city are over the age of 65 and the median income for all people, households over the age of 65 is $44,000.

112
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,991
So that's a really stark fact for us to reflect on.

113
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:08,513
So seniors are experiencing the highest rate of housing cost burden compared to any other age of household.

114
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:33,315
But on the other hand, we're also seeing another story, which is that the cost of housing is going up so rapidly that people who are moving into Medford today have to have a higher income just to access housing, just to be able to move into Medford, which is why we're seeing that the median household income for renters is rising rapidly.

115
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:37,319
So that's reflecting what it costs to move into Medford.

116
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:45,260
And I just prepared this chart actually hot off the press a very short time ago.

117
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:59,227
This is a chart that shows what the income needed to rent an apartment or to purchase a condo in Medford or to rent a room in Medford.

118
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:02,289
So the average room rental is about $1,000 a month.

119
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,789
And to be able to afford that,

120
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:11,070
to pay less than 30% of your income, you would need to make about $40,000 a year.

121
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,772
The average income needed to rent an apartment in Medford is about $120,000 a year, where the average rent is about $3,000 a month.

122
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,314
And to purchase a condo in Medford, the average condo price right now is about $637,000.

123
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,516
And the income needed to be able to afford that is somewhere around $200,000.

124
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:51,083
So the columns represent the income, the average wages by industry within the Boston region.

125
00:13:51,763 --> 00:14:04,752
So within the Boston region, people who are working in arts, recreation, food service, and hotel are making less on average than the income needed to be able to rent a room.

126
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:15,712
The people who are working in retail, transportation, healthcare, business support services, education, government, construction and real estate.

127
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:21,319
And that represents about 64% of the jobs in the Boston region.

128
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:32,141
Those folks can afford to rent a room, but they can't afford to rent an apartment on their own in the city on one income.

129
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:41,223
So those are typically people who are combining with roommates or partners to be able to rent an apartment.

130
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:52,811
And there is no industry in the Boston region that pays an average wage sufficient to purchase a condo on one income.

131
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:54,118
in the city.

132
00:14:54,818 --> 00:15:05,502
So the higher paying industries include manufacturing, finance and insurance, business management, professional and technical services and information.

133
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:17,807
And people who work in those industries on average can afford to rent an apartment on one income, but would need a second income to be able to purchase a condo today.

134
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:27,631
And the yellow column just represents seniors to see where they fall in this affordability and income range.

135
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:35,096
Not that seniors are a. Wage earners necessarily.

136
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:40,237
So that's just some interesting and sobering data that we've put together.

137
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:48,724
The other thing that we've looked at is housing strategies and initiatives that the city has been undertaking in the last 5 years.

138
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:54,548
These include and I will welcome having some more input from.

139
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:05,114
The from the city staff to give us more information about these, but just a very quick overview.

140
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:16,060
They've been working on amending zoning in particular, Wellington station, mystic of court or Salem street court or and affordable infill zoning.

141
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:28,640
Building on city-owned lots, including small lots scattered throughout the city and large lots in Medford Square and the Wellington station area air rights.

142
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:42,884
Facilitating housing development by building partnerships with non-profit organizations and working with the Medford Housing Authority to redevelop, reposition some of their properties.

143
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,085
Supporting households by

144
00:16:48,311 --> 00:17:00,388
Undertaking housing rehab program, down payment assistance, rental assistance programs, recruiting and assisting landlords, renting to voucher holders and low income tenants.

145
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:21,012
And advocating for affordable housing, fair housing, tenant fair, like, undertaking initiatives related to fair housing, tenant rights, displacement, prevention, building community support for affordable housing and identifying additional and I'm sorry.

146
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:21,072
I.

147
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,412
I need to think about how to present this slide.

148
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:35,054
So these are some initiatives that the city has been undertaking, and some that are just things that need to be undertaken.

149
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:47,897
And the ones that are colored in blue text on this slide represent initiatives that may potentially, the affordable housing trust may be partners on.

150
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:52,678
So identifying additional sources of revenue for the affordable housing trust is also

151
00:17:57,282 --> 00:18:03,147
And I also wanted to just give an overview of what the existing resources are.

152
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:10,393
Now, we've heard at our previous meeting about the federal funding program, CDBG and HOME.

153
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,878
and CDBG and HOME.

154
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:20,040
And so we also have right now already 9.49% units on the subsidized housing infant

155
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:36,398
And there's a caveat, which is that 639 of those units are waiting for building permits.

156
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:46,423
They're 40 B. Developments, which we're given credit for on the subsidized housing inventory right away.

157
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:52,847
But if we wait too long before the building permits are issued, or before the developments are constructed, we're not going to be able to do that.

158
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:57,130
those units will fall off the list until they are actually constructed.

159
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:13,439
The subsidized housing inventory is showing that we have 2,439 units, but in fact, some of those units that are counted are actually market rate units because of the way that the state counts units toward the subsidized housing inventory.

160
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,224
It's a useful metric, but not necessarily reflective of how much affordable housing is actually available to Medford residents.

161
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:30,894
And the community preservation act program has total annual revenues of about 2Million dollars a year.

162
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,380
So, a minimum of 10% of that can be allocate or must be allocated toward affordable housing.

163
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:46,789
But the amount that the city has spent over 6 years has been closer to a 3rd of the total.

164
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:54,945
CPA revenue, so it's been about 4 million that we've spent on affordable housing so far.

165
00:19:56,006 --> 00:20:00,487
And as we mentioned, the CDBG and home consortium resources.

166
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:09,430
So that is all that I have, and I welcome your comments, questions, feedback.

167
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,725
I want to start by saying thank you, Roberta.

168
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:20,168
You did a lot of work in putting this together.

169
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,390
It's on the action plan committee.

170
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,052
It's myself, Penny, and Roberta.

171
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:29,454
And I love the new slide.

172
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:40,182
It really sort of gives the aha moment on how much somebody needs to be earning in order to afford to live here.

173
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,883
So thank you, thank you, thank you.

174
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,628
So comments, questions about the data?

175
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:21,438
Our next steps are that we need to actually convert the data worksheet or the data summary that we've given into some text that will be the text of our plan.

176
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:32,163
And then we're going to be undertaking some engagement to learn more from stakeholders and the public.

177
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:36,585
Before we begin to draft our own

178
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,730
goals and priorities after what we've learned.

179
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:45,497
So the stakeholder meetings remind me the dates.

180
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,302
I don't have them on the top of my head for the stakeholder meetings.

181
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:52,009
of December 4th, which is Friday.

182
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,889
No, I'm sorry.

183
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:53,650
December 6th.

184
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,011
Today is the 4th.

185
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,612
Thank you.

186
00:21:57,312 --> 00:22:04,837
Our first one is Friday at 2 o'clock and then I believe the next one is on the 13th.

187
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,178
It's December 10th.

188
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,019
Sorry, it's a Tuesday.

189
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,260
Tuesday at 2 p.m.

190
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:22,096
So we've identified or we've invited a list of, I think, close to 30 stakeholders.

191
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:35,781
These include nonprofit organizations, city staff, regional agency staff, and I think some realtors,

192
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:51,896
Add to the list if I'm forgetting any categories of people who we've identified and so we'll be meeting with them over 2 meetings to facilitate a conversation about what are the needs and opportunities that they see here.

193
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,467
Again, Roberta, thank you.

194
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:08,010
If you're open for some feedback, I know you said you were thinking about sort of like how to present that slide on the initiatives.

195
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:22,974
Maybe just putting it in just saying exactly like housing strategies and just letting them know that the blue, exactly what you did today, like the blue is what the trust is trying to work on.

196
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:25,855
I had it formulated better in my head.

197
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:28,377
I lost it, sorry.

198
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:36,885
I had all these notes written too, which I don't have available on my screen, so I'm going to remember to have a printout to read from before I

199
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:46,320
Before this Friday, I think on that 1, it is like a footer note that it's blue and maybe just moving that up.

200
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:50,884
To like, right underneath could do that, but it's great.

201
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:51,585
Thank you so much.

202
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,065
Roberta.

203
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:58,010
I feel like I've seen a taste before, but seeing it again, and this presentation with that chart is really striking.

204
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:11,378
I haven't had a chance yet to dig in to find a version that I created about at least five years ago, but I think that the changes are very sobering too.

205
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:22,507
For one thing, I just updated this from 21 data to 22 data and the average wages have gone down between 21 and 22.

206
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:23,949
And this is region wide.

207
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:25,570
This isn't just in the city.

208
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:26,791
So, um,

209
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:47,276
I want to look a little bit more at that data, because I think that's very interesting that our costs are going up so rapidly while we are actually experiencing a real decline in wages.

210
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:56,678
And early versions of this table that I made, or that chart,

211
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,692
used to compare the cost of an apartment, a condo, or a single-family house.

212
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:20,115
And I dropped the single-family house off of that list and only show a room, an apartment, and a condo, reflecting what is meaningful to people who are looking for housing right now.

213
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:24,942
On that is 3000 the average rent right now.

214
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:27,368
I like all apartments.

215
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:34,841
I just did a quick search to see what that would be, and I found Craigslist.

216
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:43,545
I'm coming up with something maybe closer to 2,500, but that includes a lot of older apartments.

217
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:51,268
And if you look at the realtor sites, they're skewed more toward newer apartments.

218
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:54,870
So we don't have access to a data set unless somebody can get us

219
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,205
a proprietary data set.

220
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:13,919
We don't have something that will give us the actual averages, but I'm not sure that that would show up anyway because a lot of the older, more affordable units are not listed on MLS, and so they might not show up in COSTAR.

221
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,661
So, Craigslist

222
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:19,737
A windshield survey might still be a better gauge.

223
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:27,742
So just a quick eyeball gave me somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000, depending on what source I'm looking at.

224
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:33,365
And those are for smaller apartments, like one- and two-bedroom apartments.

225
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:39,655
Well, thank you, Roberta.

226
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:40,676
I appreciate it.

227
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:44,701
I hope you feel good on being on the practice run.

228
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,424
Yes, I'm very glad to have a practice run.

229
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:53,231
These things, the more you do it, the better you get, and it makes such a huge difference having a real audience.

230
00:26:55,198 --> 00:27:05,240
It does, and I will look through my slides and do a little spiel on the trust and how we do it and how we came about.

231
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,841
So I'll be prepared on Friday as well.

232
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:10,122
So thank you, thank you, thank you.

233
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:19,624
And we also want to try to be prepared to deliver, because all of you, I'm going into a little bit more detail because I know that you're really interested in the data itself.

234
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:23,205
But for our meetings, for our stakeholder meetings,

235
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:29,449
We want to rush through the presentation so we can give as much time as possible for the conversation.

236
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:41,136
And remind me, we have one hybrid meeting and one strictly Zoom, correct?

237
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:42,377
Yes.

238
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:43,498
Thank you.

239
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:43,938
Thank you.

240
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:44,439
Thank you.

241
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,240
The first one is a hybrid meeting.

242
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,581
On Friday.

243
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:48,221
Yes.

244
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:49,222
Great.

245
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:49,662
Thank you.

246
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:59,674
All right, so Aditi, did you want to provide an update on the overall housing strategies outlines in the housing production plan?

247
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:07,999
Yes, I think Roberta did a great job of providing a summary of housing strategies, so I'm just going to add to that.

248
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:19,611
talk about certain projects that address these housing strategies that Roberta talked about as part of the PDS reporting to the trust.

249
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:21,872
So this is just part one.

250
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:34,819
So I'll do my best to provide certain updates on the projects, ongoing projects, but hopefully in the next meeting, we'll have Alicia join us and talk about all these projects in detail.

251
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,901
I'm going to share my screen.

252
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:44,626
Can you all see it?

253
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:47,648
All right.

254
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:53,812
So.

255
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:59,808
I think Roberta briefly explained about the different housing strategies.

256
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:02,770
So these are the housing strategies.

257
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,311
I know it's a little hard to read.

258
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:09,615
But I'll talk about some of these housing strategies.

259
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:13,517
The ones in blue are in progress.

260
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,720
The ones in red are not initiated.

261
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,042
And the ones in orange are completed.

262
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:29,988
So the different housing strategies are outlined in the housing production plan and comprehensive plan, and I've just grouped them under common themes.

263
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,153
I'll talk about some of these themes in detail.

264
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:45,981
One common theme is to amend and update zoning to allow for multifamily mixed-use

265
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:51,609
housing types and different housing types across the city.

266
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:58,651
And then also include affordable infill and smaller infill housing.

267
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,953
The main strategy here is the city is undergoing zoning overhaul.

268
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:12,635
And as part of the zoning overhaul, the aim is to update the zoning to allow multifamily housing and affordable infill.

269
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,156
And another

270
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,924
Big change is the MBTA communities.

271
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:26,792
As you may be aware, Medford is now an MBTA community and Wellington Station has been identified as the MBTA zoning district.

272
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:30,632
The zoning overhaul.

273
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:39,521
City, in collaboration with Innis Associates, is currently doing an overall of its zoning ordinance.

274
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:54,555
This is to streamline development process and to modernize the zoning ordinance, as well as increase housing supply, reduce emissions, and promote vibrant, walkable neighborhoods in Medford.

275
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:59,372
So the zoning overhaul is grouped into three different phases.

276
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,814
Phase one is completed.

277
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:17,850
Phase one mainly focused on citywide policies and redefining certain definitions, as well as smaller changes that need not require additional research.

278
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:22,116
Phase two is currently in the process.

279
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:34,622
And as part of this phase, the city is looking at primarily two zoning districts or corridors and modifying their dimensional standards and boundaries.

280
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:39,064
Examples are Mystic Ave Corridor and Salem Street Corridor.

281
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:45,828
And as we speak, I think Mystic Ave Corridor is going before the Community Development Board this evening.

282
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:55,738
Third phase is yet to begin and hoping that this will begin end of this year or early next year.

283
00:31:56,058 --> 00:32:01,961
And in this phase, we are hoping that certain affordable housing strategies are also addressed.

284
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:14,025
So the example of Mystic Ave Corridor, this is the current map of Mystic Ave Corridor with its existing uses.

285
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:25,069
So currently there's single family, two family, three plus units and other residential uses as well as commercial industrial.

286
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,350
But the proposed one is redefined into

287
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:35,645
four sub-districts, Mixed-Use 1, Mixed-Use 2, Mixed-Use 3, and Commercial.

288
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:45,210
So Mixed-Use 1 allows for commercial and residential uses at a lower scale in terms of the building size and massing.

289
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:54,055
Mixed-Use 2 also includes both residential and commercial uses, but at a medium scale of massing size.

290
00:32:55,006 --> 00:33:07,631
Mixed-use 3, again, is similar to mixed-use 1 and 2, which includes residential and commercial uses, but the scale of the building is proportionately higher compared to mixed-use 1 and mixed-use 2.

291
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:16,375
And then the commercial sub-district mainly includes commercial uses and does not include residential uses.

292
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:24,378
So this Mystic Ave corridor allows for multiple dwelling as of right.

293
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:30,087
And it also allows dormitory, fraternity, and sorority houses as of right.

294
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:34,432
Lodging and boarding has to go before the CD board.

295
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,954
It requires a special permit.

296
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:41,240
And the other types of residential uses are not allowed.

297
00:33:44,743 --> 00:33:48,446
The Mystic Ave corridor also has development incentive bonuses.

298
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:51,968
I believe this, I'm not sure if this is finalized yet.

299
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:56,151
In the previous presentation before the city board, this was what was presented.

300
00:33:56,911 --> 00:34:06,037
So as part of the development incentive bonuses for affordable housing, this corridor is subject to inclusionary housing.

301
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:12,821
In addition to that, if the inclusionary housing affordable units

302
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:25,226
are designated, 20% of these units are designated at or below 60% AMI, then they can build another additional story.

303
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:39,938
If 30% of those affordable units that were generated through the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance are designated below 65% AMI, then you can build two additional stories.

304
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:54,831
The second type of incentive bonus is to provide an additional 20% affordable units in addition to the inclusionary housing ordinance.

305
00:34:55,232 --> 00:35:05,396
Or you can provide 30% more additional units that is in addition to the inclusionary housing ordinance.

306
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:06,757
I know it's a little confusing.

307
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:16,168
Provide an example if you're interested, or we can move to the next slide.

308
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,894
Basically, it's categorized into two different types of development incentive bonuses.

309
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:36,122
One where the inclusionary housing ordinance, you designate 20% of those units for households that are below 65% AMI.

310
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:48,353
And the other type of development incentive bonuses is in addition to the inclusionary housing ordinance, you provide 20% more affordable units.

311
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,622
So I just want to, I'm sorry, Aditi.

312
00:35:55,182 --> 00:36:06,509
So option one, the affordable requirement, everybody who's building is going to do 20% at or below 65% of the AMI.

313
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:14,074
If they're doing more than the 20%, then they can do an additional story?

314
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:18,457
No, everybody is subject to inclusionary housing ordinance.

315
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,179
So that means if a project has

316
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:26,256
10 to 24 units, then they're subject to 10% units affordable.

317
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:34,060
If a project has 25 to 49 units, then they're subject to 13% affordable housing units.

318
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,182
And then if a project has 50 or more units, then they're subject to 15%.

319
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:38,323
So if.

320
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:53,173
When a project is subject to, let's say, 15% affordable units, if that project has 100 units, then they would provide 15 units, which is affordable housing.

321
00:36:53,854 --> 00:37:06,064
But out of those 15 units, if they designate three units at or below 65% AMI, then they can receive an additional story to build on.

322
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,042
And what is our AMI already for inclusionary?

323
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,022
Is that up to 80?

324
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:14,643
Yes.

325
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:15,903
Okay.

326
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:24,728
So our IZ ordinance, inclusionary ordinance says up to 80%, but if they want to go, if they want to bring it down to 65%.

327
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:26,689
All right.

328
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:27,970
Thank you.

329
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,371
That was my disconnect.

330
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:29,991
Thank you.

331
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:38,476
No, it is confusing and it makes sense to ask questions because yeah, there are two different approaches.

332
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:57,328
Moving on to MBTA communities, so as I mentioned earlier, the Wellington station has been identified as an MBTA zoning district and it's an overlay zoning district called the Wellington station multifamily overlay district.

333
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:03,315
And here multifamily housing is allowed as of right.

334
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:08,216
This overlay district is subject to inclusionary housing and site plan review.

335
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:15,338
Approximately 130 acres of this land area is part of the MBTA community zoning district.

336
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:21,179
This also has development incentive bonuses for affordable housing.

337
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,200
It's the same percentage that's been proposed for Misty Cap Corridor.

338
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:35,495
Another important theme is accessory dwelling units as of right.

339
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:44,458
As you may be aware, Affordable Homes Act now allows ADUs as of right in single-family residential zoning districts.

340
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:53,020
So this supersedes the existing ADU ordinance outline in the city's ordinance.

341
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,462
This will be in effect from February 2nd next year.

342
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:09,597
The new act did not have principal dwelling or did not have owner occupancy in principal dwelling or ADU.

343
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:17,146
But our city's ordinance currently requires owner occupancy in the principal dwelling.

344
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,955
We haven't updated the city's ordinance yet.

345
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:29,270
We are waiting for EUHLC to provide a little more guidance on updating our ADUs.

346
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:41,300
The next strategy is fair housing, tenants' rights, and housing displacement prevention.

347
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:51,231
So promoting fair housing choice with an updated analysis is one of the strategies that was outlined in our housing production plan.

348
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:53,534
This is usually

349
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:57,198
undertaken by the North Suburban Consortium.

350
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:06,187
The last fair housing study was done in 2019, but currently HUD is updating its rules on affirmatively furthering fair housing.

351
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:14,475
So NSC aims to include this study in their next five-year action plan since the rules are not concrete yet.

352
00:40:17,003 --> 00:40:22,026
The next strategy is tenants' rights and resources, informing tenants of their rights and resources.

353
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:28,411
The city adopted Housing Stability Notification Ordinance in 2023.

354
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:37,759
So as part of this ordinance, the city developed tenants' rights and resources, and the city also informed land

355
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,700
landlords of this ordinance.

356
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:53,227
As part of the communication, I think a letter was sent to them early this year that they required to provide tenants' rights and resources to their tenants at the start and end of their tenancy.

357
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:10,669
Another strategy is to encourage mixed income and mixed use residential developments in vacant or underutilized city-owned lots.

358
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:17,353
So currently, the city has issued requests for proposals to develop city-owned lots.

359
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:24,058
This is behind Medford City Hall, along Riverside Ave, and then along Clippership Drive.

360
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:35,768
The project aims to have mixed use development that includes affordable housing, multifamily housing with ground floor commercial use.

361
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:42,512
And I think the existing parking would be improved as part of the development.

362
00:41:46,986 --> 00:42:00,709
In the RFP, I think the city requires, proposes to provide at least 150 residential units with a mix of one-bedroom units to support the graduate students and seniors and those who are looking to downsize.

363
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:10,632
In addition to inclusionary housing ordinance, if the new projects provide 20% affordable housing at 80% AMI,

364
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:20,086
or 15% of those units at 80% AMI with an additional five units at 50 to 60% AMI is preferred.

365
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:30,631
And bidders are also encouraged to provide deeper affordability by providing affordable units to those at 60% AMI or less.

366
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:42,269
As Roberta mentioned, we have three affordable housing developments in the pipeline.

367
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:45,371
Two of them are applying for building permits soon.

368
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:51,897
These two, 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway and 970 Fells Faye are two 40B projects.

369
00:42:53,738 --> 00:43:02,465
There are about nearly 200 units from both the developments that are affordable.

370
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:05,668
But as Roberta mentioned, since it's a 40B unit,

371
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:11,708
All units will be included in the subsidized housing inventory.

372
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:23,515
We also have a very small project, our community housing development organization, that's the CHODO, is building three units.

373
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:30,399
It's under construction and aims to finish by March next year.

374
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:44,789
I think there are other strategies here, for example, extending affordability restrictions of those units that are expiring soon.

375
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,874
City has been able to successively extend the affordability restrictions.

376
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:57,302
We talked about housing rehab program in the last meeting, so that is in progress.

377
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:09,454
The city is also supporting Medford Housing Authority's housing development projects, talked about Walkling Crote receiving HOME funds and also CPA funds.

378
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:17,918
We also talked about HOME and CPA funds in the previous meeting, and we've established an affordable housing trust.

379
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:19,979
So that's completed.

380
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,861
We've also expanded the staff capacity.

381
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:28,504
And currently, we are trying to foster partnership with mission-driven developers.

382
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:35,566
Enhanced community education.

383
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:39,907
We are trying to collaborate with Housing Medford.

384
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:43,848
We've applied for CHAPA's technical assistance.

385
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:45,548
We have not heard from them yet.

386
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:48,149
I did follow up, hoping to hear from them soon.

387
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,190
We are also doing a study on community land trust.

388
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:59,197
The working group is meeting once a month and providing feedback to the consultant who's leading the study.

389
00:45:00,037 --> 00:45:09,885
And then we've talked about linkage identifying funds to do a next study to add affordable housing linkage to our existing linkage program.

390
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:15,269
So these are some of the strategies.

391
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:18,552
Hopefully in the next meeting.

392
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:25,797
We'll have Alicia join us and talk to us about some of these projects in detail.

393
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,461
Yes, Roberta.

394
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:31,822
Thank you Aditi.

395
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:39,908
That was a great presentation and a lot of like, it's so important to get an update on on the progress that we're actually making on all of these.

396
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:46,667
One question I had about the Medford Square parcels.

397
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:49,309
Is the RFP already out for that?

398
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:50,210
Yes, it is.

399
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:50,650
Okay.

400
00:45:50,750 --> 00:46:02,278
And I did not see in your description anywhere that we're including some type of requirement to retain some space for the city government.

401
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:17,859
Or civic space of some kind of an, I think there is civic space, but I'm not sure exactly what the requirement is, but I'll have Alicia talk about it in the next meeting.

402
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:18,619
If that's okay.

403
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,320
Yeah, yeah.

404
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,540
Okay.

405
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,060
Yeah.

406
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,021
I'll make a note of that.

407
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:37,692
I've been advocating for some time that before we give up our last bit of land that the city owns, we need to think about what the city needs in the future and incorporate our needs into the plan for what to do with those parcels.

408
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:42,933
So I hope that that's still part of the discussion.

409
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:49,354
Yes, and I'll add that to my note and we can definitely ask Alicia about it.

410
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:51,795
Yeah.

411
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:54,574
Thank you, Aditi.

412
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:58,398
And great presentation, really appreciate it.

413
00:46:58,578 --> 00:47:08,470
And I'm still wrapping my head around the Medford's inclusionary requirements and whatnot, because I'm familiar with a little bit lower AMIs.

414
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,075
But does anybody have any questions for Aditi?

415
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:23,212
Could I just maybe offer something, which is also a great presentation.

416
00:47:23,232 --> 00:47:24,253
I feel like I learned a ton.

417
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:31,679
But as regarding fair housing, I believe a statewide office of fair housing was approved under the Affordable Homes Act.

418
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:41,086
And I wonder, that's probably something else or guidance is forthcoming, just the nature of city's relationships or access to that office.

419
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:46,570
But just wanted to flag there is state progress on that a little bit too, which hopefully impacts us.

420
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,502
All right, so thank you.

421
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:58,145
Our next item on the agenda is the meeting schedule.

422
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:01,648
Thank you for putting together the calendar year of 2025.

423
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:04,030
I have already started writing 2025 on my date.

424
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:10,436
I'm ahead of myself.

425
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:25,548
But anyways, 2025 schedule, you'll see that the meeting, I think there's a change in the meeting for January because I think January 1st is actually on a Wednesday, which is a holiday.

426
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:31,073
So we are proposing to meet on January 8th.

427
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:38,780
which is the following week at an earlier time, I think at five o'clock, yep, five o'clock start time.

428
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:50,870
And then we've done the schedule through, let's see, June, and then we'd close for July and August.

429
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,792
There are no meetings during the month of July and August.

430
00:48:54,933 --> 00:49:01,378
And then resume on the first Wednesday of the month, September through the end of the,

431
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:02,778
end of 2025.

432
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:08,423
Does that sound like a good plan for everybody?

433
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:11,700
Thank you.

434
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,622
That's really great to see that all lined up.

435
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:33,436
And 1 thing that I just want to put on our radar is that the application cycle for Community Preservation Act funds will, I don't know, like, if we want to just make a mental note that in May or June, we probably need to at that time.

436
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:50,281
Hopefully, we'll be finishing with the plan by then, and that will inform us what, how to develop the application for CPA funds, but the application will be due by the end of next year.

437
00:49:53,182 --> 00:50:06,527
So, um, we'll have to talk about it in June, so that can prepare the application while we're on summer break.

438
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:10,189
Thank you, Roberta.

439
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:10,809
That's helpful.

440
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:12,049
I just started that in my notes.

441
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:12,189
Okay.

442
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:12,530
Thank you.

443
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,450
Thank you.

444
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:25,229
All right, and we've reached the end of our agenda, so.

445
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,832
I had just one question about the declaration.

446
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:35,356
I forgot to mention, I think when we sign it, we should have a notary present.

447
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:37,238
Is that correct?

448
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:37,518
Okay.

449
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:38,198
Yes.

450
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:46,724
So I've spoken with Daria, who is the administrative assistant to the mayor's office, and she's notarized.

451
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:48,341
Okay.

452
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:55,783
And if people haven't notarized, you probably just need to bring a form of ID for the notary to verify your identity, and then that's all you'll need.

453
00:50:58,103 --> 00:51:02,044
A valid ID can't be, it can't be expired.

454
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:03,464
Or a library card.

455
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:04,485
Yeah.

456
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:05,085
Membership.

457
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:05,305
Right.

458
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:06,385
Those, those don't count.

459
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:07,425
Thanks.

460
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:08,986
