[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Building Commissioner Paul Moki on his retirement and 38 years of service to the city of Medford.

24
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

25
00:01:56,145 --> 00:02:02,951
[SPEAKER_10]: As all of us behind this rail know, Paul Moki has been a public servant in this city for 38 years.

26
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:16,763
[SPEAKER_10]: He certainly has been in front of this council many times in my nearly three years on the council and helped us spearhead the zoning recodification was incredibly helpful throughout that process attending

27
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:26,906
[SPEAKER_10]: you know hours and hours of meetings working with our zoning consultant making that all of that possible as well as all of the constituent service and management work that he did on a day-to-day basis.

28
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:37,649
[SPEAKER_10]: His last day is this Thursday and I was able to luckily able to catch a quick celebration and thank him for his service just yesterday.

29
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:43,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to congratulate him and then send that congratulations along through the clerk and

30
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:52,418
[SPEAKER_10]: on behalf of the council for his many years of service and hopefully we will be able to find someone to fill his shoes quickly.

31
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:52,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

32
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

33
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

34
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:56,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

35
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Council bus brings forward.

36
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,441
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a happy day for a great person but a sad day for this community.

37
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:13,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Mulkey, I don't think I've ever met somebody so well-versed in their position in this building in a long time.

38
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:19,205
[SPEAKER_11]: He is prepared, educated, calm, cool, collective.

39
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:27,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And even under the most strenuous circumstances, I've never seen the man in a negative light ever in my life.

40
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:34,552
[SPEAKER_11]: He was someone that you would call and hope that he would give you the answer that you wanted.

41
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:38,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you hung up the phone, you were confident.

42
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:49,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though you didn't get the answer that you needed or you were looking for, you felt confident because you were educated enough to answer our constituents with a lesson and

43
00:03:51,199 --> 00:04:04,908
[SPEAKER_11]: anything that we needed in our community, dealing with a code enforcement issue or a building issue or, I mean, the simplest things, the most intriguing items.

44
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:18,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's gonna be sad because we seldom work with many department heads, especially lately, that will call you back

45
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:29,900
[SPEAKER_11]: in a timely fashion, listen to your concerns and find a solution for you, whether it's what you're looking for or not within minutes.

46
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:39,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And to say that he wasn't one of the busiest department heads in this community for a long time would be an understatement.

47
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanna thank him for his service.

48
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:54,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank him for his commitment to the city, his ability to probably lead, I think, one of the best departments in the city.

49
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I think his whole staff is a true reflection of his personality and his educated background.

50
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:05,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he has made his staff multi-talented.

51
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:06,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have one,

52
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:15,152
[SPEAKER_11]: inspector downstairs one officer downstairs that that isn't well versed in many different building topics.

53
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's because of his leadership.

54
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:25,223
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you talk to those people, not one ever have a bad thing to say a negative word to say.

55
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:25,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And

56
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,307
[SPEAKER_11]: They're always working as a team, always supporting each other.

57
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:31,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's comical.

58
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:38,673
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at that department, and if you can only clone that throughout the community and society, boy, we'd be a better place today.

59
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot has to do with Paul Mulkey.

60
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,296
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we're going to miss him.

61
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:54,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that one of his staff will be the next to succeed him, because I think he has groomed them in his fashion.

62
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:57,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So, again, thank you Council yes bringing this forward.

63
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry Mr. celebration, but

64
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:17,182
[SPEAKER_11]: publicly I want to say thank you and if we can ask them to come up and make a motion to have them come to our next meeting and present him with a citation of service and something that we could publicly thank him I think would be important and I think that'd be well deserved.

65
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,783
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Madam President.

66
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:20,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpella.

67
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

68
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

69
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Paul Mulkey, one of the nicest guys in the building.

70
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you call him, he calls you back.

71
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:39,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the sad part is we've got 38 years of institutional knowledge walking out the door.

72
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you replace that?

73
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,288
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real key.

74
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:51,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can get other people that are smart and know their craft, but you don't get the institutional knowledge that Paul had.

75
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's where the sad part about him leaving.

76
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:59,353
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you know, I'm happy that he's going to be retiring

77
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:03,891
[SPEAKER_00]: less of a schedule and be a normal guy now.

78
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I just want to congratulate him.

79
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:12,176
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's just that institutional knowledge that keeps walking out of the door of this building that doesn't get replaced.

80
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:17,959
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a wealth of knowledge that can never be taught to someone else.

81
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:24,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to thank him for all the services of the community and his work to other people.

82
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:24,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

83
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

84
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much.

85
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:41,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Mookie is one of the best department heads, I've had the pleasure of working with, and I've worked with department heads all across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as representative for union employees in a municipal setting.

86
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,876
[SPEAKER_09]: And my relationship with Mr. Mookie over the years has grown to a friendship.

87
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:52,940
[SPEAKER_09]: He's someone that I respect, someone that I admire, someone who, as Councilor Caraviello said, brings a wealth of knowledge to the table.

88
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,208
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think about 38 years, that's a pretty long time.

89
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: When you look at the city, look at the community, you see what's happened over that 38 years.

90
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime there was a shovel on the ground, Mr. Moki was there to make sure that it was done the right way.

91
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:10,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes the new schools, stations landing.

92
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:15,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It includes Chevalier.

93
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:17,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It includes the science labs.

94
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,217
[SPEAKER_09]: It includes the field of dreams.

95
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It includes the turfing of Fort Melton.

96
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:31,116
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you think about the impact that he's had on this community over 38 years, that impact is going to last well, well, well, well into the future.

97
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,617
[SPEAKER_09]: These are things that have made our community great.

98
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:34,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's someone that had a hand in it.

99
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:43,520
[SPEAKER_09]: When you talk about his style as a department head and the way that he runs his department, I think it's safe to say that that is the only department in city hall where every employee is cross-trained.

100
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Where every inspector can be a code enforcement officer and every code enforcement officer can be an inspector.

101
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And when someone's out, they don't miss a beat.

102
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,753
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a testament to the vision that Mr. Mookie has, and how this is supposed to work.

103
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:04,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always said that the building department here in the city of Medford is a team, and they work very well together.

104
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Mookie just happens to be the person that's driving the bus.

105
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we talk about institutional knowledge being lost, that's always a concern.

106
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:15,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that Paul's done a great job cultivating talent in his office as well.

107
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:22,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So I look forward to seeing the next generation of leaders coming out of the building department here to work with us.

108
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is about Paul and all that he's done for this community.

109
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,050
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a great person.

110
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,692
[SPEAKER_09]: He's someone I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of times.

111
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:36,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had the opportunity to sit down with a number of times and enjoy his company and his conversation in a professional setting as well as in a personal, private setting.

112
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:40,759
[SPEAKER_09]: He's someone that I will certainly miss and I thank him for all that he's done for this community.

113
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And I second Councilor Scarpelli's motion to invite him down for citation.

114
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:45,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Ike.

115
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:47,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

116
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could, Councilor Tseng.

117
00:09:51,793 --> 00:10:05,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I am one of the newer Councilors here, so I haven't had the pleasure to work with Commissioner Moki as much as the rest of my colleagues have, but in the committee meetings that we have had with them,

118
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner Moki has always been a vital resource to us as a council and someone who's brought a wealth of knowledge and who has really helped us shape the work that we do here.

119
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:21,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just wanted to congratulate Commissioner Moki on his retirement.

120
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:23,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

121
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:33,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I could, I mean, my fellow councilors have said so much, and I think just hearing people speak at length about Commissioner Moki just is a testament to who he is and the work he does.

122
00:10:34,422 --> 00:11:00,327
[SPEAKER_07]: when she helps us all I think one of my early wins as a Councilor in my first term was a resident had reached out about their neighbor had you know large shipping container a lot of open storage and something that was a violation of code and it was an issue they've been battling for so long and Mr. Moki was finally able to get you know get it taken care of getting it to the right person and you know the resident thanked me profusely but it's it's it's not a lot of times it's not us it's the people who work at City Hall it's people like Commissioner Moki who

123
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:22,378
[SPEAKER_07]: go the extra mile they are they they're so responsive and just really get it done for the residents of our community and he's come to countless meetings as vice president bears said and you would never get a sense of you know how he feels about an issue personally he comes with his his work hat on and he says you know this is what we can do this is what we can't do and it's always been so welcome and I appreciate it so much.

124
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And he will be absolutely sorely missed.

125
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:30,115
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, 30 years of institutional knowledge is really tough to top.

126
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, he's working to the last minute.

127
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:37,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I had sent him a paper before I knew he was retiring, our tree ordinance, to see if we could get some feedback.

128
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, sure, I'll get that to you right away.

129
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,097
[SPEAKER_07]: When, you know, he's retiring in three days.

130
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:44,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, you know, we'll figure it out.

131
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, he'll absolutely be missed.

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:51,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank him for his many years of service to this community and to this body in particular as well.

133
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:58,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

134
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:00,335
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

135
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:01,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

136
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:12,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders and resolutions, 20-573 offered by Vice President Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council reconsider the vote on paper 20-573 for the third reading.

137
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears.

138
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:30,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President, in my everlasting persistence for consensus, I respect the request that we vote again on the snow removal ordinance, and my fingers are crossed that we will reach that intended goal.

139
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:31,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

140
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, can I speak to the debate that Councilor Bears and I had?

141
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Councilor Bears.

142
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:42,975
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very persuasive.

143
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:55,285
[SPEAKER_07]: So very Tuesday is the snow and ice removal ordinance that came before us for third reading last meeting.

144
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:03,347
[SPEAKER_07]: This just updates the language that was in the council a number of times.

145
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:07,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll, unless anyone would like the ordinance read back.

146
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:10,389

00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:20,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears.

150
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, can't secure beyond.

151
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:22,459

153
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:25,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

154
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Council night.

155
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:31,144
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

156
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:31,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

157
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

158
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:35,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

159
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, six in front of one in the negative the motion passes.

160
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:43,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take six six is good enough.

161
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,125
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-three five.

162
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

163
00:13:54,607 --> 00:14:08,498
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, to do that 359 offered by Councilor Knight, the result of the Metro City Council request that the DPW purchase necessary equipment to grind sidewalks and stems to assist in addressing the backlog of necessary sidewalk repairs Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much.

164
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:14,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week we sat here with our city engineer and our director of DPW and they talked about a need for certain equipment.

165
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:21,179
[SPEAKER_09]: to take certain functions in-house, that being grinding of stumps and the shaving down of sidewalks that are in disrepair.

166
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Annually, this council normally appropriates anywhere between a million to $1.5 million for sidewalk repairs.

167
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,002
[SPEAKER_09]: We also talk every year about whether or not we could handle this in-house.

168
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:36,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Earlier this evening, we talked about our budget priorities, and one of our budget priorities would be increasing the staffing level at the DPW.

169
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:42,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And in partnership or concert with that, I think it would make sense for us to also increase the equipment that they have.

170
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So they get some of this work that is necessary.

171
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:50,475
[SPEAKER_09]: As we said earlier in the day, the function of government is to provide services and we need boots on the ground in order to do that.

172
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We also need equipment to do it.

173
00:14:52,216 --> 00:15:07,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a request that the administration price out with this piece of equipment or cost that the city engineer and the city public works director was speaking up and to present it to the council for either inclusion in the capital plan or for a supplemental appropriation request.

174
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

175
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:10,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

176
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,797
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

177
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:16,477
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

178
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:17,638

00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,156

296
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:15,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

297
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:16,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So 22360.

298
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:28,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So what this paper is, it goes just into the efforts of corporations like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to keep their employees classified as independent contractors.

299
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And as such, these employees do not get benefits or pay into things like social security.

300
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:41,583
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times they are not getting a living wage once, or even a minimum wage once the hours and their shifts are calculated

301
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:52,110
[SPEAKER_07]: These companies contend that these folks are independent contractors and not employees, despite the fact that they are required to perform a set number of shifts.

302
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,993
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have flexibility in scheduling.

303
00:16:55,753 --> 00:17:00,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not allowed to refuse a certain number of rides or they won't be able to be on the app anymore.

304
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:15,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is in response to House Bill 1234, that would continue to exempt these gay economy businesses from paying into Social Security unemployment, which costs Massachusetts taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and we can use these programs for everyone.

305
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:29,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would affirm our support in joining Councilors across the greater Boston region, workers, consumers, community members, faith organizations, environmental and racial justice advocates, labor rights, civil rights, and union organizers to urge Massachusetts legislature to oppose House Bill 1234,

306
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:35,184
[SPEAKER_07]: and the proposed 2022 state ballot initiative with similar language.

307
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just really something to affirm our support.

308
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:50,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand Councilors, you know, certain times don't like to go on issues that go up to the state level in this way, but I would just argue that this is something that very much impacts our community.

309
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,189
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people who live in our community.

310
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:52,950
[SPEAKER_07]: These are workers that are

311
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:58,138
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, oftentimes not making a living wage they're not making a minimum wage.

312
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are services that use our roads our streets.

313
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:09,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talked about the congestion and the dangerousness that happens because of all these services, and they're essentially.

314
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:11,558
[SPEAKER_07]: they're allowed to do whatever they want.

315
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:17,502
[SPEAKER_07]: They say these people aren't employees, we're not going to give them benefits, we're not going to make sure they have a living wage, and they want to codify that.

316
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:28,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just asking the council to join with other councils and leaders in the area to stand up and say that these workers deserve the same rights as all other employees, because that's what they are.

317
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:32,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears, Councilor Caraviello, Collin Sands, go around.

318
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:34,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears first.

319
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:36,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

320
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for putting forward this resolution.

321
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:45,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Fundamentally, this is about the future of work in Medford, in Massachusetts, and in our country.

322
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:53,315
[SPEAKER_10]: And these big tech corporations have gotten out ahead of the law and out ahead of regulation.

323
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're trying to solidify that position.

324
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:02,786
[SPEAKER_10]: In California, a very similar ballot question was passed by a very close margin.

325
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:15,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only reason it passed at all is because Lyft and Uber and DoorDash and these large companies spent tens to hundreds of millions of dollars on ad campaigns to confuse the voters, to confuse the issue.

326
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:17,900
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're doing the same thing here.

327
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,184
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever see any of the ads, they say yes to independent drivers, yes to supporting drivers,

328
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:30,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And most of the time, you know, the people that they have in those advertisements are the people that they're talking about.

329
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,977
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the people who drive occasionally, you know, once in a while.

330
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:43,626
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact of the matter is over half of the rides on these services and half of the trips on these DoorDash, you know, delivery type services are done by 9%.

331
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,280
[SPEAKER_10]: of the workers.

332
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:53,784
[SPEAKER_10]: So the vast majority of this service is being provided by a small number of workers and those folks, they want to be called employees.

333
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,647
[SPEAKER_10]: If right now, a lot of these folks split between multiple services.

334
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:11,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So even under the proposed benefits that have been written by their bosses, they're not going to qualify for health insurance, even though the bosses ad say they will, they're not going to qualify for benefits that the bosses ad say they will.

335
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:12,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And beyond that,

336
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:16,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's pretty clear you've got these multi-billion dollar corporations.

337
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:30,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Lyft gave a $15 million donation to the ballot campaign to support this ballot question, the largest single donation in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to a ballot campaign, and they're expected to give tens of millions more.

338
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:36,799
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a reason that these companies are spending tens of millions of dollars to put out ad campaigns to confuse people.

339
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:44,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's because at the back end, if these bills pass or this ballot question passes, they're going to save billions of dollars.

340
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And why are they going to save it?

341
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're not going to be paying it to the people who are making them their profits.

342
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,552
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the day, this is a basic issue.

343
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:52,994
[SPEAKER_10]: of workers rights worker justice.

344
00:20:53,715 --> 00:21:10,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the point is also well made that these services are all over our streets and all over our communities and if they're not paying their workers well, and they're not paying federal income taxes and you know they don't have a yard or a taxi, you know they're not buying a taxi license or anything else they're paying what

345
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember a $1 fee or something like that.

346
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,177
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, I mean, ridiculous.

347
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:29,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're completely abusing our system and they're trying to abuse it further with this obscene spending to functionally confuse people and get them to vote against the interests of their neighbors.

348
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:40,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's incredibly important that this council speaks up and says that that model of business has no place in a community like Medford and in a Commonwealth like Massachusetts.

349
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:40,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

350
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:41,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

351
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:42,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

352
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:42,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

353
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,997
[SPEAKER_00]: They make these people come in and they tell them, you're now a business owner.

354
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:08,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell them with that story, you're a business owner now, you work for yourself.

355
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:13,605
[SPEAKER_00]: When technically they're not, they're not business owners, they're employees of these companies.

356
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,216
[SPEAKER_00]: They dictate when they work and when they don't work.

357
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see them out there.

358
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:23,723
[SPEAKER_00]: You got men and women, they're working 18, 20 hours a day.

359
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:30,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not even for other people, but for their own safety, they shouldn't be out there that long.

360
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,292
[SPEAKER_00]: They get no benefits, they get nothing.

361
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:35,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, they're paid a substandard wage.

362
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're working 20 hours a day and you're not even making a real wage that you should be making.

363
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:48,304
[SPEAKER_00]: The vehicles have now, they went out and bought vehicles under the dream that you're going to make all this money.

364
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:50,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, they're out there, they killed themselves.

365
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:55,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the vehicle is old and all broken down and they still owe a lot of money on it.

366
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all these companies are making

367
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,432
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more money.

368
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:02,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is not a new thing.

369
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:12,318
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been a way to skirt the law and not pay taxes and not pay these people a living wage.

370
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:17,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I know a lot of them that do this kind of work and I see them.

371
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people sleeping in cars.

372
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:27,721
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because, I don't know if you know, but New York has capped Uber and Lyft.

373
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:29,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're all coming over here.

374
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:32,642
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see all the New York plates here, because New York has capped them.

375
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And other cities have done the same.

376
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:36,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to go to the cities that have no cap.

377
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,905
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something maybe we should, maybe this state should look at doing too.

378
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:42,225
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree wholeheartedly with this.

379
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:46,046
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll support it, but it's been going on for years.

380
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:52,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, the big companies keep, they keep making more money and more money.

381
00:23:52,452 --> 00:24:00,681
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a chance, watch the series, Super Pumped, about Uber and how they take advantage of their employees.

382
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'll support this.

383
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:06,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I say, these people just, they deserve to make a fair wage.

384
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

385
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:08,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

386
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:31,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you President real and thank you for putting this on the agenda tonight, I have to say, advocating against each 1234 is something I thought of as one of my priorities for this entire calendar year in our capacity the city council in my private life to restate some of what's already been said, I think this constitutes one of the biggest assaults on workers rights that

387
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:50,566
[SPEAKER_01]: to my knowledge that we have seen in years and years, it's an issue that it's hard for me to contemplate without getting emotional because it is such an insult to the people of this Commonwealth to incite a campaign of, as Councilor Caraviello said, voting against the interests of our neighbours.

388
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:56,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an insult to the workers who perform these jobs, who do these gigs, which has become

389
00:24:57,468 --> 00:25:01,694
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the backbones of our, you know, modern, local level economy.

390
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that these apps are going away anytime soon.

391
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:05,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the horse is out of the barn.

392
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:10,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And what these companies are trying to do through these ballot questions is to

393
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:33,787
[SPEAKER_01]: enshrine the chipping away of essential protections, protection from liability, fair wage, just and safe working conditions for all of these people who are doing the rides, delivering the food, you know, often, you know, to people who, you know, they need that that sort of mobility service in order to make their life work.

394
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:41,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm glad for this city council to have the ability to get to advocate for this.

395
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:50,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as stated this is this is a state issue but it's also of course an issue on the most local level, because

396
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:59,575
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gig workers in our community, and we have people who are on the consuming end of these companies in our city.

397
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:10,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the other things that propositions like this do is they complicate that question of how do we, as a city, as a constituency, have a relationship with these companies if

398
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: know, wrongdoing is going on.

399
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:24,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if people know, this is a quote unquote, small business owner, who's, you know, wrong is blocking the sidewalk, who's, you know, performing badly in our community.

400
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:39,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know they can't take it to the appropriate person, which would be the company, they know that if there's a finger to point, it's pointing an individual who probably this is, you know, they wouldn't be, you know, doing this job if they had a better, more accessible option.

401
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:42,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So for so many reasons for protecting

402
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, generations long hard one workers rights workers justice to make sure that we can have a proper working accountable relationship with the companies that are doing business in our city.

403
00:26:55,836 --> 00:27:05,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is a resolution that we need to pass that we need to follow that up with making sure that h 1234 isn't allowed to distort worker relationships throughout our state.

404
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:05,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

405
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:06,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

406
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you for putting this on the agenda.

407
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:22,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially h 1234, you know what what it does is it makes a bad situation worse by enshrining it as Councilor Collins said into law.

408
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:27,518
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if you know, you know, an Uber driver.

409
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:34,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, many of my friends and family friends, drive for Uber or Lyft, you know the working situations are great.

410
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:47,593
[SPEAKER_05]: you, you'll know that, um, you know, they've, they have been tricked, as Councilor Caraville have said and the rhetoric that these big corporations are using doesn't reflect their actual lived reality on the ground.

411
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And by institutionalizing by legalizing it.

412
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes a bad situation worse.

413
00:27:53,899 --> 00:28:00,385
[SPEAKER_05]: If if h 1234 goes through and I encourage people to read the body of the text of this resolution.

414
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:11,134
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, drivers might make as little as for $4 82 cents per hour, and those who qualify for a health care site that may earn as little as 674 per hour.

415
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,736
[SPEAKER_05]: When we have people making those amounts.

416
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:26,807
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that also puts a strain on our, on our city's resources, and it puts a strain on our, our society as well, because we'll have to do more to as a government to fill in this hole that big corporations are leaving for us.

417
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:42,640
[SPEAKER_05]: We also you know we spend a lot of time talking, both in the chambers and outside of the chambers about equity, but you know, h 1234 and the, the ballot proposition on the proposed the ballot proposition would would you know

418
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:51,408
[SPEAKER_05]: would reverse all the good work that we are doing as a society when it comes to insurance equity.

419
00:28:51,789 --> 00:29:05,621
[SPEAKER_05]: This House bill would create an underclass of workers here in Massachusetts that is disproportionately black or brown and disproportionately immigrant, disproportionately working class, disproportionately

420
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:17,250
[SPEAKER_05]: veterans, and you know, this is, this is all things that we should be concerned about as a city and things that affect us in our work is as a city council.

421
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:30,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I, I urge everyone to do your research on this issue to read this resolution and not and not to be tricked by the big corporations that are running ads on TV, and on YouTube that you see all the time.

422
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:31,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And

423
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:38,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, again I think President moral for putting this on the agenda because it's just so important that we address this.

424
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:39,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

425
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:40,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

426
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

427
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:48,858
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a topic of much debate and as evident by future governor Healy's.

428
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,410
[SPEAKER_09]: lawsuits, also legal proceedings.

429
00:29:52,731 --> 00:29:57,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really the age old argument of, you know, is this an employer, an employee or a contractor?

430
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:01,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, when I think about this, I think about it in the simplest terms, right?

431
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:08,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've called Lyft before a bunch of times, I've called Uber a bunch of times, I've never called Joe the driver.

432
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I've called Uber and Uber has sent me a driver, right?

433
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:16,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's really employee misclassification, in my opinion.

434
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:27,385
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Uber, Lyft, these ride share hailing companies, you know, they have the control, the direction of the employee and anything the employee does is really in the furtherance of Uber and Lyft's name, right?

435
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:30,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in their interest, it's in furtherance of the employer's interest.

436
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:34,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a three-part test to determine whether or not you're a Councilor or an employee.

437
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:36,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sorry, contractor and employee.

438
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:42,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, when you look at what's going on, it's clear that these companies are taking advantage of workers.

439
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:52,537
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing it through, like Councilor Caraviello said, vehicle leasing programs and financial lending programs that are making these individuals, quite frankly, financially bound to these organizations.

440
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:54,498
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they wanted to leave, they wouldn't even be able to.

441
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,641
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so when you look at this and you sit back and you say, what's right is right, what's right is right.

442
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:05,511
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the way that they're classifying people the amount of money that they're putting into this case.

443
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

444
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,452
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absolutely ridiculous and just shows you there's something wrong.

445
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:13,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen this since what was the last one with a right to repair.

446
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

447
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:17,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Millions and millions of dollars are going into this to fight something.

448
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:20,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, because it's good for the working person that's why.

449
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're seeing this console concept is this is the first step.

450
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:43,257
[SPEAKER_09]: in an effort to eliminate workers' rights and workers' benefits, so that big business doesn't have to be on the hook for these liabilities, and so that individuals are going to be tasked with the responsibility of planning for their own retirement, their own future, because they're not paying into Social Security, because they're not paying into healthcare, and at the end of the run,

451
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:49,635
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to see a situation where we have a lot of people that are going to need more from government.

452
00:31:50,255 --> 00:32:01,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is actually a policy I think that's going to make sense because it's going to protect us economically it's going to protect that name is going to protect the residents of this community, and it's going to prevent big business from taking advantage the little guy.

453
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:06,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So I support this whole heartedly and I think the council put it on the agenda this evening.

454
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

455
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President, you know, you know we talked about, you know, all this other stuff but at the end of the day.

456
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:15,422
[SPEAKER_00]: These men and women are working 20 hours a week.

457
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:21,692
[SPEAKER_00]: No one cares about their safety, the safety of the people around them, the safety of the people in these cars.

458
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get into an accident, what happens?

459
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:25,299
[SPEAKER_00]: They get fired.

460
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the loyalty that these companies give them.

461
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, safety should be the number one issue.

462
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:35,416
[SPEAKER_00]: These people shouldn't be out there working.

463
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:39,018
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be in the vehicle 18, 20 hours and sleeping in your car.

464
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:44,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because now you're putting yourself at risk, your passenger at risk, and the people all around you.

465
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:46,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reward is

466
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:50,204
[SPEAKER_00]: They owe thousands of dollars in taxes because no taxes have been withheld.

467
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:54,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the year, again, they say these people, they're not making a lot of money.

468
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:56,367
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling to save for their families.

469
00:32:56,847 --> 00:33:02,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And now April 15th come, no one's withheld any taxes on you.

470
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:03,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you owe all this money.

471
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get into an accident, you're fired.

472
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:11,673
[SPEAKER_00]: That's these companies that just don't, they care nothing about the employees at all.

473
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:23,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Zoom would like to speak on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

474
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:24,969
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

475
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:25,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

476
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

477
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

478
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:31,952
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-361 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

479
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:45,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council have a representative from Eversource attend the next city council meeting to give the council an update on an ongoing project on Mystic Avenue and Winthrop Street via further resolve at the city engineer and dpw also be in attendance.

480
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:47,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

481
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:55,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ever so is this this is a gift that keeps on giving never goes away.

482
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:02,849
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking, where are we on this project?

483
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:03,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

484
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody knows where we are anymore.

485
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,092
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there, they're not there.

486
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:15,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need an update on where this project is going, how much longer it's gonna be.

487
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:29,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, and the reason I like to have the city engineer, not only to be involved with this here, but, you know, before we paved Winter Street and all these streets again, are there any other projects

488
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,423
[SPEAKER_00]: that are gonna be done after we're paved.

489
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:42,229
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing worse than seeing a brand new paved street and a month later, we're up there digging it up because a pipe should have gone in there before.

490
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:58,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the engineer will come in and coordinate with the gas company, any other water company, all these other people that are looking to do projects down there, let's do it now before the road is paved and then we dig it up

491
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:05,882
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple months a that's probably the one that aggravates me to the worst and just is no coordination.

492
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:15,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could reach out to them and have DPW here and say in some of my episodes we haven't had a we haven't had a conversation with them and I think the longest time.

493
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:20,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see where we are and see how much longer this project's gonna keep on going.

494
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

495
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Further discussion.

496
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:26,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President.

497
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:29,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, a question.

498
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:42,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I recall getting a correspondence from the administration at some point saying that they stopped the construction on the episodes project because they wanted to make sure that the condensate con and shell was accessible for the summer.

499
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:54,732
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we project slowed down because we were short of policemen to cover the details that was that was one of the issues, two months we got it I think we got something from maybe Mr. smurdy.

500
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to look it up.

501
00:35:57,465 --> 00:36:02,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I have asked the city engineer if they have any updates on timing.

502
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's obviously nuts on them and resources and give them information.

503
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:11,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I've asked them, you know, month, two months ago, because we're in high construction season, and nothing's happening.

504
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing, they just they started doing a little bit of work down by the rotary.

505
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the last few days, I don't know what they're doing there.

506
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:23,557
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the thing, you know, they, there's still holes that have to be dug, they mean that they haven't even got to yet.

507
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:26,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I say, Where are we and how much

508
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:46,249
[SPEAKER_11]: point of information I know we did have I know I had a few calls about the South Street intersection and the work that was being done by EvoSauce overnight because the I believe the chief had decided that due to safety concerns of that intersection they needed to do it overnight so

509
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:50,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, they haven't stopped the process.

510
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:53,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're sort of working backwards now.

511
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,645
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it seems like to me.

512
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:57,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but again, it'd be nice.

513
00:36:57,726 --> 00:37:14,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is, again, this is where, when we first sat down with Eversource, when they came to talk to us, one of the biggest things I kept saying, and I think all of us have said, having a representative paid for by Eversource or by the utility companies

514
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,531
[SPEAKER_11]: to be the clerk of the works.

515
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:26,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't expect our city engineer to be the person that is sitting there making sure that they're held accountable because it's not feasible.

516
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:29,457
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, this is something we're lacking in our community.

517
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:35,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Other communities have the clerks of the works that make sure that all these jobs are being, you know,

518
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:52,693
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, all the neighbors in the areas are being informed, making sure that, you know, the preparation isn't hindering traffic, that the cleanup is done satisfactory, so constituents aren't left with concerns and issues after they leave.

519
00:37:54,527 --> 00:38:10,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're gonna keep coming across this until we have someone with boots on the ground there that's making sure that they're responding back to the city engineer or DPW director in some communities or the mayor's office.

520
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,893
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is definitely an issue.

521
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:15,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've lost communication again with Eversource.

522
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:20,496
[SPEAKER_11]: They get to a certain point and then they forget that they have to report

523
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,237
[SPEAKER_11]: keep people informed.

524
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, that's not good business.

525
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:28,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, utilities shine again.

526
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

527
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

528
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Any luck Councilor Knight.

529
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:33,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I got nothing.

530
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:38,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember getting that I did a quick search I couldn't find it.

531
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't find it either but I do.

532
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:47,718
[SPEAKER_10]: recall something coming across somewhere about, I don't know if it was the Eversource project but there was work to be done.

533
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:53,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in the parking lot, there was a MWR a MW okay okay.

534
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:53,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

535
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's it.

536
00:38:56,862 --> 00:39:06,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I just add this to counsel's point, the Department of Public Utilities I mean it's another example of a public entity that's just completely unaccountable to the public.

537
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:10,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So, maybe if, if his.

538
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:15,370
[SPEAKER_10]: divine prophecy is true, Governor Healy will address that.

539
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:20,995
[SPEAKER_10]: They put the PU in the DPU, don't they?

540
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:24,959
[SPEAKER_10]: The PU and DPU, I like that, Councilor Newton.

541
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

542
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,883
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by?

543
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:31,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I second.

544
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

545
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:36,948
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, motion passes.

546
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:56,258
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-362 offered by Councilor Tseng, whereas the US Supreme Court's decision in Shurtleff versus City of Boston creates important implications for municipalities and public entities with regards to flag raising practices and policies, and whereas the city of Medford has been advised to examine existing practices and policies regarding flag raising to ensure compliance with the First Amendment,

547
00:39:56,847 --> 00:40:06,813
[SPEAKER_07]: and to also consider examining their formal or informal policies and practices regarding display of banners, flags, message boards, and other signage on and use of public buildings and property.

548
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:22,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide a report to the city council on its current practices and policies regarding flag raising and other displays, which may be affected by the short-lived decision, especially with further regard to requests from private or non-governmental groups slash individuals.

549
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And be it further resolved that the city administration

550
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:32,080
[SPEAKER_07]: also provide its plan to ensure that our policies comply with the Surleaf decision, including any updates to policies and practices.

551
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:32,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng.

552
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Morell.

553
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:36,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, the U.S.

554
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:50,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Supreme Court decided a few weeks ago in a case called Shurtleff v. City of Austin that the city has to be careful when it comes to approving or denying what flags can go up on government property.

555
00:40:51,032 --> 00:41:01,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, the most important lessons for us is that we either have to have a stated policy where we say that our flagpoles and our places for banners on city property

556
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:14,582
[SPEAKER_05]: constitute governmental speech, or we just have to allow everyone to essentially be able to apply and use those platforms for speech.

557
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:21,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of this has to be done through our law department, our legal department, they'll have to be the ones looking at

558
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:35,792
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at the policies but I think it would be good for our city for our city council to be updated and to be able to have a voice in terms of what policies are being developed in response to the shortlist decision.

559
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:45,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is just a simple resolution asking the city administration to give us an update as to what it's doing in this case, before we get into any legal trouble.

560
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:52,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, Vice-President Bears, and then Councilor Caraviello.

561
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:53,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

562
00:41:55,938 --> 00:42:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if folks remember, but prior to in 2020, in summer of 2020, I had put a resolution on the agenda around

563
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:20,035
[SPEAKER_10]: putting up a banner on the front of city hall and went into a pretty extensive resolution, legal diatribe on the case law behind the government speech doctrine.

564
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:23,916
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was about putting up a Black Lives Matter banner on city hall.

565
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:32,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time the district court had ruled that the city of Boston, basically the Supreme court has overruled the court of appeals and the district court since then.

566
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But what's very clear from the case is that

567
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:40,286
[SPEAKER_10]: of what existed and was true in 2020 is true now.

568
00:42:42,555 --> 00:43:04,090
[SPEAKER_10]: which is that as long as the city has a policy or I may say an ordinance that clearly defines how, you know, government entities, the city council or the mayor can use government buildings or flagpoles or places of displaying any sort of banner or message.

569
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:09,634
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as there's a clear policy as to how that can be used then that is completely allowable.

570
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:18,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it would, I agree with Councilor Tseng what we ran into and in 2020 was that we didn't have a policy.

571
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,925
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really nilly, and I believe in 2020, we passed a resolution and asked what the policy was.

572
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:29,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't believe we ever received a response from the city administration on that.

573
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:47,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've had it on my list for a couple years now that maybe we should write an ordinance and if we're not going to have a policy that maybe we have to take it in our hands to protect ourselves in the future so I'd love to get a response to this resolution and see if a policy has since been implemented.

574
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:55,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's behooves the city to have a policy that any private entity can put up any message they want on a public building I think that's incredibly dangerous.

575
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:04,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly don't think that having a very clear policy about the government itself putting up messages should be an issue.

576
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:13,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And I certainly don't think the excuse should be made, as the excuse was made by the Bayroll administration in 2020, that if we put one thing up, we have to put anything up.

577
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:17,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, if the government wants to put something up, they can put up what they want.

578
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:22,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Supreme Court just made it very clear that as long as we have a clear policy, we don't have to let anyone put up whatever they want.

579
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:37,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to thank the Supreme Court, which I very rarely do with the Supreme Court, for making it very clear what our legal standing is when it comes to government speech in public buildings.

580
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:37,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

581
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:38,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

582
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:39,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

583
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:40,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

584
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:44,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we were coming into the building tonight, we saw a new flagpole being put up.

585
00:44:45,768 --> 00:45:00,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that's that'll coincide with some of the stuff here, because we were in violation that we were taking the POW flag down putting up other flags, even on a temporary basis which was a violation of the law so I'm assuming that the new flagpole that's up there.

586
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:05,605
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, well you'll see it when you walk up the door will address some of these issues.

587
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:07,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

588
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:10,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President.

589
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng for elevating this issue.

590
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:20,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this decision really provides an opportunity for us to be proactive for us to clarify the city's policy.

591
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:35,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it is not a great position for our city to put itself in, that any person can use our flagpole for any speech at all.

592
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a huge Pandora's box.

593
00:45:38,805 --> 00:45:44,528
[SPEAKER_01]: But to take the first step first, I think that we absolutely need to see a clear policy or a clear response on what our current policy is.

594
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't have one, I think that's a huge Pandora's box.

595
00:45:47,409 --> 00:46:05,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take this opportunity to make one to close the door on legal troubles or more back and forth diatribes further down the line, whether that's through an administrative policy or through a clear ordinance that dispels out what our flagpole may be used for and by whom.

596
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:07,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you, Councilor Tseng.

597
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Councilor Collins.

598
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:10,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from the Council?

599
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:12,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

600
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:36,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Councilor bears mentioned possibly wanting to add in an ordinance was that a amendment to this, which I'd be happy to support but just that if we don't receive a response I think it would be a prompt response that clearly states that we will have an administrative policy, then to protect the city would probably be in the responsibility of this council to take our own action, so no amendment just great kind of a path forward.

601
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just want, I just wanted to clarify.

602
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:42,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see Mr. Castagnetti with his hand up on Zoom.

603
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:46,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

604
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:50,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford Mass.

605
00:46:52,689 --> 00:46:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Marks might comment saying that this sounds like a slippery slope.

606
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:06,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I would think that only one thing should go on to that

607
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:20,876
[SPEAKER_04]: City property the flag and that would be the United States flag while we still have it and also the prisoner of war POW flag and pretty much nothing else Because it wasn't for our veterans.

608
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:36,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any of us would be here today tonight If you allow one entity to put up whatever their mission is and Who knows where that may end and who makes these final decisions?

609
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:42,382
[SPEAKER_04]: We might end up with some group or entity that wants to worship Satan.

610
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:49,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a bad idea to mix the government with people's missions.

611
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:50,288
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

612
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

613
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:58,846
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Bears.

614
00:47:58,966 --> 00:47:59,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

615
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:01,187
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

616
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:02,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

617
00:48:02,688 --> 00:48:06,349
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-363 offered by Councilor Tseng.

618
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:12,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, MBTA, has provided its bus network redesign proposal

619
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: which includes changes affecting Medford residents in all neighborhoods and is now soliciting feedback from the public.

620
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:39,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the city administration inform residents of the proposed changes to bus service in Medford and the MBTA's feedback survey, which is available online in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Haitian, Creole, Arabic, Vietnamese, and French, and be it further resolved that the Subcommittee on Climate Sustainability and Transportation meet to draft feedback for the MBTA on changes to bus service in Medford.

621
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:40,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sanders.

622
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I'm sure many many residents of the city of have now seen the bus network redesign proposal, but I wanted to put this on the agenda so that we got this the word out to you the more people.

623
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:59,219
[SPEAKER_05]: These are redesigns that would really impact every single neighborhood in Medford.

624
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:05,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single bus route has been affected in Medford and the service will change as well.

625
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen residents who have.

626
00:49:08,784 --> 00:49:11,768
[SPEAKER_05]: both positive and negative impressions about this plan.

627
00:49:11,788 --> 00:49:18,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to say that this plan is not yet final, and that the MBTA is still soliciting feedback.

628
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in the past,

629
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:39,168
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't always been receptive to the feedback of the council and to residents, we've, I know this, I know the previous council and the Councilors here today have fought very hard for the 325 and 326 to be service for those two bus routes to be restored in Medford.

630
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, that's not in this plane.

631
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:49,933
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we just need to keep pushing, you know, and it's the only thing that we can do right now.

632
00:49:50,513 --> 00:50:07,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if our residents are informed of the proposed changes, if they're informed of the feedback survey and ways to participate in giving feedback, that will push us a step further in trying to get the bus service that we want and we deserve here in Medford.

633
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:24,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I also attached language in there about having the subcommittee on climate sustainability and transportation, having that committee meet the draft feedback because I think feedback from a council will be what is valuable and will

634
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:29,056
[SPEAKER_05]: be at a different platform than, you know, if we were just to give feedback separately.

635
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:36,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be, if there are other councillors who'd want to participate in this meeting, I'd be happy to amend that language as well.

636
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:44,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is an opportunity for us to be proactive and to take action on something that will affect a lot of residents in the city.

637
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:53,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to also let residents know that there will be in-person sessions to give feedback

638
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:57,023
[SPEAKER_05]: As well, it's also on the MBTA website.

639
00:50:57,843 --> 00:51:07,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the same place where you can find the feedback survey for the dates and times of that meetings of those meetings, and those meetings will run until the end of July.

640
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:08,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

641
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:25,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Councilor Tseng knows, but City of Bedford is one of the fourth or fifth highest assessed communities for the T. And again, and I'm sure once the train station opens up at College Ave, our assessment is gonna go up even higher.

642
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:31,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though that's an additional service, we've seen a cut in service over the last few years.

643
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:41,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think our opinion, seeing that we pay such a high assessment, I think our opinion should mean something, even though we send these things to them, they don't respond or anything.

644
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:57,123
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be, it's a, we should have a seat and maybe some type of table I don't know if we, if the city has a representative to the T, but we should have something to say, because our assessment is ridiculous the amount we pay, and say we keep getting cutbacks and cutbacks.

645
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I support this issue.

646
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:00,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

647
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:06,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Tsengford for this forward.

648
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:10,236
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this council has fought very hard for the 325 and 326 and 710.

649
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:23,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually slightly glad to see that the new 100 route in here would include a lot of the previous 710, except for the part in the heights, which is of course one of the most important.

650
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,979
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still the heights you have to walk to one side or the other to get transit access.

651
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that I think the,

652
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:47,125
[SPEAKER_10]: proposed T 96 and T 101 with 15 minutes service is a great addition to the community, especially the T 96 connecting the red, orange and green lines with service every 15 minutes, but I do completely agree that there are some major gaps in here that need to be addressed.

653
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:53,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I very much doubt we're going to get the express bus service back I know that nobody wants to hear that, but there.

654
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:56,307
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at this redesign it eliminated it everywhere.

655
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:59,228
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just Medford it's all the express buses are gone.

656
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:08,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And that has been an initiative of the Baker administration to privatize or otherwise eliminate express bus service, which we have seen impact our community.

657
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:11,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it makes a lot of sense for this council to serve.

658
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:15,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I hear you on the climate transportation subcommittee.

659
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:20,531
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're amenable I think a committee of the whole might be a better venue.

660
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:24,055
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of residents clamoring for for a voice in this.

661
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:30,934
[SPEAKER_10]: way that this was rolled out, there is kind of a specific PDF for Medford.

662
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's talking about impacts specific to Medford.

663
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:43,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we could host a committee of the whole, have residents issue their opinions, have Councilors issue theirs, and then submit that as a public comment as you intended to the MBTA.

664
00:53:45,279 --> 00:53:51,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you wouldn't mind amending that to committee of the whole, and I would also just add for the benefit of the public, in addition to the in-person,

665
00:53:53,162 --> 00:54:08,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments sessions, there's a virtual public meeting Wednesday, June 8 at 6pm for the mystic river and North Shore region for the bus network redesign so that should be focusing a little bit more on on our area as well.

666
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:28,890
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that there's a lot of residents who are concerned and some residents who are happy, and I'm hoping that we can keep the good and maybe ameliorate some of the bad as we work through this process with the T. I think they're not gonna start changing routes until next year, and this whole process does go through 2028.

667
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:38,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am, while skeptical based on past experience, I am slightly hopeful that the extended timeframe means that some

668
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:41,858
[SPEAKER_10]: adaptation and adjustment may be possible.

669
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:42,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

670
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

671
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:45,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

672
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:48,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

673
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:49,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward.

674
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:56,422
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that as the former chair of the transportation subcommittee, it was daunting to get their assistance.

675
00:54:56,482 --> 00:55:05,244
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I realized that I would if we can add is maybe using some influence with someone in this room that maybe

676
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:14,353
[SPEAKER_11]: could bring someone from the transportation department to our meeting and actually have a voice there that can answer some questions.

677
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:20,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that maybe adding an invitation for someone from transportation to come in and help with that.

678
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:21,601
[SPEAKER_11]: So

679
00:55:22,582 --> 00:55:49,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who that person can be, but maybe if we can, um, ask, uh, uh, clerk her to be, so if he can reach out to maybe any of his, uh, former colleagues, if we know of any to really just to push, I know you've been, you work very closely with me, uh, uh, Mr. Her to be seen clerk her to be used to, to get some initiatives pushed forward in the last few years because of your, your, um,

680
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:57,083
[SPEAKER_11]: knowledge of some people in the DOT and hopefully that might help to get someone to our meeting.

681
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:03,768
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we, I would second the motion to make this into a committee of the whole meeting.

682
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:12,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I would also add to add someone from the MBTA to be there as a representative.

683
00:56:14,193 --> 00:56:18,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpello, do you want somebody from MassDOT and the T, or one or the other, or both, or?

684
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:20,798
[SPEAKER_11]: You have vast experience, I think.

685
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:23,560
[SPEAKER_11]: You may be adding your guidance.

686
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that in the past, you've led me to bring in all the stakeholders.

687
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:37,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the stakeholders that are really in charge of making these decisions, I think I leave that to you.

688
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,711
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can guide us a bit, I'd appreciate it.

689
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:39,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Done.

690
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:40,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

691
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:43,985
[SPEAKER_06]: further discussion.

692
00:56:45,426 --> 00:56:46,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just Madam President.

693
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:52,672
[SPEAKER_09]: If in fact, we are going to be sending a letter right past that that letter come out of the Committee of the whole subcommittee.

694
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:55,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only question I have but I support them out.

695
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you accept that you don't have to formally motion.

696
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

697
00:57:06,848 --> 00:57:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng as amended by Vice Mayor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

698
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:16,032
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

699
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:16,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

700
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:20,734
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, motion passes.

701
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:28,797
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-364 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have Eversource repaint the crosswalks and bike lanes on South Street in the interest of public safety.

702
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:30,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam President.

703
00:57:32,592 --> 00:57:44,617
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who drive up and down South Street right now, you'll see that all the bike lanes are pretty much wiped away and the crosswalks are pretty much all gone, along with some repair work that's been done over there.

704
00:57:45,417 --> 00:58:01,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I'd like to have Eversource go by there and repaint crosswalks and the bike lane for the interest of public safety, but before they repaint the crosswalks, a couple of neighbors have reached out about maybe repositioning those or maybe

705
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:10,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd Blake could maybe reach out to some neighbors and find out what their issues with the crosswalks are, it would be greatly appreciated.

706
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:25,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could further amend this to from Method Square right down to the Winthrop Street Rotary, almost every crosswalk in front of the school, library, and everywhere is pretty much gone.

707
00:58:26,258 --> 00:58:30,681
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can further amend that to at some point have those crosswalks

708
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:37,106
[SPEAKER_00]: in Method Square, all the way down to the Rotary at Route 60 repainted in the interest of public safety also.

709
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:38,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

710
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:40,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Gone now.

711
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:42,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

712
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:43,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's gone now.

713
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:43,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

714
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the bus lane was gone, so waste of paint.

715
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:51,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Watercolors.

716
00:59:02,144 --> 00:59:04,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Thermoplastic, I got four words for you.

717
00:59:04,926 --> 00:59:06,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Thermoplastic sidewalks.

718
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:07,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thermoplastic.

719
00:59:07,928 --> 00:59:08,949
[SPEAKER_11]: So whatever we can.

720
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:15,494
[SPEAKER_00]: They did do it on High Street, the crosswalks are thermoplastic.

721
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:16,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give them that.

722
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:20,458
[SPEAKER_00]: But the green paint that they painted on High Street is gone now.

723
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,540
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll approve.

724
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,902
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello.

725
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:26,702
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

726
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:28,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, question on bears.

727
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:30,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

728
00:59:31,258 --> 00:59:32,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize this now.

729
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:45,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we, well, I don't know, I don't know what to do about this, but I think maybe we should actually have Mr. Blake down along with Mr. McGivern and Mr. Wartella whenever source comes.

730
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:48,230
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we've already passed that.

731
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:59,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe I'll throw it on as a V paper to this one to invite Todd Blake as well to request that Todd Blake join us, because maybe he could give us an update on all of the painting and whether or not

732
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,851
[SPEAKER_10]: it was temporary or permanent or whatever.

733
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:06,693
[SPEAKER_10]: So B paper to invite Todd Blake to come down to discuss the Eversource project.

734
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:10,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have a second on that?

735
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:11,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

736
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:13,615
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll take the B paper first.

737
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:20,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Susan Bares to invite Todd Blake to come down to discuss the status of the Eversource project, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

738
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:21,338
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

739
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:21,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

740
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:22,619
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

741
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:23,999
[SPEAKER_07]: B paper passes.

742
01:00:24,439 --> 01:00:28,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the main motion from Councilor Caraviello as amended by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by

[SPEAKER_07]: President Bears, all those in favor?

745
01:00:32,322 --> 01:00:32,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

746
01:00:33,022 --> 01:00:33,803
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

747
01:00:34,243 --> 01:00:36,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

748
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:37,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Public participation.

749
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:43,190
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have anyone in the chambers tonight, so is there anyone on Zoom who would like to speak for public participation?

750
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Please raise your hand.

751
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:57,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see Mr. Castagnetti.

752
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

753
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Same address, Andrew Castagnetti.

754
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,426
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the population of Medford, by the way?

755
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,287
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 60,000.

756
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:10,969
[SPEAKER_07]: It's give or take 60,000.

757
01:01:13,051 --> 01:01:15,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many people did you say are in the audience?

758
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:20,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the number ratings, Mr. Castagnetti.

759
01:01:20,817 --> 01:01:22,698
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not aware how many people are in the audience.

760
01:01:22,738 --> 01:01:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the answer.

761
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

762
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a wonderful evening.

763
01:01:27,465 --> 01:01:31,726
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of the in-person audience, it is currently zero, Mr. Castagnetti.

764
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:34,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.

765
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your input.

766
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

767
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:38,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

768
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:43,689
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

769
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:54,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless there's anyone else who would like to speak for public participation, moving on, I did get a note from the clerk that paper 20-600, we could probably move up unfinished business.

770
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:56,833
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone would like to motion to take it up.

771
01:01:58,231 --> 01:01:59,912
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the National Grid grant of location.

772
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:02,594
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to resubmit, so we can just receive and place a file.

773
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:13,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion to... A motion of Councilor Knight to take 20-600 off the table and receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

774
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:14,441
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

775
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:15,902
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

776
01:02:16,682 --> 01:02:17,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

777
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:20,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the end of our agenda.

778
01:02:21,957 --> 01:02:24,761
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

779
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:25,482
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

780
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

781
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:28,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes, the meeting is adjourned.

782
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:29,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

783
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:34,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a reminder that tomorrow night's Committee of the Whole has been canceled as we addressed it tonight's Committee of the Whole.
