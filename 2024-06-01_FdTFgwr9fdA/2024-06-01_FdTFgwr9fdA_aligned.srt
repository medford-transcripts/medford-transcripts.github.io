Aye.

137
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:48,252
Aye

138
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:50,602
Councillor Collins.

139
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:51,843
Zachary.

Zachary.

144
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,152

Isaac B. Zachary.

146
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:06,676
Councillor Hussain.

147
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,577
Thank you, President.

148
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,219
Isaac B. Zachary.

149
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:22,497
And on a vote of six in favor, zero opposed, and one voting present, Councilor Isaac B. Zach Bares has been elected Council President for 2024.

150
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:43,366
I'm going to administer the oath to the president-elect.

151
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:48,568
You're going to raise your right hand and repeat after me.

152
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:18,697
I, Isaac B. Zach Bares, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as President of the Medford City Council, according to the best of my ability.

153
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:31,665
and understanding agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.

154
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:32,205
Congratulations.

155
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:33,927
Thank you.

156
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,729
Thank you to my colleagues.

157
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,971
Councillor Scarpelli, I am watching HBO's Rome right now.

158
00:03:49,443 --> 00:04:02,567
I do hope that the spirit of congeniality can continue, because I think it is good for all of us to be able to disagree agreeably and enjoy each other's company, even when we're not on the same side of issues.

159
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:04,668
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

160
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:10,290
It's an honor to serve the people of Medford, and I thank them for placing their trust in me for a third term on the council.

161
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:17,312
And I'm very thankful to my colleagues for your support in making me president-elect last month and electing me as council president tonight for the year 2024.

162
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,558
All of you and residents may have seen that our agenda looks a little bit different tonight.

163
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,281
A bit more modern, I dare say.

164
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:36,395
And modernization is going to be a theme of the City Council this term, as we adopt some new technologies and new approaches to accomplish even more than we already have during my first two terms on the Council.

165
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:59,777
I want to thank the entire team in the City Clerk's office, including City Clerk Adam Hurtubise, Assistant City Clerk Sylvia DiPlacido, Principal Clerk Janice DePace for their hard work supporting the Council, and especially Head Clerk Annie Kelly, who worked diligently alongside Clerk Hurtubise and me to get CivicClerk software online and off the ground in time to put together the agenda for this meeting.

166
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:18,461
I also want to thank Medford Community Media Director Kevin Harrington and his team for installing these new monitors, which will help improve hybrid meeting accessibility, and for the work that we're going to do over the next few months to upgrade the audio system in the chambers, bring council meetings to YouTube live streaming, and hopefully even more.

167
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,233
There are three principles that I intend to follow as I guide this council.

168
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,575
Collaboration, planning, and trust.

169
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:34,162
I know that if we ground our work in those principles, we'll be able to accomplish big things and deliver the results that residents want to see from their local government.

170
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:42,689
Later tonight, I'll present two items that will help organize us towards those principles, a new committee structure, and a governing agenda framework for our 2024-2025 term.

171
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:51,873
I know these will help the council collaborate better, plan better, and build trust across city government and with residents.

172
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,014
Nothing can get done in city government without collaboration.

173
00:05:55,754 --> 00:06:09,838
I'm incredibly proud of the work this council did last term to work together in lockstep to advance shared goals and to pass several major ordinances, including the zoning recodification that will serve as the foundation for our zoning reform project this term.

174
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,619
But collaboration within the council is not enough.

175
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:21,923
We've made some progress on the budget ordinance and setting up the financial task force agreed to in the budget agreement that President Morrell and I reached with the mayor last June.

176
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:29,586
And I look forward to working with Vice President-elect Collins to establish strong collaboration with the mayor and her administration.

177
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:39,371
This council has and will continue to reach out in good faith on every initiative and invite the collaborative approach we know will be needed to succeed and deliver results for Medford.

178
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:44,833
Collaboration is a first step, but in order to get anything done, we need a plan.

179
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,534
I've been focused on better planning since my first day in office.

180
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:57,317
I was glad to assist in the development of our city's first comprehensive plan, as well as supporting the implementation of the housing production plan, climate plan, and more.

181
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:16,046
Last May, I proposed the Medford Better Future Budget Plan to put forward immediate targeted changes to our city charter and our city ordinances to improve our budget process and get on the road to planning to fund the solutions to the big challenges our community faces.

182
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:24,471
I'm glad that some of that plan has been incorporated into the budget ordinance discussions that we've had and initial meetings to set up the financial task force.

183
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:37,463
The governing agenda framework and committee structure that I will present later is another element of planning that will help improve the council's work product process and make all of our efforts more transparent to residents and the public.

184
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,324
Finally, getting big things done comes down to trust.

185
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:50,148
Trust among elected officials, trust among key public and private stakeholders, and the trust of residents and the public in what their city government is doing.

186
00:07:50,967 --> 00:08:17,849
We have major projects ahead, an updated budget process, passing a near $200 million general fund budget this year and next year, recommendations of the financial task force around potential Proposition 2.5 debt exclusions or overrides, comprehensive citywide zoning reform that implements several of our major plans, and the drafting of a new city charter to propose to the mayor and the state legislature based on the work of the Charter Study Committee.

187
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,752
To accomplish those huge tasks, we need the trust of the public.

188
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:34,241
I commit to lead this council in the spirit of openness and transparency, to provide a clear plan for our work to the public, and to tell the public the truth to the fullest extent possible, even when the truth is hard to hear.

189
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:42,826
Thank you again for your trust in electing me as council president, and I'll work to continue earning the trust of all of you and the public this term.

190
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:43,327
Thank you.

191
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,050
And I'll turn it back over to the clerk.

192
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:52,403
and I will sign a document first.

193
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,357
It's all yours.

194
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:06,777
Thank you.

195
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:14,756
I said I was going to preside for seven minutes.

196
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,717
I've already presided for 10 minutes.

197
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:25,803
So I will move to item 24-002, election of a city council vice president for 2024.

198
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:30,747
Yes, sir.

199
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,108
I would nominate Councilor Collins for vice president.

200
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,190
President Behrs has nominated Councilor Collins for vice president.

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,392
Is there a second?

202
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:42,293
Councillor Sang has seconded.

203
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:43,477
My bad.

204
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:56,087
I rescind my nomination.

205
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:01,869
I rescind, I withdraw my nomination and I leave the floor to my fellow councilor.

206
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,630
I did not mean, I meant that in jest.

207
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:08,651
I'm not gonna preside over a constitutional crisis.

208
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,293
I fully meant that in jest.

209
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,834
I nominate Kit Collins for VP.

210
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,114
I second it.

211
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:18,595
All right.

212
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,056
Councilor Seng has nominated Councilor Collins.

213
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,737
There is a second from Councilor Callahan.

214
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:27,004
Are there any further nominations?

215
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,806
Is there a motion to close nominations?

216
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,908
Councilor Seng has moved to close nominations.

217
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:34,568
Is there a second?

218
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:35,649
Second.

219
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,850
All right, Councilor Lemming has seconded.

220

Nominations are closed.

226
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,803
Councilor Collins, do you accept nomination?

227
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:51,203
Yes.

228
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:52,103
Excellent.

229
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,324

Councilor Collins is elected Vice President of the Metro City Council for 2024.

253
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,904
Step forward, I will administrate your oath.

254
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:42,785
I, Kit Collins, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and partially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as Vice President of the Medford City Council according to the best of my ability and understanding.

255
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:55,306
the laws of this commonwealth, and the ordinances of the city of Medford.

256
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,748
Congratulations, my best friends.

257
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,134
Was I talking to this one just for now?

258
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:05,934
Just for now?

259
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,497
Thank you so much to my colleagues.

260
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:16,562
I feel very honored to be starting my second term in the company of everybody here.

261
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:23,926
very honored to commence our term together working as a unit.

262
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:31,418
I see the role of vice president as being the person who

263
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:37,557
seeks to facilitate the smooth and effective work of this council.

264
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:49,846
I think this is a body that strives to be professional and effective, proactive, and prolific at doing our duty, which is to pass policies that make life better in Medford.

265
00:13:49,946 --> 00:14:00,193
I look forward to working with President Behrs to set the conditions to make us all individually and collectively do that work as effectively as possible.

266
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:07,047
and to have a term together that we can feel proud of and be accountable to the people that put us in these chairs.

267
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:07,687
Thank you so much.

Thank you, Madam Clerk, for your service tonight, and I hope we didn't keep you too long.

00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,802
I'm going off the sign, my friend.

303
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,763
If you could come up and receive your oath from the clerk.

304
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:31,667
And we'll sign this at the end.

305
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:31,767
OK.

306
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:32,407
All right.

00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:33,768
You're going to raise your right hand.

Congratulations.

316
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:13,892
Do you want to say anything?

317
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:35,362
In all honesty, Larry's basically where I go if I'm looking for exactly what the heart of public opinion is.

318
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,707
Wonderful.

319
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,208
24-004, resolution to adopt standing committee rules from prior year.

320
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,792
Be it resolved that the standing committee rules be adopted as the standing rules of the city council insofar as they're applicable.

321
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,194
Councilor, Vice President Collins.

322
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,404
Thank you, President Behrs.

323
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:56,685
I think the resolution speaks for itself.

324
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:02,209
Motion to have all of our previous city council rules go into effect to govern this body.

325
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,173
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, any discussion?

326
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:14,436
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

327
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,118
Do we need to call the roll on these?

328
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,840
Okay, it's seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

329
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:24,217
and we don't have to call the roll on this one, so all those in favor?

330
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:24,637
Aye.

331
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:25,477

Vice President Collins.

337
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:47,043
Thank you, President Bares, for the benefit of our newer councilors.

338
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,064
This is to ensure that all papers that haven't been

339
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:54,928
dispensed with in one form or another from the previous term to remain live in this session.

340
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:56,889
So I have a motion to approve.

341
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,173
I have a motion of Councillor Collins to approve, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

342

Aye.

344
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,335
Opposed?

345
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,417
Motion passes.

346
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,179
It's because he said my name right.

347
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:24,713
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records.

348
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:31,019
We'll take the records of the reports and then we'll go to Councillor Scarpelli's resolutions under suspension, pending a motion to do so.

00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,454
I will defer to Vice President Collins.

359

360
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,536
This was on the Budget Ordinance.

361
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:03,236
Councillor Collins.

362
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:05,129
Thank you, President Behrs.

363
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,092
This was on the draft budget ordinance.

364
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,418
We met with the chief of staff and the finance director.

365
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,042
We looked at the administration's

366
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:14,953
draft of the budget ordinance.

367
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:17,935
We reconciled it with the subcommittee's proposal.

368
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:27,422
We looked at areas of alignment, and we talked about next steps for coming to a compromise on the long-term planning part of the ordinance, and I motion for approval.

369
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:35,307
On the motion of Council Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

370
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:35,948
All those in favor?

371

Motion passes.

374
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,390
Mr. President?

375
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,491
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

376
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:45,874
Could we suspend the rules to take papers 2-4-0-1-2, 0-1-3, 0-1-4, please?

377
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:50,937
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to take papers 2-4-0-1-2, 0-1-3, and 0-1-4, under suspension, seconded by?

378
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,010
Anyone on suspension?

379
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,771
Seconded by Vice President Collins.

380
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:02,972
All those in favor?

381
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:03,693
Aye.

382
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:04,553
Opposed?

383
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,195
Motion passes.

384
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:09,817
24-012, offered under suspension by Councillor Scarpelli.

385
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:16,022
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send the family of James Jack McDevitt our deepest condolences on his recent passing.

386
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:16,783
Councillor Scarpelli.

387
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,171
Thank you, Mr President.

388
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:27,474
It's sad to add a few resolutions and for passing some pretty important people here in the city of Medford.

389
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:41,900
James Jack McDevitt was an amazing person, an amazing teacher, and someone who really loved the law and loved the city of Medford.

390
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,941
Mr. McDevitt,

391
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:53,795
I remember in high school, Mr. McDevitt started, I believe it was the Method Co-op Bank inside Medford High School.

392
00:21:54,356 --> 00:22:02,663
So we had a work program where we actually ran a bank out of the school that was run by students at Medford High School.

393
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,324
And he was

394
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:13,268
He was so involved in making sure that he taught the most important classes, and his view were law.

395
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,930
And he was, I believe, a Triple Eagle.

396
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,331
He loved his BC.

397
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:26,374
I had the honor of being at his wake tonight, and he would be laid to rest with his BC hat right next to him.

398
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:41,219
and he leaves behind, he joins his wife in heaven, but he leaves three great sons and Michael, Mark, and Chris to leave and share his legacy.

399
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:48,101
So may you rest in peace and we bless him and wish the family well, Mr. President.

400
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,562
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

401
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:58,067
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

402
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,208
Mr. Clerk, actually, all those in favor.

403
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:05,688
Can we do all three?

404
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,089
Sure.

405
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:09,469
24-013, offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,410
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send the family of Judith Granara our deepest condolences on her recent passing.

407
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,350
Councilor Scarpelli.

408
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,030
Thank you again, Mr. President.

409
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,091
Judith Granara,

410
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:29,975
was a very special person here in Medford, a lifelong resident here in Medford, a former school teacher in the Method Public Schools.

411
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:40,899
Her husband, John, has done so much for our city, and the Granara family has given so much to the city of Medford, and her passing will daily be missed.

412
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:47,762
I know that she leaves her son, John Jr., and her daughter, Kelly, and I wish their family

413
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:52,744
and we pray for their family.

414
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,284
So thank you.

415
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:59,627
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

416
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,008
24-014 offered under suspension by Councillor Scarpelli.

417
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:09,310
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send the family of Ernest Ernie Artelino our deepest condolences on his recent passing.

418
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,311
Councillor Scarpelli.

419
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,911
Thank you, Mr President.

420
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,052
Ernie's a little more personal.

421
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,553
Ernie Artelino passed away

422
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,364
After a brief illness, Ernie was a Mustang Hall of Famer.

423
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:40,840
Ernie wasn't the biggest person in stature, but he went off to University of Miami, played football and baseball for the Hurricanes, and came back and started a teaching and coaching career that's helped so many young men and women achieve their dreams.

424
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:58,672
I had the privilege of coaching with Ernie, and I learned as a young coach the importance of making sure you never, ever, ever treat a female athlete as a nefarious ex.

425
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:04,674
He made sure that we elevated every single athlete that he coached.

426
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,355
And he used to tell me, he says, coach,

427
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:13,976
look at your athletes, not your female and male athletes, look at your athletes and treat them accordingly.

428
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:15,477
They're no different.

429
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:19,638
As a matter of fact, he used to say they were stronger, our female athletes.

430
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,498
And, you know, it was a different time back then.

431
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:34,121
And the legacy that he's left behind, I remember walking through his wake and former athletes, former basketball players, and some of the girls were there.

432
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,482
And to that evening,

433
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:45,689
they would visit Ernie in the hospital and they would tell me the stories that Ernie still, the impacts that Ernie made in their lives.

434
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,695
And he really understood what we're fighting for today and equality for gender.

435
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:56,218
He was, he saw something that most coaches didn't back then.

436
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,805
And I, I, I attribute my successes as a coach because I was around Ernie Adelino.

437
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:04,886
Um,

438
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:07,199
Ernie had his own language.

439
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,781
When he wanted to talk bad about someone, he made up a language.

440
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,283
And it wasn't that he was talking bad about someone, it's because he forgot their names.

441
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,745
So we'd call him, hey, Frappeterra.

442
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:19,628
And we didn't know, we said, what is he saying when I first started coaching?

443
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,070
He says, George, Ernie forgets his keys and people's names.

444
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,933
And because he had so many kids now, he taught it out to Catholic for many, many years.

445
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:31,316
But I think his biggest joy is that he leaves his daughter, Diane and Laurie,

446
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:34,919
his pride, Ernie Jr.

447
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,340
and his daughter, Elena.

448
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:49,028
And we wish the family the best because we talk, I hate to be the one that keeps saying this, but when we lose legends, it really, it really affects our community.

449
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,309
And Ernie was a true legend.

450
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:57,294
So these are three people that played a big part in the framework of what Medford is today.

451
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:58,094
And

452
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:07,401
There are three people that will surely be missed, so I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak and wish their families the best.

453
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,101
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

454
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:15,743
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to join the three papers and approve, all those in favour?

455
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:16,483
Aye.

456
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:17,684
Opposed?

457
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,044
Motion passes.

458
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:20,845
Would everyone please rise for a moment of silence.

459
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:48,171
Motion over to regular business Councilor Scott by seconded by Councilor vice president Collins, I'm gonna have trouble with that one.

460
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:49,411
All those in favor.

461
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:58,358
I oppose motion passes 23 dash 460 special from a permit for hours mailings for 34 a Salem Street Medford ma 02155.

462
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,001

477
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,541
By order of the City Council, Adam L. Hurtubise, City Clerk, advertising the Medford transcript in Somerville Journal, December 21st, 2023, and December 28th, 2023.

478
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:26,034
I believe we recently had a victualer's license come through for a change in ownership for this business, and they had to come back to adopt again the special permit for hours extension.

479
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:31,360
At this point, I would be happy to hear from the petitioner if they are on Zoom.

480
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:33,643
Hi, good evening.

481
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:35,365
Good evening.

482
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:38,026
Yes, my name is Chong Lee.

483
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:40,267
I'm counsel for Huali Enterprises Inc.

484
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:49,969
As you indicated earlier, we did have a CV license approved earlier for the operation of Manthings Restaurant by my client as a transfer of ownership.

485
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:57,151
At that time, the petition, the CV license was approved for the standard operating hours to end around 11 o'clock.

486
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,571
Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing.

487
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:08,350
uh give us one moment we're having a we have a new audio issue we may need you to just repeat what you said but we need to turn up the audio here in the chamber sure i'm sorry no it's our fault

488
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:28,055
start of your audio visual troubles.

489
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:29,116
It's, it's inevitable.

490
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,966
Mr. Lee, could you try to give us a test?

491
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:48,367
Sure.

492
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:49,567
Can you, can anybody hear me?

493
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:50,488
Thank you.

494
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,769
We can hear you.

495
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:51,989
Yes.

496
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:54,788
Yeah, okay.

497
00:30:54,808 --> 00:31:00,771
I also have to apologize because I had a late hearing in the probate court and I'm actually on the road.

498
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,791
So I'm actually going through my phone.

499
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,672
So forgive me for if there's any cutouts anywhere.

500
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:12,095
Thank you, please, if you could just repeat what you said just a moment ago, so everyone can hear and then we can move ahead.

501
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:13,116
Sure.

502
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,318
My name is Chong Lee.

503
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:21,487
I'm counsel for Huali Enterprises Inc, operating as a mailings restaurant at 434 A Salem Street.

504
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:30,539
As you indicated, Mr. Chairman, earlier, the CV license for the current mailings restaurant for my client was approved not too long ago.

505
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:34,902
but for the standard operating hours to the end at 11 o'clock.

506
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:48,390
The present petition in front of the licensing board is to extend the operating hours from the standard to the extended hours as indicated by the license as stated earlier.

507
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:52,554
Again, nothing is going to change.

508
00:31:52,794 --> 00:32:03,888
As I indicated earlier, my client has been operating the restaurant using the standard operating hours since probably around a month ago, and we're just merely asking for an extension of the hours.

509
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:07,832
These operating hours were in fact exercised by the previous owner.

510
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:25,629
But of course we needed to go to this extra step to adopt the same operating hours as, as they were previously so we're here, asking the sport to us, approve this petition for the extended operators which will be identical to the ones that were in place earlier with the previous owner.

511
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:26,209
Thank you.

512
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:31,014
Thank you, Mr. Lee, I will go to Councillor Scarpelli.

513
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,312
Thank you, Mr President.

514
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,194
Thank you, Miss Lee.

515
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:39,206
Um, we did have mailings come in for a change.

516
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:40,309
They've been

517
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:44,618
They've been unbelievable owners so far.

518
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,599
I don't see any changes.

519
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:52,103
I think that there was never an issue with the hours of operations with the former owner.

520
00:32:52,203 --> 00:33:00,528
So I would move forward with the request that is offered by the Mailings Corporation.

521
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:05,951
Then if we can just have a 30 and 60 day review, just to make sure that we have no

522
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:11,535
No issues within that two-month time frame, midnight move approval.

523
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:13,817
Thank you, Councillor Scarpa.

524
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,918
Any further discussion before I open the public hearing?

525
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,739
Councillor Lemming.

526
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:27,827
Yeah, just, Sunday hours are listed twice here on this resolution, so just for clarification, are you proposing to open until 12.30 or 12 on Sunday?

527
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,208
It's just listed twice.

528
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,070
Oh, okay.

529
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,491
On my petition, I show Sunday operating from 11.01pm to 12am.

530
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:40,796
Yes, I think that's a typo on our end, Councilor Lemming.

531
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:42,257
I don't believe it's a typo.

532
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:43,718
I believe it is.

533
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,059
Oh, no, actually, that is a typo.

534
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,420
Take it all back.

535
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,742
Sunday is just listed on the first line at the end accidentally, I think.

536
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:55,504
But we could strike that Sunday in the records.

537
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:56,765
Scrivener's error.

538
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,766
We'll make sure it's not there in the records.

539
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:00,527
Thank you.

540
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:02,308
Great.

541
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:04,189
Any further discussion?

542
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,010
Councilor, Vice President Collins.

543
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:11,397
Great, whereas this is a public hearing, I do need to open the public hearing.

544
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,937
Public hearing is so open.

545
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:19,199
Is there anyone here who would like to speak in favor or opposition to the petition?

546
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,120
Mr. Lee, if you wanna just say that you're in favor.

547
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,041
I'm in favor of this petition to extend the operating hours, sir.

548
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:30,681
Great, thank you.

549
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:33,782
Anyone else would like to speak in favor or opposition to the paper?

550
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,381
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

551
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:45,445
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with 30-day and 60-day review.

552
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:49,808
I did, yes.

553
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:59,735
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with 30 and 60-day review, seconded by Vice President Collins.

554
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:01,616
Where is this special permit?

555
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,317
Do I need to call the roll?

556
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,089
All right.

557
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:06,530
All right.

558
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,990
We'll call the roll on this one.

559
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:19,633
Yep.

560
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,013
Councilor Callahan.

561
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:22,053
I approve.

562
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:22,593
Okay.

563
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:25,134
Vice President Collins.

564
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:25,514
Yes.

565
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:27,735
Councilor Lazaro.

566
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:28,815
Yes.

567
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:31,194
Councilor Lemming?

568
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:32,015
Yes.

569
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:33,336
Councilor Scarpelli?

570
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:33,756
Yes.

571
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:34,557
Councilor Seng?

572
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:35,117
Yes.

573
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:35,918
President Behrs?

574
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:36,358
Yes.

575
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,360
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

576
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,282
The motion passes and the special permit is approved.

577
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:44,825
Thank you, Mr. Lee, and good luck.

578
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,767
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

579
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:48,168
Thank you.

580
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:49,509
Good night.

581
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,950
Good luck.

582
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:52,251
All right.

583
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:58,656
Next papers are proposed by myself, so I will turn the chair over to the vice president.

584
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:38,568
Hang on, I left the relevant paper down there.

585
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:43,030
The clerk has some extras, bear with me.

586
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,652
It's my first time vice-presidenting.

587
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,381
Council.

588
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:08,846
24006 offered by President Barrett's resolution to propose a 2024 2025 Council governing agenda

589
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:46,224
be it resolved by the Medford City Council that councilors submit items to be included in a 2024-2025 Medford City Council governing agenda document, in parentheses, draft template attached in this packet, in parentheses, that will guide the work of this council and its committees during this term, and be it further resolved that councilors submit items to the city clerk by Thursday, January 18th, 2024, for further discussion in committee of the whole.

590
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:47,245
President Behrs.

591
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,372
Thank you, Chair, President Collins.

592
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:53,835
I will eventually get used to what our titles are.

593
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:58,199
And nobody's called anyone President Rorel yet, even though we'll see.

594
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,441
We'll see if we make it through.

595
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:09,536
So the resolution here is relatively self-explanatory, but the 18-page document surely may not be.

596
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:21,639
The intent here was really to sketch out a framework of what we would be doing this term and where and how we would be considering these various proposals.

597
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:28,241
If you take a look at the document, it was included in the agenda packet that went out as well.

598
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,498
President Collins will be sharing it on the screen in just a moment.

599
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:39,899
You can see that there's a document here that's a draft framework, and there's a table of contents that I think is useful to look at.

600
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:54,722
Essentially, I looked at everything that was in committee, as well as things that have been discussed, papers in committee, papers on the table, items that have been discussed, excuse me, in the past, and broke it down across our new committee structure.

601
00:38:56,124 --> 00:39:05,474
which we can now look at this document and see for each committee, what are the major projects that the committee may be entertaining for the term?

602
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:10,119
What are the ordinances that the committee may be entertaining for the term?

603
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:15,084
And what are some of the oversight and public engagement tasks that each committee may be undertaking?

604
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:18,588
This is not exhaustive because it does not have

605
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:22,830
The most important contribution which is the contribution from each of the six of you.

606
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:35,516
This is just what was already in front of us from the last term, either in a committee or major projects like the zoning reform, obviously the Charter has been in consideration, the budget discussions have been in consideration.

607
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:45,603
So while this is, I think, a long framework, really my ask of all of you is, what are you excited to work on that's not included in here?

608
00:39:46,323 --> 00:40:05,376
Let's submit those items, and then we can sit down in committee of the whole, as we have in the past, and discuss our council priorities, discuss which committee we think they should fall under, and then develop a fully fleshed out version of this framework that considers everything that councilors may want to look at over the next two years.

609
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:08,378
the best plan in the world.

610
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:12,600
If it lasts three months, I think we'll be amazed without a change, right?

611
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:13,661
Things will come up.

612
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:14,522
Issues will come up.

613
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,163
Circumstances will change.

614
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:18,584
Priorities will become urgent that we didn't consider.

615
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,687
My first term two months in the pandemic started.

616
00:40:23,308 --> 00:40:25,029
My priorities completely changed.

617
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,412
I didn't get to see Councillor Scarpelli for, you know, several months.

618
00:40:29,612 --> 00:40:32,173
It was, you know, sad to lose my new friend.

619
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:34,255
Um, and, uh.

620
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:48,759
So, best laid plans right but I think this is a good framework and foundation for us to share with the public hey, here's what we're planning to do for the next two years, and there's some documents in here as well there's kind of draft timelines under each committee.

621
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,501
So, that's the intent of this motion is for folks to go through.

622
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:56,023
If they see anything in here, you know that they.

623
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:18,755
maybe have questions about or want to add to that's welcome if there's something that's not in here that we really want to work on let's submit that by the 18th and we can discuss in committee of the whole and I think really as you go through this you'll see but really all that's needed to submit is how long do you think the project will take when do you want to start it and what is a description of what the project is and we can go from there and it can range all the way from

624
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:30,268
The biggest thing, although I think we've, you know, when I first started it was always said budget ordinances, you know, and charter right those are the three things kind of that the council has some review over.

625
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,974
And, and I may have gotten that wrong just now but Councilor Scarpelli can correct me in a minute.

626
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:38,796
But we're already doing those three things.

627
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:44,200
But there are many other elements of governance that I'm sure are not included in here.

628
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:46,302
Just a little bit more context.

629
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:55,789
If you go through for the committees, I also put in some kind of what areas of city government.

630
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:59,191
Yeah, if you want to share, President Collins, that'd be great.

631
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:05,568
Basically what areas of city governance are falling under each committee.

632
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:14,232
So, if you say go to the administration and finance committee on its page four of the document and then page 14 of this larger packet.

633
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,734
you can see kind of the areas and departments.

634
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:20,714
Yeah, perfect right there.

635
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:24,415
That fall under that would fall under this proposed committee.

636
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:35,017
So budget, finance, auditing, taxation, procurement, grant administration, retirement and pensions personnel, then you can see the departments, what are the departments that exist that would fall under there.

637
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,038
And then I also took a quick pass through

638
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:48,747
the city ordinances on Muni code and the city regulations to say, hey, this committee is probably mostly going to be looking at chapter two of administration, chapter 50 human relations, chapter 66 personnel.

639
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:56,453
You have the big project section, which Councilor Collins just went through three that I've put in here that we've obviously discussed.

640
00:42:57,354 --> 00:43:06,562
If you could scroll up a little bit more, our annual budget process, we've had discussions about revenue generation,

641
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:37,098
you know, based on the financial task force and the classification and compensation study that I know that we have been waiting with bated breath for years and we need to get going on because we have unfilled positions and we haven't, you know, I'm waiting for Council Bingo for us to start talking about the things that we've been talking about every meeting for the last two years that I'm really hoping we can move the needle on such as

642
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:50,848
fixing our classification and compensation so that we can do at least address that portion of the reason for unfilled positions, especially such as city solicitor and assistant city solicitor, which are so important.

643
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:56,492
So those are kind of big projects that a committee could consider right now in terms of ordinances.

644
00:43:56,552 --> 00:44:03,477
The only ordinance that's in committee and understood discussion that would fall in here would be the budget ordinance, which we are relatively close on after

645
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:07,123
five or six meetings with the administration and subcommittee.

646
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:11,049
And then there's this piece around oversight and engagement.

647
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:19,295
The item on financial review and long-term budget planning, for example, for administration and finance, we've been talking about that constantly.

648
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:27,699
There's several items on the table from Councilor Knight, myself, and others around getting the information that we need to really be doing this financial review.

649
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:40,105
I think some of that will be addressed through the budget ordinance, but I know this long-term budget planning and forecasting, Councilor Sang, Councilor Collins, and I, and the prior subcommittee on ordinances and rules have really been pushing hard to say, what can we do here?

650
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:48,916
And then there's one oversight and engagement project that I put in for every committee, which is just reviewing the ordinances and regulations that may fall under that committee.

651
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:56,827
I think we've all experienced most recently with the solid waste ordinance that some of our ordinances are a little out of date.

652
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,189
addressing issues that maybe are no longer common.

653
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:03,849
We do not have much coal ash on the sidewalks these days.

654
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:12,571
So I think, you know, if the committee has nothing else to do, which probably won't be the case, there's probably an ordinance that could use a little bit of a touch up that would fall under that committee.

655
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:15,452
So I won't go through everything.

656
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:21,213
But if you want to scroll down just to the draft timeline element, there's one of these for every committee as well.

657
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:28,496
just to kind of show, you know, the four quarters of each year of this term, when would we be working on these different items?

658
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,158
And, you know, again, this is a draft.

659
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:39,562
If counselors have comments on anything that's in here, you know, I think this timeline is too ambitious, or I don't think there's enough time to be considering things like this.

660
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:47,146
This really is a very first pass by me, and I'm hoping it will become much better with the input of my colleagues.

661
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:47,526
So,

662
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:54,271
with that, I won't go through every committee, but there are six more sections just like this for each of the other committees.

663
00:45:54,972 --> 00:46:01,757
And I think they really do capture a lot of what this council has moved from prior years to the current year.

664
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:12,726
And again, I'm really excited to see what my colleagues would like to add to this document and beef up even more this ambitious agenda for the next two years for this council.

665
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:13,287
Thank you.

666
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:24,537
Any discussion from other counselors?

667
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:28,298
I wanted to thank President Behrs for introducing this.

668
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:39,742
When I think about the next few years and what this council will prioritize, I think a lot about two words, ambition and modernization.

669
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:41,063
Really, I think

670
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:57,553
taking this time, this precious time that Medford has, where we have so much potential and where so much is moving and changing in the greater Boston area right now, to take advantage of that and to bring our city into the 21st century.

671
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:17,022
To do this, I think it's not blind to our residents that there's a lot of work that we need to catch up on, a lot of big projects that we can be taking on, a lot of projects that we can convince people to take on.

672
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:20,644
We need to do the work of convincing the administration to take on as well.

673
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:29,567
you know, with all of those ideas out there, right, with all of those ambitions out there, we really need structure.

674
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:49,151
And so having a governing agenda like this, one that's flexible and doesn't bind us to things, but I think one that gives a structure in terms of how we work in the context of the new standing committees, I think is something that's super helpful and that will be really helpful in guiding our work going forward.

675
00:47:50,852 --> 00:48:04,858
I wanted to also say, I think a lot of us counselors work on our own versions of, maybe not as complex, but our own versions of this document.

676
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:09,040
We have our list of ordinances, our list of policies that we want to pass.

677
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:11,454
community.

678
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:21,397
Um being able to meet on it together and committee of the whole and to develop that plan together to submit what we want to do and to find out common ground.

679
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:27,478
Um to find projects that other counselors are interested in working on and tackling those projects

680
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:42,121
When we like when I think about my last term there are tons of projects that other counselors were also interested in working on that, you know, we didn't really start to talk about until the second year of the term.

681
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,863
And now we're finally starting to work on it.

682
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:50,788
I'm thinking about the Youth Commission ordinance, but having a meeting like this in the beginning of our two year term.

683
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,050
we're going to be able to find partners.

684
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,451
Who I think will really orient us and help us find partners for our work as well.

685
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,373
Um so I'm very optimistic about it.

686
00:48:57,973 --> 00:49:03,257
I'm very hopeful about this document, and I'm very excited to see what everyone brings to the table.

687
00:49:06,018 --> 00:49:06,259
Thank you.

688
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:07,039
Counselor saying we'll go to

689
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,871
appreciate the movement.

690
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:19,575
This is someone that's been around for 16 years now.

691
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:25,200
It seems that it's more streamlined, and I think it keeps us on task.

692
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:28,483
And I think that, you know, as transparent as can be.

693
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:32,627
I think what's important, though, I think what Councilor Sang brought up, I think it's important that

694
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:35,208
the shared goals and visions.

695
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:39,810
I think that was probably one of our most important meetings whenever we start our new terms.

696
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:49,434
And that's sitting together as a group, because we're going to all understand that we're going to agree to disagree on, if not some, but many issues.

697
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:55,296
But I think having the respect of each other and understanding each other's

698
00:49:57,137 --> 00:50:11,667
each other's goals, and I think it sends that understanding for each other that I didn't realize how important I'll use Councilor Beers' initiatives with traffic and why that's so important to him.

699
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:21,093
And when you understand why traffic issues are so important for a personal reason for Councilor Beers, you realize as a human being why

700
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:27,937
you need to really understand and take those initiatives in for more of a personal level.

701
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:39,243
I think that, you know, as someone who's always been involved in youth services in the city of Medford and bringing the recreation department as a full-time, I take a lot of pride and passion.

702
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:47,368
That's something that Councilor Seng and I have been talking about is starting, introducing a youth summit to really get our youth involved and

703
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:50,951
really helping them mold what they want to see the city of Memphis.

704
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:57,416
And so I think that having that meeting, I think it's probably the most important meeting we'll have.

705
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:02,481
I appreciate my new counselors that reached out after they were elected.

706
00:51:03,982 --> 00:51:06,644
You know, it's the banter goes back and forth.

707
00:51:06,724 --> 00:51:10,005
I think that it was an interesting election season.

708
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:14,988
But at the same time, we all realize that it's an election.

709
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:17,510
So you're going to get down and dirty sometimes.

710
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,973
But at the same time, now that we're here behind this real, we're going to work together to do some great things.

711
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:25,254
I know I joke a lot.

712
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,856
I think that, you know, when I first came in,

713
00:51:28,576 --> 00:51:44,263
I joked at the fact that I got so many people calling me wishing me luck, but I truly, truly can say everybody that's behind this rail are very good people and we all have the same mission and that's to make Medford the best city we have.

714
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:45,404
So I appreciate.

715
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:48,826
the changes already Council presidents put into place.

716
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:55,631
I will tell you, there'll be some kickback a little in some things, but I enjoy doing that.

717
00:51:55,851 --> 00:52:05,238
And for that next meeting that I think that we sit together as a team and vet those, I think it's gonna be very important.

718
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:05,899
So thank you.

719
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:09,441
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

720
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:10,142
Councilor Callahan?

721
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:11,422
Thank you.

722
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:16,564
I first wanted to really thank President Behrs for all the work that went into this.

723
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:20,485
It looks like a really excellent framework that we'll all be able to add to.

724
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:31,768
And I especially wanted to highlight how, like, I think a lot about democracy, and to me, that's engaging people in the political process, and also just engaging people in their own ideas for making Medford better.

725
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:37,030
I think that this document, in terms of the transparency that Councilor Scarpelli mentioned,

726
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:53,118
It really allows us because especially with the timelines it allows us to communicate with our residents and to engage them in the process right and I understand that this is not in any way finalized but for example, someone who is really concerned about any of those housing home rule petitions.

727
00:52:54,419 --> 00:53:12,410
that I think a lot of folks in Medford are either for or against, that being able to sort of point out what timeline we think that's going to happen on and when they can get engaged, that is crucial in terms of getting people to engage in the process politically, which I'm very excited about.

728
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:15,873
So thank you so much, President Bares, and thanks to everyone here.

729
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:22,517
I really look forward to seeing what everyone adds to this framework so that it can truly become a document that we can share.

730
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:31,055
with the public as the plan that we see as our ability to engage the public in what we're doing.

731
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:34,158
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

732
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,361
President Beers, then Councilor Rosario.

733
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,405
Councilor Rosario, and then President Beers.

734
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:41,448
Thank you.

735
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:42,669
President bears.

736
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,649
I really appreciate this.

737
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:57,414
I think it's incredibly transparent and helpful for the public as counselor Callahan mentioned one thought concern I have is that as a new counselor, I'm not 100% clear on what

738
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,562
what projects are gonna reveal themselves to me over time.

739
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:27,223
So I guess if we have some kind of idea about how we can slide things in, move things around, sort of jigsaw our way through this as things come up, not necessarily on the scale of a pandemic, but maybe when we learn, when I start to learn more about how different departments work, how people are working together and where there's a space for something

740
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:35,075
that may be a little bit urgent or not really, but that would be something that we would wanna work on, but maybe that I don't know before January 18th.

741
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:36,496
You know.

742
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:48,239
I wanna be able to, you know, learn things as we're going and grow and change and have this be kind of a moving document.

743
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:49,679
Great.

744
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,000
Otherwise, love it.

745
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,680
Love everything.

746
00:54:56,197 --> 00:55:02,801
Thank you know and and like this is exactly what I was hoping for, like, already two great things to add in.

747
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:13,067
We should have a review schedule, maybe quarterly maybe semi annually where we come back to this document we say, what did we get done what didn't we get done let's add this new idea and let's update this.

748
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:21,272
Vice President Collins and I were talking earlier about also just like us maintaining this document as a living document in between.

749
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:25,915
So if you put a resolution on, I want to add this to the governing agenda and send it to this committee.

750
00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:27,436
So I think there'll be a lot of room there.

751
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:30,318
I think Councilor Scarpelli is right on too, right?

752
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:33,861
While this is meant to say, here's our unified approach,

753
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:39,263
we don't want that to happen in the absence of also saying here's what each counselor is passionate about.

754
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:46,386
So one thing I think that would be really great to add here on, you know, either on the items that are already here, but certainly on new items that are submitted.

755
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:52,708
If you want to be, say, the lead counselor or the co-lead counselor, we could add that as a line with the description and the timeline.

756
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:57,410
And then it'd be like, okay, counselor saying counselor Scarpelli, they're leading on the youth commission youth summit.

757
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,311
And that's in the agenda.

758
00:55:58,331 --> 00:56:02,953
It says, you know, that's our go-to, you know, and then there's a ton of other stuff in here as well.

759
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:03,613
And, you know, either

760
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:15,837
If there's something in here that you see that you want to put your name, stake your name to as a lead counselor, once we start getting over three, we'll have to have conversations about who gets what because of the open meeting on the quorum stuff.

761
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:22,178
But, you know, I think that's another way that we can add in to this to make this an even better framework.

762
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:23,039
So I, you know,

763
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,341
That's what this team is what that's what teamwork's about, right?

764
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:28,323
This is going to get better as we work on it.

765
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:40,556
So really love those 2 ideas and look forward to discussing hopefully with the approval of my colleagues this in a couple of weeks after folks have gotten their ideas in and then we can have that sit down meeting and.

766
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:50,469
you know, maybe we go committee by committee, and then people raise their, you know, either here's what I'm adding in, and as people send them in by the 18th, that's why I put that deadline in.

767
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:55,773
I can try to plug them into an updated draft before the meeting, and then we can go through committee by committee.

768
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:59,776
If there's something that we all are like, yep, we've already been working on it, it's fine.

769
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:00,936
Then maybe we don't have to have a discussion.

770
00:57:00,976 --> 00:57:02,698
If there's a point of disagreement, we raise it.

771
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:03,678
We have the disagreement.

772
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,419
We say, should we include it?

773
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,320
Should we exclude it?

774
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,422
Do we want to add something that says,

775
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:26,358
Council are saying has these concerns and they should be noted in here, you know, as part of the agenda, you know, maybe just sussing out the description a little bit to make sure that if folks have concerns or questions or want to reach out to, you know, want to expand the scope of what's in the document, that that can be added as well.

776
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:38,582
So I think that's a great, all going to be a great process for us to go through and come out in about a month or so, hopefully with a really strong document to lead us for the next couple of years.

777
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:42,769
Thank you, President Behrs.

778
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,490
Do I have a motion to approve and a second?

779
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,851
Motion to approve, second.

780
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:52,093
Great, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Singh.

781
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:52,913
All in favor?

782
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:53,693
Aye.

783
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:54,633
All opposed?

784
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:56,254
Motion passes.

785
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:04,197
24007, offered by President Behrs.

786
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:10,659
Resolution to amend rule 33 of the rules of Medford City Council to establish standing committees.

787
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:18,935
be it resolved by the Medford City Council that rule 33 committees of the rules of the Medford City Council be amended to the following.

788
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:27,620
After the organization of the council, the president of the council shall form and set standing meeting times for the committee of the whole and the following standing committees.

789
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:37,206
Administration and Finance Committee, Education and Culture Committee, Governance Committee, Planning and Permitting Committee, Public Health and Community Safety Committee,

790
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:42,427
Public Works and Facilities Committee, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

791
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:46,514
All councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee.

792
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:52,577
The president shall name those members of each committee, including its chair and vice chair, who are authorized to vote on matters in the committee.

793
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:57,139
All other members of each committee are not authorized to vote on such matters in the committee.

794
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,141
A quorum of the committee shall be determined on the basis of voting members only.

795
00:59:01,922 --> 00:59:06,144
Each committee chairperson shall form subcommittees and appoint members of subcommittees as needed.

796
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:12,767
The president or committee chairperson will give way to committee and subcommittee appointments via the longevity and interest of such appointees.

797
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:20,653
Resolutions, ordinances and other papers are referred to committee by a majority vote of the members at a regular meeting of the City Council.

798
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:30,605
If a councillor requests, the committee chair shall place any paper referred to the committee on the next scheduled committee meeting agenda or the agenda for another scheduled committee meeting.

799
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:44,891
be it further resolved that papers and committee be referred from 2022 through 2023 subcommittees to 2024-2025 committees as described in the attached memorandum describing the proposed updated council committee structure.

800
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,092
President Behrs.

801
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,852
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

802
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:51,673
So that was a long one.

803
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:58,494
Right now rule 33 of the council rules essentially says the president can do whatever the president wants when it comes to committees.

804
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:12,061
Not a bad rule, but I thought a little more structure may behoove all of us, right?

805
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:21,871
So I thought I'd propose a rule that maybe boxes me in a little bit from that.

806
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:34,417
But really the intent here, and some of this language has come from neighboring councils in terms of everyone being a member of the committee, but the voting members being named differently.

807
01:00:35,658 --> 01:00:38,820
The intent here is to really, when I sat down and I was looking at

808
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:45,441
I was looking at the menu on the city website for departments, and I was looking at the subcommittees that had already existed in the past.

809
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:54,864
I was looking at what we had done for the past four years, and kind of the question I was asking was, what does the city do?

810
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:56,384
What does city government do?

811
01:00:57,845 --> 01:01:07,147
And if possible, and I think this is a good summary of it, trying to get that into a manageable number of committees and make those committees descriptive not of

812
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:14,170
things like ordinances, but of actually like what the function of government is.

813
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:23,275
So that's how I came up with these seven committees, being administration and finance, you know, there's the administration of the city and its finances and the budget.

814
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,916
education and culture.

815
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:30,579
The city government educates the community and upholds and tries to build out the culture of our community.

816
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,621
Governance committee, the city government is responsible for governance.

817
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:35,742
What is our city charter?

818
01:01:36,162 --> 01:01:37,062
What are the elections?

819
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:39,304
What does the structure of government look like?

820
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:48,469
The city is responsible for setting up plans for land use, planning for our community, as well as permitting, like special permits and licenses.

821
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:53,691
The city government is charged with protecting the public health and the community safety.

822
01:01:54,791 --> 01:02:07,397
It is in charge of the public works and our city facilities, and it also provides other services and engages the public in building community and what it means to be part of city government.

823
01:02:07,977 --> 01:02:09,658
and to understand what city government is doing.

824
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:11,439
So that's kind of where these all came out of.

825
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:16,281
And the idea being that, essentially, there's seven committees.

826
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,582
So each one of us will get to chair a committee and vice chair a committee.

827
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,424
We will be members of many of the committees, since each committee will be five members.

828
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:30,346
Voting members of many committees, you also can come to any committee meeting, and we can all sit around here, and you can speak.

829
01:02:30,386 --> 01:02:35,168
You may not have a vote at that committee level, but you certainly will at committee of the whole and at the regular meeting.

830
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:50,941
And the other piece of this is to set these as standing committees so there's a lot of business and a lot of work that could be done in a specialized area right like Councillor Scarpelli constantly is working on is on the, you know, signs of the licensing and the permitting.

831
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,742
And, you know, that makes a lot of sense.

832
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:57,565
We should just have that go to planning and permitting.

833
01:02:57,605 --> 01:03:07,393
And then, for example, whoever the chair of that committee is, whether it be the Vice President Collins, Vice President Collins could appoint a subcommittee on signs and licensing and permitting.

834
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:12,737
And that would be a way for us to make sure that every paper that comes before us, unless it's something

835
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:20,540
like a remembrance or a celebration would go to the subject matter committee.

836
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:29,043
And those subject matter committees would meet on a regular day and time monthly or more frequently than monthly or less frequently than monthly.

837
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:30,843
We're going to have to try this out and figure that out.

838
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,544
But it would be very clear

839
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:41,715
well in advance, for example, for our planning development sustainability staff, they would know what we're going to have to planning and permitting committee meetings this month.

840
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:49,104
So we can have, you know, someone come and present on a plan development district at that committee meeting, or schedule public hearings, etc.

841
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:49,224
So,

842
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,710
that is, and also for planning and permitting committee is going to be very important as we work on the zoning work.

843
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,992
So everyone is welcome at every committee.

844
01:03:58,512 --> 01:04:08,240
Most of us will be voting members on most committees, and there will be standing times and subject matters for all of us to rely on for city staff to rely on.

845
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:18,429
And again, in the spirit of transparency for residents to know when and where they can be expected to show up, you know, maybe weeks and months in advance rather than just the Friday before.

846
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,200
the next Tuesday or Wednesday.

847
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:28,267
So thank you to my colleagues for considering this proposal, and I look forward to how you can improve it even more.

848
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,142
Thank you, President Barras, Councilor Scarpelli.

849
01:04:33,182 --> 01:04:34,342
Thank you, Madam President, if I can.

850
01:04:36,064 --> 01:04:55,617
Unfortunately, I don't have a PhD in organization, so this, if you could just do, if we can, if I could just ask for one favor, I think that as we're going public with this and people start looking, I think that one of the easier formats that we see on our website are our subcommittees and how that was formatted.

851
01:04:55,997 --> 01:04:59,940
If we can add, and ask Council President, if we can add

852
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:13,524
where, especially with the first document, as we're starting this process, that we can add maybe a little section that shows this would, in the past, fall under this committee.

853
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:15,085
So people can truly understand.

854
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:17,645
Because if you look at this, I understand it.

855
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:21,086
And as we're going through the process, saying, OK, now I understand where it falls.

856
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:28,669
But I think as we're talking about having that transparent form of government, where the common person is going to look on, they have an issue, and they have to speak

857
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:45,644
where the the language has been for years a subcommittee on science where there isn't a subcommittee on science but there is a committee that is under rules and permits if that's the way so be it so if there could be maybe a little disclaimer that says in the past this was

858
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,132
these were the subcommittees that fell into this category.

859
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:57,498
If we can do that just to, especially as we get started, I think that this document will be no different in a year or two, the people just understand it better.

860
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:08,365
But I think if we can have a little disclaimer there that shows the common person what they're looking at, so they can, that have revert back looking at, you know, the subcommittees that we've had in the past.

861
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:11,367
So at least they understand where it's going, okay?

862
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:12,708
If we can do that, that'd be great.

863
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:15,030
I'd appreciate that, Council President, thank you.

864
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:18,556
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

865
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:20,437
Councilor Zara.

866
01:06:21,198 --> 01:06:26,743
Just a quick question about all councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee.

867
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:32,988
So if you're not a voting member, can you help contribute to a quorum or no?

868
01:06:34,735 --> 01:06:40,419
The quorum will be based on voting members, but if you were to show up, even though you couldn't vote, you could speak as a member.

869
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,201
So you could just weigh in on something.

870
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:49,406
So sometimes in the past we've had subcommittees where Rick would end up being here and he'd be like, I can't talk because I'm not a member of the subcommittee.

871
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,807
And it's like the thing that he proposed.

872
01:06:53,148 --> 01:07:00,912
And I think the structure is no different, but I think what I'm seeing is you're welcoming everybody in where the former subcommittees were.

873
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:10,017
It was in the point where, in the past, I can't show up because I don't want to disrespect that chairperson because I'm actually not on it.

874
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:15,020
I think what we're seeing is a more open, inviting subcommittee process.

875
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,363
But at the same time, it's not so, and for the newer members, I think that to be stated,

876
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:23,520
We all have families.

877
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:28,145
If everybody's going to show up to five different meetings a week, that's a little overwhelming.

878
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:32,751
But at the same time, I like the idea that it's open for everybody.

879
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:35,834
Because in the past, it didn't lend to that congeniality.

880
01:07:36,054 --> 01:07:38,557
We were just like, I don't want to show up because.

881
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:47,842
I don't want to disrespect the chairperson because it's not my committee, thinking that I want to interject my thought process.

882
01:07:47,862 --> 01:08:04,989
But the way that Council Biaz has structured this, I think it's appreciated, because I think it shows that it's a welcoming committee, but at the same time, it's understood that we still have to have the groundwork as subcommittees and chairs and voices.

883
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:06,229
But thank you.

884
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:07,690
Sorry to interrupt, but I think that

885
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:10,871
little history that we've seen in the past.

886
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:12,533
Thank you.

887
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:18,324
Yeah, just a question as a new counselor.

888
01:08:18,504 --> 01:08:22,827
Does the lower requirement for quorum affect open meeting law?

889
01:08:23,568 --> 01:08:29,212
So are fewer counselors allowed to meet outside to discuss committee-specific work?

890
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:33,595
It gets tough.

891
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:40,380
For this, the quorum would be three as well, because it'd be three of five versus four of seven, so it's not much different.

892
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,603
Yeah, I mean, we could get a...

893
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:51,640
legal opinion, I guess, but I just said, don't talk to a majority of the council.

894
01:08:55,742 --> 01:09:07,209
Um, if I may, if I'm not jumping the line, I just think to that point as well, like there's a couple of things in here that I thought of like, um, you know, and maybe they aren't the best, uh,

895
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:15,958
necessarily the best quote-unquote politics, right, or at least the best parliamentary practice in terms of maintaining control.

896
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:20,986
But there's a, subcommittees would be appointed by committee chairs, right?

897
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:23,850
So if you're on the planning and permitting committee,

898
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:27,454
and you want to appoint a subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs, right?

899
01:09:27,474 --> 01:09:29,296
That's not in the president's hand under these rules.

900
01:09:29,316 --> 01:09:30,657
It'll be under the committee chair's rules.

901
01:09:31,098 --> 01:09:46,873
And the other thing is that if a counselor is here at the bottom, if a counselor requests the committee chair shall place any paper referred to the committee on the next scheduled committee meeting agenda or the agenda for another scheduled meeting, that allows counselors to, if they have a paper, they propose it, they send it to committee, they can then

902
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,700
make sure that it's heard in committee.

903
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:54,501
And I think we've experienced in the past, in many directions, that not happening.

904
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:00,823
And Councilor Scarbelli notes it.

905
01:10:02,223 --> 01:10:04,463
It's happened in both directions.

906
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:09,424
It's happened to me, and it's also happened that I was like, I don't want to meet on this.

907
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:17,066
And I think this gives councilors individually a little bit more of a voice to say, hey, I proposed this paper, referred to committee, we haven't met on it.

908
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,687
I'd really like to see it on the agenda.

909
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:21,688
And then this rule would say, okay, then they can place it on the agenda.

910
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:36,435
The other thing to your point, Councillor Scarpelli, in terms of meeting kind of the idea was we're sticking to Tuesdays and Wednesdays, you know, to start out and we'll see how this goes, you know, have one committee at six and another at seven.

911
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,416
If the six o'clock goes a little long.

912
01:10:39,016 --> 01:10:40,637
then the seven o'clock starts a little later.

913
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:46,999
If the six o'clock is a little short, then we have to wait around for 15 minutes to start at seven, but still keeping it to Tuesdays and Wednesday nights.

914
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:59,324
If we do it that way, it also leaves open alternating Tuesdays for Committee of the Whole, as well as the meetings, the meeting time before regular meetings for either Committee of the Whole or say a subcommittee on signs.

915
01:10:59,364 --> 01:11:01,085
I know we were talking about that before the meeting.

916
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:21,896
So it allows us to stick to Tuesday and Wednesdays, we're not going out to Thursdays or Saturdays or, you know, anything and hopefully, you know, maybe at the start the meetings might be a little long if there's several items in the committee, you know, if we have to consider all the papers and committee from the previous year and go through and say we're keeping these and we're putting these on file.

917
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:39,428
but my hope is that it will still stick to relatively reasonable, not that this is ever reasonable, meeting times for us so that we're here Tuesday and Wednesday nights about six o'clock to nine o'clock, six o'clock to 10 o'clock, and not going beyond that.

918
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:40,549
And we'll see.

919
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:44,831
It'll all depend on how many great ideas get added to the governing agenda, right?

920
01:11:45,212 --> 01:11:46,833
So thank you.

921
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:49,315
Thank you, President Behrs.

922
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,416
Any further discussion?

923
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:57,524
Motion to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

924
01:11:58,144 --> 01:11:58,665
All in favor?

925
01:11:59,285 --> 01:11:59,405
Aye.

926
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:00,206
All opposed?

927
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:07,091
Motion passes.

928
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:12,094
24008, offered by President Behrs, resolution to review and update city fee schedule.

929
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:20,240
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the fee schedule of the city of Medford, appendix A to the city ordinances, be reviewed and updated.

930
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,341
President Behrs.

931
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:22,881
Thank you, Madam President.

932
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:31,064
In many conversations with folks across city government, especially our friends in the city clerk's office, they said, hey, we haven't updated the fees in a while.

933
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,624
They're pretty low compared to surrounding communities.

934
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:42,467
And I think it's just important for us, as we've talked about in many different contexts to take a look at what we're doing, make sure we're making a regular review.

935
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:51,650
and make sure that we are keeping up with the times when it comes to the fees that we're charging for various licenses, permits, et cetera.

936
01:12:52,190 --> 01:13:07,636
So I would move to refer this to the just established by your vote planning and permitting committee so that they could take a look at the fee schedule for our many departments and see what is a reasonable fee schedule to set an update for the city.

937
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:13,904
Any.

938
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:17,747
Let's just submit send motion referred a planning and permitting committee.

939
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:18,207
Yeah.

940
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:22,129
Any further comment from my fellow counselors?

941
01:13:23,811 --> 01:13:24,771
On the motion.

942
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:32,456
On the motion by President Behrs to refer this paper to the planning and permitting committee, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

943
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:33,637
All those in favor?

944
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:34,938
Aye.

945
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:35,598
All those opposed?

946
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,180
The paper is referred.

947
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:55,448
24009 offered by President Baer's resolution to request Board of Health implement winter eviction moratorium.

948
01:13:57,029 --> 01:14:10,875
Whereas many cities and countries prohibited evictions between November 1 and March 31 due to winter cold that puts lives in danger and whereas Massachusetts has yet to implement a statewide policy to protect families from becoming unhoused

949
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:21,226
and put out on the street in dangerously cold weather, and whereas over 1,200 households were evicted in Massachusetts in the winter of 2022 through 2023.

950
01:14:21,926 --> 01:14:36,775
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the Board of Health declare an annual state of emergency and implement an eviction moratorium each winter to protect the health and safety of residents who face potentially fatal illness if evicted during the winter.

951
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:37,975
President Behrs.

952
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,037
Thank you, President Collins.

953
01:14:42,085 --> 01:15:06,594
essentially the purpose of this resolution is, as you just read, there have been calls from residents that I've heard from here in Medford, organizations statewide like Greater Boston Legal Services, requesting that communities look into, especially their boards of health, adopting this kind of state of emergency for the winter months to prevent evictions just for the cold weather.

954
01:15:06,614 --> 01:15:08,895
It certainly would not stop the

955
01:15:09,855 --> 01:15:11,436
legal process from going forward.

956
01:15:13,077 --> 01:15:17,521
And quite frankly, you'd probably have a big cliff effect where on April 1st, you'd see quite many evictions.

957
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:37,615
And I think that's something we need to consider as well, but especially addressing the issue of putting people out in the street in the cold, in the dangerously cold winter weather with the shelter system for the state at maximum capacity with the lack of capacity or, you know, 24 hour shelters here in Medford.

958
01:15:39,676 --> 01:15:42,677
this resolution is the folks who can implement this is the Board of Health.

959
01:15:42,797 --> 01:15:43,698
We can't implement it.

960
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:45,479
I don't even think the mayor can implement it.

961
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,940
It would be the Board of Health under some state regulations.

962
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,462
And Greater Boston Legal Services does have more information on that.

963
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:59,905
But I did want to put this on the agenda and send this over to the Board of Health to request that they consider

964
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:04,392
taking this action to protect the health and safety of Medford residents.

965
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:08,875
So I would move to refer this to the Board of Health for their consideration.

966
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:12,178
Thank you for your consideration, my fellow colleagues.

967
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,582
Councillor Lazaro.

968
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:21,745
I appreciate you putting this on the agenda, President Behrs.

969
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:30,354
One of my jobs right now, I'm the assistant director of the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal shelter in Malden.

970
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:33,817
It's an overnight shelter for people who are unhoused.

971
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,982
And we are open from December 1 through March 30th yearly.

972
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:44,006
And I can also say that in November, we get a lot of people calling us saying, are you open yet?

973
01:16:44,106 --> 01:16:45,607
Because it's cold in November too.

974
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:51,973
We should be doing anything and everything that we can to make sure that people can stay in their homes

975
01:16:52,557 --> 01:16:58,922
when it's cold out, it doesn't even have to be below freezing for people to face a lot of health issues from exposure.

976
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:13,232
We had a guest recently with, we're not a medical facility, we are run by volunteers and just people just with no training in any kind of medical things at the center that I work at.

977
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:19,729
So when we have folks that have real medical issues, we frequently have to call ambulances.

978
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:30,533
And we have a guest who has COPD, and he, just because of exposure from being outside, goes to the hospital really frequently, has a lot of breathing problems just from being outside during the day, even on days when it's not that cold.

979
01:17:30,593 --> 01:17:32,293
So it really is very dangerous for people.

980
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:41,597
And if there is anything that we can do as a council, just small steps towards mitigating that for our residents, I think we should make sure that we're taking those steps.

981
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:43,624
I appreciate you putting it on the agenda.

982
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:48,552
I appreciate whatever the Board of Health can do, and this can be one thing in that direction.

983
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:49,493
So thank you.

984
01:17:51,496 --> 01:17:52,758
Thank you, Councilor Lozano.

985
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,601
We'll go to Councilor Sang and then Councilor Callahan.

986
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:56,085
Thank you.

987
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:56,386
Um.

988
01:17:57,146 --> 01:18:00,069
Counselor or President bears for introducing this.

989
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:05,694
Um I think in a very similar vein to what councils, uh, Lazaro was talking about.

990
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:15,062
Uh this eviction moratorium, I think it's something that's very crucial for people to get through these difficult winter months.

991
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:16,303
I think today's.

992
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:33,172
As Councilor Behrs, as President Behrs referred to, there's very noticeable strain on our shelter system and our health care system.

993
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:40,855
And when we look at the data, when we look at the science of evictions, number one, it's just bad, right?

994
01:18:41,035 --> 01:18:42,836
But from a scientific standpoint,

995
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:52,912
evictions tend to cause more mental health issues, tend to cause more physical health ailments as well.

996
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:59,975
It tends to be, you know, as Councillor Lazaro was talking about, truly life-threatening.

997
01:19:00,296 --> 01:19:08,760
And I think we have a moral responsibility to make sure our neighbours are able to get through these next few months safely.

998
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,062
And so I'm very grateful for this resolution.

999
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:16,730
Thank you, Councillor Singh.

1000
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:17,911
Councillor Callahan.

1001
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:25,994
Hi, yep, I very much agree that this is important, and we need to protect those residents health and safety.

1002
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:29,155
I would love to hear from President bears.

1003
01:19:29,595 --> 01:19:33,457
If you happen to know any sort of just a tiny bit of details about

1004
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:55,809
Obviously, if this is under state regulations and other cities are passing this, there's going to be, you know, places that the Board of Health will go for the kinds of details about how this might affect, like, small local landlords and the ways in which the sort of, you know, is there funding that is available?

1005
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:59,931
Is there, you know, how is this sort of effectively done?

1006
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:03,213
I have not looked into how that is done at the state level or at other cities.

1007
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:06,236
if there's a word or two you could speak to on that point.

1008
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:19,928
Yes, on the specifics, this is similar to the Board of Health eviction moratoria that were put in place during the pandemic through states of emergency.

1009
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:23,030
Medford did not implement one, but several neighboring cities did.

1010
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:28,635
Greater Boston Legal Services is available to talk about the details of the legal justification behind it.

1011
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:39,625
Essentially how it would work, and in this case I think it speaks to, I wouldn't say that it would not have impact, but I think it would relatively minimize the impact.

1012
01:20:41,013 --> 01:20:45,615
the proceeding would continue in court.

1013
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:50,796
And it's a months-long process to file for an eviction.

1014
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:54,537
So the proceeding would continue when the courts are considering it.

1015
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:59,119
This would prohibit the final enforcement of the final eviction order.

1016
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:07,822
So essentially it would say, stop it at the sheriff level, at the constable level, where it's just that final step.

1017
01:21:09,646 --> 01:21:16,930
I'm not going to say that there wouldn't be delays that could potentially impact someone who is renting a unit.

1018
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:25,115
But it would not just say, oh, you can't even start the process, or you can't go through the court process, or you can't go through those steps.

1019
01:21:25,475 --> 01:21:30,378
It would just prevent the final enforcement of it until the weather essentially was warm enough.

1020
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:38,343
And I'm sure the Board of Health could consider alternative dates and time frames or setting it every year based on

1021
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,100
weather patterns, although there's not many patterns left in the weather.

1022
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:54,088
But yeah, that so it would not just say, oh, you can't do this and nothing is getting processed, which is actually what was happening under Governor Baker's order when the statewide had an eviction moratorium.

1023
01:21:54,108 --> 01:21:56,850
And then that whole process had to get going again.

1024
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:05,135
So if someone filed for an eviction on November 15th, it likely would take 60 to 90 days for that to get through the court system or even longer than that.

1025
01:22:05,455 --> 01:22:08,137
At that point, you're close to the March 31st date anyway.

1026
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:11,455
Thank you.

1027
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:11,995
Councilor Leving.

1028
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,538
Just a question for Councilor Lazar.

1029
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:32,010
In your years working with and running the Malden Warming Shelter, could you just give us an idea of how many people that came into the shelter were evicted during the winter months, just to offer an idea of how many this resolution would likely affect?

1030
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,233
Well, homelessness isn't,

1031
01:22:37,682 --> 01:22:40,963
It isn't a municipal issue.

1032
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:41,963
It's like a regional issue.

1033
01:22:42,984 --> 01:22:52,927
So it's hard to get numbers for how many people in a town are evicted, because when you need shelter, you go where the shelter is.

1034
01:22:53,027 --> 01:23:06,072
So what I can say is some people are chronically homeless, and some people are homeless because they missed a payment, they had a short-term issue, or they were evicted

1035
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:09,148
because of an error.

1036
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:16,491
We had one guest last year who was evicted because of an error and was stuck in the courts, but was fully evicted out of his home for the entire winter.

1037
01:23:17,052 --> 01:23:21,173
And he's now in a home, but it took him the whole winter.

1038
01:23:21,193 --> 01:23:22,494
And he had a job.

1039
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:23,694
He went to work every day.

1040
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:25,215
He dressed really beautifully.

1041
01:23:25,275 --> 01:23:28,336
He worked at a clothing store in the Prudential building.

1042
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:32,738
And he came every night that he could make it when he wasn't working too late to get in.

1043
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,989
But he did not seem like a homeless person.

1044
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:37,190
He was evicted because of an error.

1045
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,851
And he, you know, like was evicted in the winter.

1046
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:41,912
So it there are all different stories.

1047
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,273
We don't like have that much data about it.

1048
01:23:43,313 --> 01:23:45,794
But it does happen really, pretty frequently.

1049
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:52,778
I think there isn't like, when there aren't people stopping you from doing something you just can still evict people.

1050
01:23:53,663 --> 01:23:56,725
Yeah, I mean, it seems like a pretty common sense thing.

1051
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,107
If you got evicted in the winter, that could potentially be lethal.

1052
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:07,391
So just having rules in place to prevent that from happening definitely seems worth this body's time.

1053
01:24:11,594 --> 01:24:12,695
Do I have a second for the motion?

1054
01:24:15,356 --> 01:24:16,737
The motion was to refer to the Board of Health.

1055
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:22,761
On the motion to refer this paper to the Board of Health, seconded by Councillor Singh.

1056
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:23,956
All in favor?

1057
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:25,718
All opposed?

1058
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:27,659
Motion passes.

1059
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:38,466
Madam President, before you relinquish the chair back to me, just I noticed 23-412 and I didn't see on Zoom either the Dell Avenue question.

1060
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,307
I know that you had spoken to PDS.

1061
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,369
It was tabled until tonight.

1062
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:51,155
I would just like to motion to just leave it on the table so that it can come back up when I see the clerk raising his hand.

1063
01:24:51,195 --> 01:24:53,136
So I will let him instruct the chair.

1064
01:24:55,393 --> 01:25:00,935
Attorney Dash also called my office, actually emailed my office and said they were not going to be ready to proceed.

1065
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:03,516
They're close, but they're not there yet.

1066
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:07,237
So he asked for it to remain tabled until they have a resolution.

1067
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:15,220
Okay, so if we could just move to keep it on the table and then we can just change it to just tabled instead of to a date certain, then we can raise it at any time when the parties are here.

1068
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:21,842
So just be a motion to table, instead of tabling to a date certain, just to table.

1069
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:30,281
on the motion to table by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Seng.

1070
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:31,842
Any further discussion?

1071
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:39,967
We're at the 23-412, which is already under unfinished business.

1072
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,169
We're just motioning to table that, but not to a specific date.

1073
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:47,312
All in favor?

1074
01:25:47,332 --> 01:25:47,972
Aye.

1075
01:25:48,212 --> 01:25:48,332
Aye.

1076
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:49,353
All opposed?

1077
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:51,434
Motion passes.

1078
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:52,795
It stays on the table.

1079
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:16,451
24-010, resolution to discuss adoption of good landlord tax credit.

1080
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:24,813
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council explore enactment of a good landlord tax credit as outlined in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 50.

1081
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:33,295
Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further study and for discussion with the Chief Assessor and Finance Director, Vice President Collins.

1082
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:35,656
Thank you, President Barrett.

1083
01:26:37,662 --> 01:26:39,603
the good landlord tax credit.

1084
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:50,027
This is kind of the colloquial phrase for a local option that was included very recently in the state tax relief package under Governor Healey.

1085
01:26:50,987 --> 01:27:00,811
Essentially, this provides now a new way for cities to give a property tax break to landlords who choose to keep their rents below market rate.

1086
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:06,613
So it is a way to, in different framings, either incentivize or reward or

1087
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:13,558
thank, if you want to put it that way, small landlords who opt to offer more affordable rents to their tenants.

1088
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,522
It's not a one-size-fits-all mechanism.

1089
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:24,169
Cities can have several levers that they can pull on.

1090
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:24,889
They can choose

1091
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:37,209
up to what percentage of property tax to exempt landlords from.

1092
01:27:39,072 --> 01:27:50,025
They can choose whether to enact this option for landlords who, oh, I always get this wording messed up.

1093
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:54,874
You can enact this if rents are affordable up to 200% AMI.

1094
01:27:55,214 --> 01:28:01,522
We have the option to narrow it so that it's just for landlords who provide only much deeper affordability.

1095
01:28:01,562 --> 01:28:10,111
That's like a whole spectrum that this council could investigate and decide what might be the best fit for this community, and all communities have that option.

1096
01:28:11,513 --> 01:28:39,874
So there's a lot to deliberate on to explore this option further and decide what might be the best fit for Medford, for our landlords that are offering low market rate rents, all towards the goal of incentivizing small landlords to do this, because we have such an acute and ever-worsening affordable housing scarcity and crisis in Medford, as we do throughout the region, and as a way to make making that choice to offer affordability

1097
01:28:40,276 --> 01:28:44,662
a little more doable for landlords and to further incentivize them to do so.

1098
01:28:46,063 --> 01:28:57,738
And so my motion is to send this to the administration and finance committee where we can have a start discussion about it with our chief assessor and our finance director about implications for the city and get their insight on how to implement this.

1099
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,430
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1100
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:05,593
I will go to Councillor Sang, Councillor Cullen, Councillor Scarpelli, Councillor Lemming.

1101
01:29:06,014 --> 01:29:06,534
Councillor Sang.

1102
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:07,175
Thank you.

1103
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,538
Thank you, Vice President Collins, for introducing this resolution.

1104
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:18,064
This is the start of a discussion about the good landlord tax credit.

1105
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:24,590
This, I think, through your description, Councillor Collins, I think you've described it super well.

1106
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:30,452
I hope that a lot of our residents are excited about this possibly being implemented.

1107
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:38,874
As you noted, there are details that we have to work through, but this resolution starts the process.

1108
01:29:39,494 --> 01:29:42,075
It starts that conversation in the community about this.

1109
01:29:43,455 --> 01:29:49,397
I've always said that the housing crisis is one of the most severe challenges facing our city right now.

1110
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:52,299
It's part of a larger affordability crisis.

1111
01:29:52,799 --> 01:30:01,145
And I think, and I know that a lot of us, a lot of, if not all of us were elected on platforms to tackle affordability in the city.

1112
01:30:02,657 --> 01:30:21,811
This, another kind of maxim that I always say, specifically when it comes to the housing crisis, is that inaction has been so pervasive for such a long time that we now need to use all the tools in the toolbox, or at least consider all the tools in the toolbox.

1113
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:29,277
And with the state giving us a local option, we should be proactive in exercising our local rights.

1114
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:41,536
I also think, and the economic data supports this, that incentives can be a very useful economic tool to incentivize

1115
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:43,454
better behavior.

1116
01:30:44,795 --> 01:31:04,473
And I believe that the good landlord tax credit would especially help at the margins where this might incentivize the landlord to seek to qualify for the program given the credit from the property taxes.

1117
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:14,322
lower rents, hopefully, at the margins, and help those in our community who happen to be in those situations.

1118
01:31:14,462 --> 01:31:16,583
And so I'm optimistic about this, I think.

1119
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:18,063
There's a lot of potential here.

1120
01:31:19,404 --> 01:31:27,646
There's more details that we need to walk through, but I am very grateful to Vice President Collins for introducing this, and I'll second your motion.

1121
01:31:29,747 --> 01:31:30,787
Councillor Callahan.

1122
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:31,856
Thank you.

1123
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:35,478
I read this section of the state code.

1124
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:36,818
I was very excited about it.

1125
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,499
It's something I talked about on the campaign trail.

1126
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:53,506
You know, this is something that really just gets right at affordable housing in terms of rentals, and it attacks the problem exactly where it exists, by rewarding those rental properties and those landlords.

1127
01:31:53,902 --> 01:31:55,903
who are renting below market rates.

1128
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:58,625
So that is exactly what we want to be doing.

1129
01:31:58,685 --> 01:31:59,625
I'm pretty excited about it.

1130
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:11,552
I also am excited about the fact that it will just by the fact of doing this, you know, most of the people, the landlords who are renting below market rates tend to be local.

1131
01:32:12,252 --> 01:32:13,634
Many of them live here in our city.

1132
01:32:14,775 --> 01:32:17,097
If not right here in our city, then they're in nearby cities.

1133
01:32:17,777 --> 01:32:26,825
And I think being able to target these tax credits for folks who live here is what I wish we could do if we can legally, if we can find a way to do it legally for Medford residents, I would love to do that.

1134
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:34,132
But I'm also very happy that this will target people who are local, a lot of Medford resident landlords, as well as folks who live in nearby cities.

1135
01:32:35,073 --> 01:32:36,073
So I'm excited about it.

1136
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:37,815
I'm excited to discuss it on the committee.

1137
01:32:37,835 --> 01:32:38,896
So thank you for putting this forward.

1138
01:32:41,448 --> 01:32:45,054
Thank you, Mr President.

1139
01:32:45,896 --> 01:32:48,039
Um, they bring this forward and explaining it.

1140
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:50,744
I think that the phone calls I was getting was joy.

1141
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:51,525
Okay, so George.

1142
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:54,192
If I wave hi to my neighbor, am I good?

1143
01:32:54,212 --> 01:33:01,336
And I said, please, I said just, but I think that it's important that we understand where it's coming from.

1144
01:33:01,476 --> 01:33:20,268
But I think that I appreciate that it's going to the assessor just to understand the ramifications because although the best laid plans sound great, but I think we all have to, when we make decisions is also understand that if there are,

1145
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:27,964
what does it look like if we have 10 landlords that are going to do this?

1146
01:33:28,004 --> 01:33:36,389
How does this affect, you know, the other balance with our tax bracket and see how that affects us?

1147
01:33:36,469 --> 01:33:52,459
I know that, you know, love the idea, especially when we see, you know, as a former, you know, resident of a home that was owned by a resident of Medford,

1148
01:33:53,144 --> 01:33:59,626
and that being my dad and making sure that he never took advantage of his tenants.

1149
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:09,049
And we know in his passing, he promised my brothers he took over the home to make sure that the families are there, we'll always have a place to live.

1150
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:19,033
So I think that that's a reward that people like to have that open mind to see because I think like, as Councilor Cowen said, we have, you know,

1151
01:34:20,473 --> 01:34:24,635
the homes and the landlords that really take advantage, railing out those people that live here.

1152
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:33,218
And, but I think it's something that I think needs to be vetted, and I appreciate that going to the subcommittee so we can see where this goes.

1153
01:34:33,278 --> 01:34:34,178
So, I appreciate it.

1154
01:34:37,674 --> 01:34:41,356
I'd like to thank Vice President Collins for bringing this forward.

1155
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:53,922
I knocked on a lot of doors this past campaign and a lot of people that I spoke to are small landlords that oftentimes rent below market rates who are

1156
01:34:54,702 --> 01:35:09,352
who were sometimes comparing themselves to other landlords that lived a few towns over and never maintained their properties, essentially see land in Medford as something which they can extract as much money from as possible.

1157
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:23,481
And I very much sympathize with what Councillor Callaghan was saying, that it is oftentimes difficult when digging through state code to try to find ways of distinguishing between one type of landlord and the other type of landlord.

1158
01:35:23,501 --> 01:35:24,222
And this is a very

1159
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:27,444
it's a good tool for doing that.

1160
01:35:28,124 --> 01:35:38,151
The other thing I'd like to point out is beyond incentivizing lower rents, which is a city council now that I believe has a majority of renters on it.

1161
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:47,517
If that was counting correctly, it also can be used to incentivize landlords who actively maintain their properties,

1162
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:55,943
who choose to do repairs on time, who really take care of their tenants in that way too.

1163
01:35:56,484 --> 01:36:08,411
So I think that this is something that potentially a lot more people could get behind because it will incentivize basically upkeep in Medford if it's implemented correctly.

1164
01:36:08,531 --> 01:36:10,212
So thank you very much.

1165
01:36:12,415 --> 01:36:13,256
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1166
01:36:13,536 --> 01:36:17,359
And I think it may be a three, three split and everyone knows I live in my parents' basement, so.

1167
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:22,182
It's not true, it's the first floor.

1168
01:36:28,087 --> 01:36:29,528
I only come out Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

1169
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,393
Any further comment on the resolution?

1170
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:39,956
Any further comment on the resolution?

1171
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:52,129
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Seng to, and I'll go back to Councilor, Vice President Collins.

1172
01:36:52,510 --> 01:37:04,278
Sorry, now that we have approved the resolution to adopt committees with titles, I should just amend this to refer to the Administration and Finance Committee and not committee.

1173
01:37:05,379 --> 01:37:10,023
On the motion of Councilor Collins, as amended by Councilor Collins and seconded by Councilor Seng.

1174
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:12,705
Oh, she already moved, okay.

1175
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:17,093
Then simply on the motion of Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1176
01:37:17,153 --> 01:37:17,874
All those in favour?

1177
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:19,255
Opposed?

1178
01:37:19,535 --> 01:37:19,755
None.

1179
01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:20,716
Motion passes.

1180
01:37:20,736 --> 01:37:23,759
I think we're going to switch again.

1181
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:24,880
Sorry about that.

1182
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,106
City Council.

1183
01:37:54,126 --> 01:37:59,007
24 011 offered by President bears resolution to request update on Wellington Circle study next steps.

1184
01:37:59,927 --> 01:38:12,490
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the traffic and transportation director provide an update on when the city of Medford in partnership with mass dot district for plans to initiate a project through the mass dot project development process to implement the

1185
01:38:20,168 --> 01:38:21,989
What's the, what are they calling it these days?

1186
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,672
The hurricane, the tornado, the vortex, something.

1187
01:38:26,712 --> 01:38:33,657
They're calling Wellington Circle something, but it's, I can't quite remember what it is, but some sort of nightmare vortex.

1188
01:38:36,919 --> 01:38:40,601
And as such, it's super collider, that's it, there it is.

1189
01:38:42,302 --> 01:38:43,543
Thank you, counselor saying.

1190
01:38:43,563 --> 01:38:46,044
There's a few Google reviews too.

1191
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:48,366
The Medford super collider.

1192
01:38:49,551 --> 01:38:51,213
our contribution to particle physics.

1193
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:56,958
But in any case, they studied Wellington Circle.

1194
01:38:57,018 --> 01:38:57,478
It's bad.

1195
01:38:57,718 --> 01:38:59,360
Study headline, not good.

1196
01:39:01,341 --> 01:39:09,148
But they did issue some recommendations, short-term recommendations and long-term recommendations to improve safety for all modes of transit.

1197
01:39:10,329 --> 01:39:16,890
at Wellington Circle, as well as, I think, at least in my read of some of the recommendations, it will look a lot nicer.

1198
01:39:17,391 --> 01:39:32,214
It will actually activate, to an extent, it will activate the idea of building a neighborhood and connecting the different parts of the Wellington neighborhood to a little more if that intersection is not the disastrous arrangement that it is today.

1199
01:39:32,654 --> 01:39:38,315
However, at the end it says, and Medford will work on this with MassDOT District 4 and MassDOT

1200
01:39:39,615 --> 01:39:41,696
and through the MassDOT project development process.

1201
01:39:41,716 --> 01:39:47,459
So really the only purpose of this resolution is to ask Director Blake, where are we?

1202
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:57,264
As we all know, certainly Medford is not going to be able to pay to fix that intersection, nor is it our jurisdictional responsibility to do so, but we are part of the process.

1203
01:39:58,184 --> 01:39:59,385
And Director Blake,

1204
01:40:00,934 --> 01:40:04,176
was, you know, that the city of Medford was named as part of the next step.

1205
01:40:04,236 --> 01:40:18,266
So reaching out to MassDOT and making sure that we know where this is in the process, how it will be funded, what are the timelines we can expect for the short-term mitigations to potentially go into effect, as well as the long-term redesign of the entire intersection.

1206
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:21,128
And that's all this is.

1207
01:40:21,168 --> 01:40:25,210
So this would be a motion to refer to Traffic and Transportation Director Blake.

1208
01:40:29,718 --> 01:40:32,582
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1209
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:33,063
Wow.

1210
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:35,826
It turns out I was the first one to mess up.

1211
01:40:40,867 --> 01:41:00,738
As someone who goes through that intersection multiple times a week, at least by car, but oftentimes on foot, the circle being fixed as to the best of its ability is something that I think will impact the lives of a lot of Bedford residents, whether it be

1212
01:41:01,678 --> 01:41:08,243
a change that folks like or don't, I would recommend everyone look at the plans online.

1213
01:41:09,103 --> 01:41:23,493
And while I don't think there's much room for changing the plans given the state's, the structure of how the state has designed this process and its relative inflexibility to adjust their plans,

1214
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:32,480
I still think that getting more feedback and having our city government put more pressure on the state is important.

1215
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:43,150
There are also parts of the plan that are optional, that are recommendations for the future that could be cut out, and a lot of those particularly intact pedestrians.

1216
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:46,892
that we're looking to make that neighborhood.

1217
01:41:46,912 --> 01:41:48,453
Um transit, particularly transit, um, focused.

1218
01:41:48,493 --> 01:41:48,793
Um and, uh.

1219
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:49,213
And in the

1220
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:17,801
for introducing this, and I hope that our city can do a lot of good work on it, but getting clarity on the project is the first step.

1221
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:21,782
Thank you, Councilor Singh.

1222
01:42:22,022 --> 01:42:22,643
Any further comment?

1223
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:24,843
Councilor Kalan.

1224
01:42:25,864 --> 01:42:26,204
Thank you.

1225
01:42:26,364 --> 01:42:32,846
So where can we, whether we are city councilors or members of the interested public, where can we find the Wellington Circle Study?

1226
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:41,697
It is, it's on the, I was gonna come up with something, but it's on the mass, it's mass.gov.

1227
01:42:41,817 --> 01:42:49,800
I could not tell you how much further the URL goes, but if you were to type into Google Wellington Circle Study, it'd be on the mass.gov website.

1228
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,941
And then there's a page for Wellington Circle Study.

1229
01:42:52,281 --> 01:42:54,882
And then there's a list of documents on that page.

1230
01:42:56,243 --> 01:43:00,545
And I think it is the, it's called the final report, I believe is what it's called, but.

1231
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:17,823
You should see the, they wanted to, one of the proposed alternatives was an overpass, which I, yeah, well, I would have liked the tunnel, but the overpass is, yeah, so.

1232
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,426
But yeah, some Google.

1233
01:43:22,928 --> 01:43:23,829
Short answer, Google.

1234
01:43:27,672 --> 01:43:29,134
Do I have a second on the motion?

1235
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,203
On the motion to refer to the Traffic and Transportation Director, seconded by Councilor Lozano.

1236
01:43:36,263 --> 01:43:36,903
All those in favor?

1237
01:43:36,923 --> 01:43:37,683
Aye.

1238
01:43:37,703 --> 01:43:39,904
I second Councilor Lozano's motion.

1239
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:44,206
Congratulations.

1240
01:43:44,606 --> 01:43:45,747
Now you have to come up and give remarks.

1241
01:44:01,567 --> 01:44:02,468
the great divide.

1242
01:44:02,488 --> 01:44:05,150
All those in favor?

1243
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,190
Aye.

1244
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:08,052
All opposed?

1245
01:44:08,572 --> 01:44:09,273
Motion passes.

1246
01:44:17,259 --> 01:44:19,500
People don't know, but I was Justin's favorite teacher.

1247
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:23,023
It was crazy.

1248
01:44:23,043 --> 01:44:25,765
We're going back all the way to the Osgoode school days.

1249
01:44:25,905 --> 01:44:28,147
I thought President Collins was going to use the gavel before me.

1250
01:44:30,103 --> 01:44:33,505
Watch out.

1251
01:44:35,986 --> 01:44:38,768
That brings us to public participation.

1252
01:44:39,609 --> 01:44:45,112
Is there anyone, any member of the public on Zoom or in the room who would like to speak for public participation?

1253
01:44:45,132 --> 01:44:48,214
I think we have one.

1254
01:44:48,234 --> 01:44:50,375
I'm seeing no one on Zoom.

1255
01:44:50,395 --> 01:44:51,295
We have someone in the room.

1256
01:44:52,296 --> 01:44:56,638
Oh, Jack is coming up.

1257
01:44:56,779 --> 01:44:57,019
Yeah.

1258
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,281
Name and address for the record, please.

1259
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:06,463
Oh, if you could tap the... Where it says push?

1260
01:45:06,563 --> 01:45:06,823
Yes.

1261
01:45:07,103 --> 01:45:07,384
Cool.

1262
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:10,645
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1263
01:45:12,346 --> 01:45:13,526
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1264
01:45:15,034 --> 01:45:16,035
for inviting me here tonight.

1265
01:45:16,555 --> 01:45:25,142
So I came a few weeks ago as a concerned neighbor regarding a potential migrant shelter diagonally across the street from my house.

1266
01:45:25,743 --> 01:45:38,013
I saw on a Facebook post through my wife's Facebook, I guess the mayor sort of addressed some things that are happening, but I'm hoping maybe someone here can help shed some light.

1267
01:45:39,557 --> 01:45:43,800
If I can, I know Mr. Merritt's been actively, I know the neighbors have reached out.

1268
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:50,844
I think that the question that has been put out there, the mayor did address it.

1269
01:45:50,964 --> 01:45:53,085
I could share the email with everybody.

1270
01:45:53,225 --> 01:45:55,546
I was hoping to get some clarification.

1271
01:45:56,827 --> 01:46:07,532
what I would like to do is call for a meeting with that state representative because in this email the mayor clearly states that it's really that she doesn't believe I think that it falls in her privy to hold this meeting.

1272
01:46:07,592 --> 01:46:19,058
She thinks really it needs our state delegates to really explain what's going on so if I can read it so you absolutely that'd be great thank you if you can so it's uh it's an update for temporary shelter update from the mayor

1273
01:46:19,798 --> 01:46:20,358
Hello, everyone.

1274
01:46:20,398 --> 01:46:22,319
I wanted to provide an update in the last email.

1275
01:46:22,339 --> 01:46:25,780
The humanitarian crisis unfolding in our region.

1276
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:33,102
We believe the state is moving forward with the facility at 400 Riverside to serve as a temporary overnight shelter for families.

1277
01:46:33,662 --> 01:46:48,667
My office, along with our Acting Building Commissioner, Fire Chief and Board of Health, Emergency Response Director, have outlined our concerns as well as our code requirements to ensure that the governor's administration ensures a safe and secure environment for families currently in the state's wait list

1278
01:46:49,147 --> 01:46:50,228
for emergency assistance.

1279
01:46:50,789 --> 01:46:59,878
I'm working toward reaching an MOU to set a clear limit on the number of people housed at the facility as well as capping the duration of each family's stay.

1280
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:06,465
The reasons being the facility is very large and could fit thousands because three of our elementary schools are already at capacity.

1281
01:47:06,965 --> 01:47:07,806
My ask of that

1282
01:47:09,887 --> 01:47:18,510
Schools are already capacity that this be for no more than 75 families, 250 people, which is what was the original plan for the state.

1283
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:29,454
The shelter is active until April or June, and the latest based on legislators, recent legislation, that the families rotate into permanent shelter within three to four days.

1284
01:47:30,034 --> 01:47:35,236
Again, these are just my asks, and there are no specifics for report out of the public yet.

1285
01:47:35,996 --> 01:47:46,236
To date there is no lease agreement in place with the owner of 400 Riverside, no contract with the health and services provider, and as I said, no MOU.

1286
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:51,649
in place with the city, so there are a few details that can be shared.

1287
01:47:52,209 --> 01:47:57,831
As you may have read, the state is moving forward and has already opened the Cambridge site, which took priority.

1288
01:47:58,271 --> 01:48:05,433
As soon as I am fully briefed by the state in specifics and operations terms upon Riverside, I will relay

1289
01:48:07,553 --> 01:48:11,116
Excuse me, that info to you all as well as the public.

1290
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:20,022
Ultimately, this is a state-run endeavor in the relationship with a private entity, and we ultimately have very little say and have no oversight on the day-to-day operations.

1291
01:48:20,523 --> 01:48:23,345
My only hope is that the MOU can be reached and signed.

1292
01:48:23,965 --> 01:48:35,982
If there is any community meetings, it would have to be done by the state officials running the system and the building owner and provider as we don't have much involvement or insight into how this process unfolds.

1293
01:48:36,462 --> 01:48:38,085
So that's from the mayor's office.

1294
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:38,746
It's from the mayor.

1295
01:48:39,707 --> 01:48:40,428
So I think that

1296
01:48:41,369 --> 01:48:50,491
I think the mayor also understands the impact of our infrastructure, that making sure that we don't overburden our system right now.

1297
01:48:50,571 --> 01:49:00,114
I think that I've heard a lot from the teachers and the fear from parents, especially in that neighborhood between the Roberts and the McGlynn and the Andrews.

1298
01:49:00,674 --> 01:49:03,735
It's very, very, very, very tight.

1299
01:49:04,015 --> 01:49:07,756
And although we understand that we

1300
01:49:08,891 --> 01:49:20,321
you know, the governor wants to look at options, but again, I think my hope is that I get an update from the mayor again.

1301
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:26,827
The mayor's been responsive, but I think at the same time, I think we need to have our state delegates here and all of them.

1302
01:49:27,267 --> 01:49:29,729
I think that we need to have an understanding

1303
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:36,620
that if this is going to happen, which it looks like it's going to happen, that we're prepared in every which way possible.

1304
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:41,027
Because you can understand if it was three to four days, and then we're moving to it.

1305
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,131
But I don't see many guarantees.

1306
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:44,553
When I heard from friends in Cambridge,

1307
01:49:45,698 --> 01:49:48,999
It's really not being used as a three or four day Passover.

1308
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:52,640
It's really being used for families that are being housed.

1309
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:58,041
And to be honest with you, from what I gather, it's not a conducive environment for families either.

1310
01:49:58,401 --> 01:50:11,624
I mean, granted, it's safer maybe, it's warmer maybe, but I think that if this is the governor's wish, we have to look at a long-term commitment to housing the families.

1311
01:50:14,002 --> 01:50:15,783
You know, we've heard a lot.

1312
01:50:15,803 --> 01:50:18,163
I've talked to a lot of different communities.

1313
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:35,668
And what we don't see a lot of the more affluent communities that have a lot of money that they're asking to move these families, communities that have access, that have space in their schools, that have infrastructure that can support that.

1314
01:50:36,128 --> 01:50:40,170
But it seems like they're really coming into more of the urban rim and urban communities.

1315
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:44,472
over exhausting their infrastructure.

1316
01:50:44,492 --> 01:50:53,377
So I think the mayor and all her department that see that for the fact that this is, you know, whether you're for it or against it, that's not the question.

1317
01:50:53,837 --> 01:50:57,019
The biggest issue right now is making sure that we can handle that.

1318
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,003
we can, Mr Merritt, I know that you've been on the forefront.

1319
01:51:01,043 --> 01:51:09,132
I wanted to make sure I read that on on the record, but then at the same time for our next meeting, we should call for a meeting because we don't know what two weeks will come.

1320
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:16,139
If this is going to happen, at least let's hear it from the state representatives and see where we're going from there.

1321
01:51:17,981 --> 01:51:19,323
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1322
01:51:20,834 --> 01:51:24,977
Just to clarify what I'm hearing, we want to put a resolution on our next regular meeting.

1323
01:51:26,478 --> 01:51:39,126
Inviting all of us state representatives and city administration to give us an understanding of what the process I know the mayor has given us some information, but at the same time, I think if we can have someone from her her department.

1324
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:44,010
and the state delegates that can come in and support us in understanding what's going on.

1325
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:46,832
So we're not going back and forth, and we hear it directly from them.

1326
01:51:47,252 --> 01:51:48,473
Council President, appreciate it.

1327
01:51:48,553 --> 01:51:57,561
And just for the, maybe not for the records, but maybe just so we can get that resolution put together for our meeting on the 23rd, who would we want to invite?

1328
01:51:57,601 --> 01:52:01,204
The state representatives, state senator, and then

1329
01:52:03,894 --> 01:52:06,436
invite to like the representatives from the Healy administration.

1330
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,017
I can't remember what their office is.

1331
01:52:08,517 --> 01:52:10,418
Does anyone remember the name of the office that's working on this?

1332
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,002
Is it EOHLC?

1333
01:52:17,483 --> 01:52:18,023
It's that one?

1334
01:52:19,043 --> 01:52:19,244
Yeah.

1335
01:52:19,624 --> 01:52:21,365
And then there's General Keefe, right?

1336
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:23,106
General Gary Keefe is working.

1337
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:23,206
Yeah.

1338
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:35,568
So the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities and then also a representative of General Keefe or the General if you would like to come.

1339
01:52:38,512 --> 01:52:38,792
Got it.

1340
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:39,513
So we will get that.

1341
01:52:42,321 --> 01:52:42,721
Absolutely.

1342
01:52:42,761 --> 01:52:46,663
Would the residents also in the area be invited to this?

1343
01:52:46,743 --> 01:52:48,184
Yes, it'll be on the agenda.

1344
01:52:48,744 --> 01:52:51,705
It'll be part of the agenda for the city council's regular meeting on the 23rd.

1345
01:52:51,985 --> 01:53:02,290
So just as a FYI, Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's just me not able to work the website correctly, but I couldn't even find the agenda for tonight's meeting because it's bucketed under 2023.

1346
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,531
There is no link for 2024 agendas on the website.

1347
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:13,002
I'll talk to the communications director.

1348
01:53:13,022 --> 01:53:13,723
We don't post it.

1349
01:53:14,924 --> 01:53:18,187
But the agenda postings are a little convoluted.

1350
01:53:18,207 --> 01:53:19,128
They go alphabetically.

1351
01:53:19,168 --> 01:53:21,110
They don't go chronologically.

1352
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:25,734
So you would find this is a January.

1353
01:53:25,774 --> 01:53:32,280
So you'd have to scroll through all the way through April and August and February and get all the way down to January 1st.

1354
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:37,173
Okay, but the 23 link will still get you to the right Google Drive page to get there.

1355
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:38,053
I'll see if they can change that.

1356
01:53:38,073 --> 01:53:43,837
We'll ask them to make a 24 link, and then it also should be linked to the event on the events calendar on the city website.

1357
01:53:43,857 --> 01:53:47,279
If that wasn't there, we'll... I didn't check that.

1358
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:55,785
Yeah, we're working on... I expect that there may be a committee that will have several discussions about us being more engaged with the city website than we currently are.

1359
01:53:57,978 --> 01:54:01,640
So that's fine, and I can help then once you guys settle on that date.

1360
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:06,944
Yeah, it will be Tuesday the 23rd as part of our regular meeting agenda.

1361
01:54:06,964 --> 01:54:15,690
I can't promise the exact time, but I expect that if we do have those representatives or some of them here, we may take it under suspension earlier in the meeting.

1362
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:19,052
And just for clarity, I mean, I'm not opposed to this.

1363
01:54:19,072 --> 01:54:23,695
It's just as a resident literally across the street, my concerns are my family safety.

1364
01:54:24,115 --> 01:54:25,737
That is number one top dog.

1365
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,718
And if there's a plan and

1366
01:54:29,018 --> 01:54:41,503
So I work with government myself and sometimes I find that if you package ideas ahead of time, you can help contribute and shape those things versus waiting for the train to hit you and then backpedal.

1367
01:54:42,384 --> 01:54:52,788
So my hope is that maybe we can get some engagement locally and have some asks that are constructive to then help the state shape their decision.

1368
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:56,449
that's the common word I've heard from the residents.

1369
01:54:56,469 --> 01:55:04,390
I don't think anybody's opposing anything, but I think understanding the process, so there's preparation and understanding to it.

1370
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:05,330
Thank you.

1371
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,011
Great.

1372
01:55:06,251 --> 01:55:06,431
Thank you.

1373
01:55:06,451 --> 01:55:07,371
Anything else, Mr. Merritt?

1374
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:08,471
Wonderful, thank you.

1375
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:08,771
Thank you.

1376
01:55:08,971 --> 01:55:09,711
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

1377
01:55:09,731 --> 01:55:11,252
We'll get that on the agenda for the 23rd.

1378
01:55:11,812 --> 01:55:14,112
Anyone else like to speak under public participation?

1379
01:55:14,812 --> 01:55:18,013
You're welcome to come to the podium and give your name and address for the record, please.

1380
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:20,843
Hi, City Council.

1381
01:55:21,384 --> 01:55:25,085
Mike Brown, 35 Cleveland Street, Medford.

1382
01:55:25,905 --> 01:55:29,526
Been a resident for going on three decades.

1383
01:55:30,367 --> 01:55:32,307
I'm here about the indoor track.

1384
01:55:32,407 --> 01:55:34,848
You know the indoor track at the high school?

1385
01:55:36,389 --> 01:55:45,172
Over the last 10 years, over a decade, been sounding the alarm about one of the biggest health hazards.

1386
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:59,966
in the city of Medford, which has been totally ignored by mayors, by superintendent, by director of athletic, and others.

1387
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:05,028
The alarm has been sound, needs to be addressed.

1388
01:56:06,189 --> 01:56:13,372
I'm here to ask that the indoor track renovation be put on the budget.

1389
01:56:14,682 --> 01:56:41,682
so that my daughter, who's a sophomore, will have the opportunity to not run on a surface that's concrete with rubber poured on it, that has no cushioning, that has athlete's heel injuries, shin splint over the years, and not been addressed.

1390
01:56:44,633 --> 01:56:48,536
We have similar high schools in and around here that we compete against.

1391
01:56:48,576 --> 01:56:58,065
Somerville High School has renovated their, found a budget to renovate their indoor track.

1392
01:56:59,086 --> 01:57:03,289
I know we're in the running to get some funding.

1393
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:06,432
I've been hearing that for decades about a new school.

1394
01:57:07,713 --> 01:57:08,534
Time is at hand.

1395
01:57:09,275 --> 01:57:10,095
We need to do it now.

1396
01:57:12,429 --> 01:57:26,808
What alarms me, befuddles me, is the fact that years ago, Lesley University approached us about using our facility.

1397
01:57:26,848 --> 01:57:28,890
They have no gym in Cambridge.

1398
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,990
I don't know who made the decision.

1399
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:43,134
But somebody made the decision, or individuals made the decision, to install a brand new basketball court.

1400
01:57:43,214 --> 01:57:43,994
Fantastic.

1401
01:57:44,754 --> 01:57:48,235
Beneficial for Medford's basketball team.

1402
01:57:49,415 --> 01:57:54,417
Where is the basketball court located?

1403
01:57:56,937 --> 01:57:58,558
Right in the gym, where the track is.

1404
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:11,375
So if you took time to install the new basketball court, I think at that time, the indoor track should be addressed.

1405
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,196
And it wasn't.

1406
01:58:13,936 --> 01:58:14,996
So questions are asked.

1407
01:58:15,016 --> 01:58:24,540
Has anybody looked or investigated or researched or cared?

1408
01:58:25,549 --> 01:58:31,992
about these kids to want to say, hey, let's do an assessment of the track.

1409
01:58:32,393 --> 01:58:35,654
How much would it cost to renovate the track?

1410
01:58:35,794 --> 01:58:36,635
What can be done?

1411
01:58:38,656 --> 01:58:47,941
Not allowing, we don't care about our kids, not allowing them the opportunity to really, truly enhance their potential.

1412
01:58:48,261 --> 01:58:51,642
We could have an Olympian in our midst.

1413
01:58:53,123 --> 01:58:54,284
We've had a couple.

1414
01:58:55,293 --> 01:59:05,479
Mary Carew, 1932, from Medford High, Los Angeles Olympics, gold medal winner in the 4x1 relay.

1415
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:11,562
She was a designate to collect the winning medal at the podium.

1416
01:59:13,343 --> 01:59:24,330
Arantxa King, world U champion in high school at Medford High in Marrakesh, Morocco, gold medalist in the jump.

1417
01:59:25,845 --> 01:59:30,346
has gone on to represent Bermuda in a couple Olympics.

1418
01:59:30,787 --> 01:59:40,070
Stanford grad, ran at the NCAA, is now a lawyer, graduated from Georgetown Law School.

1419
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:45,351
Randy King, state champion, New England champion.

1420
01:59:46,132 --> 01:59:49,813
You know these three athletes are in the Massachusetts Hall of Fame?

1421
01:59:50,373 --> 01:59:52,514
So if you go to the Reggie Lewis Center,

1422
01:59:53,462 --> 01:59:56,323
the premier high school facility right now.

1423
01:59:57,163 --> 02:00:01,443
And you look at the wall, ones should educate themselves.

1424
02:00:02,084 --> 02:00:03,644
They're in the Massachusetts Hall of Fame.

1425
02:00:03,664 --> 02:00:17,666
Do you know that Arantxa King, right here in Medford, was one of the few athletes ever in Massachusetts to be a two-time winner of the Gatorade Athlete of the Year?

1426
02:00:19,167 --> 02:00:21,087
Where's Arantxa King's picture?

1427
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:24,772
Where's Randy King's picture?

1428
02:00:25,613 --> 02:00:26,593
Where's Mary Carew?

1429
02:00:26,994 --> 02:00:28,555
These kids don't know that.

1430
02:00:28,635 --> 02:00:32,158
That should be on the wall opposite the Hall of Fame.

1431
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:34,700
So the alarm's been sounding.

1432
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,781
I'm just giving you a little bit here.

1433
02:00:37,462 --> 02:00:39,644
I've spoken to a ton load of people.

1434
02:00:40,845 --> 02:00:42,046
I've written letters.

1435
02:00:42,066 --> 02:00:44,548
I care about the kids.

1436
02:00:45,769 --> 02:00:48,691
So if it's a health hazard, address it.

1437
02:00:50,192 --> 02:00:50,832
Find the funds.

1438
02:00:52,093 --> 02:00:56,515
Do you know that we have a few foundations here that we can reach out to?

1439
02:00:56,535 --> 02:01:01,237
These are Medford High School grads, Bill Cummings, Medford High School grad.

1440
02:01:04,498 --> 02:01:09,240
Gave some money with his wife at the Science Center for Tufts.

1441
02:01:10,521 --> 02:01:12,422
We can reach out to them.

1442
02:01:12,442 --> 02:01:20,465
I actually spoke with the person that runs that program, a name Michael Bloomberg.

1443
02:01:21,283 --> 02:01:23,604
Medford grad, he has a foundation.

1444
02:01:24,644 --> 02:01:25,725
It's all public knowledge.

1445
02:01:26,525 --> 02:01:27,265
You know what it takes?

1446
02:01:27,965 --> 02:01:34,908
A phone call from somebody, reaching out to them to say, hey, we need some help.

1447
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:38,469
And then we have our good old friends at Tufts University.

1448
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:41,651
New president came in in July.

1449
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:43,691
Reach out.

1450
02:01:43,811 --> 02:01:46,712
His number is right on the website.

1451
02:01:49,932 --> 02:01:58,418
If you need fundraisers, grassroots fundraisers, and Mr. George here, you know, I've spoken to you for years.

1452
02:01:58,498 --> 02:02:05,702
My children went to the Somerville, because Medford didn't have one, track field summer camp.

1453
02:02:08,464 --> 02:02:09,185
We gotta do better.

1454
02:02:10,125 --> 02:02:11,446
We really have to do better.

1455
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:13,748
This is, to me, this is asinine.

1456
02:02:14,248 --> 02:02:14,909
This is a joke.

1457
02:02:15,731 --> 02:02:16,992
that you have the health hazard.

1458
02:02:17,012 --> 02:02:20,694
And some people think that high schools don't have indoor tracks.

1459
02:02:21,594 --> 02:02:25,416
A lot of high schools have their tracks at a middle school.

1460
02:02:26,096 --> 02:02:30,439
For instance, Malden, their indoor track is at their middle school.

1461
02:02:31,759 --> 02:02:33,220
And you go around the state.

1462
02:02:33,941 --> 02:02:36,542
And I've been involved in track and field for years.

1463
02:02:37,563 --> 02:02:38,323
We gotta do better.

1464
02:02:38,343 --> 02:02:40,044
We gotta give the kids a chance.

1465
02:02:41,304 --> 02:02:43,866
And over the years, we'll fix the swimming pool,

1466
02:02:45,523 --> 02:02:51,888
We've had to upgrade the science section because of regulations up to standards.

1467
02:02:53,889 --> 02:02:57,652
Let's put the indoor track on the next list.

1468
02:02:58,953 --> 02:02:59,774
Put it in the budget.

1469
02:03:01,215 --> 02:03:08,560
If you need grassroots support, sound the alarm and ask people to fund it.

1470
02:03:11,842 --> 02:03:14,905
I got in touch with the FJ Roberts,

1471
02:03:16,673 --> 02:03:19,534
I'm not a director of athletics, make a phone call.

1472
02:03:20,795 --> 02:03:26,418
Director of athletics at another school gave me the information, because they're entertaining.

1473
02:03:27,518 --> 02:03:28,679
So what can be done?

1474
02:03:29,019 --> 02:03:29,980
Do you have to dig it up?

1475
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,280
No.

1476
02:03:32,761 --> 02:03:41,485
You put something called the Mondo Surface, Italian company, popular in track and field circles on top

1477
02:03:45,788 --> 02:03:48,429
You know how long it takes to get it done?

1478
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:50,730
Three weeks.

1479
02:03:52,691 --> 02:04:02,414
So you put the Mondo surface on top of this concrete with rubber, and you have it.

1480
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:13,138
Lowell High School, Newton South, Somerville High, old school schools that have done it.

1481
02:04:15,447 --> 02:04:16,610
And I shut up.

1482
02:04:19,277 --> 02:04:19,678
Thank you.

1483
02:04:21,683 --> 02:04:22,705
Thank you for sharing the information.

1484
02:04:24,642 --> 02:04:26,223
I think we'd all appreciate that.

1485
02:04:26,243 --> 02:04:35,187
I don't know if Councilor Stroud has already received some of the research, and we could certainly look into this on our own, and I'll defer to other Councillors in a minute.

1486
02:04:35,207 --> 02:04:47,653
In terms of the budget and the control of the facilities, this Council doesn't have the power to put anything in the budget, only the Mayor does, and then the control of the facilities does sit with the Director of Athletics, delegated by the Superintendent.

1487
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:52,877
but we certainly can ask these same questions and try to push for action.

1488
02:04:53,918 --> 02:04:57,221
And I will go to my fellow Councillors who may have other comments.

1489
02:04:58,162 --> 02:05:00,224
Councillor Scarpelli, then Councillor Lemming.

1490
02:05:00,864 --> 02:05:02,626
I appreciate you coming up.

1491
02:05:02,706 --> 02:05:07,150
I think that you've been the lone wolf for many years.

1492
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:14,076
We've had many discussions about this, and even in Somerville, I know that this is something that

1493
02:05:15,970 --> 02:05:22,013
I truly thought of the process that that was done, that the track was a new track.

1494
02:05:25,155 --> 02:05:33,379
My daughter played basketball, so it looked like the surface was done, but I didn't realize it was the same type of issues that we've had in the past.

1495
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:41,704
I know that the big call right now is getting the approval to be on the list now for the new high school.

1496
02:05:44,845 --> 02:05:53,109
I just don't, there might, you know, if there's something that you brought up an alarming situation when you talk about safety, it's something that you have to look at.

1497
02:05:53,129 --> 02:06:03,633
I mean, it's, when even, this is the catch 22 that you came to our forum because you can speak in our forum.

1498
02:06:04,233 --> 02:06:05,054
And I think that,

1499
02:06:05,774 --> 02:06:06,975
We appreciate you doing that.

1500
02:06:07,135 --> 02:06:12,497
I think there's got to be, unfortunately, the way that's come up, we can't deliberate or send anything out.

1501
02:06:12,557 --> 02:06:16,979
But I think this is again, that this is something that I personally make a call tomorrow.

1502
02:06:17,899 --> 02:06:20,801
Brown, I'll talk, I'll talk to the superintendent tomorrow.

1503
02:06:21,161 --> 02:06:22,621
I'll try to make a phone call tomorrow.

1504
02:06:24,392 --> 02:06:28,693
and then find a way to maybe put it on their agenda on the school side.

1505
02:06:28,733 --> 02:06:47,738
Because if there is something that is something we have to look at for next year and Medford and the track really isn't safe, then we have to look at alternative sites to support the student athletes that maybe you look at a Reggie Lewis Center to book practice space and time.

1506
02:06:49,338 --> 02:06:51,280
you know, until you figure out a plan.

1507
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,883
So I think that that's something that we need to get more information from.

1508
02:06:55,923 --> 02:06:56,724
I think I do.

1509
02:06:56,744 --> 02:06:58,705
I'm going to call the superintendent tomorrow.

1510
02:06:58,966 --> 02:07:04,170
I'll call the athletic director tomorrow and get some better understanding of what their process is and what's happening.

1511
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:13,537
So maybe we can help move you along and give you some insight to help you with this, because it pains me to see you back up here for the same situations over and over again.

1512
02:07:15,532 --> 02:07:26,844
sad because I think with the loss of Mr. Maskell, I think he was probably the last advocate for track and field, really, true advocate of track and field at Medford High.

1513
02:07:28,854 --> 02:07:31,495
you know, whatever I can do, I'll lend my support.

1514
02:07:31,535 --> 02:07:38,098
But I know that Somerville does have a new floor, but they're having their own issues as well.

1515
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:44,161
So they have to close it at the end of the school year because of the way that it was put down.

1516
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:52,164
So throughout the summer, they have to close it to put in industrial humidifiers in there so it doesn't pop up.

1517
02:07:52,224 --> 02:07:53,885
So there's issues everywhere.

1518
02:07:54,885 --> 02:07:55,586
But I think that

1519
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:58,652
You know, for this situation, you brought up safety.

1520
02:07:58,772 --> 02:08:01,554
For me, that's something that can't be overlooked.

1521
02:08:01,754 --> 02:08:05,236
So for one person, I'll look at how's the president.

1522
02:08:05,336 --> 02:08:06,576
I'll reach out to the superintendent.

1523
02:08:07,016 --> 02:08:15,001
And if there's something I'll request for her to do, if she can, is put it on the next agenda so you can go and speak to the authorities that need to push that along.

1524
02:08:15,501 --> 02:08:16,922
And that's the school department.

1525
02:08:17,422 --> 02:08:24,706
And if it's something that we need assistance from this body that can ask the mayor for some funding if there is,

1526
02:08:25,686 --> 02:08:41,374
that has to support our kids that are in a situation like that, because it'd be interesting to see what the athletic trainer has for documentation and data that says how many kids have been ACLs, MCLs, you know, different injuries that happen on different type of surfaces.

1527
02:08:42,248 --> 02:08:45,889
Well, with that, I don't think a lot of people are reporting it.

1528
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:50,911
So that's one thing, because that's what the athletic director said over the years.

1529
02:08:51,592 --> 02:08:54,052
That's the thing, data drives.

1530
02:08:54,113 --> 02:08:55,713
Right, that comes with that.

1531
02:08:55,773 --> 02:08:57,194
But you mentioned about Reggie Lewis.

1532
02:08:57,274 --> 02:09:02,175
So the school is actually, the league is actually running out of Reggie Lewis.

1533
02:09:06,357 --> 02:09:09,982
So that's a good thing, but they still have to practice on the surface.

1534
02:09:10,262 --> 02:09:20,235
And some people have the notion that they don't practice indoors, they run outside in the wintertime, which is just ridiculous.

1535
02:09:22,057 --> 02:09:24,139
So I just wanted to point that out.

1536
02:09:24,259 --> 02:09:28,503
But I think and I appreciate your effort over the years.

1537
02:09:28,723 --> 02:09:29,764
This is over a decade.

1538
02:09:29,884 --> 02:09:32,607
I know my oldest daughter ran over a decade.

1539
02:09:32,627 --> 02:09:34,528
She's graduated from college this year.

1540
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:36,350
So that's how long this is.

1541
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:39,533
And I said I was going to shut my mouth and not say anything.

1542
02:09:39,573 --> 02:09:40,834
But yeah.

1543
02:09:42,779 --> 02:09:46,463
It's so appreciate it's the first time I've ever been here.

1544
02:09:47,003 --> 02:10:02,277
I've been in meetings with the mayor over the year regarding incidents regarding car park, you don't you don't want to hear that the council doesn't want to hear that with car park and then with other situations with me personally.

1545
02:10:02,297 --> 02:10:04,439
Yeah, that I have to speak with.

1546
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,071
the former Chief Sacco?

1547
02:10:07,271 --> 02:10:19,020
Yeah, well, like I said, I think that we're looking at, you know, a few years back, a grassroot organization came to me and said, would you be willing to help in a little project called the Field of Dreams?

1548
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:22,742
And they said, no, there's no way you want to put turf fields behind Bedford High School.

1549
02:10:23,523 --> 02:10:26,505
And that's all it needs sometimes, just discussion.

1550
02:10:27,025 --> 02:10:30,188
And like you said, there are avenues out there that we can tap into if that's the case.

1551
02:10:31,288 --> 02:10:32,449
I appreciate you coming out.

1552
02:10:33,310 --> 02:10:35,612
I think the right now it's the first thing you had.

1553
02:10:35,692 --> 02:10:39,156
We have to do tonight is understand that there's an issue so we can move forward on that.

1554
02:10:39,216 --> 02:10:39,716
So thank you.

1555
02:10:39,976 --> 02:10:41,558
I'm going to go to council.

1556
02:10:41,678 --> 02:10:47,063
I mean, first off, I'd like to thank you for coming out here tonight and.

1557
02:10:48,098 --> 02:10:49,699
presenting the case.

1558
02:10:49,799 --> 02:10:51,719
Just a few resources I'd like to point out.

1559
02:10:51,739 --> 02:10:56,761
So I served on the Community Preservation Committee, which was actually just meeting across the hall from us.

1560
02:10:57,261 --> 02:11:07,385
They allocated about $206,000 to repair the Tufts basketball court, which should give kind of an order of magnitude for how much a project like this would cost.

1561
02:11:07,445 --> 02:11:12,686
They also allocated part of the funding for the new McGlynn Playground.

1562
02:11:17,728 --> 02:11:38,515
project that just broke ground I believe a few days ago and that was being pushed both by one of the assistant superintendents of the school as well as a community member with no official involvement but who just really wanted to push that project through so that so I think that an avenue

1563
02:11:39,936 --> 02:12:00,771
really this body, we have the power to approve funding once a project comes forward, and there is a construction company, sufficient planning that has been made for that, but we don't really have the power to just point a magic wand and say that this will be done.

1564
02:12:00,991 --> 02:12:06,695
So I also spoke this morning with one of the community

1565
02:12:08,256 --> 02:12:11,837
development block grant manager, which is another similar pool of funding.

1566
02:12:12,337 --> 02:12:20,780
And she was actually just asking about trying to flag down more projects exactly like the one you were just talking about right now.

1567
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:30,543
So I would be pleased to meet up with you afterwards or just email you later and just give you the contact information for some of these folks.

1568
02:12:30,563 --> 02:12:32,804
Because I think the money is there.

1569
02:12:32,824 --> 02:12:35,585
With these sorts of projects, there's always sort of like weird

1570
02:12:36,005 --> 02:12:38,045
kind of like eligibility issues.

1571
02:12:38,125 --> 02:12:44,687
So like maybe the, you know, if it's like an indoor track, it's only used by students, not the general public, there could be like something going on there.

1572
02:12:44,727 --> 02:12:53,848
But generally speaking, this is like for these kind of projects where they take like, you know, a couple hundred thousand dollars and they could be done in like a short enough timeframe.

1573
02:12:53,908 --> 02:12:56,069
I think that there's definitely money sitting there for this.

1574
02:12:56,089 --> 02:13:02,630
It's just a matter of getting a proposal into the right committees, advocating for them can't be done in three weeks is probably like,

1575
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:07,372
a year-long timeline just because of the clock that these sort of things are on.

1576
02:13:07,432 --> 02:13:14,196
But yes, there are options that you have if you are really interested in repaving the inward track.

1577
02:13:14,216 --> 02:13:15,777
So thank you for bringing it to our attention.

1578
02:13:16,537 --> 02:13:17,337
Thank you, Councillor Laming.

1579
02:13:17,357 --> 02:13:18,158
Councillor Callahan.

1580
02:13:18,858 --> 02:13:19,118
Thank you.

1581
02:13:20,814 --> 02:13:26,676
Mr. Brown, I want to commend you for being a model resident of Medford because I am so impressed.

1582
02:13:26,696 --> 02:13:36,160
I mean, I'm pained to hear that you have been trying to get this done for 10 years, but I am so impressed that you, you know, you're not just complaining about something.

1583
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,461
You are talking deeply about the issue.

1584
02:13:38,841 --> 02:13:40,322
You have looked into how it could be funded.

1585
02:13:40,562 --> 02:13:42,804
You have looked into the proper surface that needs to be done.

1586
02:13:42,844 --> 02:13:44,425
You have looked into what other cities have done.

1587
02:13:44,725 --> 02:13:47,986
You have truly looked at what the solutions should be.

1588
02:13:49,227 --> 02:13:51,468
And I am also very happy to help.

1589
02:13:51,668 --> 02:13:58,192
So I will, you know, in conjunction with Councilor Scarbelli and Councilor Mulroney.

1590
02:13:59,193 --> 02:13:59,753
There you go.

1591
02:13:59,793 --> 02:14:02,054
Like, I'm happy to help in any way I can.

1592
02:14:02,134 --> 02:14:05,156
And I do, I know this is not a simple

1593
02:14:05,894 --> 02:14:06,254
issue.

1594
02:14:06,594 --> 02:14:21,503
But I do hope that Medford can become a city that can respond to people like you, to people who come to us with well-thought-out proposals that they have already dug into the solutions for and already done a lot of that work.

1595
02:14:21,523 --> 02:14:26,186
Because the point that that has happened, we really need to be able to say yes to our residents.

1596
02:14:26,446 --> 02:14:42,237
That is how we engage people in the political process when someone, I mean it's a miracle that you're still here 10 years later, because normally when people come and they propose these well thought out solutions, and they're told no or they simply get nothing, they will go away they never come back.

1597
02:14:45,532 --> 02:14:59,083
the best thing our city can do to take these amazing solutions that are provided by people who genuinely care about a specific issue and to find ways to incorporate those into a solution that we can make happen.

1598
02:14:59,103 --> 02:15:06,348
So I'm really hoping that we can do it, not just for your issue, but more broadly for folks in Medford who want to engage in the political process in this way.

1599
02:15:06,428 --> 02:15:07,029
Thank you so much.

1600
02:15:08,166 --> 02:15:09,507
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1601
02:15:10,027 --> 02:15:10,728
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

1602
02:15:10,788 --> 02:15:22,817
And I think we will find between the research that you've done and the advocacy that you've done and some of the resources that we've had here, I'm hoping some sort of meeting or collaboration or effort to at least advance the ball in some direction.

1603
02:15:23,277 --> 02:15:31,143
So and if necessary, if anyone after your discussions wants to put something on for a future agenda for official action as well.

1604
02:15:31,263 --> 02:15:34,746
But I think even just the meeting of the minds here and the discussions so far,

1605
02:15:35,701 --> 02:15:37,542
could lead to some progress.

1606
02:15:37,582 --> 02:15:39,263
So thank you to my fellow councillors.

1607
02:15:39,303 --> 02:15:41,264
Thank you for coming tonight in public participation.

1608
02:15:41,284 --> 02:15:47,228
Is there anyone else on Zoom or in the chamber who would like to participate in public participation?

1609
02:15:54,472 --> 02:15:57,214
Seeing none, public participation is concluded.

1610
02:15:57,694 --> 02:15:59,395
Council Vice President Collins.

1611
02:16:00,215 --> 02:16:01,016
Thank you, President Behrs.

1612
02:16:01,096 --> 02:16:02,917
A motion to take from the table papers

1613
02:16:03,724 --> 02:16:09,430
23463 and 22605, both for a third reading.

1614
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:23,563
On the motion of Councillor Collins to take the papers for 224—23-463, the City Water System Bond Order, and 22-605, the Solid Waste Ordinance, off the table, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1615
02:16:24,083 --> 02:16:24,684
All those in favour?

1616
02:16:24,884 --> 02:16:25,044
Aye.

1617
02:16:25,865 --> 02:16:26,445
Opposed?

1618
02:16:26,646 --> 02:16:28,367
Motion passes.

1619
02:16:28,387 --> 02:16:30,608
22-463 City Water System Bond Order.

1620
02:16:30,688 --> 02:16:37,032
This was in City Council December 12, 2023, and was approved for first reading on December 12, 2023.

1621
02:16:37,593 --> 02:16:46,659
It was advertised for second reading in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal on December 21, 2023, and is eligible for third reading tonight, January 9, 2024.

1622
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:52,903
Since we have come from a prior council to a new council, I will just add this is a bond order for

1623
02:16:53,703 --> 02:17:08,409
the Water and Sewer Department to take out, I believe it's through the interest-free MWRA loan program bonding funds to improve our water and sewer infrastructure, which from some of our discussions, I know folks know is not in the best of conditions.

1624
02:17:08,769 --> 02:17:10,710
So that is what that is.

1625
02:17:10,730 --> 02:17:14,031
That's all me.

1626
02:17:15,272 --> 02:17:20,194
On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for third reading, seconded by

1627
02:17:21,761 --> 02:17:25,344
seconded by, I saw Emily, I saw Councilor Lozaro's hand.

1628
02:17:25,364 --> 02:17:27,386
So we'll go with Councilor Lozaro.

1629
02:17:28,787 --> 02:17:30,048
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1630
02:17:43,419 --> 02:17:44,059
Councilor Callahan.

1631
02:17:46,161 --> 02:17:47,082
Vice President Collins.

1632
02:17:47,322 --> 02:17:47,482
Yes.

1633
02:17:47,843 --> 02:17:48,543
Councilor Lozaro.

1634
02:17:48,803 --> 02:17:49,004
Yes.

1635
02:17:49,864 --> 02:17:50,385
Councilor Lemming.

1636
02:17:51,445 --> 02:17:52,089
Councilor Scarpelli.

1637
02:17:52,129 --> 02:17:52,391
Yes.

1638
02:17:52,954 --> 02:17:54,503
Councilor saying yes, President bears.

1639
02:17:55,543 --> 02:17:58,544
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1640
02:17:58,704 --> 02:18:02,845
The ordinance is approved for third, or the bond order is approved for third reading.

1641
02:18:02,865 --> 02:18:05,946
22-605, the solid waste ordinance.

1642
02:18:06,486 --> 02:18:08,106
We've had several committee meetings on it.

1643
02:18:08,507 --> 02:18:14,248
The final draft appeared in city council December 12th, 2023, and was approved for first reading on the same date.

1644
02:18:14,928 --> 02:18:22,230
It was advertised for second reading on December 28th, 2023 in the Medford Transcript and Summerville Journal, and it's eligible for third reading this evening.

1645
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:24,611
Again, for our fellow councilors, this is

1646
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:26,693
an update to the solid waste ordinance.

1647
02:18:26,713 --> 02:18:33,560
I believe the updated draft was circulated to members of the body at the request of Councillor, Vice President Collins.

1648
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:41,047
And if there's anything you want to say on this one, I know you worked on this pretty hard for several months.

1649
02:18:43,285 --> 02:18:44,086
Thank you, President Behrs.

1650
02:18:44,106 --> 02:18:47,970
Just by way of quick recap for the new counselors in the room.

1651
02:18:48,951 --> 02:18:55,559
Again, this is an update to the existing Chapter 70, which governs solid waste in Medford, how we deal with it.

1652
02:18:56,960 --> 02:19:02,406
The updates align our current ordinance with best practices promulgated by MassDEP.

1653
02:19:04,148 --> 02:19:23,602
We worked closely with the Planning Development Sustainability Office and the DPW Commissioner to make sure that this would align with what we are looking to do to hold the waste haulers in our community more accountable to our goals for having this be a smooth and efficient process for residents and businesses, as well as getting us closer to our waste reduction goals.

1654
02:19:25,364 --> 02:19:26,665
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

1655
02:19:27,365 --> 02:19:30,928
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve her third reading,

1656
02:19:32,208 --> 02:19:33,608
seconded by Councillor Seng.

1657
02:19:33,989 --> 02:19:35,049
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1658
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:40,391
Councillor Callaghan.

1659
02:19:40,691 --> 02:19:40,851
Yes.

1660
02:19:41,911 --> 02:19:42,831
Vice President Collins.

1661
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:43,451
Yes.

1662
02:19:44,052 --> 02:19:44,792
Councillor Lazzaro.

1663
02:19:45,152 --> 02:19:45,352
Yes.

1664
02:19:45,772 --> 02:19:46,312
Councillor Lemming.

1665
02:19:46,612 --> 02:19:46,792
Yes.

1666
02:19:47,493 --> 02:19:48,253
Councillor Scarpelli.

1667
02:19:48,453 --> 02:19:48,673
Yes.

1668
02:19:49,573 --> 02:19:50,073
Councillor Seng.

1669
02:19:50,354 --> 02:19:50,514
Yes.

1670
02:19:50,814 --> 02:19:51,374
President Bexar.

1671
02:19:51,714 --> 02:19:51,954
Yes.

1672
02:19:52,114 --> 02:19:53,535
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1673
02:19:54,015 --> 02:19:56,595
The motion passes and the ordinance is approved for third reading.

1674
02:19:57,116 --> 02:19:58,076
It is ordained.

1675
02:20:01,121 --> 02:20:04,104
Other than that, that concludes the agenda.

1676
02:20:04,144 --> 02:20:06,707
Other than reports due, is there a motion on the floor?

1677
02:20:07,207 --> 02:20:07,968
Motion to adjourn.

1678
02:20:08,869 --> 02:20:10,030
Motion to adjourn.

1679
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:13,153
Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1680
02:20:13,954 --> 02:20:14,835
All those in favour?

1681
02:20:14,855 --> 02:20:15,255
Aye.

1682
02:20:15,495 --> 02:20:16,056
Opposed?

1683
02:20:16,697 --> 02:20:18,679
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
