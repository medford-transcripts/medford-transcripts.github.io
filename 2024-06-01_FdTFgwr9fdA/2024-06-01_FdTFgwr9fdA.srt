158
00:03:49,443 --> 00:04:02,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I do hope that the spirit of congeniality can continue, because I think it is good for all of us to be able to disagree agreeably and enjoy each other's company, even when we're not on the same side of issues.

159
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:04,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

160
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:10,290
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an honor to serve the people of Medford, and I thank them for placing their trust in me for a third term on the council.

161
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:17,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very thankful to my colleagues for your support in making me president-elect last month and electing me as council president tonight for the year 2024.

162
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: All of you and residents may have seen that our agenda looks a little bit different tonight.

163
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,281
[SPEAKER_06]: A bit more modern, I dare say.

164
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And modernization is going to be a theme of the City Council this term, as we adopt some new technologies and new approaches to accomplish even more than we already have during my first two terms on the Council.

165
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:59,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank the entire team in the City Clerk's office, including City Clerk Adam Hurtubise, Assistant City Clerk Sylvia DiPlacido, Principal Clerk Janice DePace for their hard work supporting the Council, and especially Head Clerk Annie Kelly, who worked diligently alongside Clerk Hurtubise and me to get CivicClerk software online and off the ground in time to put together the agenda for this meeting.

166
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:18,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Medford Community Media Director Kevin Harrington and his team for installing these new monitors, which will help improve hybrid meeting accessibility, and for the work that we're going to do over the next few months to upgrade the audio system in the chambers, bring council meetings to YouTube live streaming, and hopefully even more.

167
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three principles that I intend to follow as I guide this council.

168
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Collaboration, planning, and trust.

169
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:34,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that if we ground our work in those principles, we'll be able to accomplish big things and deliver the results that residents want to see from their local government.

170
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:42,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Later tonight, I'll present two items that will help organize us towards those principles, a new committee structure, and a governing agenda framework for our 2024-2025 term.

171
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:51,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I know these will help the council collaborate better, plan better, and build trust across city government and with residents.

172
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing can get done in city government without collaboration.

173
00:05:55,754 --> 00:06:09,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm incredibly proud of the work this council did last term to work together in lockstep to advance shared goals and to pass several major ordinances, including the zoning recodification that will serve as the foundation for our zoning reform project this term.

174
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,619
[SPEAKER_06]: But collaboration within the council is not enough.

175
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:21,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We've made some progress on the budget ordinance and setting up the financial task force agreed to in the budget agreement that President Morell and I reached with the mayor last June.

176
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:29,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to working with Vice President-elect Collins to establish strong collaboration with the mayor and her administration.

177
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: This council has and will continue to reach out in good faith on every initiative and invite the collaborative approach we know will be needed to succeed and deliver results for Medford.

178
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Collaboration is a first step, but in order to get anything done, we need a plan.

179
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been focused on better planning since my first day in office.

180
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:57,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I was glad to assist in the development of our city's first comprehensive plan, as well as supporting the implementation of the housing production plan, climate plan, and more.

181
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:16,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Last May, I proposed the Medford Better Future Budget Plan to put forward immediate targeted changes to our city charter and our city ordinances to improve our budget process and get on the road to planning to fund the solutions to the big challenges our community faces.

182
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:24,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that some of that plan has been incorporated into the budget ordinance discussions that we've had and initial meetings to set up the financial task force.

183
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:37,463
[SPEAKER_06]: The governing agenda framework and committee structure that I will present later is another element of planning that will help improve the council's work product process and make all of our efforts more transparent to residents and the public.

184
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, getting big things done comes down to trust.

185
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:50,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust among elected officials, trust among key public and private stakeholders, and the trust of residents and the public in what their city government is doing.

186
00:07:50,967 --> 00:08:17,849
[SPEAKER_06]: We have major projects ahead, an updated budget process, passing a near $200 million general fund budget this year and next year, recommendations of the financial task force around potential Proposition 2.5 debt exclusions or overrides, comprehensive citywide zoning reform that implements several of our major plans, and the drafting of a new city charter to propose to the mayor and the state legislature based on the work of the Charter Study Committee.

187
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,752
[SPEAKER_06]: To accomplish those huge tasks, we need the trust of the public.

188
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:34,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I commit to lead this council in the spirit of openness and transparency, to provide a clear plan for our work to the public, and to tell the public the truth to the fullest extent possible, even when the truth is hard to hear.

189
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:42,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again for your trust in electing me as council president, and I'll work to continue earning the trust of all of you and the public this term.

190
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:43,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

191
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll turn it back over to the clerk.

192
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: and I will sign a document first.

193
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,357
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all yours.

194
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:06,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

195
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:14,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I was going to preside for seven minutes.

196
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already presided for 10 minutes.

197
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:25,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will move to item 24-002, election of a city council vice president for 2024.

198
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:30,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

199
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I would nominate Councilor Collins for vice president.

200
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,190
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears has nominated Councilor Collins for vice president.

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

202
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:42,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng has seconded.

203
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:43,477
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

204
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I rescind my nomination.

205
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:01,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I rescind, I withdraw my nomination and I leave the floor to my fellow councilor.

206
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not mean, I meant that in jest.

207
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:08,651
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not gonna preside over a constitutional crisis.

208
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,293
[SPEAKER_13]: I fully meant that in jest.

209
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I nominate Kit Collins for VP.

210
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I second it.

211
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:18,595

00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:27,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any further nominations?

215
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to close nominations?

216
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng has moved to close nominations.

262
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:31,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the role of vice president as being the person who

263
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:37,557
[SPEAKER_10]: seeks to facilitate the smooth and effective work of this council.

264
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:49,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a body that strives to be professional and effective, proactive, and prolific at doing our duty, which is to pass policies that make life better in Medford.

265
00:13:49,946 --> 00:14:00,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to working with President Bears to set the conditions to make us all individually and collectively do that work as effectively as possible.

266
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:07,047
[SPEAKER_10]: and to have a term together that we can feel proud of and be accountable to the people that put us in these chairs.

00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:35,362
[SPEAKER_06]: In all honesty, Larry's basically where I go if I'm looking for exactly what the heart of public opinion is.

318
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,707

[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

329
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:24,217

338
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,064

387
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

388
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad to add a few resolutions and for passing some pretty important people here in the city of Method.

389
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:41,900
[SPEAKER_04]: James Jack McDevitt was an amazing person, an amazing teacher, and someone who really loved the law and loved the city of Method.

390
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. McDevitt,

391
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:53,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember in high school, Mr. McDevitt started, I believe it was the Method Co-op Bank inside Medford High School.

392
00:21:54,356 --> 00:22:02,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a work program where we actually ran a bank out of the school that was run by students at Medford High School.

393
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was

394
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so involved in making sure that he taught the most important classes, and his view were law.

395
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was, I believe, a Triple Eagle.

396
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,331
[SPEAKER_04]: He loved his BC.

397
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the honor of being at his wake tonight, and he would be laid to rest with his BC hat right next to him.

398
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:41,219
[SPEAKER_04]: and he leaves behind, he joins his wife in heaven, but he leaves three great sons and Michael, Mark, and Chris to leave and share his legacy.

399
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:48,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So may you rest in peace and we bless him and wish the family well, Mr. President.

400
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,562

402
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, actually, all those in favor.

403
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:05,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we do all three?

404
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

405
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:09,469
[SPEAKER_06]: 24-013, offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send the family of Judith Granara our deepest condolences on her recent passing.

407
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

408
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

409
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Judith Granara,

410
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:29,975
[SPEAKER_04]: was a very special person here in Medford, a lifelong resident here in Medford, a former school teacher in the Method Public Schools.

411
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:40,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Her husband, John, has done so much for our city, and the Granara family has given so much to the city of Method, and her passing will daily be missed.

412
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:47,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that she leaves her son, John Jr., and her daughter, Kelly, and I wish their family

413
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:52,744
[SPEAKER_04]: and we pray for their family.

414
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

415
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:59,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

416
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,008
[SPEAKER_06]: 24-014 offered under suspension by Councilor Scarpelli.

00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:09,310

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

419
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

420
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Ernie's a little more personal.

421
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Ernie Artelino passed away

422
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,364
[SPEAKER_04]: After a brief illness, Ernie was a Mustang Hall of Famer.

423
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:40,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Ernie wasn't the biggest person in stature, but he went off to University of Miami, played football and baseball for the Hurricanes, and came back and started a teaching and coaching career that's helped so many young men and women achieve their dreams.

424
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:58,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the privilege of coaching with Ernie, and I learned as a young coach the importance of making sure you never, ever, ever treat a female athlete as a nefarious ex.

425
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:04,674
[SPEAKER_04]: He made sure that we elevated every single athlete that he coached.

426
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And he used to tell me, he says, coach,

427
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:13,976
[SPEAKER_04]: look at your athletes, not your female and male athletes, look at your athletes and treat them accordingly.

428
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:15,477
[SPEAKER_04]: They're no different.

429
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:19,638
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, he used to say they were stronger, our female athletes.

430
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was a different time back then.

431
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:34,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And the legacy that he's left behind, I remember walking through his wake and former athletes, former basketball players, and some of the girls were there.

432
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And to that evening,

433
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:45,689
[SPEAKER_04]: they would visit Ernie in the hospital and they would tell me the stories that Ernie still, the impacts that Ernie made in their lives.

434
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And he really understood what we're fighting for today and equality for gender.

435
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:56,218
[SPEAKER_04]: He was, he saw something that most coaches didn't back then.

436
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I, I attribute my successes as a coach because I was around Ernie Adelino.

437
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:04,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

438
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:07,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Ernie had his own language.

439
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,781
[SPEAKER_04]: When he wanted to talk bad about someone, he made up a language.

440
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't that he was talking bad about someone, it's because he forgot their names.

441
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd call him, hey, Frappeterra.

442
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:19,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't know, we said, what is he saying when I first started coaching?

443
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,070
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, George, Ernie forgets his keys and people's names.

444
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And because he had so many kids now, he taught it out to Catholic for many, many years.

445
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:31,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think his biggest joy is that he leaves his daughter, Diane and Laurie,

446
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:34,919
[SPEAKER_04]: his pride, Ernie Jr.

447
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,340
[SPEAKER_04]: and his daughter, Elena.

448
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:49,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wish the family the best because we talk, I hate to be the one that keeps saying this, but when we lose legends, it really, it really affects our community.

449
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ernie was a true legend.

450
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:57,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are three people that played a big part in the framework of what Medford is today.

451
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:58,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And

452
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:07,401
[SPEAKER_04]: There are three people that will surely be missed, so I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak and wish their families the best.

453
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

454
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:15,743
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to join the three papers and approve, all those in favour?

455
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:16,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

456
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:17,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

457
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

458
00:27:19,064 --> 00:27:20,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Would everyone please rise for a moment of silence.

459
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:48,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion over to regular business Councilor Scott by seconded by Councilor vice president Collins, I'm gonna have trouble with that one.

460
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:49,411

00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:26,034

[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, I would be happy to hear from the petitioner if they are on Zoom.

[SPEAKER_12]: I'm counsel for Huali Enterprises Inc.

484
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:49,969
[SPEAKER_12]: As you indicated earlier, we did have a CV license approved earlier for the operation of Manthings Restaurant by my client as a transfer of ownership.

485
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:57,151
[SPEAKER_12]: At that time, the petition, the CV license was approved for the standard operating hours to end around 11 o'clock.

486
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing.

00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:28,055
[SPEAKER_14]: start of your audio visual troubles.

489
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:29,116
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's inevitable.

490
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Lee, could you try to give us a test?

491
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:48,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

492
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:49,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you, can anybody hear me?

493
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:50,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

494
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,769
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hear you.

495
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:51,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

496
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:54,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

497
00:30:54,808 --> 00:31:00,771
[SPEAKER_12]: I also have to apologize because I had a late hearing in the probate court and I'm actually on the road.

498
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,791
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm actually going through my phone.

499
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,672
[SPEAKER_12]: So forgive me for if there's any cutouts anywhere.

500
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:12,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, please, if you could just repeat what you said just a moment ago, so everyone can hear and then we can move ahead.

501
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:13,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

502
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,318
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Chong Lee.

503
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:21,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm counsel for Huali Enterprises Inc, operating as a mailings restaurant at 434 A Salem Street.

504
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:30,539
[SPEAKER_12]: As you indicated, Mr. Chairman, earlier, the CV license for the current mailings restaurant for my client was approved not too long ago.

505
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:34,902
[SPEAKER_12]: but for the standard operating hours to the end at 11 o'clock.

506
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:48,390
[SPEAKER_12]: The present petition in front of the licensing board is to extend the operating hours from the standard to the extended hours as indicated by the license as stated earlier.

507
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:52,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, nothing is going to change.

508
00:31:52,794 --> 00:32:03,888
[SPEAKER_12]: As I indicated earlier, my client has been operating the restaurant using the standard operating hours since probably around a month ago, and we're just merely asking for an extension of the hours.

509
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:07,832
[SPEAKER_12]: These operating hours were in fact exercised by the previous owner.

510
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:25,629
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course we needed to go to this extra step to adopt the same operating hours as, as they were previously so we're here, asking the sport to us, approve this petition for the extended operators which will be identical to the ones that were in place earlier with the previous owner.

511
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:26,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

512
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:31,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Lee, I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.

513
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Miss Lee.

515
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:39,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we did have mailings come in for a change.

516
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been

517
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:44,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been unbelievable owners so far.

518
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any changes.

519
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:52,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there was never an issue with the hours of operations with the former owner.

520
00:32:52,203 --> 00:33:00,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would move forward with the request that is offered by the Mailings Corporation.

521
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:05,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Then if we can just have a 30 and 60 day review, just to make sure that we have no

522
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:11,535
[SPEAKER_04]: No issues within that two-month time frame, midnight move approval.

523
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:13,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

524
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion before I open the public hearing?

525
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemingng.

526
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:27,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just, Sunday hours are listed twice here on this resolution, so just for clarification, are you proposing to open until 12.30 or 12 on Sunday?

527
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,208
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just listed twice.

528
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

529
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,491
[SPEAKER_12]: On my petition, I show Sunday operating from 11.01pm to 12am.

530
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:40,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think that's a typo on our end, Councilor Lemingng.

531
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe it's a typo.

532
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:43,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it is.

533
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, actually, that is a typo.

534
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it all back.

535
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday is just listed on the first line at the end accidentally, I think.

536
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:55,504
[SPEAKER_06]: But we could strike that Sunday in the records.

537
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:56,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Scrivener's error.

538
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:58,766
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make sure it's not there in the records.

539
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:00,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

540
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:02,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

541
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:04,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

542
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, Vice President Collins.

543
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:11,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, whereas this is a public hearing, I do need to open the public hearing.

544
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Public hearing is so open.

545
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:19,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone here who would like to speak in favor or opposition to the petition?

546
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Lee, if you wanna just say that you're in favor.

547
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in favor of this petition to extend the operating hours, sir.

548
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:30,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

549
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else would like to speak in favor or opposition to the paper?

550
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

551
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:45,445
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with 30-day and 60-day review.

552
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:49,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, yes.

553
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:59,735
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve with 30 and 60-day review, seconded by Vice President Collins.

554
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:01,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is this special permit?

555
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I need to call the roll?

556
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,089
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

557
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

558
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,990
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll call the roll on this one.

559
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:19,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

560
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

561
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:22,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I approve.

562
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:22,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

563
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:25,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins.

564
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:25,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

565
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:27,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazzaro.

566
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:28,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

567
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:31,194

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

569
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:33,336

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

573
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:35,918
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears?

574
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:36,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

575
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

576
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,282
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes and the special permit is approved.

577
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:44,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Lee, and good luck.

578
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your cooperation.

579
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:48,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

580
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:49,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

581
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

582
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

583
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:58,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Next papers are proposed by myself, so I will turn the chair over to the vice president.

584
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:38,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang on, I left the relevant paper down there.

585
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:43,030
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk has some extras, bear with me.

586
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,652
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my first time vice-presidenting.

587
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Council.

588
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:08,846
[SPEAKER_10]: 24006 offered by President Bears's resolution to propose a 2024 2025 Council governing agenda

589
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:46,224
[SPEAKER_10]: be it resolved by the Medford City Council that councilors submit items to be included in a 2024-2025 Medford City Council governing agenda document, in parentheses, draft template attached in this packet, in parentheses, that will guide the work of this council and its committees during this term, and be it further resolved that councilors submit items to the city clerk by Thursday, January 18th, 2024, for further discussion in committee of the whole.

590
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:47,245
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

591
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair, President Collins.

592
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:53,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I will eventually get used to what our titles are.

593
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:58,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody's called anyone President Rorel yet, even though we'll see.

594
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,441
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if we make it through.

595
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:09,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So the resolution here is relatively self-explanatory, but the 18-page document surely may not be.

596
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:21,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent here was really to sketch out a framework of what we would be doing this term and where and how we would be considering these various proposals.

597
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:28,241
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take a look at the document, it was included in the agenda packet that went out as well.

598
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,498
[SPEAKER_06]: President Collins will be sharing it on the screen in just a moment.

599
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:39,899
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that there's a document here that's a draft framework, and there's a table of contents that I think is useful to look at.

600
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:54,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, I looked at everything that was in committee, as well as things that have been discussed, papers in committee, papers on the table, items that have been discussed, excuse me, in the past, and broke it down across our new committee structure.

601
00:38:56,124 --> 00:39:05,474
[SPEAKER_06]: which we can now look at this document and see for each committee, what are the major projects that the committee may be entertaining for the term?

602
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:10,119
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the ordinances that the committee may be entertaining for the term?

603
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:15,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are some of the oversight and public engagement tasks that each committee may be undertaking?

604
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:18,588
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not exhaustive because it does not have

605
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:22,830
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important contribution which is the contribution from each of the six of you.

606
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:35,516
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just what was already in front of us from the last term, either in a committee or major projects like the zoning reform, obviously the Charter has been in consideration, the budget discussions have been in consideration.

607
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:45,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So while this is, I think, a long framework, really my ask of all of you is, what are you excited to work on that's not included in here?

608
00:39:46,323 --> 00:40:05,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's submit those items, and then we can sit down in committee of the whole, as we have in the past, and discuss our council priorities, discuss which committee we think they should fall under, and then develop a fully fleshed out version of this framework that considers everything that councilors may want to look at over the next two years.

609
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: the best plan in the world.

610
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:12,600
[SPEAKER_06]: If it lasts three months, I think we'll be amazed without a change, right?

611
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:13,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Things will come up.

612
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:14,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Issues will come up.

613
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Circumstances will change.

614
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:18,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Priorities will become urgent that we didn't consider.

615
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,687
[SPEAKER_06]: My first term two months in the pandemic started.

616
00:40:23,308 --> 00:40:25,029
[SPEAKER_06]: My priorities completely changed.

617
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to see Councilor Scarpelli for, you know, several months.

618
00:40:29,612 --> 00:40:32,173
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, you know, sad to lose my new friend.

619
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:34,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh.

620
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:48,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So, best laid plans right but I think this is a good framework and foundation for us to share with the public hey, here's what we're planning to do for the next two years, and there's some documents in here as well there's kind of draft timelines under each committee.

621
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's the intent of this motion is for folks to go through.

622
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:56,023
[SPEAKER_06]: If they see anything in here, you know that they.

623
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:18,755
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe have questions about or want to add to that's welcome if there's something that's not in here that we really want to work on let's submit that by the 18th and we can discuss in committee of the whole and I think really as you go through this you'll see but really all that's needed to submit is how long do you think the project will take when do you want to start it and what is a description of what the project is and we can go from there and it can range all the way from

624
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest thing, although I think we've, you know, when I first started it was always said budget ordinances, you know, and charter right those are the three things kind of that the council has some review over.

625
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I may have gotten that wrong just now but Councilor Scarpelli can correct me in a minute.

626
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:38,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're already doing those three things.

627
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:44,200
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are many other elements of governance that I'm sure are not included in here.

628
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:46,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit more context.

629
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go through for the committees, I also put in some kind of what areas of city government.

630
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:59,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you want to share, President Collins, that'd be great.

631
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:05,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what areas of city governance are falling under each committee.

632
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:14,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you say go to the administration and finance committee on its page four of the document and then page 14 of this larger packet.

633
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,734
[SPEAKER_06]: you can see kind of the areas and departments.

634
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:20,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, perfect right there.

635
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:24,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That fall under that would fall under this proposed committee.

636
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:35,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So budget, finance, auditing, taxation, procurement, grant administration, retirement and pensions personnel, then you can see the departments, what are the departments that exist that would fall under there.

637
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also took a quick pass through

638
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:48,747
[SPEAKER_06]: the city ordinances on Muni code and the city regulations to say, hey, this committee is probably mostly going to be looking at chapter two of administration, chapter 50 human relations, chapter 66 personnel.

639
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:56,453
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the big project section, which Councilor Collins just went through three that I've put in here that we've obviously discussed.

640
00:42:57,354 --> 00:43:06,562
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could scroll up a little bit more, our annual budget process, we've had discussions about revenue generation,

641
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:37,098
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, based on the financial task force and the classification and compensation study that I know that we have been waiting with bated breath for years and we need to get going on because we have unfilled positions and we haven't, you know, I'm waiting for Council Bingo for us to start talking about the things that we've been talking about every meeting for the last two years that I'm really hoping we can move the needle on such as

642
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:50,848
[SPEAKER_06]: fixing our classification and compensation so that we can do at least address that portion of the reason for unfilled positions, especially such as city solicitor and assistant city solicitor, which are so important.

643
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are kind of big projects that a committee could consider right now in terms of ordinances.

644
00:43:56,552 --> 00:44:03,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The only ordinance that's in committee and understood discussion that would fall in here would be the budget ordinance, which we are relatively close on after

645
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:07,123
[SPEAKER_06]: five or six meetings with the administration and subcommittee.

646
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:11,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's this piece around oversight and engagement.

647
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:19,295
[SPEAKER_06]: The item on financial review and long-term budget planning, for example, for administration and finance, we've been talking about that constantly.

648
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: There's several items on the table from Councilor Knight, myself, and others around getting the information that we need to really be doing this financial review.

649
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:40,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of that will be addressed through the budget ordinance, but I know this long-term budget planning and forecasting, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Collins, and I, and the prior subcommittee on ordinances and rules have really been pushing hard to say, what can we do here?

650
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:48,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's one oversight and engagement project that I put in for every committee, which is just reviewing the ordinances and regulations that may fall under that committee.

651
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:56,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've all experienced most recently with the solid waste ordinance that some of our ordinances are a little out of date.

652
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,189
[SPEAKER_06]: addressing issues that maybe are no longer common.

653
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:03,849
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have much coal ash on the sidewalks these days.

654
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:12,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know, if the committee has nothing else to do, which probably won't be the case, there's probably an ordinance that could use a little bit of a touch up that would fall under that committee.

655
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:15,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So I won't go through everything.

656
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:21,213
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to scroll down just to the draft timeline element, there's one of these for every committee as well.

657
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:28,496
[SPEAKER_06]: just to kind of show, you know, the four quarters of each year of this term, when would we be working on these different items?

658
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again, this is a draft.

659
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:39,562
[SPEAKER_06]: If Councilors have comments on anything that's in here, you know, I think this timeline is too ambitious, or I don't think there's enough time to be considering things like this.

660
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: This really is a very first pass by me, and I'm hoping it will become much better with the input of my colleagues.

661
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:47,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

662
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: with that, I won't go through every committee, but there are six more sections just like this for each of the other committees.

663
00:45:54,972 --> 00:46:01,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they really do capture a lot of what this council has moved from prior years to the current year.

664
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:12,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I'm really excited to see what my colleagues would like to add to this document and beef up even more this ambitious agenda for the next two years for this council.

665
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:13,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

666
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:24,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Any discussion from other Councilors?

667
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:28,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to thank President Bears for introducing this.

668
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:39,742
[SPEAKER_11]: When I think about the next few years and what this council will prioritize, I think a lot about two words, ambition and modernization.

669
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:41,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, I think

670
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:57,553
[SPEAKER_11]: taking this time, this precious time that Medford has, where we have so much potential and where so much is moving and changing in the greater Boston area right now, to take advantage of that and to bring our city into the 21st century.

671
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:17,022
[SPEAKER_11]: To do this, I think it's not blind to our residents that there's a lot of work that we need to catch up on, a lot of big projects that we can be taking on, a lot of projects that we can convince people to take on.

672
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:20,644
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to do the work of convincing the administration to take on as well.

673
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:29,567
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, with all of those ideas out there, right, with all of those ambitions out there, we really need structure.

674
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:49,151
[SPEAKER_11]: And so having a governing agenda like this, one that's flexible and doesn't bind us to things, but I think one that gives a structure in terms of how we work in the context of the new standing committees, I think is something that's super helpful and that will be really helpful in guiding our work going forward.

675
00:47:50,852 --> 00:48:04,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to also say, I think a lot of us Councilors work on our own versions of, maybe not as complex, but our own versions of this document.

676
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:09,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our list of ordinances, our list of policies that we want to pass.

677
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:11,454
[SPEAKER_11]: community.

678
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:21,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Um being able to meet on it together and committee of the whole and to develop that plan together to submit what we want to do and to find out common ground.

679
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:27,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Um to find projects that other Councilors are interested in working on and tackling those projects

680
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:42,121
[SPEAKER_11]: When we like when I think about my last term there are tons of projects that other Councilors were also interested in working on that, you know, we didn't really start to talk about until the second year of the term.

681
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're finally starting to work on it.

682
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:50,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking about the Youth Commission ordinance, but having a meeting like this in the beginning of our two year term.

683
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,050
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to be able to find partners.

684
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Who I think will really orient us and help us find partners for our work as well.

685
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Um so I'm very optimistic about it.

686
00:48:57,973 --> 00:49:03,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very hopeful about this document, and I'm very excited to see what everyone brings to the table.

687
00:49:06,018 --> 00:49:06,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

688
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:07,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng we'll go to

689
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate the movement.

690
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:19,575
[SPEAKER_04]: This is someone that's been around for 16 years now.

691
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:25,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that it's more streamlined, and I think it keeps us on task.

692
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:28,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, as transparent as can be.

693
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:32,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what's important, though, I think what Councilor Tseng brought up, I think it's important that

694
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:35,208
[SPEAKER_04]: the shared goals and visions.

695
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:39,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was probably one of our most important meetings whenever we start our new terms.

696
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:49,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sitting together as a group, because we're going to all understand that we're going to agree to disagree on, if not some, but many issues.

697
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think having the respect of each other and understanding each other's

698
00:49:57,137 --> 00:50:11,667
[SPEAKER_04]: each other's goals, and I think it sends that understanding for each other that I didn't realize how important I'll use Councilor Bears' initiatives with traffic and why that's so important to him.

699
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:21,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you understand why traffic issues are so important for a personal reason for Councilor Bears, you realize as a human being why

700
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:27,937
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to really understand and take those initiatives in for more of a personal level.

701
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:39,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, as someone who's always been involved in youth services in the city of Method and bringing the recreation department as a full-time, I take a lot of pride and passion.

702
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:47,368
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that Councilor Tseng and I have been talking about is starting, introducing a youth summit to really get our youth involved and

703
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:50,951
[SPEAKER_04]: really helping them mold what they want to see the city of Method.

704
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:57,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that having that meeting, I think it's probably the most important meeting we'll have.

705
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:02,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate my new Councilors that reached out after they were elected.

706
00:51:03,982 --> 00:51:06,644
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's the banter goes back and forth.

707
00:51:06,724 --> 00:51:10,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it was an interesting election season.

708
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, we all realize that it's an election.

709
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:17,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to get down and dirty sometimes.

710
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, now that we're here behind this real, we're going to work together to do some great things.

711
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:25,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I joke a lot.

712
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, when I first came in,

713
00:51:28,576 --> 00:51:44,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I joked at the fact that I got so many people calling me wishing me luck, but I truly, truly can say everybody that's behind this rail are very good people and we all have the same mission and that's to make Medford the best city we have.

714
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate.

715
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:48,826
[SPEAKER_04]: the changes already Council presidents put into place.

716
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you, there'll be some kickback a little in some things, but I enjoy doing that.

717
00:51:55,851 --> 00:52:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that next meeting that I think that we sit together as a team and vet those, I think it's gonna be very important.

718
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:05,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

719
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:09,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

720
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:10,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan?

721
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:11,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

722
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:16,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I first wanted to really thank President Bears for all the work that went into this.

723
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a really excellent framework that we'll all be able to add to.

724
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:31,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And I especially wanted to highlight how, like, I think a lot about democracy, and to me, that's engaging people in the political process, and also just engaging people in their own ideas for making Medford better.

725
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:37,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this document, in terms of the transparency that Councilor Scarpelli mentioned,

726
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:53,118
[SPEAKER_08]: It really allows us because especially with the timelines it allows us to communicate with our residents and to engage them in the process right and I understand that this is not in any way finalized but for example, someone who is really concerned about any of those housing home rule petitions.

727
00:52:54,419 --> 00:53:12,410
[SPEAKER_08]: that I think a lot of folks in Medford are either for or against, that being able to sort of point out what timeline we think that's going to happen on and when they can get engaged, that is crucial in terms of getting people to engage in the process politically, which I'm very excited about.

728
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:15,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much, President Bears, and thanks to everyone here.

729
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:22,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I really look forward to seeing what everyone adds to this framework so that it can truly become a document that we can share.

730
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:31,055
[SPEAKER_08]: with the public as the plan that we see as our ability to engage the public in what we're doing.

731
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:34,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

732
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,361
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears, then Councilor Rosario.

733
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Rosario, and then President Bears.

734
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:41,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

735
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: President Bears.

736
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate this.

737
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:57,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's incredibly transparent and helpful for the public as Councilor Callahan mentioned one thought concern I have is that as a new Councilor, I'm not 100% clear on what

738
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,562
[SPEAKER_01]: what projects are gonna reveal themselves to me over time.

739
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:27,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess if we have some kind of idea about how we can slide things in, move things around, sort of jigsaw our way through this as things come up, not necessarily on the scale of a pandemic, but maybe when we learn, when I start to learn more about how different departments work, how people are working together and where there's a space for something

740
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be a little bit urgent or not really, but that would be something that we would wanna work on, but maybe that I don't know before January 18th.

741
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:36,496
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.

742
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:48,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna be able to, you know, learn things as we're going and grow and change and have this be kind of a moving document.

743
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:49,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

744
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, love it.

745
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Love everything.

746
00:54:56,197 --> 00:55:02,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you know and and like this is exactly what I was hoping for, like, already two great things to add in.

747
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:13,067
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have a review schedule, maybe quarterly maybe semi annually where we come back to this document we say, what did we get done what didn't we get done let's add this new idea and let's update this.

748
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:21,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins and I were talking earlier about also just like us maintaining this document as a living document in between.

749
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:25,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you put a resolution on, I want to add this to the governing agenda and send it to this committee.

750
00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:27,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there'll be a lot of room there.

751
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:30,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Councilor Scarpelli is right on too, right?

752
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:33,861
[SPEAKER_06]: While this is meant to say, here's our unified approach,

753
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:39,263
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't want that to happen in the absence of also saying here's what each Councilor is passionate about.

754
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:46,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing I think that would be really great to add here on, you know, either on the items that are already here, but certainly on new items that are submitted.

755
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:52,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to be, say, the lead Councilor or the co-lead Councilor, we could add that as a line with the description and the timeline.

756
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:57,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'd be like, okay, Councilor Tseng Councilor Scarpelli, they're leading on the youth commission youth summit.

757
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's in the agenda.

758
00:55:58,331 --> 00:56:02,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, you know, that's our go-to, you know, and then there's a ton of other stuff in here as well.

759
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:03,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, either

760
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:15,837
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's something in here that you see that you want to put your name, stake your name to as a lead Councilor, once we start getting over three, we'll have to have conversations about who gets what because of the open meeting on the quorum stuff.

761
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:22,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I think that's another way that we can add in to this to make this an even better framework.

762
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:23,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, you know,

763
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this team is what that's what teamwork's about, right?

764
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:28,323
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to get better as we work on it.

765
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:40,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So really love those 2 ideas and look forward to discussing hopefully with the approval of my colleagues this in a couple of weeks after folks have gotten their ideas in and then we can have that sit down meeting and.

766
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:50,469
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, maybe we go committee by committee, and then people raise their, you know, either here's what I'm adding in, and as people send them in by the 18th, that's why I put that deadline in.

767
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:55,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I can try to plug them into an updated draft before the meeting, and then we can go through committee by committee.

768
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:59,776
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's something that we all are like, yep, we've already been working on it, it's fine.

769
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:00,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe we don't have to have a discussion.

770
00:57:00,976 --> 00:57:02,698
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a point of disagreement, we raise it.

771
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:03,678
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the disagreement.

772
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,419
[SPEAKER_06]: We say, should we include it?

773
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we exclude it?

774
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to add something that says,

775
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:26,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Council are saying has these concerns and they should be noted in here, you know, as part of the agenda, you know, maybe just sussing out the description a little bit to make sure that if folks have concerns or questions or want to reach out to, you know, want to expand the scope of what's in the document, that that can be added as well.

776
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:38,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's a great, all going to be a great process for us to go through and come out in about a month or so, hopefully with a really strong document to lead us for the next couple of years.

777
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:42,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Bears.

778
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have a motion to approve and a second?

779
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve, second.

780
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:52,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

781
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:52,913
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

782
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:53,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

783
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:54,633
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

784
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:56,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

785
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:04,197
[SPEAKER_10]: 24007, offered by President Bears.

786
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:10,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Resolution to amend rule 33 of the rules of Medford City Council to establish standing committees.

787
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:18,935
[SPEAKER_10]: be it resolved by the Medford City Council that rule 33 committees of the rules of the Medford City Council be amended to the following.

788
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:27,620
[SPEAKER_10]: After the organization of the council, the president of the council shall form and set standing meeting times for the committee of the whole and the following standing committees.

789
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:37,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Administration and Finance Committee, Education and Culture Committee, Governance Committee, Planning and Permitting Committee, Public Health and Community Safety Committee,

790
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:42,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Public Works and Facilities Committee, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

791
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:46,514
[SPEAKER_10]: All councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee.

792
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:52,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The president shall name those members of each committee, including its chair and vice chair, who are authorized to vote on matters in the committee.

793
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:57,139
[SPEAKER_10]: All other members of each committee are not authorized to vote on such matters in the committee.

794
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,141
[SPEAKER_10]: A quorum of the committee shall be determined on the basis of voting members only.

795
00:59:01,922 --> 00:59:06,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Each committee chairperson shall form subcommittees and appoint members of subcommittees as needed.

796
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:12,767
[SPEAKER_10]: The president or committee chairperson will give way to committee and subcommittee appointments via the longevity and interest of such appointees.

797
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:20,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Resolutions, ordinances and other papers are referred to committee by a majority vote of the members at a regular meeting of the City Council.

798
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: If a councillor requests, the committee chair shall place any paper referred to the committee on the next scheduled committee meeting agenda or the agenda for another scheduled committee meeting.

799
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:44,891
[SPEAKER_10]: be it further resolved that papers and committee be referred from 2022 through 2023 subcommittees to 2024-2025 committees as described in the attached memorandum describing the proposed updated council committee structure.

800
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,092
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

801
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

802
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:51,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a long one.

803
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:58,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now rule 33 of the council rules essentially says the president can do whatever the president wants when it comes to committees.

804
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:12,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a bad rule, but I thought a little more structure may behoove all of us, right?

805
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:21,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought I'd propose a rule that maybe boxes me in a little bit from that.

806
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:34,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But really the intent here, and some of this language has come from neighboring councils in terms of everyone being a member of the committee, but the voting members being named differently.

807
01:00:35,658 --> 01:00:38,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent here is to really, when I sat down and I was looking at

808
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:45,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at the menu on the city website for departments, and I was looking at the subcommittees that had already existed in the past.

809
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at what we had done for the past four years, and kind of the question I was asking was, what does the city do?

810
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:56,384
[SPEAKER_06]: What does city government do?

811
01:00:57,845 --> 01:01:07,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And if possible, and I think this is a good summary of it, trying to get that into a manageable number of committees and make those committees descriptive not of

812
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:14,170
[SPEAKER_06]: things like ordinances, but of actually like what the function of government is.

813
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:23,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how I came up with these seven committees, being administration and finance, you know, there's the administration of the city and its finances and the budget.

814
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:24,916
[SPEAKER_06]: education and culture.

815
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:30,579
[SPEAKER_06]: The city government educates the community and upholds and tries to build out the culture of our community.

816
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Governance committee, the city government is responsible for governance.

817
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:35,742
[SPEAKER_06]: What is our city charter?

818
01:01:36,162 --> 01:01:37,062
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the elections?

819
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:39,304
[SPEAKER_06]: What does the structure of government look like?

820
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:48,469
[SPEAKER_06]: The city is responsible for setting up plans for land use, planning for our community, as well as permitting, like special permits and licenses.

821
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:53,691
[SPEAKER_06]: The city government is charged with protecting the public health and the community safety.

822
01:01:54,791 --> 01:02:07,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It is in charge of the public works and our city facilities, and it also provides other services and engages the public in building community and what it means to be part of city government.

823
01:02:07,977 --> 01:02:09,658
[SPEAKER_06]: and to understand what city government is doing.

824
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:11,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of where these all came out of.

825
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:16,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea being that, essentially, there's seven committees.

826
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So each one of us will get to chair a committee and vice chair a committee.

827
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,424
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be members of many of the committees, since each committee will be five members.

828
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:30,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Voting members of many committees, you also can come to any committee meeting, and we can all sit around here, and you can speak.

829
01:02:30,386 --> 01:02:35,168
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not have a vote at that committee level, but you certainly will at committee of the whole and at the regular meeting.

830
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other piece of this is to set these as standing committees so there's a lot of business and a lot of work that could be done in a specialized area right like Councilor Scarpelli constantly is working on is on the, you know, signs of the licensing and the permitting.

831
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that makes a lot of sense.

832
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:57,565
[SPEAKER_06]: We should just have that go to planning and permitting.

833
01:02:57,605 --> 01:03:07,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, for example, whoever the chair of that committee is, whether it be the Vice President Collins, Vice President Collins could appoint a subcommittee on signs and licensing and permitting.

834
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:12,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be a way for us to make sure that every paper that comes before us, unless it's something

835
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:20,540
[SPEAKER_06]: like a remembrance or a celebration would go to the subject matter committee.

836
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And those subject matter committees would meet on a regular day and time monthly or more frequently than monthly or less frequently than monthly.

837
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:30,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to try this out and figure that out.

838
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,544
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would be very clear

839
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:41,715
[SPEAKER_06]: well in advance, for example, for our planning development sustainability staff, they would know what we're going to have to planning and permitting committee meetings this month.

840
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can have, you know, someone come and present on a plan development district at that committee meeting, or schedule public hearings, etc.

841
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:49,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

842
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,710
[SPEAKER_06]: that is, and also for planning and permitting committee is going to be very important as we work on the zoning work.

843
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone is welcome at every committee.

844
01:03:58,512 --> 01:04:08,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of us will be voting members on most committees, and there will be standing times and subject matters for all of us to rely on for city staff to rely on.

845
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:18,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, in the spirit of transparency for residents to know when and where they can be expected to show up, you know, maybe weeks and months in advance rather than just the Friday before.

846
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,200
[SPEAKER_06]: the next Tuesday or Wednesday.

847
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:28,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to my colleagues for considering this proposal, and I look forward to how you can improve it even more.

848
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Barras, Councilor Scarpelli.

849
01:04:33,182 --> 01:04:34,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President, if I can.

850
01:04:36,064 --> 01:04:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I don't have a PhD in organization, so this, if you could just do, if we can, if I could just ask for one favor, I think that as we're going public with this and people start looking, I think that one of the easier formats that we see on our website are our subcommittees and how that was formatted.

851
01:04:55,997 --> 01:04:59,940
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can add, and ask Council President, if we can add

852
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: where, especially with the first document, as we're starting this process, that we can add maybe a little section that shows this would, in the past, fall under this committee.

853
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So people can truly understand.

854
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:17,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you look at this, I understand it.

855
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:21,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we're going through the process, saying, OK, now I understand where it falls.

856
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think as we're talking about having that transparent form of government, where the common person is going to look on, they have an issue, and they have to speak

857
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:45,644
[SPEAKER_04]: where the the language has been for years a subcommittee on science where there isn't a subcommittee on science but there is a committee that is under rules and permits if that's the way so be it so if there could be maybe a little disclaimer that says in the past this was

858
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,132
[SPEAKER_04]: these were the subcommittees that fell into this category.

859
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:57,498
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can do that just to, especially as we get started, I think that this document will be no different in a year or two, the people just understand it better.

860
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think if we can have a little disclaimer there that shows the common person what they're looking at, so they can, that have revert back looking at, you know, the subcommittees that we've had in the past.

861
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least they understand where it's going, okay?

862
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:12,708
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can do that, that'd be great.

863
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:15,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd appreciate that, Council President, thank you.

864
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:18,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

865
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:20,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lazzaro.

866
01:06:21,198 --> 01:06:26,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question about all councilors shall be considered as members of each standing committee.

867
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:32,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not a voting member, can you help contribute to a quorum or no?

868
01:06:34,735 --> 01:06:40,419
[SPEAKER_06]: The quorum will be based on voting members, but if you were to show up, even though you couldn't vote, you could speak as a member.

869
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could just weigh in on something.

870
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:49,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes in the past we've had subcommittees where Rick would end up being here and he'd be like, I can't talk because I'm not a member of the subcommittee.

871
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like the thing that he proposed.

872
01:06:53,148 --> 01:07:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the structure is no different, but I think what I'm seeing is you're welcoming everybody in where the former subcommittees were.

873
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:10,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the point where, in the past, I can't show up because I don't want to disrespect that chairperson because I'm actually not on it.

874
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:15,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we're seeing is a more open, inviting subcommittee process.

875
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, it's not so, and for the newer members, I think that to be stated,

876
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have families.

877
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:28,145
[SPEAKER_04]: If everybody's going to show up to five different meetings a week, that's a little overwhelming.

878
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:32,751
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I like the idea that it's open for everybody.

879
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:35,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the past, it didn't lend to that congeniality.

880
01:07:36,054 --> 01:07:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just like, I don't want to show up because.

881
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to disrespect the chairperson because it's not my committee, thinking that I want to interject my thought process.

882
01:07:47,862 --> 01:08:04,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way that Council Biaz has structured this, I think it's appreciated, because I think it shows that it's a welcoming committee, but at the same time, it's understood that we still have to have the groundwork as subcommittees and chairs and voices.

883
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:06,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you.

884
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:07,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interrupt, but I think that

885
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:10,871
[SPEAKER_04]: little history that we've seen in the past.

886
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:12,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

887
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:18,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just a question as a new Councilor.

888
01:08:18,504 --> 01:08:22,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the lower requirement for quorum affect open meeting law?

889
01:08:23,568 --> 01:08:29,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So are fewer Councilors allowed to meet outside to discuss committee-specific work?

890
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:33,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets tough.

891
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:40,380
[SPEAKER_06]: For this, the quorum would be three as well, because it'd be three of five versus four of seven, so it's not much different.

892
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, we could get a...

893
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:51,640
[SPEAKER_06]: legal opinion, I guess, but I just said, don't talk to a majority of the council.

894
01:08:55,742 --> 01:09:07,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if I may, if I'm not jumping the line, I just think to that point as well, like there's a couple of things in here that I thought of like, um, you know, and maybe they aren't the best, uh,

895
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:15,958
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily the best quote-unquote politics, right, or at least the best parliamentary practice in terms of maintaining control.

896
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a, subcommittees would be appointed by committee chairs, right?

897
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:23,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're on the planning and permitting committee,

898
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:27,454
[SPEAKER_06]: and you want to appoint a subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs, right?

899
01:09:27,474 --> 01:09:29,296
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not in the president's hand under these rules.

900
01:09:29,316 --> 01:09:30,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be under the committee chair's rules.

901
01:09:31,098 --> 01:09:46,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing is that if a Councilor is here at the bottom, if a Councilor requests the committee chair shall place any paper referred to the committee on the next scheduled committee meeting agenda or the agenda for another scheduled meeting, that allows Councilors to, if they have a paper, they propose it, they send it to committee, they can then

902
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,700
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure that it's heard in committee.

903
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:54,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've experienced in the past, in many directions, that not happening.

904
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:00,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Scarpelli notes it.

905
01:10:02,223 --> 01:10:04,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened in both directions.

906
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:09,424
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened to me, and it's also happened that I was like, I don't want to meet on this.

907
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:17,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this gives councilors individually a little bit more of a voice to say, hey, I proposed this paper, referred to committee, we haven't met on it.

908
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd really like to see it on the agenda.

909
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:21,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this rule would say, okay, then they can place it on the agenda.

910
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:36,435
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing to your point, Councilor Scarpelli, in terms of meeting kind of the idea was we're sticking to Tuesdays and Wednesdays, you know, to start out and we'll see how this goes, you know, have one committee at six and another at seven.

911
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: If the six o'clock goes a little long.

912
01:10:39,016 --> 01:10:40,637
[SPEAKER_06]: then the seven o'clock starts a little later.

913
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:46,999
[SPEAKER_06]: If the six o'clock is a little short, then we have to wait around for 15 minutes to start at seven, but still keeping it to Tuesdays and Wednesday nights.

914
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:59,324
[SPEAKER_06]: If we do it that way, it also leaves open alternating Tuesdays for Committee of the Whole, as well as the meetings, the meeting time before regular meetings for either Committee of the Whole or say a subcommittee on signs.

915
01:10:59,364 --> 01:11:01,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we were talking about that before the meeting.

916
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:21,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So it allows us to stick to Tuesday and Wednesdays, we're not going out to Thursdays or Saturdays or, you know, anything and hopefully, you know, maybe at the start the meetings might be a little long if there's several items in the committee, you know, if we have to consider all the papers and committee from the previous year and go through and say we're keeping these and we're putting these on file.

917
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:39,428
[SPEAKER_06]: but my hope is that it will still stick to relatively reasonable, not that this is ever reasonable, meeting times for us so that we're here Tuesday and Wednesday nights about six o'clock to nine o'clock, six o'clock to 10 o'clock, and not going beyond that.

918
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see.

919
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:44,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll all depend on how many great ideas get added to the governing agenda, right?

920
01:11:45,212 --> 01:11:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

921
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:49,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Bears.

922
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

923
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:57,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

924
01:11:58,144 --> 01:11:58,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

925
01:11:59,285 --> 01:11:59,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

926
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:00,206
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

927
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:07,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

928
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:12,094
[SPEAKER_10]: 24008, offered by President Bears, resolution to review and update city fee schedule.

929
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:20,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the fee schedule of the city of Method, appendix A to the city ordinances, be reviewed and updated.

930
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,341
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

931
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:22,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

932
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:31,064
[SPEAKER_06]: In many conversations with folks across city government, especially our friends in the city clerk's office, they said, hey, we haven't updated the fees in a while.

933
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,624
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty low compared to surrounding communities.

934
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:42,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's just important for us, as we've talked about in many different contexts to take a look at what we're doing, make sure we're making a regular review.

935
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:51,650
[SPEAKER_06]: and make sure that we are keeping up with the times when it comes to the fees that we're charging for various licenses, permits, et cetera.

936
01:12:52,190 --> 01:13:07,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move to refer this to the just established by your vote planning and permitting committee so that they could take a look at the fee schedule for our many departments and see what is a reasonable fee schedule to set an update for the city.

937
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:13,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Any.

938
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:17,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just submit send motion referred a planning and permitting committee.

939
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:18,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

940
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:22,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further comment from my fellow Councilors?

941
01:13:23,811 --> 01:13:24,771
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

942
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:32,456
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by President Bears to refer this paper to the planning and permitting committee, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

943
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:33,637
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

944
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:34,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

945
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:35,598
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

946
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,180
[SPEAKER_10]: The paper is referred.

947
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:55,448
[SPEAKER_10]: 24009 offered by President Baer's resolution to request Board of Health implement winter eviction moratorium.

948
01:13:57,029 --> 01:14:10,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas many cities and countries prohibited evictions between November 1 and March 31 due to winter cold that puts lives in danger and whereas Massachusetts has yet to implement a statewide policy to protect families from becoming unhoused

949
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:21,226
[SPEAKER_10]: and put out on the street in dangerously cold weather, and whereas over 1,200 households were evicted in Massachusetts in the winter of 2022 through 2023.

950
01:14:21,926 --> 01:14:36,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the Board of Health declare an annual state of emergency and implement an eviction moratorium each winter to protect the health and safety of residents who face potentially fatal illness if evicted during the winter.

951
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:37,975
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

952
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Collins.

953
01:14:42,085 --> 01:15:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially the purpose of this resolution is, as you just read, there have been calls from residents that I've heard from here in Medford, organizations statewide like Greater Boston Legal Services, requesting that communities look into, especially their boards of health, adopting this kind of state of emergency for the winter months to prevent evictions just for the cold weather.

954
01:15:06,614 --> 01:15:08,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It certainly would not stop the

955
01:15:09,855 --> 01:15:11,436
[SPEAKER_06]: legal process from going forward.

956
01:15:13,077 --> 01:15:17,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite frankly, you'd probably have a big cliff effect where on April 1st, you'd see quite many evictions.

957
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:37,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's something we need to consider as well, but especially addressing the issue of putting people out in the street in the cold, in the dangerously cold winter weather with the shelter system for the state at maximum capacity with the lack of capacity or, you know, 24 hour shelters here in Medford.

958
01:15:39,676 --> 01:15:42,677
[SPEAKER_06]: this resolution is the folks who can implement this is the Board of Health.

959
01:15:42,797 --> 01:15:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't implement it.

960
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think the mayor can implement it.

961
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the Board of Health under some state regulations.

962
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And Greater Boston Legal Services does have more information on that.

963
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:59,905
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to put this on the agenda and send this over to the Board of Health to request that they consider

964
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:04,392
[SPEAKER_06]: taking this action to protect the health and safety of Medford residents.

965
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:08,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move to refer this to the Board of Health for their consideration.

966
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:12,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your consideration, my fellow colleagues.

967
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Lazzaro.

968
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:21,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you putting this on the agenda, President Bears.

969
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:30,354
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my jobs right now, I'm the assistant director of the Malden Warming Center, which is a seasonal shelter in Malden.

970
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:33,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an overnight shelter for people who are unhoused.

971
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are open from December 1 through March 30th yearly.

972
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:44,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can also say that in November, we get a lot of people calling us saying, are you open yet?

973
01:16:44,106 --> 01:16:45,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's cold in November too.

974
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:51,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be doing anything and everything that we can to make sure that people can stay in their homes

975
01:16:52,557 --> 01:16:58,922
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's cold out, it doesn't even have to be below freezing for people to face a lot of health issues from exposure.

976
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:13,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a guest recently with, we're not a medical facility, we are run by volunteers and just people just with no training in any kind of medical things at the center that I work at.

977
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:19,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have folks that have real medical issues, we frequently have to call ambulances.

978
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a guest who has COPD, and he, just because of exposure from being outside, goes to the hospital really frequently, has a lot of breathing problems just from being outside during the day, even on days when it's not that cold.

979
01:17:30,593 --> 01:17:32,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is very dangerous for people.

980
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:41,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is anything that we can do as a council, just small steps towards mitigating that for our residents, I think we should make sure that we're taking those steps.

981
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:43,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you putting it on the agenda.

982
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:48,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate whatever the Board of Health can do, and this can be one thing in that direction.

983
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:49,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

984
01:17:51,496 --> 01:17:52,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

985
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,601
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Callahan.

986
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:56,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

987
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:56,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

988
01:17:57,146 --> 01:18:00,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor or President Bears for introducing this.

989
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:05,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Um I think in a very similar vein to what councils, uh, Lazzaro was talking about.

990
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:15,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh this eviction moratorium, I think it's something that's very crucial for people to get through these difficult winter months.

991
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:16,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I think today's.

992
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:33,172
[SPEAKER_11]: As Councilor Bears, as President Bears referred to, there's very noticeable strain on our shelter system and our health care system.

993
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:40,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we look at the data, when we look at the science of evictions, number one, it's just bad, right?

994
01:18:41,035 --> 01:18:42,836
[SPEAKER_11]: But from a scientific standpoint,

995
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:52,912
[SPEAKER_11]: evictions tend to cause more mental health issues, tend to cause more physical health ailments as well.

996
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:59,975
[SPEAKER_11]: It tends to be, you know, as Councilor Lazzaro was talking about, truly life-threatening.

997
01:19:00,296 --> 01:19:08,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we have a moral responsibility to make sure our neighbours are able to get through these next few months safely.

998
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm very grateful for this resolution.

999
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:16,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1000
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:17,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

1001
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:25,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, yep, I very much agree that this is important, and we need to protect those residents health and safety.

1002
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:29,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to hear from President Bears.

1003
01:19:29,595 --> 01:19:33,457
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to know any sort of just a tiny bit of details about

1004
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:55,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, if this is under state regulations and other cities are passing this, there's going to be, you know, places that the Board of Health will go for the kinds of details about how this might affect, like, small local landlords and the ways in which the sort of, you know, is there funding that is available?

1005
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:59,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there, you know, how is this sort of effectively done?

1006
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not looked into how that is done at the state level or at other cities.

1007
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:06,236
[SPEAKER_08]: if there's a word or two you could speak to on that point.

1008
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:19,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on the specifics, this is similar to the Board of Health eviction moratoria that were put in place during the pandemic through states of emergency.

1009
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:23,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford did not implement one, but several neighboring cities did.

1010
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:28,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Greater Boston Legal Services is available to talk about the details of the legal justification behind it.

1011
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:39,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially how it would work, and in this case I think it speaks to, I wouldn't say that it would not have impact, but I think it would relatively minimize the impact.

1012
01:20:41,013 --> 01:20:45,615
[SPEAKER_06]: the proceeding would continue in court.

1013
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:50,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a months-long process to file for an eviction.

1014
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:54,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So the proceeding would continue when the courts are considering it.

1015
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:59,119
[SPEAKER_06]: This would prohibit the final enforcement of the final eviction order.

1016
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:07,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially it would say, stop it at the sheriff level, at the constable level, where it's just that final step.

1017
01:21:09,646 --> 01:21:16,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say that there wouldn't be delays that could potentially impact someone who is renting a unit.

1018
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would not just say, oh, you can't even start the process, or you can't go through the court process, or you can't go through those steps.

1019
01:21:25,475 --> 01:21:30,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just prevent the final enforcement of it until the weather essentially was warm enough.

1020
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:38,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure the Board of Health could consider alternative dates and time frames or setting it every year based on

1021
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,100
[SPEAKER_06]: weather patterns, although there's not many patterns left in the weather.

1022
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:54,088
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that so it would not just say, oh, you can't do this and nothing is getting processed, which is actually what was happening under Governor Baker's order when the statewide had an eviction moratorium.

1023
01:21:54,108 --> 01:21:56,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that whole process had to get going again.

1024
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone filed for an eviction on November 15th, it likely would take 60 to 90 days for that to get through the court system or even longer than that.

1025
01:22:05,455 --> 01:22:08,137
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, you're close to the March 31st date anyway.

1026
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1027
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:11,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leving.

1028
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a question for Councilor Lazzaro.

1029
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:32,010
[SPEAKER_14]: In your years working with and running the Malden Warming Shelter, could you just give us an idea of how many people that came into the shelter were evicted during the winter months, just to offer an idea of how many this resolution would likely affect?

1030
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, homelessness isn't,

1031
01:22:37,682 --> 01:22:40,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't a municipal issue.

1032
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:41,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a regional issue.

1033
01:22:42,984 --> 01:22:52,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to get numbers for how many people in a town are evicted, because when you need shelter, you go where the shelter is.

1034
01:22:53,027 --> 01:23:06,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I can say is some people are chronically homeless, and some people are homeless because they missed a payment, they had a short-term issue, or they were evicted

1035
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:09,148
[SPEAKER_01]: because of an error.

1036
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:16,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one guest last year who was evicted because of an error and was stuck in the courts, but was fully evicted out of his home for the entire winter.

1037
01:23:17,052 --> 01:23:21,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's now in a home, but it took him the whole winter.

1038
01:23:21,193 --> 01:23:22,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a job.

1039
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:23,694
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to work every day.

1040
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:25,215
[SPEAKER_01]: He dressed really beautifully.

1041
01:23:25,275 --> 01:23:28,336
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked at a clothing store in the Prudential building.

1042
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:32,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came every night that he could make it when he wasn't working too late to get in.

1043
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,989
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did not seem like a homeless person.

1044
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:37,190
[SPEAKER_01]: He was evicted because of an error.

1045
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, you know, like was evicted in the winter.

1046
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:41,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So it there are all different stories.

1047
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like have that much data about it.

1048
01:23:43,313 --> 01:23:45,794
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does happen really, pretty frequently.

1049
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:52,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there isn't like, when there aren't people stopping you from doing something you just can still evict people.

1050
01:23:53,663 --> 01:23:56,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, it seems like a pretty common sense thing.

1051
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,107
[SPEAKER_14]: If you got evicted in the winter, that could potentially be lethal.

1052
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:07,391
[SPEAKER_14]: So just having rules in place to prevent that from happening definitely seems worth this body's time.

1053
01:24:11,594 --> 01:24:12,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have a second for the motion?

1054
01:24:15,356 --> 01:24:16,737
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion was to refer to the Board of Health.

1055
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:22,761
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to refer this paper to the Board of Health, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1056
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:23,956
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

1057
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:25,718
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

1058
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:27,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1059
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:38,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, before you relinquish the chair back to me, just I noticed 23-412 and I didn't see on Zoom either the Dell Avenue question.

1060
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you had spoken to PDS.

1061
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It was tabled until tonight.

1062
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:51,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to motion to just leave it on the table so that it can come back up when I see the clerk raising his hand.

1063
01:24:51,195 --> 01:24:53,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will let him instruct the chair.

1064
01:24:55,393 --> 01:25:00,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Attorney Dash also called my office, actually emailed my office and said they were not going to be ready to proceed.

1065
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:03,516
[SPEAKER_03]: They're close, but they're not there yet.

1066
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:07,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So he asked for it to remain tabled until they have a resolution.

1067
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:15,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so if we could just move to keep it on the table and then we can just change it to just tabled instead of to a date certain, then we can raise it at any time when the parties are here.

1068
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So just be a motion to table, instead of tabling to a date certain, just to table.

1069
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:30,281
[SPEAKER_10]: on the motion to table by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1070
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:31,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

1071
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:39,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at the 23-412, which is already under unfinished business.

1072
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,169
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just motioning to table that, but not to a specific date.

1073
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:47,312
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

1074
01:25:47,332 --> 01:25:47,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1075
01:25:48,212 --> 01:25:48,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1076
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:49,353
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

1077
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:51,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1078
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:52,795
[SPEAKER_10]: It stays on the table.

1079
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:16,451
[SPEAKER_06]: 24-010, resolution to discuss adoption of good landlord tax credit.

1080
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:24,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council explore enactment of a good landlord tax credit as outlined in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 59, Section 50.

1081
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:33,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further study and for discussion with the Chief Assessor and Finance Director, Vice President Collins.

1082
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:35,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Bears.

1083
01:26:37,662 --> 01:26:39,603
[SPEAKER_10]: the good landlord tax credit.

1084
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:50,027
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of the colloquial phrase for a local option that was included very recently in the state tax relief package under Governor Healey.

1085
01:26:50,987 --> 01:27:00,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Essentially, this provides now a new way for cities to give a property tax break to landlords who choose to keep their rents below market rate.

1086
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:06,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a way to, in different framings, either incentivize or reward or

1087
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:13,558
[SPEAKER_10]: thank, if you want to put it that way, small landlords who opt to offer more affordable rents to their tenants.

1088
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,522
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a one-size-fits-all mechanism.

1089
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:24,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Cities can have several levers that they can pull on.

1090
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:24,889
[SPEAKER_10]: They can choose

1091
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:37,209
[SPEAKER_10]: up to what percentage of property tax to exempt landlords from.

1092
01:27:39,072 --> 01:27:50,025
[SPEAKER_10]: They can choose whether to enact this option for landlords who, oh, I always get this wording messed up.

1093
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:54,874
[SPEAKER_10]: You can enact this if rents are affordable up to 200% AMI.

1094
01:27:55,214 --> 01:28:01,522
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the option to narrow it so that it's just for landlords who provide only much deeper affordability.

1095
01:28:01,562 --> 01:28:10,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like a whole spectrum that this council could investigate and decide what might be the best fit for this community, and all communities have that option.

1096
01:28:11,513 --> 01:28:39,874
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot to deliberate on to explore this option further and decide what might be the best fit for Medford, for our landlords that are offering low market rate rents, all towards the goal of incentivizing small landlords to do this, because we have such an acute and ever-worsening affordable housing scarcity and crisis in Medford, as we do throughout the region, and as a way to make making that choice to offer affordability

1097
01:28:40,276 --> 01:28:44,662
[SPEAKER_10]: a little more doable for landlords and to further incentivize them to do so.

1098
01:28:46,063 --> 01:28:57,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And so my motion is to send this to the administration and finance committee where we can have a start discussion about it with our chief assessor and our finance director about implications for the city and get their insight on how to implement this.

1099
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1100
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:05,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Cullen, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lemingng.

1101
01:29:06,014 --> 01:29:06,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

1102
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:07,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1103
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for introducing this resolution.

1104
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:18,064
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the start of a discussion about the good landlord tax credit.

1105
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:24,590
[SPEAKER_11]: This, I think, through your description, Councilor Collins, I think you've described it super well.

1106
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:30,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that a lot of our residents are excited about this possibly being implemented.

1107
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:38,874
[SPEAKER_11]: As you noted, there are details that we have to work through, but this resolution starts the process.

1108
01:29:39,494 --> 01:29:42,075
[SPEAKER_11]: It starts that conversation in the community about this.

1109
01:29:43,455 --> 01:29:49,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always said that the housing crisis is one of the most severe challenges facing our city right now.

1110
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:52,299
[SPEAKER_11]: It's part of a larger affordability crisis.

1111
01:29:52,799 --> 01:30:01,145
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, and I know that a lot of us, a lot of, if not all of us were elected on platforms to tackle affordability in the city.

1112
01:30:02,657 --> 01:30:21,811
[SPEAKER_11]: This, another kind of maxim that I always say, specifically when it comes to the housing crisis, is that inaction has been so pervasive for such a long time that we now need to use all the tools in the toolbox, or at least consider all the tools in the toolbox.

1113
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:29,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And with the state giving us a local option, we should be proactive in exercising our local rights.

1114
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:41,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think, and the economic data supports this, that incentives can be a very useful economic tool to incentivize

1115
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:43,454
[SPEAKER_11]: better behavior.

1116
01:30:44,795 --> 01:31:04,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that the good landlord tax credit would especially help at the margins where this might incentivize the landlord to seek to qualify for the program given the credit from the property taxes.

1117
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:14,322
[SPEAKER_11]: lower rents, hopefully, at the margins, and help those in our community who happen to be in those situations.

1118
01:31:14,462 --> 01:31:16,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm optimistic about this, I think.

1119
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:18,063
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of potential here.

1120
01:31:19,404 --> 01:31:27,646
[SPEAKER_11]: There's more details that we need to walk through, but I am very grateful to Vice President Collins for introducing this, and I'll second your motion.

1121
01:31:29,747 --> 01:31:30,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan.

1122
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:31,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1123
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I read this section of the state code.

1124
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:36,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very excited about it.

1125
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something I talked about on the campaign trail.

1126
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:53,506
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is something that really just gets right at affordable housing in terms of rentals, and it attacks the problem exactly where it exists, by rewarding those rental properties and those landlords.

1127
01:31:53,902 --> 01:31:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: who are renting below market rates.

1128
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is exactly what we want to be doing.

1129
01:31:58,685 --> 01:31:59,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty excited about it.

1130
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:11,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I also am excited about the fact that it will just by the fact of doing this, you know, most of the people, the landlords who are renting below market rates tend to be local.

1131
01:32:12,252 --> 01:32:13,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them live here in our city.

1132
01:32:14,775 --> 01:32:17,097
[SPEAKER_08]: If not right here in our city, then they're in nearby cities.

1133
01:32:17,777 --> 01:32:26,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think being able to target these tax credits for folks who live here is what I wish we could do if we can legally, if we can find a way to do it legally for Medford residents, I would love to do that.

1134
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:34,132
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm also very happy that this will target people who are local, a lot of Medford resident landlords, as well as folks who live in nearby cities.

1135
01:32:35,073 --> 01:32:36,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited about it.

1136
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:37,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to discuss it on the committee.

1137
01:32:37,835 --> 01:32:38,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for putting this forward.

1138
01:32:41,448 --> 01:32:45,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1139
01:32:45,896 --> 01:32:48,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they bring this forward and explaining it.

1140
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:50,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the phone calls I was getting was joy.

1141
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:51,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so George.

1142
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:54,192
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wave hi to my neighbor, am I good?

1143
01:32:54,212 --> 01:33:01,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, please, I said just, but I think that it's important that we understand where it's coming from.

1144
01:33:01,476 --> 01:33:20,268
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that I appreciate that it's going to the assessor just to understand the ramifications because although the best laid plans sound great, but I think we all have to, when we make decisions is also understand that if there are,

1145
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:27,964
[SPEAKER_04]: what does it look like if we have 10 landlords that are going to do this?

1146
01:33:28,004 --> 01:33:36,389
[SPEAKER_04]: How does this affect, you know, the other balance with our tax bracket and see how that affects us?

1147
01:33:36,469 --> 01:33:52,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, you know, love the idea, especially when we see, you know, as a former, you know, resident of a home that was owned by a resident of Medford,

1148
01:33:53,144 --> 01:33:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: and that being my dad and making sure that he never took advantage of his tenants.

1149
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:09,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know in his passing, he promised my brothers he took over the home to make sure that the families are there, we'll always have a place to live.

1150
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:19,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's a reward that people like to have that open mind to see because I think like, as Councilor Cowen said, we have, you know,

1151
01:34:20,473 --> 01:34:24,635
[SPEAKER_04]: the homes and the landlords that really take advantage, railing out those people that live here.

1152
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but I think it's something that I think needs to be vetted, and I appreciate that going to the subcommittee so we can see where this goes.

1153
01:34:33,278 --> 01:34:34,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I appreciate it.

1154
01:34:37,674 --> 01:34:41,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Vice President Collins for bringing this forward.

1155
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:53,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I knocked on a lot of doors this past campaign and a lot of people that I spoke to are small landlords that oftentimes rent below market rates who are

1156
01:34:54,702 --> 01:35:09,352
[SPEAKER_14]: who were sometimes comparing themselves to other landlords that lived a few towns over and never maintained their properties, essentially see land in Medford as something which they can extract as much money from as possible.

1157
01:35:09,852 --> 01:35:23,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And I very much sympathize with what Councilor Callaghan was saying, that it is oftentimes difficult when digging through state code to try to find ways of distinguishing between one type of landlord and the other type of landlord.

1158
01:35:23,501 --> 01:35:24,222
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a very

1159
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:27,444
[SPEAKER_14]: it's a good tool for doing that.

1160
01:35:28,124 --> 01:35:38,151
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing I'd like to point out is beyond incentivizing lower rents, which is a city council now that I believe has a majority of renters on it.

1161
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:47,517
[SPEAKER_14]: If that was counting correctly, it also can be used to incentivize landlords who actively maintain their properties,

1162
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:55,943
[SPEAKER_14]: who choose to do repairs on time, who really take care of their tenants in that way too.

1163
01:35:56,484 --> 01:36:08,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that this is something that potentially a lot more people could get behind because it will incentivize basically upkeep in Medford if it's implemented correctly.

1164
01:36:08,531 --> 01:36:10,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much.

1165
01:36:12,415 --> 01:36:13,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

1166
01:36:13,536 --> 01:36:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it may be a three, three split and everyone knows I live in my parents' basement, so.

1167
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:22,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not true, it's the first floor.

1168
01:36:28,087 --> 01:36:29,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I only come out Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

1169
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment on the resolution?

1170
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:39,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment on the resolution?

1171
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:52,129
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to, and I'll go back to Councilor, Vice President Collins.

1172
01:36:52,510 --> 01:37:04,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, now that we have approved the resolution to adopt committees with titles, I should just amend this to refer to the Administration and Finance Committee and not committee.

1173
01:37:05,379 --> 01:37:10,023
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, as amended by Councilor Collins and seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1174
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:12,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she already moved, okay.

1175
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:17,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Then simply on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1176
01:37:17,153 --> 01:37:17,874
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favour?

1177
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:19,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1178
01:37:19,535 --> 01:37:19,755
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

1179
01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:20,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1180
01:37:20,736 --> 01:37:23,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to switch again.

1181
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:24,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1182
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,106
[SPEAKER_10]: City Council.

1183
01:37:54,126 --> 01:37:59,007
[SPEAKER_10]: 24 011 offered by President Bears resolution to request update on Wellington Circle study next steps.

1184
01:37:59,927 --> 01:38:12,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the traffic and transportation director provide an update on when the city of Method in partnership with mass dot district for plans to initiate a project through the mass dot project development process to implement the

1185
01:38:20,168 --> 01:38:21,989
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the, what are they calling it these days?

1186
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,672
[SPEAKER_06]: The hurricane, the tornado, the vortex, something.

1187
01:38:26,712 --> 01:38:33,657
[SPEAKER_06]: They're calling Wellington Circle something, but it's, I can't quite remember what it is, but some sort of nightmare vortex.

1188
01:38:36,919 --> 01:38:40,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And as such, it's super collider, that's it, there it is.

1189
01:38:42,302 --> 01:38:43,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1190
01:38:43,563 --> 01:38:46,044
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few Google reviews too.

1191
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:48,366
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford super collider.

1192
01:38:49,551 --> 01:38:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: our contribution to particle physics.

1193
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:56,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But in any case, they studied Wellington Circle.

1194
01:38:57,018 --> 01:38:57,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad.

1195
01:38:57,718 --> 01:38:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Study headline, not good.

1196
01:39:01,341 --> 01:39:09,148
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did issue some recommendations, short-term recommendations and long-term recommendations to improve safety for all modes of transit.

1197
01:39:10,329 --> 01:39:16,890
[SPEAKER_06]: at Wellington Circle, as well as, I think, at least in my read of some of the recommendations, it will look a lot nicer.

1198
01:39:17,391 --> 01:39:32,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It will actually activate, to an extent, it will activate the idea of building a neighborhood and connecting the different parts of the Wellington neighborhood to a little more if that intersection is not the disastrous arrangement that it is today.

1199
01:39:32,654 --> 01:39:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: However, at the end it says, and Medford will work on this with MassDOT District 4 and MassDOT

1200
01:39:39,615 --> 01:39:41,696
[SPEAKER_06]: and through the MassDOT project development process.

1201
01:39:41,716 --> 01:39:47,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So really the only purpose of this resolution is to ask Director Blake, where are we?

1202
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:57,264
[SPEAKER_06]: As we all know, certainly Medford is not going to be able to pay to fix that intersection, nor is it our jurisdictional responsibility to do so, but we are part of the process.

1203
01:39:58,184 --> 01:39:59,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And Director Blake,

1204
01:40:00,934 --> 01:40:04,176
[SPEAKER_06]: was, you know, that the city of Method was named as part of the next step.

1205
01:40:04,236 --> 01:40:18,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So reaching out to MassDOT and making sure that we know where this is in the process, how it will be funded, what are the timelines we can expect for the short-term mitigations to potentially go into effect, as well as the long-term redesign of the entire intersection.

1206
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:21,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all this is.

1207
01:40:21,168 --> 01:40:25,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would be a motion to refer to Traffic and Transportation Director Blake.

1208
01:40:29,718 --> 01:40:32,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1209
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:33,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1210
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:35,826
[SPEAKER_11]: It turns out I was the first one to mess up.

1211
01:40:40,867 --> 01:41:00,738
[SPEAKER_11]: As someone who goes through that intersection multiple times a week, at least by car, but oftentimes on foot, the circle being fixed as to the best of its ability is something that I think will impact the lives of a lot of Bedford residents, whether it be

1212
01:41:01,678 --> 01:41:08,243
[SPEAKER_11]: a change that folks like or don't, I would recommend everyone look at the plans online.

1213
01:41:09,103 --> 01:41:23,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And while I don't think there's much room for changing the plans given the state's, the structure of how the state has designed this process and its relative inflexibility to adjust their plans,

1214
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:32,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I still think that getting more feedback and having our city government put more pressure on the state is important.

1215
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:43,150
[SPEAKER_11]: There are also parts of the plan that are optional, that are recommendations for the future that could be cut out, and a lot of those particularly intact pedestrians.

1216
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:46,892
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're looking to make that neighborhood.

1217
01:41:46,912 --> 01:41:48,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Um transit, particularly transit, um, focused.

1218
01:41:48,493 --> 01:41:48,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Um and, uh.

1219
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:49,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the

1220
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:17,801
[SPEAKER_11]: for introducing this, and I hope that our city can do a lot of good work on it, but getting clarity on the project is the first step.

1221
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:21,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1222
01:42:22,022 --> 01:42:22,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further comment?

1223
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:24,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kalan.

1224
01:42:25,864 --> 01:42:26,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1225
01:42:26,364 --> 01:42:32,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So where can we, whether we are city councilors or members of the interested public, where can we find the Wellington Circle Study?

1226
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:41,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, it's on the, I was gonna come up with something, but it's on the mass, it's mass.gov.

1227
01:42:41,817 --> 01:42:49,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not tell you how much further the URL goes, but if you were to type into Google Wellington Circle Study, it'd be on the mass.gov website.

1228
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a page for Wellington Circle Study.

1229
01:42:52,281 --> 01:42:54,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a list of documents on that page.

1230
01:42:56,243 --> 01:43:00,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it is the, it's called the final report, I believe is what it's called, but.

1231
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: You should see the, they wanted to, one of the proposed alternatives was an overpass, which I, yeah, well, I would have liked the tunnel, but the overpass is, yeah, so.

1232
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,426
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, some Google.

1233
01:43:22,928 --> 01:43:23,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Short answer, Google.

1234
01:43:27,672 --> 01:43:29,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have a second on the motion?

1235
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,203
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to refer to the Traffic and Transportation Director, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1236
01:43:36,263 --> 01:43:36,903
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1237
01:43:36,923 --> 01:43:37,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1238
01:43:37,703 --> 01:43:39,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I second Councilor Lazzaro's motion.

1239
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:44,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

1240
01:43:44,606 --> 01:43:45,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you have to come up and give remarks.

1241
01:44:01,567 --> 01:44:02,468
[SPEAKER_06]: the great divide.

1242
01:44:02,488 --> 01:44:05,150
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1243
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1244
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:08,052
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

1245
01:44:08,572 --> 01:44:09,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1246
01:44:17,259 --> 01:44:19,500
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't know, but I was Justin's favorite teacher.

1247
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:23,023
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

1248
01:44:23,043 --> 01:44:25,765
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going back all the way to the Osgoode school days.

1249
01:44:25,905 --> 01:44:28,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought President Collins was going to use the gavel before me.

1250
01:44:30,103 --> 01:44:33,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out.

1251
01:44:35,986 --> 01:44:38,768
[SPEAKER_06]: That brings us to public participation.

1252
01:44:39,609 --> 01:44:45,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone, any member of the public on Zoom or in the room who would like to speak for public participation?

1253
01:44:45,132 --> 01:44:48,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have one.

1254
01:44:48,234 --> 01:44:50,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing no one on Zoom.

1255
01:44:50,395 --> 01:44:51,295
[SPEAKER_06]: We have someone in the room.

1256
01:44:52,296 --> 01:44:56,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Jack is coming up.

1257
01:44:56,779 --> 01:44:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1258
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1259
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:06,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, if you could tap the... Where it says push?

1260
01:45:06,563 --> 01:45:06,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1261
01:45:07,103 --> 01:45:07,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1262
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:10,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1263
01:45:12,346 --> 01:45:13,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1264
01:45:15,034 --> 01:45:16,035
[SPEAKER_05]: for inviting me here tonight.

1265
01:45:16,555 --> 01:45:25,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So I came a few weeks ago as a concerned neighbor regarding a potential migrant shelter diagonally across the street from my house.

1266
01:45:25,743 --> 01:45:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw on a Facebook post through my wife's Facebook, I guess the mayor sort of addressed some things that are happening, but I'm hoping maybe someone here can help shed some light.

1267
01:45:39,557 --> 01:45:43,800
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, I know Mr. Merritt's been actively, I know the neighbors have reached out.

1268
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:50,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the question that has been put out there, the mayor did address it.

1269
01:45:50,964 --> 01:45:53,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I could share the email with everybody.

1270
01:45:53,225 --> 01:45:55,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping to get some clarification.

1271
01:45:56,827 --> 01:46:07,532
[SPEAKER_04]: what I would like to do is call for a meeting with that state representative because in this email the mayor clearly states that it's really that she doesn't believe I think that it falls in her privy to hold this meeting.

1272
01:46:07,592 --> 01:46:19,058
[SPEAKER_04]: She thinks really it needs our state delegates to really explain what's going on so if I can read it so you absolutely that'd be great thank you if you can so it's uh it's an update for temporary shelter update from the mayor

1273
01:46:19,798 --> 01:46:20,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.

1274
01:46:20,398 --> 01:46:22,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to provide an update in the last email.

1275
01:46:22,339 --> 01:46:25,780
[SPEAKER_04]: The humanitarian crisis unfolding in our region.

1276
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:33,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe the state is moving forward with the facility at 400 Riverside to serve as a temporary overnight shelter for families.

1277
01:46:33,662 --> 01:46:48,667
[SPEAKER_04]: My office, along with our Acting Building Commissioner, Fire Chief and Board of Health, Emergency Response Director, have outlined our concerns as well as our code requirements to ensure that the governor's administration ensures a safe and secure environment for families currently in the state's wait list

1278
01:46:49,147 --> 01:46:50,228
[SPEAKER_04]: for emergency assistance.

1279
01:46:50,789 --> 01:46:59,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working toward reaching an MOU to set a clear limit on the number of people housed at the facility as well as capping the duration of each family's stay.

1280
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:06,465
[SPEAKER_04]: The reasons being the facility is very large and could fit thousands because three of our elementary schools are already at capacity.

1281
01:47:06,965 --> 01:47:07,806
[SPEAKER_04]: My ask of that

1282
01:47:09,887 --> 01:47:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Schools are already capacity that this be for no more than 75 families, 250 people, which is what was the original plan for the state.

1283
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:29,454
[SPEAKER_04]: The shelter is active until April or June, and the latest based on legislators, recent legislation, that the families rotate into permanent shelter within three to four days.

1284
01:47:30,034 --> 01:47:35,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, these are just my asks, and there are no specifics for report out of the public yet.

1285
01:47:35,996 --> 01:47:46,236
[SPEAKER_04]: To date there is no lease agreement in place with the owner of 400 Riverside, no contract with the health and services provider, and as I said, no MOU.

1286
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:51,649
[SPEAKER_04]: in place with the city, so there are a few details that can be shared.

1287
01:47:52,209 --> 01:47:57,831
[SPEAKER_04]: As you may have read, the state is moving forward and has already opened the Cambridge site, which took priority.

1288
01:47:58,271 --> 01:48:05,433
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I am fully briefed by the state in specifics and operations terms upon Riverside, I will relay

1289
01:48:07,553 --> 01:48:11,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, that info to you all as well as the public.

1290
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:20,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, this is a state-run endeavor in the relationship with a private entity, and we ultimately have very little say and have no oversight on the day-to-day operations.

1291
01:48:20,523 --> 01:48:23,345
[SPEAKER_04]: My only hope is that the MOU can be reached and signed.

1292
01:48:23,965 --> 01:48:35,982
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is any community meetings, it would have to be done by the state officials running the system and the building owner and provider as we don't have much involvement or insight into how this process unfolds.

1293
01:48:36,462 --> 01:48:38,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's from the mayor's office.

1294
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:38,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from the mayor.

1295
01:48:39,707 --> 01:48:40,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that

1296
01:48:41,369 --> 01:48:50,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the mayor also understands the impact of our infrastructure, that making sure that we don't overburden our system right now.

1297
01:48:50,571 --> 01:49:00,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I've heard a lot from the teachers and the fear from parents, especially in that neighborhood between the Roberts and the McGlynn and the Andrews.

1298
01:49:00,674 --> 01:49:03,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very, very, very tight.

1299
01:49:04,015 --> 01:49:07,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And although we understand that we

1300
01:49:08,891 --> 01:49:20,321
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the governor wants to look at options, but again, I think my hope is that I get an update from the mayor again.

1301
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor's been responsive, but I think at the same time, I think we need to have our state delegates here and all of them.

1302
01:49:27,267 --> 01:49:29,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we need to have an understanding

1303
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: that if this is going to happen, which it looks like it's going to happen, that we're prepared in every which way possible.

1304
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can understand if it was three to four days, and then we're moving to it.

1305
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't see many guarantees.

1306
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:44,553
[SPEAKER_04]: When I heard from friends in Cambridge,

1307
01:49:45,698 --> 01:49:48,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not being used as a three or four day Passover.

1308
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really being used for families that are being housed.

1309
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:58,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest with you, from what I gather, it's not a conducive environment for families either.

1310
01:49:58,401 --> 01:50:11,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, it's safer maybe, it's warmer maybe, but I think that if this is the governor's wish, we have to look at a long-term commitment to housing the families.

1311
01:50:14,002 --> 01:50:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've heard a lot.

1312
01:50:15,803 --> 01:50:18,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked to a lot of different communities.

1313
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:35,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we don't see a lot of the more affluent communities that have a lot of money that they're asking to move these families, communities that have access, that have space in their schools, that have infrastructure that can support that.

1314
01:50:36,128 --> 01:50:40,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems like they're really coming into more of the urban rim and urban communities.

1315
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:44,472
[SPEAKER_04]: over exhausting their infrastructure.

1316
01:50:44,492 --> 01:50:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the mayor and all her department that see that for the fact that this is, you know, whether you're for it or against it, that's not the question.

1317
01:50:53,837 --> 01:50:57,019
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest issue right now is making sure that we can handle that.

1318
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: we can, Mr. Merritt, I know that you've been on the forefront.

1319
01:51:01,043 --> 01:51:09,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to make sure I read that on on the record, but then at the same time for our next meeting, we should call for a meeting because we don't know what two weeks will come.

1320
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is going to happen, at least let's hear it from the state representatives and see where we're going from there.

1321
01:51:17,981 --> 01:51:19,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1322
01:51:20,834 --> 01:51:24,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to clarify what I'm hearing, we want to put a resolution on our next regular meeting.

1323
01:51:26,478 --> 01:51:39,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Inviting all of us state representatives and city administration to give us an understanding of what the process I know the mayor has given us some information, but at the same time, I think if we can have someone from her her department.

1324
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:44,010
[SPEAKER_04]: and the state delegates that can come in and support us in understanding what's going on.

1325
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:46,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not going back and forth, and we hear it directly from them.

1326
01:51:47,252 --> 01:51:48,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President, appreciate it.

1327
01:51:48,553 --> 01:51:57,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for the, maybe not for the records, but maybe just so we can get that resolution put together for our meeting on the 23rd, who would we want to invite?

1328
01:51:57,601 --> 01:52:01,204
[SPEAKER_06]: The state representatives, state senator, and then

1329
01:52:03,894 --> 01:52:06,436
[SPEAKER_06]: invite to like the representatives from the Healy administration.

1330
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what their office is.

1331
01:52:08,517 --> 01:52:10,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone remember the name of the office that's working on this?

1332
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it EOHLC?

1333
01:52:17,483 --> 01:52:18,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that one?

1334
01:52:19,043 --> 01:52:19,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1335
01:52:19,624 --> 01:52:21,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's General Keefe, right?

1336
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:23,106
[SPEAKER_06]: General Gary Keefe is working.

1337
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:23,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1338
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:35,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities and then also a representative of General Keefe or the General if you would like to come.

1339
01:52:38,512 --> 01:52:38,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

1340
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will get that.

1341
01:52:42,321 --> 01:52:42,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1342
01:52:42,761 --> 01:52:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the residents also in the area be invited to this?

1343
01:52:46,743 --> 01:52:48,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it'll be on the agenda.

1344
01:52:48,744 --> 01:52:51,705
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be part of the agenda for the city council's regular meeting on the 23rd.

1345
01:52:51,985 --> 01:53:02,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as a FYI, Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's just me not able to work the website correctly, but I couldn't even find the agenda for tonight's meeting because it's bucketed under 2023.

1346
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no link for 2024 agendas on the website.

1347
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:13,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to the communications director.

1348
01:53:13,022 --> 01:53:13,723
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't post it.

1349
01:53:14,924 --> 01:53:18,187
[SPEAKER_03]: But the agenda postings are a little convoluted.

1350
01:53:18,207 --> 01:53:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: They go alphabetically.

1351
01:53:19,168 --> 01:53:21,110
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't go chronologically.

1352
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would find this is a January.

1353
01:53:25,774 --> 01:53:32,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd have to scroll through all the way through April and August and February and get all the way down to January 1st.

1354
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:37,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but the 23 link will still get you to the right Google Drive page to get there.

1355
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:38,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see if they can change that.

1356
01:53:38,073 --> 01:53:43,837
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll ask them to make a 24 link, and then it also should be linked to the event on the events calendar on the city website.

1357
01:53:43,857 --> 01:53:47,279
[SPEAKER_06]: If that wasn't there, we'll... I didn't check that.

1358
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:55,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're working on... I expect that there may be a committee that will have several discussions about us being more engaged with the city website than we currently are.

1359
01:53:57,978 --> 01:54:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's fine, and I can help then once you guys settle on that date.

1360
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:06,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it will be Tuesday the 23rd as part of our regular meeting agenda.

1361
01:54:06,964 --> 01:54:15,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't promise the exact time, but I expect that if we do have those representatives or some of them here, we may take it under suspension earlier in the meeting.

1362
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:19,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And just for clarity, I mean, I'm not opposed to this.

1363
01:54:19,072 --> 01:54:23,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just as a resident literally across the street, my concerns are my family safety.

1364
01:54:24,115 --> 01:54:25,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That is number one top dog.

1365
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's a plan and

1366
01:54:29,018 --> 01:54:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So I work with government myself and sometimes I find that if you package ideas ahead of time, you can help contribute and shape those things versus waiting for the train to hit you and then backpedal.

1367
01:54:42,384 --> 01:54:52,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So my hope is that maybe we can get some engagement locally and have some asks that are constructive to then help the state shape their decision.

1368
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:56,449
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the common word I've heard from the residents.

1369
01:54:56,469 --> 01:55:04,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody's opposing anything, but I think understanding the process, so there's preparation and understanding to it.

1370
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:05,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1371
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1372
01:55:06,251 --> 01:55:06,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1373
01:55:06,451 --> 01:55:07,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else, Mr. Merritt?

1374
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:08,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, thank you.

1375
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:08,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1376
01:55:08,971 --> 01:55:09,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1377
01:55:09,731 --> 01:55:11,252
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get that on the agenda for the 23rd.

1378
01:55:11,812 --> 01:55:14,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else like to speak under public participation?

1379
01:55:14,812 --> 01:55:18,013
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome to come to the podium and give your name and address for the record, please.

1380
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:20,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, City Council.

1381
01:55:21,384 --> 01:55:25,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Brown, 35 Cleveland Street, Medford.

1382
01:55:25,905 --> 01:55:29,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Been a resident for going on three decades.

1383
01:55:30,367 --> 01:55:32,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here about the indoor track.

1384
01:55:32,407 --> 01:55:34,848
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the indoor track at the high school?

1385
01:55:36,389 --> 01:55:45,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 10 years, over a decade, been sounding the alarm about one of the biggest health hazards.

1386
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:59,966
[SPEAKER_00]: in the city of Method, which has been totally ignored by mayors, by superintendent, by director of athletic, and others.

1387
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:05,028
[SPEAKER_00]: The alarm has been sound, needs to be addressed.

1388
01:56:06,189 --> 01:56:13,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to ask that the indoor track renovation be put on the budget.

1389
01:56:14,682 --> 01:56:41,682
[SPEAKER_00]: so that my daughter, who's a sophomore, will have the opportunity to not run on a surface that's concrete with rubber poured on it, that has no cushioning, that has athlete's heel injuries, shin splint over the years, and not been addressed.

1390
01:56:44,633 --> 01:56:48,536
[SPEAKER_00]: We have similar high schools in and around here that we compete against.

1391
01:56:48,576 --> 01:56:58,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville High School has renovated their, found a budget to renovate their indoor track.

1392
01:56:59,086 --> 01:57:03,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're in the running to get some funding.

1393
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:06,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing that for decades about a new school.

1394
01:57:07,713 --> 01:57:08,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is at hand.

1395
01:57:09,275 --> 01:57:10,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do it now.

1396
01:57:12,429 --> 01:57:26,808
[SPEAKER_00]: What alarms me, befuddles me, is the fact that years ago, Lesley University approached us about using our facility.

1397
01:57:26,848 --> 01:57:28,890
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no gym in Cambridge.

1398
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:31,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who made the decision.

1399
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:43,134
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody made the decision, or individuals made the decision, to install a brand new basketball court.

1400
01:57:43,214 --> 01:57:43,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.

1401
01:57:44,754 --> 01:57:48,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial for Medford's basketball team.

1402
01:57:49,415 --> 01:57:54,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the basketball court located?

1403
01:57:56,937 --> 01:57:58,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the gym, where the track is.

1404
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:11,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you took time to install the new basketball court, I think at that time, the indoor track should be addressed.

1405
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't.

1406
01:58:13,936 --> 01:58:14,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So questions are asked.

1407
01:58:15,016 --> 01:58:24,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody looked or investigated or researched or cared?

1408
01:58:25,549 --> 01:58:31,992
[SPEAKER_00]: about these kids to want to say, hey, let's do an assessment of the track.

1409
01:58:32,393 --> 01:58:35,654
[SPEAKER_00]: How much would it cost to renovate the track?

1410
01:58:35,794 --> 01:58:36,635
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be done?

1411
01:58:38,656 --> 01:58:47,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Not allowing, we don't care about our kids, not allowing them the opportunity to really, truly enhance their potential.

1412
01:58:48,261 --> 01:58:51,642
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have an Olympian in our midst.

1413
01:58:53,123 --> 01:58:54,284
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a couple.

1414
01:58:55,293 --> 01:59:05,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Carew, 1932, from Medford High, Los Angeles Olympics, gold medal winner in the 4x1 relay.

1415
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:11,562
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a designate to collect the winning medal at the podium.

1416
01:59:13,343 --> 01:59:24,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Arantxa King, world U champion in high school at Medford High in Marrakesh, Morocco, gold medalist in the jump.

1417
01:59:25,845 --> 01:59:30,346
[SPEAKER_00]: has gone on to represent Bermuda in a couple Olympics.

1418
01:59:30,787 --> 01:59:40,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford grad, ran at the NCAA, is now a lawyer, graduated from Georgetown Law School.

1419
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:45,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy King, state champion, New England champion.

1420
01:59:46,132 --> 01:59:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: You know these three athletes are in the Massachusetts Hall of Fame?

1421
01:59:50,373 --> 01:59:52,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to the Reggie Lewis Center,

1422
01:59:53,462 --> 01:59:56,323
[SPEAKER_00]: the premier high school facility right now.

1423
01:59:57,163 --> 02:00:01,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the wall, ones should educate themselves.

1424
02:00:02,084 --> 02:00:03,644
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the Massachusetts Hall of Fame.

1425
02:00:03,664 --> 02:00:17,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that Arantxa King, right here in Medford, was one of the few athletes ever in Massachusetts to be a two-time winner of the Gatorade Athlete of the Year?

1426
02:00:19,167 --> 02:00:21,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Arantxa King's picture?

1427
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:24,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Randy King's picture?

1428
02:00:25,613 --> 02:00:26,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Mary Carew?

1429
02:00:26,994 --> 02:00:28,555
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids don't know that.

1430
02:00:28,635 --> 02:00:32,158
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be on the wall opposite the Hall of Fame.

1431
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:34,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alarm's been sounding.

1432
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you a little bit here.

1433
02:00:37,462 --> 02:00:39,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to a ton load of people.

1434
02:00:40,845 --> 02:00:42,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written letters.

1435
02:00:42,066 --> 02:00:44,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about the kids.

1436
02:00:45,769 --> 02:00:48,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a health hazard, address it.

1437
02:00:50,192 --> 02:00:50,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the funds.

1438
02:00:52,093 --> 02:00:56,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that we have a few foundations here that we can reach out to?

1439
02:00:56,535 --> 02:01:01,237
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Medford High School grads, Bill Cummings, Medford High School grad.

1440
02:01:04,498 --> 02:01:09,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave some money with his wife at the Science Center for Tufts.

1441
02:01:10,521 --> 02:01:12,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reach out to them.

1442
02:01:12,442 --> 02:01:20,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually spoke with the person that runs that program, a name Michael Bloomberg.

1443
02:01:21,283 --> 02:01:23,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford grad, he has a foundation.

1444
02:01:24,644 --> 02:01:25,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all public knowledge.

1445
02:01:26,525 --> 02:01:27,265
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it takes?

1446
02:01:27,965 --> 02:01:34,908
[SPEAKER_00]: A phone call from somebody, reaching out to them to say, hey, we need some help.

1447
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:38,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our good old friends at Tufts University.

1448
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:41,651
[SPEAKER_00]: New president came in in July.

1449
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:43,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out.

1450
02:01:43,811 --> 02:01:46,712
[SPEAKER_00]: His number is right on the website.

1451
02:01:49,932 --> 02:01:58,418
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need fundraisers, grassroots fundraisers, and Mr. George here, you know, I've spoken to you for years.

1452
02:01:58,498 --> 02:02:05,702
[SPEAKER_00]: My children went to the Somerville, because Medford didn't have one, track field summer camp.

1453
02:02:08,464 --> 02:02:09,185
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta do better.

1454
02:02:10,125 --> 02:02:11,446
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have to do better.

1455
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:13,748
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, to me, this is asinine.

1456
02:02:14,248 --> 02:02:14,909
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a joke.

1457
02:02:15,731 --> 02:02:16,992
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have the health hazard.

1458
02:02:17,012 --> 02:02:20,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people think that high schools don't have indoor tracks.

1459
02:02:21,594 --> 02:02:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of high schools have their tracks at a middle school.

1460
02:02:26,096 --> 02:02:30,439
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, Malden, their indoor track is at their middle school.

1461
02:02:31,759 --> 02:02:33,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go around the state.

1462
02:02:33,941 --> 02:02:36,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been involved in track and field for years.

1463
02:02:37,563 --> 02:02:38,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta do better.

1464
02:02:38,343 --> 02:02:40,044
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta give the kids a chance.

1465
02:02:41,304 --> 02:02:43,866
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, we'll fix the swimming pool,

1466
02:02:45,523 --> 02:02:51,888
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had to upgrade the science section because of regulations up to standards.

1467
02:02:53,889 --> 02:02:57,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the indoor track on the next list.

1468
02:02:58,953 --> 02:02:59,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the budget.

1469
02:03:01,215 --> 02:03:08,560
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need grassroots support, sound the alarm and ask people to fund it.

1470
02:03:11,842 --> 02:03:14,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in touch with the FJ Roberts,

1471
02:03:16,673 --> 02:03:19,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a director of athletics, make a phone call.

1472
02:03:20,795 --> 02:03:26,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Director of athletics at another school gave me the information, because they're entertaining.

1473
02:03:27,518 --> 02:03:28,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can be done?

1474
02:03:29,019 --> 02:03:29,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to dig it up?

1475
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,280
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1476
02:03:32,761 --> 02:03:41,485
[SPEAKER_00]: You put something called the Mondo Surface, Italian company, popular in track and field circles on top

1477
02:03:45,788 --> 02:03:48,429
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how long it takes to get it done?

1478
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:50,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Three weeks.

1479
02:03:52,691 --> 02:04:02,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put the Mondo surface on top of this concrete with rubber, and you have it.

1480
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:13,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowell High School, Newton South, Somerville High, old school schools that have done it.

1481
02:04:15,447 --> 02:04:16,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shut up.

1482
02:04:19,277 --> 02:04:19,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1483
02:04:21,683 --> 02:04:22,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for sharing the information.

1484
02:04:24,642 --> 02:04:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'd all appreciate that.

1485
02:04:26,243 --> 02:04:35,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Councilor Stroud has already received some of the research, and we could certainly look into this on our own, and I'll defer to other Councilors in a minute.

1486
02:04:35,207 --> 02:04:47,653
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the budget and the control of the facilities, this Council doesn't have the power to put anything in the budget, only the Mayor does, and then the control of the facilities does sit with the Director of Athletics, delegated by the Superintendent.

1487
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:52,877
[SPEAKER_06]: but we certainly can ask these same questions and try to push for action.

1488
02:04:53,918 --> 02:04:57,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will go to my fellow Councilors who may have other comments.

1489
02:04:58,162 --> 02:05:00,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Lemingng.

1490
02:05:00,864 --> 02:05:02,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you coming up.

1491
02:05:02,706 --> 02:05:07,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you've been the lone wolf for many years.

1492
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:14,076
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had many discussions about this, and even in Somerville, I know that this is something that

1493
02:05:15,970 --> 02:05:22,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly thought of the process that that was done, that the track was a new track.

1494
02:05:25,155 --> 02:05:33,379
[SPEAKER_04]: My daughter played basketball, so it looked like the surface was done, but I didn't realize it was the same type of issues that we've had in the past.

1495
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:41,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the big call right now is getting the approval to be on the list now for the new high school.

1496
02:05:44,845 --> 02:05:53,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't, there might, you know, if there's something that you brought up an alarming situation when you talk about safety, it's something that you have to look at.

1497
02:05:53,129 --> 02:06:03,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, when even, this is the catch 22 that you came to our forum because you can speak in our forum.

1498
02:06:04,233 --> 02:06:05,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that,

1499
02:06:05,774 --> 02:06:06,975
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate you doing that.

1500
02:06:07,135 --> 02:06:12,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's got to be, unfortunately, the way that's come up, we can't deliberate or send anything out.

1501
02:06:12,557 --> 02:06:16,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this is again, that this is something that I personally make a call tomorrow.

1502
02:06:17,899 --> 02:06:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Brown, I'll talk, I'll talk to the superintendent tomorrow.

1503
02:06:21,161 --> 02:06:22,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to make a phone call tomorrow.

1504
02:06:24,392 --> 02:06:28,693
[SPEAKER_04]: and then find a way to maybe put it on their agenda on the school side.

1505
02:06:28,733 --> 02:06:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if there is something that is something we have to look at for next year and Medford and the track really isn't safe, then we have to look at alternative sites to support the student athletes that maybe you look at a Reggie Lewis Center to book practice space and time.

1506
02:06:49,338 --> 02:06:51,280
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, until you figure out a plan.

1507
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's something that we need to get more information from.

1508
02:06:55,923 --> 02:06:56,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I do.

1509
02:06:56,744 --> 02:06:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call the superintendent tomorrow.

1510
02:06:58,966 --> 02:07:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll call the athletic director tomorrow and get some better understanding of what their process is and what's happening.

1511
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:13,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we can help move you along and give you some insight to help you with this, because it pains me to see you back up here for the same situations over and over again.

1512
02:07:15,532 --> 02:07:26,844
[SPEAKER_04]: sad because I think with the loss of Mr. Maskell, I think he was probably the last advocate for track and field, really, true advocate of track and field at Medford High.

1513
02:07:28,854 --> 02:07:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever I can do, I'll lend my support.

1514
02:07:31,535 --> 02:07:38,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that Somerville does have a new floor, but they're having their own issues as well.

1515
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:44,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to close it at the end of the school year because of the way that it was put down.

1516
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:52,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So throughout the summer, they have to close it to put in industrial humidifiers in there so it doesn't pop up.

1517
02:07:52,224 --> 02:07:53,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's issues everywhere.

1518
02:07:54,885 --> 02:07:55,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that

1519
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:58,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for this situation, you brought up safety.

1520
02:07:58,772 --> 02:08:01,554
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, that's something that can't be overlooked.

1521
02:08:01,754 --> 02:08:05,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So for one person, I'll look at how's the president.

1522
02:08:05,336 --> 02:08:06,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll reach out to the superintendent.

1523
02:08:07,016 --> 02:08:15,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's something I'll request for her to do, if she can, is put it on the next agenda so you can go and speak to the authorities that need to push that along.

1524
02:08:15,501 --> 02:08:16,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the school department.

1525
02:08:17,422 --> 02:08:24,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's something that we need assistance from this body that can ask the mayor for some funding if there is,

1526
02:08:25,686 --> 02:08:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: that has to support our kids that are in a situation like that, because it'd be interesting to see what the athletic trainer has for documentation and data that says how many kids have been ACLs, MCLs, you know, different injuries that happen on different type of surfaces.

1527
02:08:42,248 --> 02:08:45,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with that, I don't think a lot of people are reporting it.

1528
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:50,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing, because that's what the athletic director said over the years.

1529
02:08:51,592 --> 02:08:54,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing, data drives.

1530
02:08:54,113 --> 02:08:55,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, that comes with that.

1531
02:08:55,773 --> 02:08:57,194
[SPEAKER_00]: But you mentioned about Reggie Lewis.

1532
02:08:57,274 --> 02:09:02,175
[SPEAKER_00]: So the school is actually, the league is actually running out of Reggie Lewis.

1533
02:09:06,357 --> 02:09:09,982
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing, but they still have to practice on the surface.

1534
02:09:10,262 --> 02:09:20,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have the notion that they don't practice indoors, they run outside in the wintertime, which is just ridiculous.

1535
02:09:22,057 --> 02:09:24,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to point that out.

1536
02:09:24,259 --> 02:09:28,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think and I appreciate your effort over the years.

1537
02:09:28,723 --> 02:09:29,764
[SPEAKER_00]: This is over a decade.

1538
02:09:29,884 --> 02:09:32,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my oldest daughter ran over a decade.

1539
02:09:32,627 --> 02:09:34,528
[SPEAKER_00]: She's graduated from college this year.

1540
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:36,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how long this is.

1541
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:39,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said I was going to shut my mouth and not say anything.

1542
02:09:39,573 --> 02:09:40,834
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.

1543
02:09:42,779 --> 02:09:46,463
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so appreciate it's the first time I've ever been here.

1544
02:09:47,003 --> 02:10:02,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in meetings with the mayor over the year regarding incidents regarding car park, you don't you don't want to hear that the council doesn't want to hear that with car park and then with other situations with me personally.

1545
02:10:02,297 --> 02:10:04,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that I have to speak with.

1546
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,071
[SPEAKER_00]: the former Chief Sacco?

1547
02:10:07,271 --> 02:10:19,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, like I said, I think that we're looking at, you know, a few years back, a grassroot organization came to me and said, would you be willing to help in a little project called the Field of Dreams?

1548
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, no, there's no way you want to put turf fields behind Bedford High School.

1549
02:10:23,523 --> 02:10:26,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all it needs sometimes, just discussion.

1550
02:10:27,025 --> 02:10:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said, there are avenues out there that we can tap into if that's the case.

1551
02:10:31,288 --> 02:10:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you coming out.

1552
02:10:33,310 --> 02:10:35,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the right now it's the first thing you had.

1553
02:10:35,692 --> 02:10:39,156
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do tonight is understand that there's an issue so we can move forward on that.

1554
02:10:39,216 --> 02:10:39,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1555
02:10:39,976 --> 02:10:41,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go to council.

1556
02:10:41,678 --> 02:10:47,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, first off, I'd like to thank you for coming out here tonight and.

1557
02:10:48,098 --> 02:10:49,699
[SPEAKER_14]: presenting the case.

1558
02:10:49,799 --> 02:10:51,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a few resources I'd like to point out.

1559
02:10:51,739 --> 02:10:56,761
[SPEAKER_14]: So I served on the Community Preservation Committee, which was actually just meeting across the hall from us.

1560
02:10:57,261 --> 02:11:07,385
[SPEAKER_14]: They allocated about $206,000 to repair the Tufts basketball court, which should give kind of an order of magnitude for how much a project like this would cost.

1561
02:11:07,445 --> 02:11:12,686
[SPEAKER_14]: They also allocated part of the funding for the new McGlynn Playground.

1562
02:11:17,728 --> 02:11:38,515
[SPEAKER_14]: project that just broke ground I believe a few days ago and that was being pushed both by one of the assistant superintendents of the school as well as a community member with no official involvement but who just really wanted to push that project through so that so I think that an avenue

1563
02:11:39,936 --> 02:12:00,771
[SPEAKER_14]: really this body, we have the power to approve funding once a project comes forward, and there is a construction company, sufficient planning that has been made for that, but we don't really have the power to just point a magic wand and say that this will be done.

1564
02:12:00,991 --> 02:12:06,695
[SPEAKER_14]: So I also spoke this morning with one of the community

1565
02:12:08,256 --> 02:12:11,837
[SPEAKER_14]: development block grant manager, which is another similar pool of funding.

1566
02:12:12,337 --> 02:12:20,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was actually just asking about trying to flag down more projects exactly like the one you were just talking about right now.

1567
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:30,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would be pleased to meet up with you afterwards or just email you later and just give you the contact information for some of these folks.

1568
02:12:30,563 --> 02:12:32,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think the money is there.

1569
02:12:32,824 --> 02:12:35,585
[SPEAKER_14]: With these sorts of projects, there's always sort of like weird

1570
02:12:36,005 --> 02:12:38,045
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of like eligibility issues.

1571
02:12:38,125 --> 02:12:44,687
[SPEAKER_14]: So like maybe the, you know, if it's like an indoor track, it's only used by students, not the general public, there could be like something going on there.

1572
02:12:44,727 --> 02:12:53,848
[SPEAKER_14]: But generally speaking, this is like for these kind of projects where they take like, you know, a couple hundred thousand dollars and they could be done in like a short enough timeframe.

1573
02:12:53,908 --> 02:12:56,069
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that there's definitely money sitting there for this.

1574
02:12:56,089 --> 02:13:02,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of getting a proposal into the right committees, advocating for them can't be done in three weeks is probably like,

1575
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:07,372
[SPEAKER_14]: a year-long timeline just because of the clock that these sort of things are on.

1576
02:13:07,432 --> 02:13:14,196
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, there are options that you have if you are really interested in repaving the inward track.

1577
02:13:14,216 --> 02:13:15,777
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for bringing it to our attention.

1578
02:13:16,537 --> 02:13:17,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Laming.

1579
02:13:17,357 --> 02:13:18,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

1580
02:13:18,858 --> 02:13:19,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1581
02:13:20,814 --> 02:13:26,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Brown, I want to commend you for being a model resident of Medford because I am so impressed.

1582
02:13:26,696 --> 02:13:36,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm pained to hear that you have been trying to get this done for 10 years, but I am so impressed that you, you know, you're not just complaining about something.

1583
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,461
[SPEAKER_08]: You are talking deeply about the issue.

1584
02:13:38,841 --> 02:13:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: You have looked into how it could be funded.

1585
02:13:40,562 --> 02:13:42,804
[SPEAKER_08]: You have looked into the proper surface that needs to be done.

1586
02:13:42,844 --> 02:13:44,425
[SPEAKER_08]: You have looked into what other cities have done.

1587
02:13:44,725 --> 02:13:47,986
[SPEAKER_08]: You have truly looked at what the solutions should be.

1588
02:13:49,227 --> 02:13:51,468
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am also very happy to help.

1589
02:13:51,668 --> 02:13:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will, you know, in conjunction with Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Mulroney.

1590
02:13:59,193 --> 02:13:59,753
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1591
02:13:59,793 --> 02:14:02,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm happy to help in any way I can.

1592
02:14:02,134 --> 02:14:05,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do, I know this is not a simple

1593
02:14:05,894 --> 02:14:06,254
[SPEAKER_08]: issue.

1594
02:14:06,594 --> 02:14:21,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do hope that Medford can become a city that can respond to people like you, to people who come to us with well-thought-out proposals that they have already dug into the solutions for and already done a lot of that work.

1595
02:14:21,523 --> 02:14:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the point that that has happened, we really need to be able to say yes to our residents.

1596
02:14:26,446 --> 02:14:42,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That is how we engage people in the political process when someone, I mean it's a miracle that you're still here 10 years later, because normally when people come and they propose these well thought out solutions, and they're told no or they simply get nothing, they will go away they never come back.

1597
02:14:45,532 --> 02:14:59,083
[SPEAKER_08]: the best thing our city can do to take these amazing solutions that are provided by people who genuinely care about a specific issue and to find ways to incorporate those into a solution that we can make happen.

1598
02:14:59,103 --> 02:15:06,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really hoping that we can do it, not just for your issue, but more broadly for folks in Medford who want to engage in the political process in this way.

1599
02:15:06,428 --> 02:15:07,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1600
02:15:08,166 --> 02:15:09,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1601
02:15:10,027 --> 02:15:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Brown.

1602
02:15:10,788 --> 02:15:22,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we will find between the research that you've done and the advocacy that you've done and some of the resources that we've had here, I'm hoping some sort of meeting or collaboration or effort to at least advance the ball in some direction.

1603
02:15:23,277 --> 02:15:31,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So and if necessary, if anyone after your discussions wants to put something on for a future agenda for official action as well.

1604
02:15:31,263 --> 02:15:34,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think even just the meeting of the minds here and the discussions so far,

1605
02:15:35,701 --> 02:15:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: could lead to some progress.

1606
02:15:37,582 --> 02:15:39,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to my fellow councillors.

1607
02:15:39,303 --> 02:15:41,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming tonight in public participation.

1608
02:15:41,284 --> 02:15:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone else on Zoom or in the chamber who would like to participate in public participation?

1609
02:15:54,472 --> 02:15:57,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, public participation is concluded.

1610
02:15:57,694 --> 02:15:59,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Vice President Collins.

1611
02:16:00,215 --> 02:16:01,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Bears.

1612
02:16:01,096 --> 02:16:02,917
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion to take from the table papers

1613
02:16:03,724 --> 02:16:09,430
[SPEAKER_10]: 23463 and 22605, both for a third reading.

1614
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:23,563
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to take the papers for 224—23-463, the City Water System Bond Order, and 22-605, the Solid Waste Ordinance, off the table, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1615
02:16:24,083 --> 02:16:24,684
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favour?

1616
02:16:24,884 --> 02:16:25,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1617
02:16:25,865 --> 02:16:26,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1618
02:16:26,646 --> 02:16:28,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1619
02:16:28,387 --> 02:16:30,608
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-463 City Water System Bond Order.

1620
02:16:30,688 --> 02:16:37,032
[SPEAKER_06]: This was in City Council December 12, 2023, and was approved for first reading on December 12, 2023.

1621
02:16:37,593 --> 02:16:46,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It was advertised for second reading in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal on December 21, 2023, and is eligible for third reading tonight, January 9, 2024.

1622
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:52,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we have come from a prior council to a new council, I will just add this is a bond order for

1623
02:16:53,703 --> 02:17:08,409
[SPEAKER_06]: the Water and Sewer Department to take out, I believe it's through the interest-free MWRA loan program bonding funds to improve our water and sewer infrastructure, which from some of our discussions, I know folks know is not in the best of conditions.

1624
02:17:08,769 --> 02:17:10,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is what that is.

1625
02:17:10,730 --> 02:17:14,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all me.

1626
02:17:15,272 --> 02:17:20,194
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for third reading, seconded by

1627
02:17:21,761 --> 02:17:25,344
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by, I saw Emily, I saw Councilor Lazzaro's hand.

1628
02:17:25,364 --> 02:17:27,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go with Councilor Lazzaro.

1629
02:17:28,787 --> 02:17:30,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1630
02:17:43,419 --> 02:17:44,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

1631
02:17:46,161 --> 02:17:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins.

1632
02:17:47,322 --> 02:17:47,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1633
02:17:47,843 --> 02:17:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1634
02:17:48,803 --> 02:17:49,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1635
02:17:49,864 --> 02:17:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lemingng.

1636
02:17:51,445 --> 02:17:52,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1637
02:17:52,129 --> 02:17:52,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1638
02:17:52,954 --> 02:17:54,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng yes, President Bears.

1639
02:17:55,543 --> 02:17:58,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1640
02:17:58,704 --> 02:18:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: The ordinance is approved for third, or the bond order is approved for third reading.

1641
02:18:02,865 --> 02:18:05,946
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-605, the solid waste ordinance.

1642
02:18:06,486 --> 02:18:08,106
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had several committee meetings on it.

1643
02:18:08,507 --> 02:18:14,248
[SPEAKER_06]: The final draft appeared in city council December 12th, 2023, and was approved for first reading on the same date.

1644
02:18:14,928 --> 02:18:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It was advertised for second reading on December 28th, 2023 in the Medford Transcript and Summerville Journal, and it's eligible for third reading this evening.

1645
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:24,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, for our fellow councilors, this is

1646
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:26,693
[SPEAKER_06]: an update to the solid waste ordinance.

1647
02:18:26,713 --> 02:18:33,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the updated draft was circulated to members of the body at the request of Councilor, Vice President Collins.

1648
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:41,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything you want to say on this one, I know you worked on this pretty hard for several months.

1649
02:18:43,285 --> 02:18:44,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Bears.

1650
02:18:44,106 --> 02:18:47,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Just by way of quick recap for the new Councilors in the room.

1651
02:18:48,951 --> 02:18:55,559
