18
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:48,457
[SPEAKER_00]: The agenda for today is as approved by the committee on February 4th, 2024, item number 2024-8.

19
00:01:52,278 --> 00:02:17,213
[SPEAKER_00]: be it resolved that the medford school committee will establish an ad hoc subcommittee to establish a process and norms around annual handbook review for the resolution passed unanimously on 11 20 22 2024 which was item 2023-26 and if anybody hasn't lost yet i'm impressed that one said be it resolved that the subcommittee will establish at the february 5th school committee meeting

20
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:26,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little late, and we'll work to complete the process as close to the original deadline of April 1st, 2024 as reasonably possible.

21
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take the role in Tapa present.

22
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I felt present.

23
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:39,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So present 3 present, we have a quorum, so.

24
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:52,342
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our charges to draft a document, in other words, a policy about how we would like to proceed with our handbook reviews each year and.

25
00:02:55,057 --> 00:03:02,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I did search other school systems and not surprisingly slash not surprisingly, actually, I couldn't find anything.

26
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:05,502
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.

27
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So the law does require us to approve them each year.

28
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:14,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guess is some years we do it in Medford, some years we don't.

29
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:21,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm betting that a lot of school systems are in the same boat, but hopefully we can lay that down and that.

30
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a draft.

31
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have been writing today that I will share.

32
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:48,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, is there any history that we need to know about about how this has been done in the past other than inconsistently in terms or in terms of timeline where the administration this year we got a packet full of policies slash draft policies with the final draft forthcoming?

33
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:49,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

34
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,237
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do that.

35
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:51,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, because

36
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,651
[SPEAKER_00]: while there's nobody watching right this moment, there might be somebody in YouTube, and certainly people might watch this later.

37
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:16,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the intent is that school councils will draft a recommended update to the handbook, and then those will come to the school committee for approval, presumably in the spring, for the following school year.

38
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:25,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that historically in Medford there, I remember one time approving handbooks, maybe two times in my seven years.

39
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:30,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of like, here are the handbooks, you have to approve them, okay.

40
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:36,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were at that time, they were all very different handbooks.

41
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:41,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously middle schools and high schools and elementary schools have different handbooks.

42
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,696
[SPEAKER_00]: But for all four elementary schools to have different handbooks was kind of,

43
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:50,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just that they were formatted differently with different fonts and colors.

44
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:55,837
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actually some policy and content differences that could not be correct.

45
00:04:55,997 --> 00:05:04,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the Met for Public Schools, the school committee has a policy, and in some of the books it was the policy, and others it was...

46
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:09,724
[SPEAKER_00]: something drafted long ago or by a principal or a superintendent.

47
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,186
[SPEAKER_00]: So the need to clean that up has been an ongoing process.

48
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will say that we are in much better place now than then.

49
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:21,169
[SPEAKER_00]: The elementary school handbooks, for the most part, are the same.

50
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Content-wise, I believe they're pretty much the same.

51
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of them is still formatted very differently, but honestly, that is not a hill to die on.

52
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:34,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a guess as to which one that is, but... We don't need to talk about that.

53
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:37,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have it in front of me as well.

54
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:49,700
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, I do honestly feel like format and, you know, like some schools have, they're named after a person, others are named after a river, you know, like to have your handbooks look different.

55
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:51,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get behind that.

56
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,302
[SPEAKER_00]: But the content,

57
00:05:54,242 --> 00:06:00,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Needs to comply with policy law regulations, et cetera.

58
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:05,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of the point of this meeting is to get a process in place.

59
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:12,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we review things, 1st of all, we know that all of the handbooks we've approved are in fact.

60
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,587
[SPEAKER_00]: complying with that stuff.

61
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:26,521
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's always more interesting things like, you know, how does each school handle a drop-off in the morning and pick up and, you know, every school's got a different physical structure, so those would be different, but

62
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:34,639
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of the baseline stuff that we need to make sure we have and that we are doing the approval that we're supposed to do.

63
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number one most important thing is that we are supposed to, by law, put our signature on these things.

64
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:46,144
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to lay that out tonight, how we get there.

65
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,006
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you see this OK?

66
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:52,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

67
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:59,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am drafting a different policy, which we're not here to discuss tonight.

68
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:05,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just happened to have it was a schedule timeline kind of a policy, which I'm not going to tell you about because of open meeting law.

69
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,738
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realized that it was sort of useful here.

70
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's.

71
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:20,402
[SPEAKER_00]: three phases in this that I, in my mind, obviously this is a dialogue between us, there's the initiation of the update process.

72
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:27,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these are dates that I just sort of like walked back in my mind when I thought would make sense.

73
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:34,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I do expect the administration to have opinions on this, and we can change the dates, obviously, during the regular meeting.

74
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:46,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, sometime between August 1st and September 30th, the process will begin, and this is to begin the handbook update for the following school year.

75
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:52,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that the superintendent will create a digital versions of each school handbook.

76
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:57,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I know using the word digital here is kind of annoying, but I just want to make sure we are clear.

77
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:02,137
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not talking about printing huge binders of paper that were

78
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:03,998
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting to get anywhere.

79
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:11,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just a copy of the current, this is the current handbook that will be in use this particular school year that this is happening.

80
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:25,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use dates, I'm just going to say during school year 2024, which began in 2023, this would be that the current handbook we're using right now.

81
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:26,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So then

82
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: the superintendent's office, and this is one thing where I'm not clear if maybe it's somebody else in her office or whatever, but that these copies, which I'm calling drafts, will be updated.

83
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:51,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in the office will go through them, looking at school committee policy that has changed within the last year, any district policy and for the uninitiated.

84
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:51,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

85
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: school committees have a lot of authority over policy.

86
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:08,586
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the law is written is that if we do not actually say what our policy is, then the superintendent is the policymaker.

87
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Just anything the superintendent says,

88
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,682
[SPEAKER_00]: goes as policy and obviously within the law.

89
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:23,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I've separated them out here because there are plenty of things for which we may have a policy on or we may make a statement about what we expect and want.

90
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,409
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's lots of things we don't.

91
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether we should or not is unrelated to this conversation.

92
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:31,493
[SPEAKER_00]: But so then district policy is.

93
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:42,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to put superintendent because sometimes it actually ends up being the principal or it could be at a departmental level of like a science policy.

94
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I just put district.

95
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:49,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think the word district, it might be a better word, but I don't know what it is.

96
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:58,089
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, any of the changes that have to happen because of changing policies, laws, regulations, legal rulings,

97
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:04,028
[SPEAKER_00]: those need to just be put into the drafts by the central office.

98
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:12,471
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want seven or eight schools running around trying to find out what legal rulings there were this year, what school committee policies changed.

99
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just silly.

100
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be school councils doing that.

101
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just volunteers from the school.

102
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the right way to go.

103
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's teachers too.

104
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:24,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So a draft,

105
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:36,047
[SPEAKER_00]: that incorporates all of that stuff will be created by the central office, a memorandum detailing each of those changes.

106
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:49,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do not mean, I don't think anybody here expects to include in the memorandum corrections to spelling and punctuation and, you know, but each substantive change, there should be an explanation for what it is.

107
00:10:53,646 --> 00:11:06,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a copy of the handbooks originally, which are the current operating handbooks, the draft one, the memorandum explaining the changes, and a copy of this policy will be sent to each school principal.

108
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Roberts will get their version of their handbook with the

109
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:14,046
[SPEAKER_00]: required things and each of the schools will too.

110
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:23,669
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each of the handbooks do not necessarily contain, you know, the high school handbook may contain things that the elementary one does not and vice versa.

111
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the initiation of the process.

112
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,251
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect administration will have some tweaks to this and, you know,

113
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:38,229
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is it starts within some reasonable timeframe.

114
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:53,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important things in my personal opinion are this memorandum of changes so that we are not being asked at the end of this to read a whole manual from a school and just guess what changed from the previous year.

115
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an impossible task.

116
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, those things go over to the principal.

117
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:13,689
[SPEAKER_00]: The school councils and outlining how school councils get created and all that other business that's all the schools have them already they are expected to draft.

118
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,450
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm calling the recommended handbook.

119
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go through it, they'll have the document that includes all of the changes that had to happen.

120
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:38,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are not changes that the school council is expected to, I mean, they'll have opinions on, I mean, everybody has opinions, but these are not changes they're gonna, if the superintendent makes an update because school committee changed the policy, the school council doesn't undo it.

121
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:49,751
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this is just they can make all of the other changes that they want and there are many changes school councils recommend so they will go through the handbook.

122
00:12:50,411 --> 00:13:00,234
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be confused about why this language suddenly changed because it will be in the memorandum explaining it and they will generate what's called.

123
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:02,556
[SPEAKER_00]: John, go ahead.

124
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so quick question.

125
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:06,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess more of like a point of clarification.

126
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming this is sort of the point, the school council's made up of like students, staff, faculty.

127
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:23,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the point for them to kind of give their feedback on like, we're finding that this isn't working or this, like we've noticed this uptake in this and we need to do something about it.

128
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:27,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is this the community's chance to sort of

129
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:41,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, he's back into not feedback the school council's responsible for providing us that it's you know, I mean they may provide us they there's also this school council changes memorandum.

130
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they make a change.

131
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,554
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a substantive change.

132
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really struggling with examples.

133
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a substantive change.

134
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Not again, not regarding the laws and policies and regulation stuff.

135
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,804
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a change to the handbook and.

136
00:13:57,824 --> 00:14:00,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's about arrival and dismissal.

137
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:02,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, thank you.

138
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:11,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not controversial, they're just gonna say, we've changed this and the principal and everybody thinks this is gonna work better.

139
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one sentence and everybody's happy.

140
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:21,693
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anything more challenging, then I can certainly see dialogue going on there.

141
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:29,836
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal here is also that the school councils don't have to come and stand before us as a school committee hours on one night.

142
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,797
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not expected of them.

143
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:34,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not reasonable.

144
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:44,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they have a concern about a school committee policy, that would be raised outside of this process.

145
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

146
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,443
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have a concern, but the policy change isn't going to happen in time for this.

147
00:14:52,924 --> 00:15:02,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm more thinking about when the users of the handbook can give feedback on what they're seeing made, when that period would be essential.

148
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if that was the time for it or not.

149
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:12,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the school councils, I think, are constantly in that mode all year long.

150
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've not been on a school council, but I imagine that things are piling up.

151
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:23,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's time to start this work, they've got their pile of things that they need to work through.

152
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:30,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's between them and, well, the principal is part of the school council, I believe.

153
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:33,174
[SPEAKER_00]: The listing is in the law, but I forgot it.

154
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:41,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but so this is, you know, this is in every way divorced from school committee so far.

155
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:53,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll create a memorandum as well that just explains their changes, not the required changes, and then they will send that recommended handbook

156
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:59,491
[SPEAKER_00]: and the memorandum to the superintendent for review and submission to us.

157
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:06,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put it in here that the superintendent may have opinions on it, but my thoughts on that are this.

158
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:13,351
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent and central administration staff are not 16, 25, 40 people.

159
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:24,981
[SPEAKER_00]: If a school council and a principal have all approved this, I can't foresee the central administration sitting down to review and decide whether they agree on everything.

160
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:32,707
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's a universe of endless availability of time and resources that doesn't exist in most places, I'm sure.

161
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:36,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so I just want it to be like, superintendent gets it,

162
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:41,432
[SPEAKER_00]: The review is if the superintendent really even wants to review it and getting it to us.

163
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is our review.

164
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:53,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a pretty big timeframe here, but I did want to make sure it happens before we're in May.

165
00:16:54,057 --> 00:17:07,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So for school committee members and you both are, this is your first term, but May has many names in school committee council, school committee circles, because that is when we get 750 invitations to

166
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:21,569
[SPEAKER_00]: every performance at every grade, at every school, at every art show, and every presentation from the social studies and the humanities, and every single award ceremony.

167
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:28,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And May is both joyful and absolutely impossible for school committee members.

168
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:35,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, thinking about all the other responsibilities we have, I want this thing to be out of the way before May hits.

169
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Because May, I like May.

170
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,735
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're able to just focus on the students and the successes of that school year.

171
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:51,982
[SPEAKER_00]: If we also have to fit in countless other meetings, which we do, but let's limit it if we can.

172
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so that's the purpose of the timeline.

173
00:17:54,484 --> 00:18:02,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put that the item on the agenda would be review and approval of school year, and then obviously the number of handbooks,

174
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:17,900
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be put on a regular school committee meeting, digital copies of the handbook prior to changes, the recommended handbook, the mandatory changes memorandum and the school council's changes memorandum will be in our packets.

175
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:28,106
[SPEAKER_00]: School committee will take action such as approval amendments or postpone approval to a subsequent meeting or subcommittee meeting.

176
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I can envision that like,

177
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:37,087
[SPEAKER_00]: early on, you know, the first year, maybe even first two years, we may be like, this takes a lot more time.

178
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:51,074
[SPEAKER_00]: But ideally, after we've done this, maybe even only one year, we'll be like, we'll all know to flip to the memorandum, we'll read the memorandum, we'll be like, oh, okay, well, that all makes sense, both of the memorandums.

179
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:58,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we won't be going line by line through, you know, dense handbooks from multiple schools.

180
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously people are free to do what they want with their time.

181
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:10,942
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that obviously the first time you ever review a handbook, it's probably a good idea to read the whole thing.

182
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:20,549
[SPEAKER_00]: But considering most of the content doesn't change, it's not a very efficient use of anybody's time to read it again from scratch.

183
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but in the event that, you know, like title,

184
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Title IX, is that the one that's got major changes that just happened?

185
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:37,398
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be lots of changes that will come into our handbooks.

186
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:50,870
[SPEAKER_00]: We may, and how that language gets transmitted from the law, I think that's regulation, but how it gets transmitted from the regulation into language that the superintendent is putting into the manual.

187
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:57,151
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have a real interesting set of conversations that need to be happening.

188
00:19:57,351 --> 00:20:03,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be like we send that to a committee of the whole.

189
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:14,913
[SPEAKER_00]: or subcommittee just to discuss that specific piece, like how this really works in Medford or what we think.

190
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:17,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, a lot of times we will have no choice.

191
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:26,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that during the previous presidential administration, there were changes and we did not like them, but we also didn't have a decision.

192
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,584
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no decision making for us to do.

193
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make sure we had it out.

194
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:36,549
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of this meeting, we will do one of these things.

195
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,255
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we eventually do approve them.

196
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:58,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you wanna discuss this, but since we were just talking about this phase three, step three, sounds like we're talking about approval of handbooks as a whole once all of the discrepancies.

197
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:06,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's an item that needs discussion in subcommittee, that handbook is not approved rather than everything approved except for this section.

198
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:10,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a cleaner way to do this.

199
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:13,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we only can approve the whole handbook.

200
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:20,661
[SPEAKER_00]: we can amend it, but, so is there a better wording for that, you think?

201
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:30,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's just an added sentence around each handbook will be approved.

202
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:38,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, let me ask, I assume we're approving handbooks one at a, can we approve one handbook at a time?

203
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:39,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We can approve one at a time.

204
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,015
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just say they're all good and go.

205
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but to say, you know,

206
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:51,630
[SPEAKER_02]: approved by the school committee will be per handbook?

207
00:21:52,430 --> 00:22:00,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we say singular complete approval, meaning it has to be a complete approval of a singular handbook?

208
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:05,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Could that phrasing just before approval make sense, or is there some caveat?

209
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:11,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind that, except in a lot of other districts, all the elementary schools have one handbook.

210
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of value to that.

211
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:21,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was the question I asked on April 8th that sent us down a little spiral, and I just walked it back because it was late.

212
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:27,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I mean, singular, complete.

213
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,449
[SPEAKER_01]: By singular, I mean like this is the McGlynn handbook.

214
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:31,450
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Brooks handbook.

215
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,312
[SPEAKER_01]: If we approve one of them, that is a singular complete approval.

216
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:39,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be in whole.

217
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:45,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good message.

218
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:55,420
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, both all of us as well as the future school committee members will be like, what did they mean?

219
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we, how do we do that?

220
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,883
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's the whole purpose of this meeting so we can stop that conversation.

221
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:04,346
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

222
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:10,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there ever a scenario when we send a handbook back to a school saying fix this?

223
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a, you are invited to this subcommittee meeting to discuss this handbook?

224
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,680
[SPEAKER_02]: What does?

225
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:24,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the school council's approval of the handbook is procedural.

226
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:26,427
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, that doesn't make it this handbook.

227
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:30,470
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think sending it back is a thing.

228
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,895
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can change what, within the, you know, excluding the legal stuff, but,

229
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:50,995
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being collaborative, I would certainly much rather us be like, let's invite them over to discuss this in a subcommittee, rather than just whole cloth, like tearing out something that they took pains to create.

230
00:23:51,015 --> 00:24:00,819
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that that's not really ever something we want, unless, you know, in the weird situation where as a council creates something and as a committee, we just

231
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:07,721
[SPEAKER_00]: a majority of us disagree, and we could make such a change.

232
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:16,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we've done that before, but again, we've also not approved in a meaningful way before, so.

233
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it seems to me the main thing, the role that school committee has here, or possibly the superintendent, I guess this is my question at the end of

234
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:40,207
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of phase two here, this point three, the second part, or the first part of it, the school council will send the handbook and memorandum to the superintendent for review.

235
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:44,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to specify what that review entails?

236
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:56,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's just sign off, but maybe it's the question about in one and two, because the only time the handbook becomes a problem, and I've certainly received questions from parents about this, is if they perceive that

237
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:03,522
[SPEAKER_02]: an enforcement of a policy, which is kind of what the handbook lays out, is in conflict with the policy itself.

238
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's doing that reconciliation?

239
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably it's happening in one... Or is that just what needs to happen in that first review and then the memorandum of changes says...

240
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:31,877
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to make sure that this section, I guess I think there are relevant sections of the handbook that relate to new policy, law, regulation, et cetera.

241
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the memorandum is meant to do, is to say we changed the, I had this, we changed

242
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:47,824
[SPEAKER_02]: the discipline to match the new bullying policy.

243
00:25:49,404 --> 00:26:00,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Or when the out-of-school suspension, when the suspensions policy changed, to say, we changed the discipline section of our handbook to comply with this.

244
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:01,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Who checks that?

245
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:03,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, right.

246
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the,

247
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:24,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we assume, for instance, that there's nothing, when the superintendent in the first section is making updates, let's say that the superintendent does not feel that there's any conflict in that particular school's manual and that there's no update required.

248
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:33,813
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about school councils is they are volunteers and they are, and with anything where there's a volunteer

249
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,805
[SPEAKER_00]: where you rely on volunteers, there's gonna be people who, the people who volunteer are interested.

250
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:44,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And why people are interested varies very greatly.

251
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:54,857
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be people, there could be a whole pile of people who are volunteering for school councils right now because they disagree with how we did discipline policies.

252
00:26:55,718 --> 00:27:02,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they draft language around that, they may interpret our policies in ways that

253
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,223
[SPEAKER_00]: As a majority of the school committee does not see that that is how we did it.

254
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:07,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

255
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:11,786
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the thing about language.

256
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:21,749
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how hard we try to be as precise and clear as we can be, there's honest interpretation involved.

257
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's, of course, always, you know, not good faith interpretation involved.

258
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:36,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my mind, when it's, if there's something going on in a handbook that is not a good faith interpretation of what we,

259
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:44,260
[SPEAKER_00]: have in policy, well, then we would, you know, use our authority to make the change to the handbook.

260
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:51,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, my hope is that that's just not a regular occurrence or something we really need to worry about.

261
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:55,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I am grateful to these school councils that there's all this extra work that they're doing.

262
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:58,769
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's some of our staff.

263
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but there's always going to be

264
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,811
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity for disagreement between the school council and the school committee.

265
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:16,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the law lays out this whole process, it is our approval that is required.

266
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:23,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, at least I'm pretty sure that's the case, it is really up to us what they say.

267
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:28,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nobody writing the law was gonna say school committee sit down and write a school manuals every year.

268
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:31,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's...

269
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:33,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the root of that.

270
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:42,442
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, like a superintendent could also read the changes and be like, that doesn't really comply with the intent of the policy.

271
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you asking them to do that before they send it to us?

272
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not asking them to do that.

273
00:28:51,379 --> 00:29:03,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that that's, in a district where we had endless resources and that might be a thing, but none of us believe that that's coming anytime soon.

274
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:13,510
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would certainly I would be happy if the superintendent's office had the capacity to read all of these things and really confirm that they comply with all of our policies.

275
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,553
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's a huge, huge undertaking.

276
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:28,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that getting us through this the first time is the part that's going to be hard because it's going to be more work for every single

277
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:30,087
[SPEAKER_00]: group involved.

278
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:41,392
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that once we're through it once, it should be dramatically easier, aside from the fact that there'll be examples of what the memorandums should look like.

279
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:46,714
[SPEAKER_00]: People will perhaps number their sections of their handbooks so they can refer to them.

280
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:48,534
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be page numbers everywhere.

281
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:56,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those things just happen naturally when you have to start writing about another document in a document.

282
00:29:58,612 --> 00:30:00,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And that won't be easy the first time.

283
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:08,628
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, like like anything, like all policy, like, you know, we go through this, we do it for a year and we're like, oh, that just stunk.

284
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,930
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we thinking?

285
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change it is, you know.

286
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:20,367
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely happy to change it, happy to throw it all away if it turns out it was just not a good idea.

287
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:28,011
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing to me is that we can approve these handbooks and approve them knowing what we're approving.

288
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:31,813
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, that's sort of the unfair thing.

289
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:34,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on Friday we get 400 pages of

290
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Handbooks, like I'm a slow reader, but I think for fast readers to get through it by Monday is a challenge.

291
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Memorandums, I think, is perfect.

292
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,239
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what's changed.

293
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your track changes of the.

294
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:58,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love us, we could just use track changes, but I don't want us to get into the specifics of the technology.

295
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:09,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also requires that school councils are all using Google and then they don't necessarily have Google accounts with the district and it just goes wild from there.

296
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

297
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:26,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I think one thing that we do need the superintendent's office to do unless this is us, but is to confirm consistency across elementary schools right if one elementary school makes a change to something.

298
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:33,536
[SPEAKER_02]: that affects the other ones or the two middle schools.

299
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:38,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I might have missed it, but one of them seems to have a homework policy and the other doesn't.

300
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems like a problem in equity for students of making expectations clear.

301
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:52,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I might just have missed it in this as I flipped through this large binder that we got.

302
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:59,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that, a new phase three, superintendent, I'm just gonna put that as.

303
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, what is the superintendent review?

304
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do think, if you get a memorandum that says you need to change this to comply with that policy and one school changes it in one way and another changes it in a different way, or is this first memorandum saying, no, no, this needs to change in this specific way?

305
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:44,559
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah I mean I think we're going to say that all handbooks have that you know I think there's an important there's a useful conversation to have we don't have to have it this year about should each elementary school have should there be a Medford elementary schools expectations and then school specific procedures should there be one elementary school handbook with

306
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:50,257
[SPEAKER_02]: an addendum for the Roberts, for the Missituk, for the McGlynn.

307
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:56,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think there's some consistency that needs to happen.

308
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,919
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a heck of a job for the first time through.

309
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's right.

310
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:13,981
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that, just making it number four instead of a whole other... That makes sense.

311
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:14,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

312
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:16,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

313
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,827
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really important point and one that has come up many times in my time as well.

314
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:28,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's handbooks, the recess and homework.

315
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:29,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

316
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:51,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, those are the three things I think we hear about consistency on levels, consistency across schools, consistency between school protocol and official policy, and then consistency between what parents are told verbally in the moment and what's written down in one or another location.

317
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:03,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So this process can't address all of that, but it can address the consistency across schools with alignment with official policy.

318
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:04,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

319
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:08,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you just said something reminds me, like we want to make sure also that this policy is

320
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:15,832
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if all the handbooks were perfect today, we'd want this to still be the policy and we don't have to like keep coming back and changing it.

321
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:21,114
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and that's why I like that consistency language.

322
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:34,558
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the superintendent can, with this first phase, which I don't honestly know that happens at all right now, but if this first phase isn't happening and it begins to happen,

323
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,420
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean the superintendent herself, but under her direction.

324
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,222
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cleanup of inconsistent language can happen.

325
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,464
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to create a draft to send to them.

326
00:34:50,984 --> 00:34:58,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's already corrected in there, kind of getting out ahead of it.

327
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a process between her and I think the principals and school councils.

328
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,300
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?

329
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:23,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to double check that there were tables of contents and everything, which there aren't.

330
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:24,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.

331
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we mandate any parts of handbooks that every handbook must have this section or?

332
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:29,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

333
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:31,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

334
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:34,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if that's part of this policy.

335
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we that might be a very

336
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:50,802
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be a resolution we should work on is that we will draft a handbook schema or whatever the right word would be.

337
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:55,064
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we do it for our agendas and for other things.

338
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,885
[SPEAKER_00]: We say like, this is the structure we want.

339
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:04,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, you know, some handbooks, you open it up and there'll be like, vast general law quoted.

340
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:08,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think most everybody can agree that

341
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:20,572
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if you wanna include it, put it in an appendix, but in fact, maybe just don't put it at all and just say what the law number is, because exactly two people per year are gonna read it.

342
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:27,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do know people are looking and saying, look, this says right here.

343
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:30,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it can be at the end.

344
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely at the end, but I don't.

345
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,581
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability of our handbooks, some of them is,

346
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:38,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, because some of these have federal laws included.

347
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:44,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these say, we've included the policies we think are most relevant to elementary school students.

348
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nobody says, here, go to this website, which who would want to, knowing that website where our policies live?

349
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:53,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

350
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,270
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's true.

351
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think a nice,

352
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:00,749
[SPEAKER_00]: addendum would be great.

353
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:04,790
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them, it's very much like, welcome to this school.

354
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:12,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see language on the Mass General Law website, and you're just like, what does that even say?

355
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:15,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not welcoming.

356
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:19,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that handbooks really do need to be welcoming.

357
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:29,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember who I was recently talking to about this, but they're like, you should open the handbook and read the first page and have a really a strong sense already of your expectations as a student.

358
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:39,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it shouldn't be that you have to go 42 pages in, start to kind of grasp what's expected of you because nobody reads the whole thing.

359
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:43,238
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different conversation, I think.

360
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:50,840
[SPEAKER_00]: either for another policy or just for the councils to have themselves.

361
00:37:51,520 --> 00:38:00,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the high school principal is actually working on a whole new format for that one.

362
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't seen it or anything, but I'd be very interested.

363
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the one that they gave us has a bunch of yellow highlighting that says this is changing.

364
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:15,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this is to prevent some of that from happening too.

365
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:24,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's helpful when policy respects all of the people in the process as people who have lives and other things to do.

366
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:34,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got that binder that the rest of us got, it didn't, it frankly just didn't feel very respectful.

367
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:41,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, we're gonna go through this and know what's different this year from last year.

368
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:50,974
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to be unfair to anybody, but like this, the process as it's currently happening is not respectful of anybody's time.

369
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:53,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

370
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:03,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I will say when it comes time for me to review, I like having it in hard copy.

371
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,099
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not saying we couldn't get hard copies.

372
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:07,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just.

373
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:19,227
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, do you want to read four elementary school handbooks when in fact, much of it will be the same?

374
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,309
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fast reader though, I think.

375
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:36,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but is that, and then I guess in phase three here, we haven't said, so it says the school committee will receive copies and we will approve it, amend it, or?

376
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:39,190
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss further.

377
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean everyone is reading every handbook?

378
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:50,822
[SPEAKER_00]: What's... Well, honestly, the first, I mean, that is sort of the expectation that everyone is reading every handbook.

379
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:56,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my mind, once we've done this once, everyone will just need to read the memorandums.

380
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that...

381
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:11,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess is that a separate question in terms of onboarding new members is you should have the handbook so you know what's happening in the schools on paper.

382
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, we've talked about onboarding of new members.

383
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:22,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move, don't mind my screen going, my video going out because I need to plug in.

384
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,292
[SPEAKER_00]: The onboarding of new members has been a topic.

385
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:31,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I have a Google Doc with a very long list of things for new members.

386
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:34,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send some of the things out.

387
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:43,443
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that there's too much.

388
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:47,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And so figuring out how to deal with that is a problem.

389
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,870
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much.

390
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,552
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I mean, I would say it's an impossible list of things.

391
00:40:57,852 --> 00:41:05,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you go to a school committee conference and when you go to the, the, the, the, the.

392
00:41:05,456 --> 00:41:06,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Charting the course.

393
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Charting the course.

394
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:12,459
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a, I'm pretty sure it's a conversation that happens.

395
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:18,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been to several of them, but you know, there's this whole concept of becoming an effective school committee member and it's,

396
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:28,114
[SPEAKER_00]: It can sound a bit snotty or snooty, and it's not meant that way.

397
00:41:28,294 --> 00:41:38,160
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the depth and breadth of knowledge you need to bring all year long to every conversation and things that are changing is frankly staggering.

398
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:45,858
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is like you're adding more each year you're in office.

399
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:58,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, I don't believe, and I would doubt anybody who says otherwise, nobody in the history of school committees has been elected and been effective immediately, maybe on an issue.

400
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:07,118
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, but not like on the breadth of things that we are required to approve.

401
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,563
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our list of presentations on our policy manual is several pages long.

402
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:17,387
[SPEAKER_00]: We're supposed to receive all of those each year and all of us are supposed to understand and approve them.

403
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:21,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you a while just to read the list.

404
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:33,839
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that what we decide to include in onboarding, which I know we're slightly off topic, is something we might want to have a subcommittee meeting on at some point, a different one.

405
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how do you bring people up to speed so they are effective as quickly as possible?

406
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:45,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the truth is, is the whole committee benefits when the new members are effective as quickly as possible.

407
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:47,109
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do, you know.

408
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:54,645
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not that you won't have to ask the questions for which everybody else in the room already knows the answer to.

409
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to happen.

410
00:42:58,048 --> 00:42:59,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.

411
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:10,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there are some basic things, and I don't just mean Robert's Rules and Open Meeting Law, that you kind of have to know.

412
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:12,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nobody out there teaching them.

413
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,262
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't teach them at Charting the Course, because every district's different.

414
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:21,667
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question and a hard one to answer in my opinion.

415
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:25,831
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sorry, I didn't mean to take us quite so far off topic.

416
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:31,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of this policy, I think the staging is good.

417
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: The dates seem reasonable to me.

418
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:39,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the people carrying out phases one and two

419
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I mean, there's- Opinions on that.

420
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

421
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, our approval, by the way, I mean, I gave us a February, March and April, three months.

422
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:57,556
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get these handbooks and we get the memorandum, we just do it in one weekend.

423
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, we don't need three months.

424
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:06,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they say they need more time in certain sections of this process, we have it to give to them.

425
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,381
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just cut some of our time down here.

426
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,302
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted it,

427
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:14,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I like going early and having them more time.

428
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:19,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the councils are meeting in March to start talking about the handbook.

429
00:44:22,017 --> 00:44:25,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know.

430
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:31,056
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're approving handbooks the last week of June at best, or just not doing it.

431
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:41,504
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if this October to January school council thing is reasonable at all.

432
00:44:41,624 --> 00:44:43,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I haven't been on a school council.

433
00:44:43,205 --> 00:44:51,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know when they form, and I'm sure they form at different times with each school, and whether or not, if everybody's just coming over and staying around for another year,

434
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:54,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, oh, it's born.

435
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:58,419
[SPEAKER_00]: We agreed and we're just going to keep the same council versus a whole turnover.

436
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:04,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mean, I only know about the Roberts because Mia said, oh, yes, I'm on this.

437
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:06,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

438
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, former member of Stone.

439
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:22,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I, this is a, this is a, in my mind, this is a draft policy that if we report out of here positively, then the committee and the administration can respond to and I, I will.

440
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:44,471
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do approve it tonight to go to the full committee, I will ask the superintendent when I send her this document to send it to principals for their feedback, you know, to come to the committee or to email all of us so we can bring our notes on how we might wanna change it at the meeting.

441
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a policy, so it would be, you know, first reading and then,

442
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:53,818
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not what we would want to just waive the second reading.

443
00:45:53,978 --> 00:45:56,659
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to have a chance to let it soak in.

444
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

445
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:07,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to say in phase 1.1 the superintendent or their designee?

446
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:07,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

447
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:09,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.

448
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:12,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a designee within central administration?

449
00:46:12,656 --> 00:46:16,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it needs to be clear that they're not designating it to.

450
00:46:17,216 --> 00:46:20,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it always is or designee.

451
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:29,259
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time it is not or designee, we actually would say, we'd have to specify that only the superintendent can do something.

452
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:32,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that is implied kind of across the board.

453
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know we've had things saying, well, we didn't mean that you should do it, we meant that your office should do it.

454
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:43,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's you know the part of that is that also the superintendent is the only person we actually can have.

455
00:46:43,894 --> 00:46:45,096
[SPEAKER_00]: We have authority over so.

456
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:51,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but no we don't have to say that it's something that I.

457
00:46:53,925 --> 00:47:02,228
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, when I was writing policy, I always put, or designee, and then I'm like, oh my God, it's like putting the words Medford in our school committee policy everywhere.

458
00:47:02,248 --> 00:47:05,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to remind myself to go take the words Medford out.

459
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:08,009
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Medford school committee policy.

460
00:47:08,029 --> 00:47:10,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we don't mean Belmont.

461
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:11,770
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do this.

462
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:16,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And the length of this thing matters greatly.

463
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:26,534
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone who reads very, very slowly, you know, I'm very attuned to this becoming too verbose.

464
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:29,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Verbose enough, but not.

465
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:31,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's also this

466
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:38,186
[SPEAKER_00]: other conversation, we're off topic slightly here again, but like just saying the committee is actually sufficient.

467
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:53,015
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we're talking about things like this, where there's a school council, that's when I decide we need to go verbose because, you know, like with the school building committee, you can't say the committee, do you mean us, the school building committee?

468
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:54,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean the school committee?

469
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,517
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I see that, that's...

470
00:47:57,472 --> 00:48:02,334
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's hard to find consistency because you'll end up with some policies where you're like, oh, you said school committee everywhere here.

471
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:04,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but there was a reason.

472
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

473
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:09,158
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

474
00:48:09,198 --> 00:48:12,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just put this up on the screen so I can read everything, I think?

475
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it, can you not see it all?

476
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:16,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean- There we go.

477
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yep, that's great for me.

478
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:25,206
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't need the, where you, that magnification that you had before was great.

479
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: 125?

480
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just needed it scrolled.

481
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:32,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I can see to the end of three.

482
00:48:33,316 --> 00:48:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to see the policy information section.

483
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:37,839
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sorry.

484
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing I have to notice, which is the typo on phase 3.2 mandatory.

485
00:48:43,523 --> 00:48:44,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I have three?

486
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:47,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Two.

487
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandatory, what's wrong with that?

488
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:50,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding, yeah.

489
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:55,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I googled it just in case I didn't understand linguistics for a second.

490
00:48:55,806 --> 00:48:58,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Member in Tapa has been finding Dory.

491
00:48:58,668 --> 00:48:58,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

492
00:48:59,208 --> 00:48:59,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandatory.

493
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny, I thought I copied it and I had mandatory here.

494
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:11,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my, I paid for, um, um, whatchamacallit thing that should find all my typos.

495
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Google docs does it automatically.

496
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:15,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought so too, but I don't see it.

497
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I must've turned it off by accident.

498
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:18,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.

499
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:21,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look at that because.

500
00:49:23,105 --> 00:49:23,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I do rely on that.

501
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:26,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the time frame seemed logistical to me.

502
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:33,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the cushion to an RN of like, hey, if these things need to get moved back, ours is significant.

503
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:37,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way we're the ones who are kind of paid to do the work and can kind of speed things along if we have to.

504
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in my experience of drafting policy and drafting

505
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:50,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Dates, we did it with elections with our student council and like, it was like, it looked great on paper.

506
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:51,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this makes sense.

507
00:49:51,648 --> 00:49:55,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just executed the constitute the new constitution this year.

508
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, no, we need to, we need to do this a lot earlier.

509
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:01,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be something we live and learn that we can change.

510
00:50:02,774 --> 00:50:05,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But logistically, having a month for initiation.

511
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:18,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm right in thinking that, because the handbooks have to be final and approved for students to receive at the end of August when school starts, because I know they sign off.

512
00:50:19,446 --> 00:50:24,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, yes, but again, we- No, I want this done by May 1st.

513
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: May has been terrible.

514
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:32,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our very wise decision to push, bring the budgeting process forward,

515
00:50:34,678 --> 00:50:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: it compounds May.

516
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not saying push budgeting back because knowing all this early is great.

517
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a disconnect?

518
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:52,426
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my pedantry on display here, that the digital versions being created in phase 1.1,

519
00:50:55,026 --> 00:50:58,027
[SPEAKER_02]: is what becomes the draft digital handbooks.

520
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:02,189
[SPEAKER_00]: As I wrote it, I was like, how can I connect those things?

521
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:07,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping is like a better way to describe, I'd like to not use the word digital.

522
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:16,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to assume that it's implied, but I don't know.

523
00:51:18,915 --> 00:51:29,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you're asking is for the superintendent to duplicate the current year's handbook and update that to create the upcoming year draft.

524
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,087
[SPEAKER_02]: The upcoming school year.

525
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:52,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we'll leave that.

526
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:01,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'll say those copies of the handbook.

527
00:52:04,637 --> 00:52:11,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to specify the format because some members prefer digital some of our papers and I'll leave that out of there because.

528
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:13,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

529
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:41,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if the superintendent notices an inconsistency and makes an update, do then they need to have... No.

530
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:43,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a third memorandum?

531
00:52:44,256 --> 00:52:53,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this many memorandums, but do we need to know that the superintendent updated the Brooks handbook to match the Roberts handbook?

532
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:13,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do they do the superintendent have to go back to the school council and say hi for consistency reasons I'm making this change I.

533
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:43,728
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that sound?

534
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:49,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to resist giving it a name because it's one that we may never.

535
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's good.

536
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:54,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have any further questions or comments.

537
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:57,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide the memorandum to whom?

538
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:02,753
[SPEAKER_02]: To school committee and the school council or.

539
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:03,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

540
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:23,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, sounds good.

541
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remove the provide before create on the second line of number four.

542
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Backseat typing.

543
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better than finding out what I typed later was like, didn't make sense.

544
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:44,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandatory.

545
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:45,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

546
00:54:50,314 --> 00:54:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I would call these mandatory changes, but that'll just confuse things.

547
00:54:55,597 --> 00:55:00,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we then, we're in subcommittee, do we motion to send this to full committee?

548
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we would make that- Passing it by the administration first.

549
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:08,705
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we would, so let me stop sharing.

550
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:12,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I can find that, stop share.

551
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:13,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

552
00:55:13,738 --> 00:55:17,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to move to my bedroom where my power cord is.

553
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do that horrible thing where people have meetings from their bed.

554
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:30,005
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the, I have too many windows open, sorry.

555
00:55:30,945 --> 00:55:35,046
[SPEAKER_00]: So the motion, the basic motion would be,

556
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:44,697
[SPEAKER_00]: To report out policy, whatever the policy ID was, I just had it in my face a second ago.

557
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:49,260
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

558
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:53,504
[SPEAKER_00]: CHCA-B, CHCA-B.

559
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:01,130
[SPEAKER_00]: To report policy.

560
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:07,595
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not positively, what's the word?

561
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:20,725
[SPEAKER_02]: To what comes after the word I can figure out words in context, but I don't have a bit for this one.

562
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:26,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so to report policy blah out to the full committee for.

563
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:32,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Adoption adoption with.

564
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:34,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcommittee.

565
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,754
[SPEAKER_00]: With unanimous well, not with subcommittee.

566
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:41,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendation.

567
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:51,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Approval let me read it out loud to report policy see hca dash be out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.

568
00:56:52,548 --> 00:56:59,435
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other thing that we were just talking about that getting administrative getting the approval from the administration and or principles.

569
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:27,424
[SPEAKER_00]: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration, A&M school, school principals, I'll just say principals, so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee.

570
00:57:29,523 --> 00:57:33,369
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting where the policy will be considered.

571
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:37,394
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that sound?

572
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:39,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to read it one more time or do you all get that?

573
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I can read it one more time.

574
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:44,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I never like people... Second reading, no.

575
00:57:46,403 --> 00:57:57,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So the motion, which one of you all would have to say so moved, to report policy CHCA-B out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.

576
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:06,696
[SPEAKER_00]: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration and principals so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee meeting where the policy will be considered.

577
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:08,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So moved.

578
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:09,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

579
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:12,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

580
00:58:23,844 --> 00:58:24,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

581
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:30,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the motion, member Intoppa?

582
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

583
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And member Reinfeld?

584
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:35,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

585
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:42,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, in the affirmative, the draft policy is reported out.

586
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for this wonderful work.

587
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:51,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't look forward to having to actually do all this work on the first time through.

588
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:58,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of this conversation for this meeting or is that the follow-on motion once this is reported out?

589
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:05,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't honestly see this, we'll be doing any of this this school year.

590
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:06,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

591
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:07,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.

592
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:13,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nobody's going to draft any memorandums at the timeline we're in right now.

593
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:20,144
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I mean, do we need to do we just need to approve these as is once we get the

594
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:25,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, what we do this time around, I don't know.

595
00:59:25,427 --> 00:59:26,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we may in fact.

596
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:35,053
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if folks get time to read them all, um, somebody definitely should make an emotion to approve them, but they have to be on the agenda for us to do that.

597
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:35,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And they aren't.

598
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:44,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it's fairly awkward for me to say out loud in a meeting, especially recorded that maybe we end up don't.

599
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:46,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the proper thing and approving them this year.

600
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Alas, we have also not done that for many years.

601
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:55,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not like I'm suggesting we break the law and do something that's never been done before.

602
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:58,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I think that.

603
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can talk, you know, maybe you and I could talk offline about.

604
01:00:03,385 --> 01:00:09,027
[SPEAKER_00]: How we want to do this, or you can talk to another member and say, like, so how do we get these approved?

605
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:10,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to approve them?

606
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the current policy is we don't have a policy, just they have to be approved.

607
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:17,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

608
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:21,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Until this policy goes into effect, we are not breaking our own policy.

609
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:22,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

610
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:23,396
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.

611
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:29,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, looking around other districts, all they have is that same language, they have to be approved.

612
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:34,046
[SPEAKER_00]: No comment about when, what happens if they don't, no comment about

613
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it too late to amend this policy to say this policy will be effective as of August 1st, 2024?

614
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:53,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too late, but it's also not necessary because unless policy specific, and I don't know if this is the law, but this is definitely how everybody operates.

615
01:00:54,519 --> 01:01:00,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless a policy says effective immediately, it is implied to begin the next school year, July 1.

616
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought it was.

617
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:06,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought our rules said it's effective immediately unless indicated otherwise.

618
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:09,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where I read that somewhere.

619
01:01:09,275 --> 01:01:12,537
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, let me take a peek.

620
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:13,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the page open.

621
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:16,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I know I'm dragging this out and.

622
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:22,143
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not it.

623
01:01:23,704 --> 01:01:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Governance.

624
01:01:26,586 --> 01:01:28,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish this tap could move.

625
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're right.

626
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:59,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule 46, the policy will take effect immediately unless another date is specified.

627
01:01:59,436 --> 01:02:04,520
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I should point out that immediately, we're already past the end date of this implementation on this.

628
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So immediately does mean August 1st.

629
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:11,250
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot go back to April.

630
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking your word on that.

631
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:14,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm just making it up as I go, of course.

632
01:02:16,213 --> 01:02:21,316
[SPEAKER_00]: But since all these dates are now passed, I don't think we could reasonably think that we have to have done this.

633
01:02:22,056 --> 01:02:23,297
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that sounds about right to me.

634
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,418
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's outside of the time we're dialoguing.

635
01:02:25,498 --> 01:02:27,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that does make sense to amend it.

636
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:33,322
[SPEAKER_01]: But right, if this was April 28th, we'd be having a different conversation, I think.

637
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that it's May 8th, I think we're OK.

638
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:38,251
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my sense.

639
01:02:40,492 --> 01:02:42,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't think about that member Raffles.

640
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:46,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that up because that would have been fun.

641
01:02:46,633 --> 01:02:47,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

642
01:02:47,813 --> 01:03:04,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like when we passed the the policy on out of school suspensions, we actually passed it in December and did not have we specified implementation for September one of the following year because we expected there to be substantial effort to

643
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,581
[SPEAKER_00]: be in compliance.

644
01:03:07,141 --> 01:03:10,803
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's a really important question is when does something start?

645
01:03:11,424 --> 01:03:13,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for bringing it up.

646
01:03:13,745 --> 01:03:19,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And for reminding me that the policy I wrote, the rule I wrote, actually I had backwards in my head.

647
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:26,914
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless there's any other discussion, is there anything?

648
01:03:26,954 --> 01:03:33,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my only question is, do we need to, when we bring this to the floor, do we need to talk about this year's handbooks?

649
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:42,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we would do that because it wouldn't be on the agenda.

650
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:44,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

651
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess maybe I'm asking if it needs to get added to the agenda.

652
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:50,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably.

653
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:53,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.

654
01:03:54,413 --> 01:04:00,356
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have not received yet the other three updated handbooks.

655
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:04,759
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got an email saying that we have them and that physical copies will be given to us.

656
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:06,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And.

657
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:08,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing me.

658
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, like like literally 20 minutes ago we got the three of them and we will be giving hard copies up for the May 20th meeting.

659
01:04:16,027 --> 01:04:16,507
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.

660
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:18,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So then yeah, that seems like a really good time for us to.

661
01:04:20,728 --> 01:04:22,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Get around to actually approving them.

662
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:31,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so but that's not a motion of this subcommittee that we review handbooks for approval by.

663
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,090
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the school year.

664
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:39,425
[SPEAKER_00]: That's outside the scope of our agenda of this meeting.

665
01:04:39,445 --> 01:04:40,105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

666
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:42,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I guess we didn't have that conversation.

667
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:46,689
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't make any decisions.

668
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:50,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

669
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:51,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

670
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:53,033
[SPEAKER_01]: So move.

671
01:04:59,356 --> 01:05:01,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Second or no, I'm sorry.

672
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just OK.

673
01:05:03,592 --> 01:05:08,595
[SPEAKER_00]: member and second.

674
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:09,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

675
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:17,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, so yes, thank you all for a lovely and productive meeting and have a good evening and this meeting is adjourned next time.
