[SPEAKER_03]: So big thank you.

135
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Perry, and thank you to all of the administrators.

136
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:32,942
[SPEAKER_12]: The effort was really important to us as a committee because being clear about the role that every person plays when it comes to impacting student outcomes and learning is really important.

137
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:49,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, throughout this contract as an all contracts job descriptions are a subject of bargaining with all of our partners, and this unit in particular was a challenge because you all do very different things, so it was not quite as simple.

138
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:53,255
[SPEAKER_12]: as in some units.

139
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:54,997
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you all for your work.

140
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:58,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Every member of the team participated.

141
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,864
[SPEAKER_12]: So every single one of our administrators was there and participated.

142
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:05,107
[SPEAKER_12]: They asked good, thoughtful questions.

143
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:08,930
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the conversation was collaborative.

144
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:09,931
[SPEAKER_12]: It was

145
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:11,573
[SPEAKER_12]: hugely refreshing.

146
00:57:11,613 --> 00:57:14,135
[SPEAKER_12]: We were all on the same page about what we were trying to accomplish.

147
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:19,079
[SPEAKER_12]: We set out a goal and then we actually exceeded the goal.

148
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So also thanks to everybody for making it four meetings instead of five.

149
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:25,565
[SPEAKER_12]: We all loved the extra time back.

150
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:31,069
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think more importantly, the collaboration and the efficiency was very notable.

151
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:32,711
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you all for your hard work.

152
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:38,596
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are happy to talk to you again at the bargaining table in another year.

153
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:47,579

[SPEAKER_08]: So I look forward to all the things that we're gonna learn about the wonderful accomplishments and contributions of women throughout history, with our female governor and many other wonderful women leading in Massachusetts, our own Mayor Lungo-Koehn, the nation and the world.

206
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:35,546

207
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:48,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And as all of us are hoping for warmer weather we can see that beginning this evening, we're going to be in for quite a bit of rain over the next few days but we'll make it through all of that.

01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:57,616
[SPEAKER_08]: A friendly reminder to the community that next Wednesday, March 13th, is an early release day for all of our students.

214
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:48,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Although they came up short in a tough 59-40 final result, we were proud to watch these Mustangs fight for victory.

215
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:56,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations to our Mustang girls basketball team for a 15-5-0 winter season.

217
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:21,219
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cardinals may have beaten our Mustangs, but spirits were high among the Medford contingent after a strong 11-9-1 winter season.

218
01:02:25,177 --> 01:02:29,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming up this Friday is our World Language and Cultural Festival.

01:04:08,237 --> 01:04:09,258
[SPEAKER_08]: At tonight's meeting.

[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to welcoming Dr. Nicole keys and Mr. Eric Esner, who are seeking school committee approval for student travel to the University of North Carolina for the National Ethics Bureau.

231
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Medford Ethics Bowl students have continued a successful streak of several years in reaching this national competition, and I hope that you will approve this exciting and enriching travel opportunity for our students.

232
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:46,112
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll also hear from our Director of Family and Community Engagement, Ms.

233

234
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:58,380
[SPEAKER_08]: These programs offer extended day, school day, for many of our younger students.

235

236
01:05:17,003 --> 01:05:33,651
[SPEAKER_08]: As we observed this past September, in particular, we've been experiencing more and more hot weather in recent years, causing us to consider a plan, consider and plan our approach to handling sweltering conditions.

237
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:47,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, which we just approved, I truly am very, very excited that the committee has approved the vote for the MOA with our Teamsters Local 25 school administrators.

238
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:55,452
[SPEAKER_08]: The journey began last year in the fall, and the school district and school committee, we worked closely

239
01:05:56,312 --> 01:06:05,397
[SPEAKER_08]: and really worked in a collaborative, cooperative spirit to get to the approved MOA that we just did this evening.

[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to say thank you and congratulations for a job well done on all of our parts.

246
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:41,140
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not on yet.

247
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:46,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, good evening.

248
01:06:49,665 --> 01:07:05,553
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been enjoying great success with our ethics school team for several years, actually since its inception 11 years ago, under the leadership of Mr. Eric Esner, as well as our philosopher in residence from Tufts University, Miss Audrey Ledbetter.

249
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:08,875
[SPEAKER_01]: They have once again achieved great success.

250
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so proud of our students.

251
01:07:12,592 --> 01:07:17,732
[SPEAKER_01]: They were victorious at the New England Ethics Bowl competition and the regional playoffs.

252
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:26,394
[SPEAKER_01]: They surpassed schools, including Windsor Academy, Buckingham Brown and Nichols, Lexington High School.

253
01:07:26,454 --> 01:07:27,914
[SPEAKER_01]: They have done an amazing job.

254
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:36,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on these victories, they are now qualified to attend the National Bowl at the University of North Carolina.

255
01:07:36,196 --> 01:07:37,636
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be their fourth time

256
01:07:38,457 --> 01:07:44,520
[SPEAKER_01]: attending that bowl, and we are so proud of these students, so grateful to Mr. Esner and Ms.

257
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:49,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Ledbetter for their leadership, and we are requesting approval for the out-of-state field trip.

258
01:07:49,662 --> 01:07:58,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Esner was just gonna give a little bit of information in terms of what the students will do those few days that they're there, and then we're requesting approval.

259
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:00,346
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your consideration.

260
01:08:02,142 --> 01:08:02,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

261
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:08,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's a three day event, the first day is like a welcome ceremony reception.

262
01:08:08,245 --> 01:08:18,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids get to mingle with students from other schools from around the country, which is always a lot of fun for them, and they get to bed nice and early so they get up and compete the next day they do.

263
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:25,293
[SPEAKER_00]: several rounds, three to four rounds on the first day and those teams that qualify continue on into the final rounds on Sunday.

264
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:33,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for those teams that don't successfully go through, there's a series of workshops for the students and for coaches to help them prepare for years to follow.

265
01:08:33,358 --> 01:08:39,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then there's a word ceremony at the end and at that point we'd return, return back home.

266
01:08:39,422 --> 01:08:42,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, it's a action packed weekend of debate.

267
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:43,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So

268
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:47,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

269
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:49,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions from the committee?

270
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:50,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau.

271
01:08:50,647 --> 01:08:50,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

272
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:53,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like we keep seeing you.

273
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:55,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to always see people for great reasons.

274
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:05,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what the cost is.

275
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering about, this isn't a request for funding.

276
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think, I did read it, but I didn't see that in there.

277
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:16,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are the thoughts at this point in time on the funding?

278
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about a little over 10 grand for the whole 10 of you to go.

279
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:24,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, what are your thoughts on that?

280
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:38,702
[SPEAKER_01]: We were requesting some funding, understanding that that may not be available, but we are working very closely with Dr. Vincent and the Director of Finance to see what funds could be available.

281
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:49,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward next year, we plan to be very straightforward with the students in terms of if we win, this will be the cost and kind of just have it laid out when they join the club.

282
01:09:50,206 --> 01:09:52,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to deter people, because of course we would

283
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:59,525
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, support anybody that couldn't go, but just to be a little bit, to be very clear and upfront with it.

284
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:09,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are working, I don't know if Dr. Vincent and I have talked about this a few times, we are working to see what funds would be available, and the students are aware of potential fundraising that we'll be doing.

285
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:10,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Time is short.

286
01:10:10,549 --> 01:10:19,753
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a financial aid application that we will be submitting to the UNC Chapel Hill that Mr. Esner is working on as well, which should give back

287
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:23,767
[SPEAKER_01]: some funding should we be successful in receiving it.

288
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:28,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working hard on that application as well so that we can get there.

289
01:10:28,654 --> 01:10:32,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It is costly, but again, it's a wonderful experience for the students.

290
01:10:32,379 --> 01:10:34,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that answer the question?

291
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:34,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

292
01:10:34,743 --> 01:10:35,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

293
01:10:35,223 --> 01:10:36,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct, Dr. Vincent?

294
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:37,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I portray that correctly?

295
01:10:38,058 --> 01:10:42,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you accurately portrayed it and where again, wasn't expected.

296
01:10:43,519 --> 01:10:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about looking to see if there's something we can figure out with Mr. McHugh and because last year we were able to fund it through, I believe some of the ESSER.

297
01:10:57,121 --> 01:11:05,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's a possibility to, you know, pull a little bit of that to support them and then moving forward,

298
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:09,845
[SPEAKER_08]: where we've had four consecutive years where we're on a wonderful streak.

299
01:11:10,585 --> 01:11:24,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't see that streak going away to start doing fundraising so that we could have a separate revolving account that the Ethics Bowl team could just kind of have there and do fundraising over the course of the year.

300
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:31,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Because to come up with that money in about one month's time would be a really, really quick turnaround.

301
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:32,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

302
01:11:32,681 --> 01:11:37,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that certainly seems like a rough period of time to have to come up with that money.

303
01:11:37,703 --> 01:11:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, raising money for this when you don't even know that you're going to end up going.

304
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:45,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's, that's not very motivating.

305
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:46,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's going to do that.

306
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:52,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do hope that we can find the money in the district somewhere in a line item of money that is

307
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:55,592
[SPEAKER_09]: not actually getting used for this year.

308
01:11:56,252 --> 01:12:02,858
[SPEAKER_09]: For the public that doesn't necessarily know this, at the end of the year, any money we have left over, we have to give back to the city.

309
01:12:03,398 --> 01:12:10,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can, if Mr. McHugh can find some money that we're not going to end up using, I would be very happy to see it used for this purpose.

310
01:12:11,385 --> 01:12:13,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like to

311
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:18,449
[SPEAKER_09]: find out whether it's just an email that says, you know, we were able to get all the kids to go.

312
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:23,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And if, you know, we still have two meetings before.

313
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:33,537
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it looks like there are going to be kids that can't go and there's no way to finagle the funding, I think I certainly would like to hear about that before it's too late.

314
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:34,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

315
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:36,919
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate your all of your support.

316
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

317
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions?

318
01:12:42,562 --> 01:12:58,220
[SPEAKER_12]: From the chair, we actually, Thomas Dalton, our director of communications, was recently able to set up a dedicated link to allow people to make donations to the McGlynn Playground Fund.

319
01:12:58,761 --> 01:13:01,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wonder if there is an opportunity to do something similar.

320
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:12,647
[SPEAKER_12]: to allow the community, any community members who are out there who might be listening or who might read our, the superintendent's weekly newsletter to help support the team.

321
01:13:13,788 --> 01:13:27,031
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if that's possible, but I would like to make a motion from the chair that we explore whether that's an option and just report back to this committee.

322
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:32,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So motion by me, seconded by member Rousseau.

323
01:13:33,224 --> 01:13:33,645
[SPEAKER_12]: roll call.

324
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:37,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

325
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:38,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

326
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:38,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

327
01:13:38,532 --> 01:13:38,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

328
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:39,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

329
01:13:39,914 --> 01:13:40,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

330
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

331
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to approve the field trip?

332
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:56,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I had one more question.

333
01:13:56,784 --> 01:14:01,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I see in here that meals are the responsibility of the travelers.

334
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:09,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a plan in place if there are students for whom that could pose a hardship to cover that in a sensitive, discreet way?

335
01:14:09,598 --> 01:14:11,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will have a plan in place for that.

336
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:11,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

337
01:14:14,008 --> 01:14:14,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olapade.

338
01:14:15,329 --> 01:14:17,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a question about the maximum of eight students.

339
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:24,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an expectation by the organizers that you have to have eight students for a team or is that a decision you two made?

340
01:14:25,313 --> 01:14:28,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seven and then add one as an alternate.

341
01:14:28,315 --> 01:14:31,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where it comes from in terms of competing.

342
01:14:32,357 --> 01:14:35,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that's kind of the restriction that they put on us.

343
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:35,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

344
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:36,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

345
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:37,039
Thank you.

346
01:14:37,731 --> 01:14:42,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And how many, yes, how many students are on the team here in Medford?

347
01:14:43,274 --> 01:14:48,036
[SPEAKER_00]: The number exceeds, well, it serves as both a team competitively and a club.

348
01:14:48,176 --> 01:14:48,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

349
01:14:48,537 --> 01:14:55,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are students who take part in it on a non-regular basis and that number would exceed maybe 15, 16, 17.

350
01:14:56,621 --> 01:15:01,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a dedicated number split into kind of two teams, team A and team B this year.

351
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:06,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The first five of whom qualified, the second team did not, but still actively fought.

352
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:18,196
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also love to be on the agenda prior to the end of the school year, of course, to honor these students as well as some of our other humanities, authentic learning opportunities that have been very successful.

353
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:24,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll look to honor everybody, hopefully, should time a lot, which I'm sure would be very nice for everybody.

354
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:26,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

355
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to approve the field trip?

356
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:30,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve.

357
01:15:30,882 --> 01:15:32,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve the field trip by member Branley.

358
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

359
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:34,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Second by member Lopate.

360
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:39,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

361
01:15:40,138 --> 01:15:40,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

362
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

363
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:46,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

364
01:15:47,622 --> 01:15:48,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

365
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:49,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

366
01:15:51,745 --> 01:15:56,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative one absent motion passes and the field trip is approved.

367
01:15:57,048 --> 01:15:57,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

368
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:58,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

369
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Item number three, we have a before and after school update.

370
01:16:04,038 --> 01:16:04,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

371
01:16:04,338 --> 01:16:07,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Megan Fidler-Carey, the Director of Family and Community Engagement.

372
01:16:08,341 --> 01:16:08,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

373
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:09,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Fidler-Carey?

374
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:10,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

375
01:16:11,206 --> 01:16:12,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the opportunity.

376
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:13,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you all.

377
01:16:14,588 --> 01:16:17,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see some new faces and meet you, meet some of you for the first time.

378
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:36,822
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of today's meeting, and I framed it a little differently than normal, because there are some new members and I know some new families to Medford Public Schools, I figured I would take the beginning of this to just do a sort of overview of the programs, so I don't leave anything out and take for granted that people know more about the programs than we'd like them to.

379
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:39,003
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a slide presentation.

380
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:41,410
[SPEAKER_06]: come in just one second.

381
01:16:45,712 --> 01:16:46,652
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can tell you all about it.

382
01:16:46,692 --> 01:16:50,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So the before and after school program runs at all four elementary schools in the district.

383
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:55,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The before school program starts at 7.30 and families can drop off.

384
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always describe it as it's separated into two groups.

385
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:05,377
[SPEAKER_06]: There are the kids that need a little more time waking up and then the kids that really need to get all their energy out before they can sit down for some focused learning.

386
01:17:06,218 --> 01:17:07,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are teachers that are,

387
01:17:08,197 --> 01:17:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: ready and poised for both of those groups and then they take them to breakfast, and then they're ready for school.

388
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:16,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the before school after care program and then after school.

389
01:17:16,827 --> 01:17:28,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from dismissal until six o'clock, and I say dismissal because on those early release Wednesdays that we have where school gets out at 12, we do have after school programming until still until the six o'clock pickup time.

390
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:34,183
[SPEAKER_06]: The programs vary from school to school because the schools are different from each other.

391
01:17:34,243 --> 01:17:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The groups of people are different from each other, the sizes of the school, the setup of the building, and the needs of the families.

392
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:43,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a cookie cutter program.

393
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we do break it into about four segments.

394
01:17:46,446 --> 01:17:56,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We have snack, homework time, physical time, and then structured time, where we do either a craft or some more physical activities and structured games, that sort of thing.

395
01:17:57,146 --> 01:18:09,713
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, depending on what the interests of the students in front of us in that particular year are, it might be a little different or depending on what the skills and expertise of the particular staff at a different site are, it might look a little different from site to site.

396
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also going to discuss the tuition that we charge.

397
01:18:14,809 --> 01:18:17,552
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a tuition, this is a fee-based program.

398
01:18:18,313 --> 01:18:20,976
[SPEAKER_06]: The costs of this program are completely covered.

399
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a self-sustaining program.

400
01:18:22,358 --> 01:18:23,499
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in a revolving account.

401
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:26,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are completely covered from the tuitions that we take in.

402
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:29,343
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a financial assistance program.

403
01:18:30,284 --> 01:18:45,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk a little bit about that this isn't program that was a little bit that was new, we stopped taking vouchers from the state, and instead instituted our own financial assistance program, based on the same criteria that the city uses in determining low income as well.

404
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:50,962
[SPEAKER_06]: pay rates and how they compare in other districts.

405
01:18:51,703 --> 01:19:00,810
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I did want you all to know about the new people is we are Medford is a member of a consortium called the Network of Extended Day Directors.

406
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's NEDS.

407
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am currently the chair of NEDS.

408
01:19:05,013 --> 01:19:11,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And once every other month, we all meet, these are directors from all over Massachusetts, and we meet to talk about after school.

409
01:19:12,469 --> 01:19:14,070
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about all of our challenges.

410
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:18,634
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about our best practices, share policies, share different things.

411
01:19:18,834 --> 01:19:27,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just a really great network to lean on to find out if I'm going crazy or if other people are experiencing the same things that we are.

412
01:19:28,523 --> 01:19:29,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will move ahead.

413
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:31,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide, please.

414
01:19:33,927 --> 01:19:36,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is sort of what I've just described.

415
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can, we do have,

416
01:19:38,502 --> 01:19:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: in there was we have a student to teacher ratio of about 10 to one, which is consistent with the state and other programs in the area.

417
01:19:45,205 --> 01:19:47,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice Chair?

418
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:48,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

419
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:50,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

420
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:51,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we hold questions to the end or?

421
01:19:51,968 --> 01:19:58,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, let's hold questions until the end and then we will roll back through slides if we need to.

422
01:19:58,871 --> 01:19:59,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

423
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:05,394
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can move ahead.

424
01:20:08,396 --> 01:20:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is the so the organizational structure of our programs is at the before school, the way that has worked out, we have teachers or Paris from the school that just come in a little bit early that we pay to run the before school program.

425
01:20:19,121 --> 01:20:25,845
[SPEAKER_06]: The after school, we do have some teachers, some Paris, but it's more often than that, it's outside people who are coming to work for an hourly wage.

426
01:20:26,765 --> 01:20:34,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's overseen by the superintendent for academics instruction, Suzanne Galussi, and then managed by me at the but from my office in the high school.

427
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Each site has what's called a site coordinator.

428
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:40,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like to lovingly describe that as the principal of that afterschool program.

429
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:46,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And they oversee group leaders and assistant group leaders who are like the teachers and the paras.

430
01:20:46,768 --> 01:20:49,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also, and this I'm very proud of, employ high school staff.

431
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:57,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got some excellent high school staff members who are, you know, the kids look up to in a way that's very different than any of the adults.

432
01:20:57,255 --> 01:20:58,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, really fun to see.

433
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:01,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I think we can go to the next one.

434
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:18,935
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part that's new this year that I'm most excited that I can share with all of you, even though even the veteran school committee members, because we have the new formatted early release days, we decided to fill those six hours with enrichments.

435
01:21:19,115 --> 01:21:23,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So we invited in some different, you can see some pictures here.

436
01:21:24,142 --> 01:21:29,709
[SPEAKER_06]: What's not shown is one that we're really excited about, which is the National Arts Honor Society students.

437
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:34,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We had those students come in and lead some art projects, and that was really cool.

438
01:21:34,195 --> 01:21:34,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately,

439
01:21:36,218 --> 01:21:40,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, we didn't get any good photographs from that experience, so I couldn't really show it here.

440
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:54,301
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wanted to give shout-outs to Curious Creatures, the Mass Audubon Society, Ooch the Yo-Yo Guy, the Medford Police Department, who we partnered with, and they had their canine unit come and brought the dogs, which was very, very exciting.

441
01:21:55,101 --> 01:22:03,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Local author Wendy Pfaffenbach, and also local artist Susan Altman came and did her mural project.

442
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you guys know the big murals on Medford High School,

443
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:08,990
[SPEAKER_06]: she did sort of mini versions with each of the students at each of the programs.

444
01:22:09,851 --> 01:22:11,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, it's wildly successful.

445
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:12,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really happy with it.

446
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:17,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some good ideas for next year too, for what to do with those early release days.

447
01:22:17,576 --> 01:22:19,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

448
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:22,120
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, next slide.

449
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the, this is the brass tacks.

450
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:27,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So these, here's some data for you.

451
01:22:28,264 --> 01:22:29,665
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what our numbers look like.

452
01:22:29,905 --> 01:22:34,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So last year we determined that it was more beneficial to talk about

453
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:42,060
[SPEAKER_06]: the data in terms of seats and to talk about what we can offer families at the schools in terms of seats, not students.

454
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:51,429
[SPEAKER_06]: This data is showing you that we have 95 students enrolled across the district, but on a given day, there are 90 seats in the before school program.

455
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:55,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that goes with that ratio for teacher to student that we talked about.

456
01:22:58,089 --> 01:23:00,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll notice I have the waitlist information there too.

457
01:23:00,752 --> 01:23:05,138
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no waitlist at the McGlynn and Mistetuck, which is very fortunate for those schools.

458
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:07,841
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there does remain a waitlist at the other two.

459
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:10,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.

460
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:25,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in afterschool, our total number of students served went down a little bit because there were more students who signed up for a five-day-a-week slot versus one having a two-day-a-week, another having a three-day-a-week.

461
01:23:25,135 --> 01:23:36,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's why we found it very important to talk about it in terms of seats, that the Brooks on a given day has 120 seats, and the other schools, because of staff ratios, have about 60.

462
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:45,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I'm sure you're all seeing those somewhat alarming waitlist numbers that we'll talk about a little further in the program.

463
01:23:48,049 --> 01:23:52,631
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past we've talked about how important it is to think about the demographics of who we're serving in our program.

464
01:23:53,591 --> 01:24:01,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I still find myself worried that there are families who don't realize that they have access to our program and who students could really benefit from it.

465
01:24:01,894 --> 01:24:08,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say access like maybe they don't completely understand our financial assistance and how robust it is, or they, they.

466
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure they don't know about it, which I can't believe because we're very I believe we're very thorough and making sure that everybody knows about the program, but this is the demographics of our Of our students in the program and you'll notice at the bottom that we do have to McKinney Vento students.

467
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:25,636
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our unhoused population.

468
01:24:25,657 --> 01:24:29,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got to unhoused students currently in that taking advantage of after school.

469
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:36,046
[SPEAKER_06]: The registration process, I believe is as fair as we can get it.

470
01:24:36,627 --> 01:24:44,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year we instituted something new for the waitlist, I'll get to that in a second but for those of you who are new and again families who are new.

471
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of it first come first serve, we have a lottery system.

472
01:24:49,160 --> 01:25:00,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And so on April 1st, a Google form will be on our website, it'll be shared through social media, it'll be shared everywhere we can get it, on all of the principal's newsletters, on the superintendent's newsletters.

473
01:25:01,049 --> 01:25:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So on April 1st, the Google form will open up, the lottery will open up, it'll be open for two weeks.

474
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:09,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So people will have two weeks to get their name in there to enter into the lottery.

475
01:25:09,915 --> 01:25:10,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it will shut down.

476
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:17,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And on April 14th, we run it through a sequence generator called random.org.

477
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:21,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And that runs it through, takes each name, how many kids did you signed up for this?

478
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And it re-orders those numbers.

479
01:25:24,343 --> 01:25:27,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's completely random, completely fair.

480
01:25:27,605 --> 01:25:33,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we take all of those numbers that are associated with names and we let them, the first spots open to those families.

481
01:25:34,268 --> 01:25:35,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And we notify families.

482
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:40,033
[SPEAKER_06]: If they are put on a wait list, we give them information about other programs in the area.

483
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:47,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here's what's different here's what I was excited to share last year when we instituted instead of having a ranked list.

484
01:25:48,407 --> 01:25:56,856
[SPEAKER_06]: that if you're on that list in a certain order, you're sort of doomed to that ranking on the list for life, we've instituted what's called the lottery pool.

485
01:25:57,156 --> 01:26:05,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a given grade group, so say at the Brooks School in the third grade group, somebody moves, and so now a spot has opened up.

486
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:08,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to all of the third graders on our wait list,

487
01:26:09,308 --> 01:26:14,491
[SPEAKER_06]: and re-put those names in the lottery, the random number sequence generator.

488
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:17,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like running a lottery again every time.

489
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:19,214
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always completely fair.

490
01:26:20,094 --> 01:26:21,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody is stuck at the bottom.

491
01:26:21,615 --> 01:26:23,996
[SPEAKER_06]: So far that has worked really well.

492
01:26:24,156 --> 01:26:25,217
[SPEAKER_06]: We've used it every time.

493
01:26:25,897 --> 01:26:30,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I have random.org as a bookmark on my computer.

494
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's made it fair.

495
01:26:32,941 --> 01:26:36,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does, it's interesting to see how it does change the order.

496
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:41,416
Next.

497
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Next.

498
01:26:45,461 --> 01:26:48,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this now we're getting into the budget for the after school program.

499
01:26:48,805 --> 01:26:51,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I did say this is a self sustaining program.

500
01:26:52,349 --> 01:26:56,555
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried to make sure that we're keeping it as accessible and affordable as possible for families.

501
01:26:57,076 --> 01:27:01,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We're paying our staff fairly, which we'll get into again, too, for staff retention.

502
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:04,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we are doing a good job.

503
01:27:04,621 --> 01:27:05,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy with what we see.

504
01:27:05,922 --> 01:27:10,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm part of NEDS, so I have the opportunity to look at a lot of data from other districts.

505
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:15,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are very competitive, both in how much we charge families and how much we pay our staff.

506
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:17,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The costs are listed here.

507
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:21,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried to be really thorough in thinking about every single cost that I can.

508
01:27:21,968 --> 01:27:30,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So including cell phones, and I even talked to custodians about like, if we use extra wipes or paper towels, let us know, you know, and we'll get you back.

509
01:27:31,134 --> 01:27:33,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've tried to be pretty thorough about it.

510
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:44,601
[SPEAKER_06]: So with all of that in mind, and I'm working with the director of finance to think about the administrative costs that we use, meaning HR and custodial fees and the finance office and payroll.

511
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:50,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And we think we spend just over a million dollars a year for the before and after school programs.

512
01:27:50,726 --> 01:27:51,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, next.

513
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:58,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here's what we're bringing in.

514
01:27:59,067 --> 01:28:04,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So the tuition that we'll bring in that we're projected to bring in by the end of the year is about a million three.

515
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:09,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that's after the financial assistance that we've given out this year.

516
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:11,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll notice it's $53,000 so far this year.

517
01:28:12,315 --> 01:28:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually that number is already skewed because this week we invited another family for March to start in March and they just qualified for 50% off.

518
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So that number is even a little different for how much we're

519
01:28:25,035 --> 01:28:29,237
[SPEAKER_06]: giving out for financial assistance, but also for how much we're bringing in for tuition as we add students.

520
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:42,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we did receive, we were fortunate to be awarded a grant, we have every year since I've been working here, from the Community Development Block Grant that they use for community programs to support low-income families.

521
01:28:42,762 --> 01:28:46,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we use these to subsidize tuition for low-income families.

522
01:28:47,813 --> 01:28:50,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We were enjoying $10,000 a year for a while.

523
01:28:50,637 --> 01:28:52,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the max you can ask for.

524
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:55,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And this year and the last two years, we've only gotten 96.

525
01:28:56,605 --> 01:28:58,628
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have my fingers crossed that next year we'll get 10 again.

526
01:28:58,869 --> 01:28:59,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

527
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:09,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the costs of tuition that I've showed over time.

528
01:29:09,364 --> 01:29:12,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So before school program, that one sort of stayed still for a while.

529
01:29:12,906 --> 01:29:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So last year we kind of right-sized it.

530
01:29:15,608 --> 01:29:19,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We hadn't raised the rate, changed the tuition or the pay for quite a while.

531
01:29:19,672 --> 01:29:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So we fixed that, we right-sized that last year.

532
01:29:21,933 --> 01:29:31,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year, I think just so that we're not finding ourself in a big gap of time that we just need to raise it just $1 a day, I think would be plenty for families.

533
01:29:33,513 --> 01:29:35,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, it doesn't need to be more than that.

534
01:29:36,255 --> 01:29:41,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look on the next slide, I'm saying the same thing for after school, because again, we right sized this tuition.

535
01:29:42,339 --> 01:29:54,568
[SPEAKER_06]: When we were looking, especially during COVID when it was extremely difficult to staff, we looked, that's when we did a hard look at the neighboring and surrounding communities and realized that we weren't paying our staff enough.

536
01:29:56,388 --> 01:29:58,409
[SPEAKER_06]: at all a competitive rate and that's why it was really hard.

537
01:29:58,449 --> 01:30:01,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We were losing them to Malden, we were losing them to neighboring communities.

538
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:06,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So we right-sized our pay rates and I think now we're very competitive.

539
01:30:06,813 --> 01:30:13,517
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, some other communities looked to us and were quoting us in their school committee presentations, but now we're all really about equal.

540
01:30:13,577 --> 01:30:18,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We're neither the highest or the lowest on either tuition or pay rates.

541
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So my recommendation again to you all would be same for afterschool to raise it just a dollar a day.

542
01:30:26,374 --> 01:30:29,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

543
01:30:30,035 --> 01:30:33,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Our biggest challenges won't be a surprise.

544
01:30:33,676 --> 01:30:36,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, click one more time and then it'll show.

545
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So the two main things that you're always gonna hear me talk about are staffing and space.

546
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:45,758
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot meet the demands of the afterschool needs of our families.

547
01:30:46,178 --> 01:30:48,959
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a problem that is unique to Medford.

548
01:30:49,179 --> 01:30:50,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm on NEDS.

549
01:30:50,339 --> 01:30:51,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk to them all the time.

550
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,920
[SPEAKER_06]: We're emailing each other all the time.

551
01:30:53,740 --> 01:31:06,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Comparing wait lists trying to thinking about where's the best place to advertise for staff staffing is really the number one hardest thing for after school, because two to six is a really bizarre time of day to try and find people to work.

552
01:31:07,614 --> 01:31:08,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And also space.

553
01:31:08,776 --> 01:31:15,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So the picture that I've chosen to illustrate this is the McGlynn playground that we were writing love notes on right before it was being demolished.

554
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:25,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So our, our buddies at the McGlynn actually are only playing at the Hormel playground after school, which is just not ideal you can imagine hourly wage workers

555
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:36,376
[SPEAKER_06]: as it's getting dark, trying to wrangle elementary school students in this gigantic field while like neighbors are trying to just come play soccer and it's just, that's been a big challenge.

556
01:31:36,436 --> 01:31:49,721
[SPEAKER_06]: But space in the school, though we know that the children go to that school all day and it's their school and it's their building, after school space is very different than school day space.

557
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:51,282
[SPEAKER_06]: During a school day is for focused

558
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:57,705
[SPEAKER_06]: learn teaching and learning and after school is really about like curiosity and gross modal skills and running and.

559
01:31:59,179 --> 01:32:03,922
[SPEAKER_06]: yelling and exhaling from being in school all day with focused teaching and learning.

560
01:32:04,022 --> 01:32:06,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So the spaces are not, it's not really one-to-one.

561
01:32:07,725 --> 01:32:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We do enjoy the gym and the cafeteria and the auditorium where possible or the library most in most schools and some of the specials rooms.

562
01:32:16,911 --> 01:32:20,214
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice, but it's somehow still as tight.

563
01:32:20,294 --> 01:32:25,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So space is something that we're constantly kind of working on with principals, with custodians,

564
01:32:26,857 --> 01:32:28,137
[SPEAKER_06]: to expand as much as we can.

565
01:32:28,318 --> 01:32:33,079
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are the constraints that we face when thinking about addressing those wait lists.

566
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:36,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

567
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:46,484
[SPEAKER_06]: For hiring and staff retention, because staffing is our biggest challenge, these are the prices that we, this is what the rates we pay now that we've right sized.

568
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think these are still very competitive.

569
01:32:49,265 --> 01:32:52,986
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what I'd like to propose, can you click it one more time, Dr. Cushing?

570
01:32:54,344 --> 01:33:03,006
[SPEAKER_06]: is I would like to propose instituting just once an annual wage adjustment that's commensurate with the units, the bargaining units.

571
01:33:03,707 --> 01:33:15,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of worrying about it year to year and having to come to ask for it year to year, I was hoping that we could just say that unless there's a real right sizing necessary where people, we need to significantly change the rate.

572
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:16,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, sorry.

573
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:23,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping that we could sort of, that would be a way that when I'm interviewing people for the job, I could say, and the great news is,

574
01:33:24,884 --> 01:33:29,667
[SPEAKER_06]: a percentage increase from year to year that follows whichever of the bargaining units.

575
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of my things for consideration tonight.

576
01:33:35,171 --> 01:33:43,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one other thing that I'd like to just point out, especially for new folks, is at that bottom category, you'll see it says wraparound paraprofessionals.

577
01:33:43,956 --> 01:33:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that we explored last year.

578
01:33:46,598 --> 01:33:50,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about having a paraprofessional whose hours were from 11 to five,

579
01:33:51,837 --> 01:33:56,741
[SPEAKER_06]: during the school, like that spanned the school day, into the after school.

580
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:01,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was somebody that was already there, they would be there right at dismissal, and that would be their whole job.

581
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:04,488
[SPEAKER_06]: This experiment has not yet proven successful.

582
01:34:04,628 --> 01:34:05,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have high hopes.

583
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:09,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We only had two people apply for the position.

584
01:34:10,153 --> 01:34:12,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We had it posted, I was sort of hoping for two at each school.

585
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We only had two people apply in total.

586
01:34:15,558 --> 01:34:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them ended up taking a daytime para job because she could be a lot more lucrative and actually make a lot more money for what she was doing because she had an expertise that we needed in the school day.

587
01:34:26,902 --> 01:34:29,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hopeful.

588
01:34:29,703 --> 01:34:35,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should give it another year to try it out and then really look at it and try to think about what we might be able to do differently.

589
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, one more.

590
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might be nearing the close.

591
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:44,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is my other big thing that I wanted to talk about.

592
01:34:44,742 --> 01:34:50,664
[SPEAKER_06]: The other purpose of this presentation is to further discuss how we're partnering with other programs in the city.

593
01:34:51,804 --> 01:35:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the demand for afterschool care should not be on the shoulders of the school district alone, especially because we know that being in the same school building all day is not the best thing for every single kid.

594
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Some kids really need a change of scenery.

595
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:08,494
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it means getting on a bus to go there.

596
01:35:09,014 --> 01:35:15,358
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other programs in the district, and I'm delighted to report that last Friday, we held a meeting at the Medford Public Library.

597
01:35:15,398 --> 01:35:18,521
[SPEAKER_06]: There were 10 of us around the table from six different programs in the city.

598
01:35:18,941 --> 01:35:22,643
[SPEAKER_06]: The only two missing were Grace Works and the Recreation Center.

599
01:35:23,164 --> 01:35:28,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin Bailey, they couldn't make it, but all of the other programs in the city were all in attendance.

600
01:35:28,607 --> 01:35:33,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We decided to form this group, our own little network within Medford.

601
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:41,557
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to meet twice a year, we hope, once before school starts and once before registration, so that we can sort of do a balancing.

602
01:35:41,677 --> 01:35:47,662
[SPEAKER_06]: We can ground ourselves, compare notes, do best practices, find out what the challenges are in the city.

603
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest challenge they faced was staffing.

604
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:53,529
[SPEAKER_06]: and also transportation.

605
01:35:53,629 --> 01:36:00,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was something that I, that's where the district can be helpful and work with them to get transportation, to get kids to their programs safely.

606
01:36:02,232 --> 01:36:06,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about maybe being strategic about which programs take kids from which school.

607
01:36:07,134 --> 01:36:09,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just a really great meeting.

608
01:36:09,374 --> 01:36:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited for what this partnership's gonna bring.

609
01:36:11,435 --> 01:36:14,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we're just about at the end.

610
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:15,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

611
01:36:19,969 --> 01:36:21,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you, Miss Fidler-Carey.

612
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:23,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau.

613
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:29,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I have many questions, and I want to make sure the new members have a chance to ask theirs.

614
01:36:29,672 --> 01:36:33,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll ask the last question I just wrote down, and then I'll come back afterwards.

615
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:37,674
[SPEAKER_09]: When the district covers transportation, when transportation is

616
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:42,069
[SPEAKER_09]: handled to get kids to these programs.

617
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I presume the district is paying for it, but is the after school, is your budget paying for that transportation or is it like the regular bus routes are being adjusted so as if that's where they live?

618
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Great question, and it's the latter.

619
01:36:58,382 --> 01:37:00,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The regular bus routes are being adjusted.

620
01:37:00,444 --> 01:37:00,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

621
01:37:01,004 --> 01:37:01,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

622
01:37:01,445 --> 01:37:03,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I have many questions, but I'll wait.

623
01:37:06,148 --> 01:37:06,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley?

624
01:37:08,658 --> 01:37:09,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just curious.

625
01:37:09,839 --> 01:37:14,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one, I'd like to thank you because I was a member of the school program when I worked at the Brooks and I loved it.

626
01:37:15,623 --> 01:37:20,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually as a parent at the time, I was making a lot less than what the parents do now, which is good.

627
01:37:21,006 --> 01:37:25,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never paid enough, of course, but the pay was why I did it.

628
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:28,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pay has come up significantly since then.

629
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:37,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great to see because there is that definitely divided group at morning program that some just need a hug and to sit and chill and others are,

630
01:37:37,984 --> 01:37:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to bounce the ball off the wall.

631
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So for each other.

632
01:37:43,067 --> 01:37:44,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I think I think this is great.

633
01:37:44,468 --> 01:37:45,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how hard you work.

634
01:37:45,468 --> 01:37:51,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So my only question is, on the re registration for current students, how long does that last?

635
01:37:51,652 --> 01:37:52,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And when does that what are the dates?

636
01:37:53,132 --> 01:37:53,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great question.

637
01:37:53,953 --> 01:37:55,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's underway.

638
01:37:56,014 --> 01:37:57,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did write that down.

639
01:37:58,195 --> 01:38:02,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It says new registration April 1st remains open until April 13th, but just curious about their re-registration.

640
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:07,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So re-registration for current students and their incoming kindergarten siblings.

641
01:38:08,003 --> 01:38:09,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a good clarification.

642
01:38:09,564 --> 01:38:11,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that that came up.

643
01:38:12,046 --> 01:38:12,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It has started.

644
01:38:12,727 --> 01:38:15,069
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens the week after February break.

645
01:38:15,149 --> 01:38:16,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's underway.

646
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I made a note.

647
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:21,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already had 51 as of 445 this afternoon.

648
01:38:21,614 --> 01:38:23,655
[SPEAKER_06]: 51 had already re-registered for before school.

649
01:38:24,576 --> 01:38:24,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And

650
01:38:25,937 --> 01:38:29,379
[SPEAKER_06]: 204 had already re-registered for after school.

651
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:29,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay.

652
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is and their incoming kindergarten siblings.

653
01:38:34,082 --> 01:38:40,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then does that stay open, like if they, do they have a deadline that they have to meet that by if they're re-registering?

654
01:38:40,305 --> 01:38:40,625
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

655
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:50,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I've said they have to have it by April 13th because when we write, that's when I will, when I run the lottery is when I know how many spots I have open.

656
01:38:50,151 --> 01:38:53,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So by April 13th is when I need to know when re-registration

657
01:38:54,642 --> 01:38:55,122
[SPEAKER_06]: is committed.

658
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

659
01:38:55,983 --> 01:38:56,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

660
01:38:56,283 --> 01:38:56,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I had.

661
01:38:56,763 --> 01:38:57,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for all you do.

662
01:38:57,884 --> 01:38:58,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

663
01:39:01,005 --> 01:39:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Olapade.

664
01:39:02,046 --> 01:39:02,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

665
01:39:02,586 --> 01:39:03,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you so much for being here.

666
01:39:03,967 --> 01:39:08,569
[SPEAKER_05]: A question, actually, after what Member Branley said about the lottery system.

667
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:16,573
[SPEAKER_05]: For parents that have multiple kids, when they're slotted into the lottery, is that any children they have, or is it just one child, and is it separation between both?

668
01:39:16,793 --> 01:39:18,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an excellent, excellent question.

669
01:39:18,534 --> 01:39:19,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you asked that.

670
01:39:20,215 --> 01:39:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I would encourage you to

671
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:26,962
[SPEAKER_06]: to enter both names, but there is a question on there that asks if there's a sibling.

672
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:32,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the first one comes up, then the sibling would come up next, would take the next spot.

673
01:39:34,627 --> 01:39:45,494
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I will clarify too, that if there are people who are currently on the wait list and they enter their incoming kindergarten student, so they're currently on the wait list.

674
01:39:45,514 --> 01:39:47,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So those people don't need to re-register for the wait list.

675
01:39:47,995 --> 01:39:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need to re-enter the lottery.

676
01:39:49,556 --> 01:39:52,118
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're currently on the wait list, it rolls over from year to year.

677
01:39:52,878 --> 01:39:57,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But for incoming kindergartners, they can enter them in the lottery, and I will give them the option.

678
01:39:57,979 --> 01:40:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say, look, because that's the thing, I have more kindergarten spots than I do anything else, any other spots, because those people have rolled up from the year before.

679
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would offer them, I would say, your name came up in the kindergarten lottery.

680
01:40:09,362 --> 01:40:12,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to put your kindergartner but not your third grader?

681
01:40:13,302 --> 01:40:14,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had both answers.

682
01:40:14,663 --> 01:40:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have one family that said yes.

683
01:40:21,206 --> 01:40:21,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Reinfeld?

684
01:40:22,067 --> 01:40:24,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm wondering how our programs compare.

685
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that you've had this meeting and that you're moving forward with the other programs in the city.

686
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:32,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried to do a little bit of research and I see that our rates are on par.

687
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they also have waitlists of similar sizes?

688
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:38,085
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

689
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:44,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, so one of the martial arts programs said that he was growing his program this year.

690
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:53,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, as soon as he put that in, because his registration was in February, he said, as soon as he put that information out, he was full in two days and now has a wait list.

691
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:54,840
Yeah.

692
01:40:57,282 --> 01:41:04,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And then are there other, so you said in the current schools, you're using the cafeterias,

693
01:41:06,386 --> 01:41:08,087
[SPEAKER_14]: the libraries, the gyms, yeah.

694
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:14,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm a museum educator by training, so I'm familiar with the informal or unstructured learning environments.

695
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:21,894
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the options elsewhere in the district, kind of beyond elementary schools?

696
01:41:22,714 --> 01:41:27,136
[SPEAKER_14]: What would we need to run that sort of program somewhere else or for someone to?

697
01:41:30,926 --> 01:41:39,357
[SPEAKER_06]: To have it be one of our programs like but we take a bus to the different site is there other places in the district like other schools or.

698
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've explored the idea of coming to the high school.

699
01:41:43,993 --> 01:41:48,754
[SPEAKER_06]: What we ran into was that the traffic logistics were horrible.

700
01:41:49,174 --> 01:42:02,640
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the fact that the building, again is designed for high school age students and used by high school students at different times during the year right for sports and after school clubs, and there are high school students in the building at the time all the time so it's sort of.

701
01:42:04,434 --> 01:42:10,336
[SPEAKER_06]: We just didn't feel comfortable for the way that the traffic pattern would have to go, the bus would have to go behind.

702
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:18,458
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were gonna use the back of the school, it just, it proved to not be a viable, safe option.

703
01:42:18,478 --> 01:42:29,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about using one of the cafeterias, and then that would be a cafeteria program, which wasn't so attractive, you know, to get on a, we couldn't think of how many families would wanna put their student on a bus to go all the way to the high school to hang out in a cafeteria all day.

704
01:42:31,144 --> 01:42:34,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And I recognize staffing is certainly an issue.

705
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:37,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you competing with these other programs in Medford for staffing?

706
01:42:37,371 --> 01:42:39,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Is everyone trying to hire the same people?

707
01:42:39,273 --> 01:42:41,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we talked a lot about that at this meeting.

708
01:42:42,136 --> 01:42:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the

709
01:42:43,988 --> 01:42:48,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Solutions that people often come up with when they're trying to help me think of this is like, oh, well, you guys are right next to Tufts.

710
01:42:48,489 --> 01:42:49,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you advertise at Tufts?

711
01:42:49,469 --> 01:42:51,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is yes, 100%.

712
01:42:51,469 --> 01:42:53,230
[SPEAKER_06]: We are on the Tufts jobs board.

713
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:56,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an employee outreach thing called Handshake.

714
01:42:56,890 --> 01:43:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It also goes to UMass Boston and Lesley and all the different schools, Salem State.

715
01:43:01,351 --> 01:43:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on all of those job boards.

716
01:43:03,591 --> 01:43:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only Tufts students that we've gotten to work for us this year are by word of mouth.

717
01:43:07,772 --> 01:43:11,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we already had one Tufts student who said, oh, my friend was interested in doing it too.

718
01:43:11,973 --> 01:43:13,333
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't find out about it from Handshake.

719
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there's one program who is up on North Street closer to Tufts University and they employ a lot of Tufts students and I realized that like if I'm a Tufts student and I'm looking for an after school job like that programs right here I can get there I walk versus, you know, tripping across the city to get over to the Mississippi or the Roberts, unless I live there so I'm wondering if that's part of the reason but yes the answer is.

720
01:43:37,782 --> 01:43:45,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that two to six time slot is a very unique lifestyle that can afford that or a person who's interested in that and interested in working with kids.

721
01:43:46,325 --> 01:43:48,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are definitely all competing.

722
01:43:52,467 --> 01:43:53,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Lopate?

723
01:43:53,987 --> 01:44:01,409
[SPEAKER_05]: To follow up on that question about staffing, do we have an idea about the percentage of retention rates for our staff compared to other districts that you've talked to?

724
01:44:01,429 --> 01:44:02,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

725
01:44:04,328 --> 01:44:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: For us, I'd say it's about 70% of our staff are repeat over the years.

726
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:12,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

727
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:22,272
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some people in NEDS, we talk about our lifers, the people who have made a career of this and other people, it's a stepping stone to something else.

728
01:44:22,332 --> 01:44:29,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We definitely, a lot of our high school students, if they're interested in teaching, we encourage that and we encourage them to work with us when they're home from college.

729
01:44:30,146 --> 01:44:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: when they're getting their teaching degrees, two of them are now looking to be teachers, which we're very excited about.

730
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got three of our former high school are now paras in the district and work for us in afterschool.

731
01:44:41,648 --> 01:44:42,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a bit of a pipeline.

732
01:44:43,348 --> 01:44:47,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to kind of formalize that with a teacher, that would be really cool.

733
01:44:48,349 --> 01:44:55,390
[SPEAKER_06]: We do work with the early childhood, speaking of in the vocational school, we work with the early childhood teacher for their students as well.

734
01:44:58,211 --> 01:44:58,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

735
01:44:59,380 --> 01:44:59,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

736
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

737
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:02,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody asked the same questions I have to ask.

738
01:45:03,742 --> 01:45:05,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Just need you have to listen to me for longer.

739
01:45:06,504 --> 01:45:13,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So the one of the most common things we hear about is you know we have the students whether they're high school students are tough students.

740
01:45:14,728 --> 01:45:35,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ratio of 10 students per adult, for the most part, we cannot include those people in our ratios because students have finals and they can't show up or tough students go on spring break and we can't close the program down or tell parents your kids can't come to the afterschool program because we don't have enough adults.

741
01:45:35,477 --> 01:45:40,819
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's an important, when we list all the different kinds of people that we have working,

742
01:45:42,250 --> 01:46:02,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, there's a whole lot of them that we can't include in the numbers for our ratios and I don't think there is a solution we're not going to actually get any tough students or or Medford high students who will be like no no I under no circumstances while I miss work like that's doesn't make any sense we want our high school students to be students first.

743
01:46:03,175 --> 01:46:05,836
[SPEAKER_09]: and tough students probably want a break when they have breaks.

744
01:46:06,076 --> 01:46:10,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's just an important thing to repeat yet again.

745
01:46:12,019 --> 01:46:16,361
[SPEAKER_09]: The demographics categories, I appreciated you putting those in.

746
01:46:17,552 --> 01:46:26,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not for tonight, but if you could run those numbers and put like another column of how those compare to the district.

747
01:46:28,455 --> 01:46:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized that these, you know, it's like the number of students on an IEP is 45, but like, are they distributed evenly across the grades?

748
01:46:37,957 --> 01:46:38,858
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an easy thing.

749
01:46:38,878 --> 01:46:43,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would be fine with just a big, you know, take the grades that you cover in your program,

750
01:46:44,662 --> 01:46:49,606
[SPEAKER_09]: and then get that, how many students, and just get kind of percentages.

751
01:46:50,847 --> 01:46:53,869
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the most well thought out request, but I think you understand my point.

752
01:46:54,129 --> 01:46:54,769
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do.

753
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:59,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm seeing even one more column, like percentage of the program versus percentage of the school.

754
01:47:00,033 --> 01:47:01,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

755
01:47:04,236 --> 01:47:05,577
[SPEAKER_09]: You answered those questions, wonderful.

756
01:47:08,217 --> 01:47:14,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So the, oh, you answered what the, oh, the proposed annual wage adjustment, you keep, you mentioned,

757
01:47:16,547 --> 01:47:21,889
[SPEAKER_09]: the union or the unit, there isn't actually one number for the different units or unions.

758
01:47:22,529 --> 01:47:28,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like the idea that we would say we will do that, but we would have to pick a union to peg it to.

759
01:47:29,732 --> 01:47:32,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm fine with that.

760
01:47:32,793 --> 01:47:37,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's anything unusual or strange about that.

761
01:47:37,855 --> 01:47:42,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I would wanna just kind of ask our attorney about whether or not we can

762
01:47:43,004 --> 01:47:53,810
[SPEAKER_09]: take a non union group of employees and tie their increases to a union because essentially that union ends up negotiating for these non members.

763
01:47:55,211 --> 01:47:57,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that like we're at where I've worked at Mass General Brigham.

764
01:47:58,476 --> 01:48:03,479
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the nurses at Mass General Hospital are non-unionized and the nurses at the Brigham are.

765
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:09,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the Mass General nurses just get whatever the Brigham nurses are getting.

766
01:48:10,203 --> 01:48:14,986
[SPEAKER_09]: They just move lockstep, except the Mass General nurses didn't have to pay union dues.

767
01:48:15,386 --> 01:48:21,790
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do just want us to get clarification before we would make a motion on that piece.

768
01:48:23,051 --> 01:48:27,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, I mean, to add to the,

769
01:48:28,697 --> 01:48:31,380
[SPEAKER_06]: data pile of that, that's common in NEDS.

770
01:48:31,941 --> 01:48:32,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it is?

771
01:48:32,401 --> 01:48:32,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

772
01:48:32,822 --> 01:48:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well then, frankly, that's common in NEDS.

773
01:48:34,564 --> 01:48:35,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't make it up.

774
01:48:35,585 --> 01:48:35,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

775
01:48:36,026 --> 01:48:36,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a great idea.

776
01:48:36,686 --> 01:48:37,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I assumed you made it up.

777
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:45,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, if that's common in NEDS, and I definitely like that, can you just find out whether they typically tie it to the paras or the teachers?

778
01:48:45,492 --> 01:48:50,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of districts, the teachers and the paras are in the same union.

779
01:48:52,235 --> 01:48:57,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So because they're not in Medford, we may have to just pick one.

780
01:48:57,077 --> 01:49:04,100
[SPEAKER_09]: The negotiated increases in their contracts are typically very similar, although paras recently have had

781
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:08,426
[SPEAKER_09]: very big jumps because we wanted to fix that scale.

782
01:49:08,806 --> 01:49:21,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So like when we did a 25% increase in the last pair of contract, if we had done this then, you might have a financial problem in your program if we just 25% increases across the board for your staff.

783
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:26,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have to be a little more thoughtful on that.

784
01:49:28,272 --> 01:49:28,472
[SPEAKER_09]: That's...

785
01:49:30,168 --> 01:49:31,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my one concern there.

786
01:49:31,749 --> 01:49:37,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that was somehow was all my questions, because I've asked them over and over through previous years.

787
01:49:37,992 --> 01:49:54,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do want to thank you for explaining that lottery stuff, because while I understood the lottery in general, the whole, the incoming kindergartner getting through, and even though the other sibling is still on the wait list, that makes a lot of sense.

788
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:58,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I wouldn't want to have to be the family that's in that situation, but at the same time,

789
01:50:00,276 --> 01:50:03,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one less problem for families that can make that work.

790
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:09,543
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's unfortunate we don't have the space to be like, you're kindergarten again, so we're going to make room for the third grader.

791
01:50:09,643 --> 01:50:13,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not how it works, because once they're in, they're not leaving.

792
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:15,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for all your work.

793
01:50:15,427 --> 01:50:18,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's never ending.

794
01:50:18,389 --> 01:50:20,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, credit to a great team.

795
01:50:20,551 --> 01:50:24,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've said in the past, we do have excellent site coordinators.

796
01:50:24,274 --> 01:50:26,035
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a lot of good people working

797
01:50:26,687 --> 01:50:29,548
[SPEAKER_06]: with us on the afterschool and lots of good champions.

798
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

799
01:50:31,888 --> 01:50:32,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

800
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

801
01:50:34,089 --> 01:50:34,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

802
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:40,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you give us a sense of how the waitlist has grown, what the trend is here?

803
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:43,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it getting, I assume it's getting bigger or is it leveling off?

804
01:50:43,811 --> 01:50:44,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we?

805
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:45,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's leveling off.

806
01:50:46,752 --> 01:50:47,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It got a lot bigger.

807
01:50:47,892 --> 01:50:48,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly it felt like.

808
01:50:50,313 --> 01:50:52,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I first started working here six years ago.

809
01:50:52,113 --> 01:50:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you, Dr. Edvard Vinsant.

810
01:50:53,993 --> 01:50:55,434
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the same tenure, six years, right?

811
01:50:56,656 --> 01:50:58,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like it's just gotten bigger, bigger, bigger.

812
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:06,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The story I need to make clear about the waitlist is some people are getting on just because they know how hard it is to get in.

813
01:51:06,968 --> 01:51:08,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, I got to get a spot.

814
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:11,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to put my name in right away, whether I need it now or not.

815
01:51:11,473 --> 01:51:12,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But I might need it in the future.

816
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're getting on the waitlist.

817
01:51:16,168 --> 01:51:18,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever a spot opens up, I call people off the waitlist.

818
01:51:18,912 --> 01:51:21,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've already had four people say, oh, no, thank you, I don't need it.

819
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:29,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means that the numbers that I had leading up to my phone call to them were inaccurate because there was a number on my waitlist that didn't actually need it.

820
01:51:30,029 --> 01:51:33,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So I worry about thinking about what the waitlist means.

821
01:51:33,531 --> 01:51:38,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, the numbers that I have actually written down in my spreadsheets are getting have gotten bigger.

822
01:51:38,993 --> 01:51:41,654
[SPEAKER_06]: They're leveling off over the last two, three years.

823
01:51:41,674 --> 01:51:49,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd be really curious to see that as long as along with the numbers of percentage of people who are declining waitlist spots.

824
01:51:49,937 --> 01:51:55,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think if that's changing as well, that tells us something about how people are filling their needs.

825
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

826
01:51:57,065 --> 01:51:59,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep, I wonder, yeah.

827
01:51:59,487 --> 01:52:04,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's certainly something I can do from now on, keeping track of both of those numbers.

828
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:06,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I could even get it retroactively.

829
01:52:07,031 --> 01:52:09,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly what the wait list looks like over time, I could get for you.

830
01:52:09,713 --> 01:52:14,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because I think you're absolutely right that the raw numbers don't tell the whole story.

831
01:52:14,556 --> 01:52:20,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what are the key metrics here to understand how we are or are not meeting the need?

832
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we hear a lot of anecdotes and what,

833
01:52:23,806 --> 01:52:28,371
[SPEAKER_14]: what's true across the district or in specific schools be really helpful.

834
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:28,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

835
01:52:28,932 --> 01:52:41,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, you know, if I'm a parent who doesn't have any is didn't get into any of the programs in Medford, I could see somebody else who's already in one of the other programs in Medford doesn't need it as badly as they do.

836
01:52:42,727 --> 01:52:45,090
[SPEAKER_06]: But the parents want to stay on our waitlist because

837
01:52:45,441 --> 01:52:46,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are the most attractive.

838
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:53,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the sort of number one choice for everybody because their kids don't have to get on a bus because they know exactly where the school is to go pick up their kids after school.

839
01:52:53,484 --> 01:52:58,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had that frank conversation with all of the programs on Friday when I met with them and they agreed.

840
01:52:58,406 --> 01:53:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, it's maddening when you call them and they say, yep, terrific.

841
01:53:01,447 --> 01:53:06,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And they come and then they call us and say, oh, I'm leaving tomorrow because I got into the school after school program.

842
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:13,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So then it's not the end of the world because then a spot opens up and they get to call somebody off of their wait list, but it's changing.

843
01:53:14,813 --> 01:53:19,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So then the question becomes, you know, who gets, should it only be for the people who aren't in another program?

844
01:53:20,077 --> 01:53:23,200
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe that other program's not ideal for them.

845
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:30,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, again, these numbers tell a story, but it's not just the, as clear as just the numbers.

846
01:53:30,906 --> 01:53:34,629
[SPEAKER_14]: And then one more, you may not have this answer until the end of the year, until next year.

847
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:40,373
[SPEAKER_14]: So Ready, Set, Kids is a new program that was kind of formed in response to some of the challenges.

848
01:53:41,434 --> 01:53:41,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Has it helped?

849
01:53:44,286 --> 01:53:52,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they're lovely people, they were at our- Yes, and this is not about them and the quality of their program, which I've heard good things.

850
01:53:52,808 --> 01:53:54,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It's created a different set of problems, right?

851
01:53:54,929 --> 01:54:02,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Because since we're in partnership providing transportation to all of the programs, Ready, Set, Kids is on the corner of the city.

852
01:54:03,151 --> 01:54:10,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really difficult to get to from all of the elementary schools, even the Brooks School, which is very close to it, just because the traffic at that hour is a nightmare.

853
01:54:11,093 --> 01:54:14,134
[SPEAKER_06]: because there are so many, there's overcrowding on the buses.

854
01:54:14,254 --> 01:54:15,594
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a discussion for a different day.

855
01:54:17,015 --> 01:54:19,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, it's been helpful.

856
01:54:19,655 --> 01:54:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: They only have 30 spots in the 30s range.

857
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:25,857
[SPEAKER_06]: So our wait list, you saw how big it was.

858
01:54:25,957 --> 01:54:29,438
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the hundreds or over a hundred.

859
01:54:29,478 --> 01:54:31,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's helped.

860
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:33,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

861
01:54:33,539 --> 01:54:39,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's great to have, I would like a bazillion options for families because each program, like I said, is a little bit different.

862
01:54:39,521 --> 01:54:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

863
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:50,263
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that's one difference in between, I know you said these problems are not unique to Medford, but I think there are communities around us that have many more options.

864
01:54:50,604 --> 01:54:53,284
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of private options, not preschools.

865
01:54:53,725 --> 01:54:53,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

866
01:54:54,605 --> 01:54:59,687
[SPEAKER_06]: As though we have a YMCA, a youth center, it's not like a giant, it's not one of those giant facilities that can house.

867
01:54:59,867 --> 01:55:00,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I live next door to that one.

868
01:55:01,667 --> 01:55:02,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I see the space.

869
01:55:05,669 --> 01:55:06,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Londo Kern.

870
01:55:14,096 --> 01:55:15,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you, Vice Chair Graham.

871
01:55:17,037 --> 01:55:31,300
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at slide eight, it does show that our numbers are increasing at a school or two, so I guess my question is, we are doing better with staffing, and how much have we increased over the last two years with regards to staff levels?

872
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:43,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So staff, we've got more reliable staff, meaning they can work more consistent days in the

873
01:55:43,601 --> 01:55:55,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year and the year before we had staff that weren't sort of sure which days they could work from week to week, which was a little harder to staff for, and certainly harder to, you know, to depend on, but we did.

874
01:55:55,586 --> 01:56:08,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we made it work, but the increase was because of reliable staff that were, you know, could give us set days when they worked, so then we could give set days for the families on which days, you know, how many kids we could have.

875
01:56:11,323 --> 01:56:14,924
[SPEAKER_06]: but I worry about that because, you know, compared to the year.

876
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:15,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

877
01:56:18,125 --> 01:56:38,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I only ask because I know that we have made requests to try to increase, especially at the three schools that are not at anywhere near the capacity as our fourth school, which is the Brooks, and just out of fairness to families from the three other schools, I think it's just important to try to continue to increase staffing so we can

878
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:42,021
[SPEAKER_11]: increase those levels to make it more fair across the district.

879
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:51,342
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think there's 90 people on the wait list for the Roberts alone, but we only have 66 spots where at the Brooks, it's about 125.

880
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:55,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just my only plea to do whatever we can.

881
01:56:55,403 --> 01:56:58,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you're doing a great deal, Mr. McCarry.

882
01:56:58,444 --> 01:57:05,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I just hope that we'd be able to increase, continue to increase as it seems like we have at the Misita.

883
01:57:05,472 --> 01:57:09,235
[SPEAKER_11]: which I'm assuming means you must have found one or two more staff members there.

884
01:57:10,556 --> 01:57:18,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So any push I can give to, we're working on things on the city side, our rec department's ready, willing and able to help set up a program.

885
01:57:18,642 --> 01:57:19,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a space issue.

886
01:57:20,603 --> 01:57:23,545
[SPEAKER_11]: The YMCA was, when they were gonna go into St.

887
01:57:23,605 --> 01:57:28,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis, rec was gonna open a program on Forest Street, and then that fell through for the YMCA.

888
01:57:29,069 --> 01:57:31,131
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know how difficult it is to,

889
01:57:31,601 --> 01:57:43,607
[SPEAKER_11]: continue to increase capacity, but there's definitely over 200 people on the wait list, 200 families, and we want to try to do whatever we can, even if that's just a staff member or two more at each of the other three schools.

890
01:57:44,228 --> 01:57:47,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just my only plea for the families that are struggling in our community.

891
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:48,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

892
01:57:54,453 --> 01:57:55,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

893
01:57:55,554 --> 01:57:57,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have one more question I forgot to ask earlier.

894
01:57:57,935 --> 01:58:01,137
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that when we've talked about

895
01:58:01,638 --> 01:58:25,901
[SPEAKER_09]: not not you, but when we've talked about, you know, whether we change middle school to an elementary school and we've had kind of off the record conversations around what can we do around our challenges around some schools being very oversubscribed and other schools being well the mistook having a much lower population of students rezoning is a temporary problem that just essentially

896
01:58:26,448 --> 01:58:30,410
[SPEAKER_09]: kicks the ball a few years and people move to different places and then you have the same problem again.

897
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:44,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that we had discussed was that bathrooms for elementary kids are actually different, which unless you've been in one since you were a kid, you probably don't remember, but they're like, they're these ridiculous little things.

898
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:53,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if we open a program in the high school, I assume we have to renovate the high school to have bathrooms that they can use.

899
01:58:53,064 --> 01:58:54,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And is that a requirement of,

900
01:58:56,038 --> 01:58:58,120
[SPEAKER_09]: the regulations which you know all that stuff and I don't.

901
01:58:58,821 --> 01:59:01,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So if, yes, it would be for the little guys.

902
01:59:01,943 --> 01:59:19,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not licensed, so we don't have regulation, we are licensed exempt, because, you know, the state has already determined that these school buildings are safe for children, so they're safe for after school so therefore we are licensed exempt, so we don't have a licensor coming and telling us what we need to do regulations in the same way that a private company would.

903
01:59:20,885 --> 01:59:31,168
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we even just with that in mind, we even explored the idea of what if we only bust the older kids over the high school, the bigger kids, but it was still very costly.

904
01:59:32,509 --> 01:59:46,174
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be an extra bus and it's still, I mean, I'd be willing to continue to explore these things in an effort to do anything we could, but for that reason, we wouldn't have invited the little guys.

905
01:59:46,634 --> 01:59:47,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

906
01:59:47,134 --> 01:59:47,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

907
01:59:47,414 --> 01:59:47,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

908
01:59:48,094 --> 01:59:50,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, not that we are ready or anything

909
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:59,636
[SPEAKER_09]: wrecking ball at the high school but then we also have to face the impending reality that when we weather, whatever we do with the high school.

910
02:00:01,457 --> 02:00:06,921
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have displacement challenges, not right you know for families now, what happens in.

911
02:00:08,097 --> 02:00:16,178
[SPEAKER_09]: three years, two years, three years, whenever we're actually really ready to start doing something interesting with the building may not be their biggest concern.

912
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:24,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But as a member of this body, I do think about like expanding programs at a high school that we won't necessarily be able to keep.

913
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:34,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like building up this like new demand or making the community very happy about a program to then immediately shut it all off.

914
02:00:36,226 --> 02:00:41,968
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't sound like a particularly strategic approach to solving the problem.

915
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:45,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you again.

916
02:00:46,070 --> 02:00:54,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a couple of questions myself, and then there's at least one hand from the community that I wanna take before we wrap this up.

917
02:00:54,753 --> 02:01:01,976
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question is just to get clarity at each school is the constraint

918
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:05,521
[SPEAKER_12]: staff or space or both.

919
02:01:06,402 --> 02:01:19,489
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not clear, like when I look at the distribution of students at the Brooks, we're filling 53% of the need if you take the total in the program, plus the people on the wait list.

920
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:21,891
[SPEAKER_12]: At McGlynn, we're filling 77.6% of the need.

921
02:01:21,911 --> 02:01:23,552
[SPEAKER_12]: At Missittuck, we're filling 65% of the need.

922
02:01:23,572 --> 02:01:26,313
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the Roberts, we're filling 42% of the need.

923
02:01:26,353 --> 02:01:26,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Having said that,

924
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:42,175
[SPEAKER_12]: the program at the Brooks is about double everybody else's program, so I'm trying to understand, is it space, is it staff, or is it both for each building?

925
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:44,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you answer that off the top of your head, or do you need time?

926
02:01:45,317 --> 02:01:46,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, simply, it's both.

927
02:01:47,218 --> 02:01:48,019
[SPEAKER_12]: In all buildings?

928
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:48,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

929
02:01:48,939 --> 02:01:53,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what are the space constraints at the McGlynn, the Misituck, and the Roberts?

930
02:01:53,982 --> 02:01:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, in every building, we use those

931
02:02:00,161 --> 02:02:04,323
[SPEAKER_06]: specials rooms or the gym, the cafeteria, the library.

932
02:02:05,264 --> 02:02:26,495
[SPEAKER_06]: In some places we use the art rooms, in some we use the computer rooms for different reasons, partly because some of those specials spaces or extra rooms that we used to enjoy as afterschool rooms have become offices as the needs of students during the day are becoming greater and different diagnoses or different specialists

933
02:02:29,212 --> 02:02:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not positive exactly which ones, but we need more office space than we've ever needed in the past kind of, I don't know Derek unprecedented office space.

934
02:02:37,397 --> 02:02:44,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So we last year at the Roberts we lost one of our after school rooms for office space for that, where one of the

935
02:02:47,253 --> 02:02:52,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure who the person was, what they did with the, but they need to meet one-on-one with students during the day.

936
02:02:52,076 --> 02:02:55,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And we couldn't use that room as our afterschool room anymore.

937
02:02:55,417 --> 02:03:01,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we were only in the art rooms and the gym and the playgrounds and the cafeteria.

938
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:02,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

939
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:04,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, member Rousseau.

940
02:03:05,017 --> 02:03:11,681
[SPEAKER_09]: When you say office space, you're not referring to, you are meaning space for which students are receiving services.

941
02:03:11,701 --> 02:03:13,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to- A little bit of both, yeah.

942
02:03:13,401 --> 02:03:14,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And where students are receiving services, yes.

943
02:03:14,922 --> 02:03:24,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great, because typically when I hear that, I think like- It's like the desk for the person who didn't exist, whose job didn't exist in that building before, but now needs a desk to give the services and a one-on-one space, yes.

944
02:03:24,988 --> 02:03:27,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

945
02:03:28,349 --> 02:03:29,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So how can,

946
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:33,082
[SPEAKER_12]: those same spaces fit twice as many kids at the Brooks?

947
02:03:33,642 --> 02:03:37,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge challenge and it's a kind of an argument every day.

948
02:03:39,406 --> 02:03:41,948
[SPEAKER_06]: The Brooks has two art rooms and we can use both of those.

949
02:03:42,428 --> 02:03:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a nexus room that we can use.

950
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:49,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The McGlynn nexus room is a lot smaller for whatever design reason, I'm not sure why.

951
02:03:49,513 --> 02:03:56,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can only fit way fewer students in that nexus classroom than we can at the Brooks one, for example.

952
02:03:56,818 --> 02:03:59,300
[SPEAKER_06]: One group at the Brooks doesn't have a home at a given time.

953
02:03:59,867 --> 02:04:02,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say home, meaning at dismissal.

954
02:04:03,168 --> 02:04:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't like to send all our kids out to the playground right at dismissal because that's when families are there.

955
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little chaotic.

956
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:12,871
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there to greet their students and actually meet with each other and spend time together.

957
02:04:12,911 --> 02:04:16,393
[SPEAKER_06]: So to add the afterschool students into that mix is a little bit chaotic.

958
02:04:16,413 --> 02:04:25,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So we keep our students inside until about three o'clock until about a half hour after dismissal when families have had time to play and gather and then they can go.

959
02:04:26,336 --> 02:04:29,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So at a given time in the Brooks, for example, we have to combine groups.

960
02:04:29,937 --> 02:04:31,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So there might be 40 kids

961
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:40,402
[SPEAKER_06]: in the cafeteria right at dismissal or 40 kids up in the library, two separate grade groups just to get, to take attendance and make sure that everybody's there.

962
02:04:40,922 --> 02:04:42,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not ideal, it gets very loud.

963
02:04:43,342 --> 02:04:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And then teachers who are finishing their contractual obligations until three o'clock are sort of like, why are the afterschool kids so loud all the time?

964
02:04:49,963 --> 02:04:56,144
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all in the hall, you know, if we're in the hallways trying to utilize the hallway space, we're trying to get our prep work done.

965
02:04:56,205 --> 02:04:58,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, it's difficult to share.

966
02:05:00,353 --> 02:05:02,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to sound complaining, by the way.

967
02:05:03,434 --> 02:05:11,518
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think it's helpful because I think when you look at these numbers, to me it says, why can't 124 kids be at the McGlynn?

968
02:05:11,638 --> 02:05:12,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't they be at Missittuck?

969
02:05:12,938 --> 02:05:13,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And why can't they be at the Roberts?

970
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:19,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Because those wait lists would all be cleared long before those counts reach 124.

971
02:05:20,281 --> 02:05:24,143
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the question that I have for you and the administration is,

972
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,482
[SPEAKER_12]: what can you do to solve the space problem?

973
02:05:29,602 --> 02:05:45,733
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you have constraints in buildings, like that are, if you have things that are working in one building and that they're not available to you in another building, what can be done to pull all the principles together and say, how do we create space capacity?

974
02:05:46,454 --> 02:05:48,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And does that, what would that provide?

975
02:05:48,495 --> 02:05:50,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Like what kind of capacity would that provide?

976
02:05:53,177 --> 02:06:02,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I also feel like so I think that's one request that I have of you all is to say, what can you do to solve the space issue.

977
02:06:02,061 --> 02:06:10,345
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have the staff and I understand that you have to have both for this to work at all but I would like some clarity about what.

978
02:06:11,505 --> 02:06:27,545
[SPEAKER_12]: can be done to create more space so that if five people knock on your door tomorrow that you can deploy them and we can start to clear some of these wait lists so I think that's one thing that I have a really big question about and I think the other question that I have for you and you don't need to answer it today is

979
02:06:28,326 --> 02:06:33,508
[SPEAKER_12]: What should the capacity of our buildings be when it comes to after school.

980
02:06:34,048 --> 02:06:40,531
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's much less than 550 kids or whatever it is that are in the building I know it's much less than that.

981
02:06:41,791 --> 02:06:43,432
[SPEAKER_12]: In the past you have talked about.

982
02:06:44,532 --> 02:06:59,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, real like fundamental like building safety concerns that are very different in the afternoons than when you have a building full of adults so there's 100, 100 adults in a school building during the school day at any given time.

983
02:07:00,402 --> 02:07:09,485
[SPEAKER_12]: So if an evacuation is needed, if a medical emergency happens, if, you know, if anything requires people to mobilize, you have lots of options inside the school day.

984
02:07:09,945 --> 02:07:13,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that you have many less in the afternoon in the afterschool programs.

985
02:07:14,066 --> 02:07:23,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I understand that the number that we can accommodate in any given building is much less than like the capacity of the school.

986
02:07:25,129 --> 02:07:45,415
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think your point about the kind of space that is suited for after school is like, I think you did a nice job sort of outlining that but I would actually like you to tell us a little bit more about that because what you and I have talked about and what we have heard over time I think is really important, which, which are things like

987
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:47,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you just take classroom space?

988
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:55,692
[SPEAKER_12]: It was not that long ago that the administration, none of the people in this room were standing before us telling us if they had more staff, it would be no problem.

989
02:07:55,732 --> 02:07:57,452
[SPEAKER_12]: The programs could be endlessly big.

990
02:07:58,092 --> 02:08:01,253
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the time I was like, well, that's exactly what I want to hear.

991
02:08:01,313 --> 02:08:01,933
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing.

992
02:08:02,373 --> 02:08:03,733
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that's not true.

993
02:08:04,433 --> 02:08:14,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you all need to tell us what you recommend so that we can support you and we can set policy about how big these programs can be in these buildings so that

994
02:08:16,076 --> 02:08:23,572
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a clear number that we're shooting for because I think what you've said in the past is the Brooks program cannot get bigger, right?

995
02:08:23,773 --> 02:08:24,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that still true?

996
02:08:24,895 --> 02:08:25,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

997
02:08:26,775 --> 02:08:29,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think what you're saying right now is it has to get smaller.

998
02:08:30,118 --> 02:08:34,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's a really hard message to dish out to the community.

999
02:08:34,262 --> 02:08:38,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I would like to see is some clarity about like, what is that capacity?

1000
02:08:39,446 --> 02:08:50,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And in sort of in tandem with that, if you could get to that capacity number, how many more staff would you need in order to like sort of rise to that capacity level?

1001
02:08:51,497 --> 02:08:53,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be very helpful information to have.

1002
02:08:54,380 --> 02:09:00,605
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing that I think would be helpful to have about the wait list is you transport all of the kids to other programs.

1003
02:09:01,386 --> 02:09:05,610
[SPEAKER_12]: What percent of the kids on the wait list are in other programs?

1004
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:11,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you look at this, you think like 106 children at the Brooks do not have afterschool care.

1005
02:09:11,455 --> 02:09:13,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't actually believe that's true.

1006
02:09:13,256 --> 02:09:17,140
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe people are leaving their kindergartners to fend for themselves.

1007
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:21,181
[SPEAKER_12]: And while we may be the most desirable program, that's amazing.

1008
02:09:21,241 --> 02:09:23,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we had lots of space, we could take everybody and their money.

1009
02:09:24,883 --> 02:09:34,987
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the meantime, I wanna really understand the gap in the community, which is bigger than just who can fit in our program.

1010
02:09:35,047 --> 02:09:46,231
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping you can do some work maybe with our director of data and reporting to present sort of a more evolved picture than this so that we can understand that

1011
02:09:47,512 --> 02:10:05,160
[SPEAKER_12]: So that when we talk about like pulling for the lottery, we're clear about like what number are you trying to get to now and what number like what number are you even able to increase to if more staff come through the door than you're expecting because I think that's part of the frustration in the community is like people.

1012
02:10:06,544 --> 02:10:27,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that programs should be growing and you're saying they can't, and I think we need to be like really crystal clear about why that is so that there can be no confusion, it's not to say that anybody will be happy with what you have to say but I think if we can all be on the same page about those realities I think that's the first step to actually sort of solving a problem.

1013
02:10:29,454 --> 02:10:36,547
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the other question and request I would have for you all is to work with the two middle school principals to say,

1014
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:49,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there space in their buildings, which the makeup of what happens in middle school, after school is completely different than high school, but is there space in their buildings to help you with capacity?

1015
02:10:49,369 --> 02:11:02,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and if there is, again, like what kind of staff would you need to sort of fill that capacity, whatever it might be to sort of demonstrate to us what you think the growth could look like and

1016
02:11:03,762 --> 02:11:06,483
[SPEAKER_12]: set our expectations about how fast it can happen.

1017
02:11:06,644 --> 02:11:13,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think if we said like, great news, we could take 70 more kids if we opened a program at the Andrews, for example.

1018
02:11:14,687 --> 02:11:21,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's not realistic that all 70 of those kids can come in this year, because you have to have staff, you have to have all the things, right?

1019
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:23,631
[SPEAKER_12]: But like, what might be reasonable?

1020
02:11:23,651 --> 02:11:26,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's really important for us to understand.

1021
02:11:27,613 --> 02:11:28,653
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of the,

1022
02:11:30,134 --> 02:11:31,795
[SPEAKER_12]: the rate for staff.

1023
02:11:32,776 --> 02:11:38,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I am actually not in favor of tying it to a contract.

1024
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:46,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've done a lot of things for this group in particular that have been out that have operated outside of what we've been able to do.

1025
02:11:48,604 --> 02:11:53,745
[SPEAKER_12]: for staff that are on contract with us through our union partners.

1026
02:11:54,445 --> 02:12:00,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And what one unit needs and what the next unit needs is often really, really, really different.

1027
02:12:01,087 --> 02:12:14,310
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would hesitate to tie us to a contract who may or may not be experiencing the same kinds of issues that afterschool is when it comes to compensation.

1028
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:16,430
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think

1029
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:28,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I that's I think a vote we would need to take when we had a little bit more information and I would love to see if this isn't how we choose to go forward with staff comp changes like what would your recommendation be for next year?

1030
02:12:28,784 --> 02:12:32,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I would like to see that before we take it for me personally.

1031
02:12:32,746 --> 02:12:37,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Any votes on how staff rates will change for next year?

1032
02:12:37,487 --> 02:12:44,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that would be super helpful and then my last I'll say question or comment.

1033
02:12:45,857 --> 02:13:08,651
[SPEAKER_12]: is around not for this year, but exploring if there's a way to shift our rate structure for tuition so that increases to the general population joining the program do not also create an increase

1034
02:13:10,643 --> 02:13:15,667
[SPEAKER_12]: by percentage point essentially for those folks who are receiving financial assistance.

1035
02:13:15,747 --> 02:13:24,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So like when I look at this, right, we're charging $11 an hour essentially for before school and we're charging like $8 an hour for after school.

1036
02:13:24,433 --> 02:13:35,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, I would like to see those after school numbers go to something commensurate with the before school numbers, but I'm not ready to do that now because doing that would hike

1037
02:13:36,328 --> 02:13:41,050
[SPEAKER_12]: the 50% threshold for those families receiving financial assistance.

1038
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:49,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would also like to see like is there a way to uncouple this from a percentage point to like a flat dollar amount where there's like different

1039
02:13:50,270 --> 02:14:03,655
[SPEAKER_12]: different scales for tuition so that we as a committee could say, we're moving the general scale up $3 or whatever it is, but we're making a decision this year not to move this other scale.

1040
02:14:03,715 --> 02:14:18,740
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think we can accomplish that before you need to be able to tell people what the program's gonna cost next year, but I would like to see that in anticipation of this conversation next year so that we can be really thoughtful about

1041
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:23,483
[SPEAKER_12]: who we are increasing tuition for and by how much.

1042
02:14:24,503 --> 02:14:28,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think right now, like the increase that you're proposing is really modest.

1043
02:14:28,466 --> 02:14:31,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it's also modest for those people on financial assistance.

1044
02:14:31,769 --> 02:14:41,735
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we are the most desirable program in the community, putting on my like business finance hat, we should be the most expensive, right?

1045
02:14:42,376 --> 02:14:47,459
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand that we are not necessarily like here to sort of pull in

1046
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,181
[SPEAKER_12]: lots of cash.

1047
02:14:49,221 --> 02:14:50,782
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what we do as a district.

1048
02:14:51,302 --> 02:14:58,267
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would like to make sure that we can adequately pay for all the things that we need.

1049
02:14:58,747 --> 02:15:03,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's revenue generation happening, that's that's sort of a plus and a bonus.

1050
02:15:03,590 --> 02:15:04,351
[SPEAKER_12]: But if

1051
02:15:04,798 --> 02:15:14,383
[SPEAKER_12]: if people are coming to us because we're the chief, if the desire is because we're the cheapest program, I think that inflates the need in a way that is confusing.

1052
02:15:14,463 --> 02:15:17,925
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want, I want to have a clear picture of what the need is.

1053
02:15:18,705 --> 02:15:23,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's where that like sort of look at the wait list and other afterschool programs, I think becomes important.

1054
02:15:24,769 --> 02:15:29,371
[SPEAKER_12]: What you would recommend for staff raises sort of independent of tying it to a contract because they are not

1055
02:15:29,851 --> 02:15:47,452
[SPEAKER_12]: members of collective bargaining and they're not subject to union dues, and frankly their interests in terms of changes to sort of their environment are probably quite different than what our union partners experience and there's, you know, there's 10 unions so like which one.

1056
02:15:48,689 --> 02:15:52,791
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to see what that like recommendation number is as well.

1057
02:15:52,891 --> 02:16:02,495
[SPEAKER_12]: If you all could think about that when you think about like really drawing a clear capacity picture for us and maybe come back in April or May to talk to us about that.

1058
02:16:05,116 --> 02:16:10,359
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have one member of the community, but is there any, are there any other questions from the committee before I continue?

1059
02:16:10,999 --> 02:16:11,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau?

1060
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:12,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1061
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,641
[SPEAKER_09]: There was something that you just said that,

1062
02:16:19,079 --> 02:16:21,621
[SPEAKER_09]: made me realize something sort of obvious at this point.

1063
02:16:22,562 --> 02:16:29,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So McGlynn has a lot of space compared to the other elementary schools, like a lot.

1064
02:16:30,328 --> 02:16:34,151
[SPEAKER_09]: If we think of it as one building, which I mean, it was built as one building.

1065
02:16:34,371 --> 02:16:35,853
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no wall that comes down.

1066
02:16:36,913 --> 02:16:40,957
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am interested in how, are we not using middle school space?

1067
02:16:42,798 --> 02:16:43,259
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not.

1068
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:46,701
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of middle school clubs that happen.

1069
02:16:52,668 --> 02:17:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we do, here's an anecdote story that illustrates the difficulty of shared space.

1070
02:17:01,676 --> 02:17:06,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the exciting things that our afterschool program at McGlynn does is they're in charge of all the recycling for the building.

1071
02:17:07,201 --> 02:17:11,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So they go classroom to classroom and they collect all the recycling and put it in those big bins and they love it.

1072
02:17:12,425 --> 02:17:13,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a responsibility.

1073
02:17:13,646 --> 02:17:14,487
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really good at it.

1074
02:17:14,567 --> 02:17:16,248
[SPEAKER_06]: The kids that do it enjoy it.

1075
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:18,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of on a rotation of which kids get to do it.

1076
02:17:19,633 --> 02:17:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is after school.

1077
02:17:20,813 --> 02:17:23,914
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been in school all day, focused teaching and learning all day.

1078
02:17:23,974 --> 02:17:24,894
[SPEAKER_06]: This is after school.

1079
02:17:24,934 --> 02:17:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're a little bit noisy.

1080
02:17:25,954 --> 02:17:27,955
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a little bit excited that it's their turn to do it.

1081
02:17:27,995 --> 02:17:30,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're kind of maybe kind of running from room to room.

1082
02:17:31,376 --> 02:17:46,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get in a lot of trouble with the after school or the middle school teachers in the middle school hallway because the middle school and rightfully so they're having like a study club after school or whatever kind of club that they're having in their classrooms that requires kind of focus.

1083
02:17:46,299 --> 02:17:48,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And the students have chosen to be there.

1084
02:17:49,352 --> 02:18:05,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's this kind of ruckus outside and it's like oh here we go again the after school kids are noisy and they're running all over the halls and they're unattended and but they're they're not they're doing exactly what we've asked them to do, you know, maybe a little speedier than during the school day we would let them walk right because but

1085
02:18:06,636 --> 02:18:14,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's the sort of discrepancy and incongruity and the space is just designed for two different uses of the space at the wrong time.

1086
02:18:14,846 --> 02:18:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's, and just hearing that day after day having teachers sort of report to the principal, these after school kids are so loud or to the to our site coordinators, it just gets

1087
02:18:25,897 --> 02:18:28,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it so, you know what, okay, we'll just stay out of that space.

1088
02:18:28,259 --> 02:18:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just direct it over here.

1089
02:18:29,921 --> 02:18:31,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just makes it harder.

1090
02:18:31,742 --> 02:18:45,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great example of the challenges of the shared space because you've kind of put to bed my idea of like, why don't we just like make this gigantic building have way more kids?

1091
02:18:46,134 --> 02:18:50,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's with the relatively small numbers that we have

1092
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:52,650
[SPEAKER_09]: the at the McGlynn.

1093
02:18:52,850 --> 02:18:58,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you double it, you don't double the problem, the problems probably goes up exponentially.

1094
02:18:58,692 --> 02:19:00,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, and there are fewer adults in the building.

1095
02:19:01,253 --> 02:19:01,473
Right.

1096
02:19:01,973 --> 02:19:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are adults that weren't that didn't necessarily go to graduate school to learn about behavior management in the classroom, the same way that you know, the teachers all day did.

1097
02:19:10,215 --> 02:19:10,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1098
02:19:11,903 --> 02:19:12,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1099
02:19:12,703 --> 02:19:27,511
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think those are those are great illustrations of challenges I think what I would like to hear you all come back and talk to us about is, how can you collaborate across buildings with all these like really smart people we have in our district, and come up with like

1100
02:19:28,635 --> 02:19:31,257
[SPEAKER_12]: plans or solutions or things to try.

1101
02:19:31,277 --> 02:19:42,648
[SPEAKER_12]: So I like I totally get it I'm sensitive to all the things you're saying and like waving a magic wand we just like conjure up a new building and it would be this giant like sort of.

1102
02:19:44,961 --> 02:19:50,427
[SPEAKER_12]: I get like sort of the Nirvana point of view, but I think there are some like

1103
02:20:00,410 --> 02:20:24,299
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some obstacles like in the mix that I would like to see us commit to solve and I think that will require some collaboration from our middle school staff and maybe they need to sort of highlight that in their staff meeting because I don't want your staff feeling unwelcome in our buildings and I absolutely understand how tiring that can be and sort of why

1104
02:20:25,299 --> 02:20:52,514
[SPEAKER_12]: people would shy away from continuing to try to plug away at that kind of expansion but I also think like there's you know literally hundreds of kids who are trying to come into our program and again if I just like put my business hat on hundreds of kids it's like twice as much revenue as we are pulling through the door on this today and again it's not that's not what we do as a district but it is a

1105
02:20:53,783 --> 02:20:55,284
[SPEAKER_12]: data point worth talking about.

1106
02:20:55,404 --> 02:21:00,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you guys could sort of pull that together, I think that would be super helpful.

1107
02:21:00,766 --> 02:21:02,267
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do want to take some questions.

1108
02:21:02,587 --> 02:21:04,708
[SPEAKER_12]: There's at least one hand up on Zoom.

1109
02:21:04,728 --> 02:21:10,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the committee can't see that, but there is one member of the community with their hand up, Lenko.

1110
02:21:13,312 --> 02:21:14,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for recognizing me.

1111
02:21:16,193 --> 02:21:16,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me well?

1112
02:21:18,074 --> 02:21:18,655
[SPEAKER_12]: We can hear you.

1113
02:21:18,675 --> 02:21:19,335
[SPEAKER_12]: You have two minutes.

1114
02:21:20,696 --> 02:21:22,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1115
02:21:22,456 --> 02:21:23,237
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, please.

1116
02:21:23,942 --> 02:21:24,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Lenko Tankov.

1117
02:21:27,044 --> 02:21:38,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to start by sharing and emphasizing that Medford's afterschool program does not provide enough space for all families that need it.

1118
02:21:39,152 --> 02:21:45,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And our problem in Medford is unique because we don't have access to other private programs.

1119
02:21:46,016 --> 02:21:48,197
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that you have listed have

1120
02:21:50,773 --> 02:21:58,117
[SPEAKER_07]: different age groups, so they don't serve K-4 or K-8, and two of those programs are martial arts.

1121
02:21:58,637 --> 02:22:07,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So there aren't enough programs for the parents to use, and it's becoming a larger and larger problem as the city is growing.

1122
02:22:08,846 --> 02:22:13,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, more parents are coming back to work in person and cannot pick up their children.

1123
02:22:13,992 --> 02:22:17,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So my first comment is in regards to the lottery.

1124
02:22:17,616 --> 02:22:25,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It's currently set up that it serves parents that already have a child and the other child has a guaranteed spot.

1125
02:22:26,266 --> 02:22:29,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is serving fewer families in the district.

1126
02:22:31,946 --> 02:22:34,708
[SPEAKER_07]: The second comment is that this is a self-sustaining program.

1127
02:22:34,728 --> 02:22:39,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe that the capacity issue can be solved by raising the wages.

1128
02:22:39,471 --> 02:22:51,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like, my question here is, can you put some numbers behind the capacity numbers as you've already discussed, but being proactive about the space and how it's being used?

1129
02:22:52,641 --> 02:22:54,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about all of the space that can be used.

1130
02:22:55,122 --> 02:23:00,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to think about the challenges that you talked about, but really put that

1131
02:23:01,906 --> 02:23:05,109
[SPEAKER_07]: program at first priority because it's needed.

1132
02:23:05,530 --> 02:23:13,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And in terms of the staffing, my question is if raising the wages would solve this, given that it's self-sustaining.

1133
02:23:14,218 --> 02:23:14,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1134
02:23:18,082 --> 02:23:18,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Lenko.

1135
02:23:19,684 --> 02:23:22,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other questions from members of the audience?

1136
02:23:29,032 --> 02:23:35,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I think we all have sort of asked questions that might warrant a next look.

1137
02:23:35,277 --> 02:23:36,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Member Ruseau, did you have another question?

1138
02:23:36,978 --> 02:23:37,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Just gonna make a motion.

1139
02:23:38,219 --> 02:23:38,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1140
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:42,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I was gonna make the motion to approve the new pay rates for before and after school tuitions.

1141
02:23:44,223 --> 02:23:50,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve the new recommended rates for after school, before and after school tuition by Member Ruseau.

1142
02:23:50,748 --> 02:23:51,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1143
02:23:51,308 --> 02:23:52,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Member Reinfeld.

1144
02:23:53,329 --> 02:23:53,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call.

1145
02:23:54,991 --> 02:23:55,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley?

1146
02:23:55,851 --> 02:23:56,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1147
02:23:57,072 --> 02:23:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Graham?

1148
02:23:58,093 --> 02:23:58,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1149
02:23:59,147 --> 02:24:01,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And my Glockman is absent member all the padding.

1150
02:24:01,169 --> 02:24:01,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1151
02:24:02,030 --> 02:24:02,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, right.

1152
02:24:03,111 --> 02:24:03,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1153
02:24:04,072 --> 02:24:05,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, Maryland go current.

1154
02:24:06,075 --> 02:24:06,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1155
02:24:08,157 --> 02:24:12,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative one absent the motion passes so tuition rates are approved.

1156
02:24:14,101 --> 02:24:22,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think the question that I would have for the rest of the committee is whether there are any other data requests that you would like to see Ms.

1157
02:24:22,266 --> 02:24:27,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Fidler-Carey bring back to us on a second look at this.

1158
02:24:28,550 --> 02:24:34,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps you can email the superintendent with what those requests might be if anything comes up in the next week or so to give Ms.

1159
02:24:34,753 --> 02:24:36,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Fidler-Carey some time to

1160
02:24:36,803 --> 02:24:45,324
[SPEAKER_12]: think through and work with our Director of Data and Reporting, among others, to figure out what all information she can provide us based on what we've asked for.

1161
02:24:45,344 --> 02:24:47,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that work for everybody?

1162
02:24:48,145 --> 02:24:48,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1163
02:24:49,585 --> 02:24:50,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ms.

1164
02:24:50,025 --> 02:24:50,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Fidler-Carey.

1165
02:24:50,825 --> 02:24:52,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for the opportunity.

1166
02:24:53,186 --> 02:24:54,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, if I may.

1167
02:24:54,466 --> 02:24:56,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1168
02:24:56,486 --> 02:25:05,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we put in a motion to get an update in May in hopes to expand capacity at our three other schools?

1169
02:25:06,553 --> 02:25:19,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, so the motion is to get an update in the month of May, in the hopes of being able to look at potential capacity expansion by Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1170
02:25:19,517 --> 02:25:20,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

1171
02:25:20,358 --> 02:25:20,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1172
02:25:20,778 --> 02:25:22,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Member Olapade.

1173
02:25:22,538 --> 02:25:23,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call.

1174
02:25:24,419 --> 02:25:25,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley?

1175
02:25:25,199 --> 02:25:25,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1176
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:26,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Graham?

1177
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:27,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1178
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:29,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin is absent.

1179
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:29,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade?

1180
02:25:29,881 --> 02:25:30,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1181
02:25:31,421 --> 02:25:32,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

1182
02:25:32,342 --> 02:25:32,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1183
02:25:33,182 --> 02:25:33,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Members say yes.

1184
02:25:33,962 --> 02:25:34,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1185
02:25:35,443 --> 02:25:36,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

1186
02:25:37,892 --> 02:25:40,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

1187
02:25:41,675 --> 02:25:42,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ms.

1188
02:25:42,095 --> 02:25:42,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Fither-Carey.

1189
02:25:43,916 --> 02:25:45,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Next time you don't have to come in person.

1190
02:25:46,198 --> 02:25:47,499
[SPEAKER_12]: You can come on Zoom if you want.

1191
02:25:53,122 --> 02:25:57,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we have item number four, revised excessive heat protocol.

1192
02:25:57,465 --> 02:26:01,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of operations enrichment and innovation.

1193
02:26:02,349 --> 02:26:02,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Cushing?

1194
02:26:03,507 --> 02:26:05,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Madam Vice Chair, members of the committee.

1195
02:26:05,829 --> 02:26:08,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate this opportunity to represent.

1196
02:26:09,532 --> 02:26:15,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went through the video and the questions and suggestions that were posed previously.

1197
02:26:16,177 --> 02:26:16,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I've made the edits.

1198
02:26:17,157 --> 02:26:30,668
[SPEAKER_10]: The only one that really wasn't made was a set of rules for AC buildings and a set of rules for buildings that don't have AC, because as we do a comprehensive look at the district,

1199
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:54,677
[SPEAKER_10]: What we want to do is we want to make sure that we're paying attention to spaces that may, at any given time, even with new and updated air conditioning units that we hope to have in place over the next X number of months, as that work is ongoing, that we're paying attention to the district as a whole, and any individual space that may have a temporary

1200
02:26:57,216 --> 02:26:59,698
[SPEAKER_10]: HVAC issue that needs to be resolved.

1201
02:27:00,539 --> 02:27:16,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we did was we changed everything here is from the National Weather Service, which at times has some conflicting information or information that does not directly correlate to one another.

1202
02:27:17,027 --> 02:27:33,095
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we did was we switched from the heat index and risk levels and protective measures from the last time from a three bullet list that I think was confusing as to time and days.

1203
02:27:33,796 --> 02:27:42,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what this will do is we are more direct to member Graham's suggestion that the Metro Public Schools will use these inclement weather protocols.

1204
02:27:45,433 --> 02:27:46,353
[SPEAKER_10]: as we move forward.

1205
02:27:46,873 --> 02:27:54,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that by having these human indexes, by paying heed to the weather, we actually pay attention to the weather.

1206
02:27:54,875 --> 02:28:00,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent is a member of a service that provides updates on a daily basis.

1207
02:28:00,937 --> 02:28:11,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are shared with us, that we are very in tune to the weather and to make sure that we're paying close heed to what's going on.

1208
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:19,692
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll notice that on page two, that the caution, extreme caution, danger and extreme danger did not change to match.

1209
02:28:20,598 --> 02:28:23,359
[SPEAKER_10]: the indices on the front.

1210
02:28:23,539 --> 02:28:45,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because we will have to pay attention to the information that is being given to us by the National Weather Service and local weathermen and local services that we may have to adapt and move forward based upon the recommendations of that day or the day's upcoming.

1211
02:28:46,084 --> 02:29:03,300
[SPEAKER_10]: So what this will have us do is we will be really paying attention as we are getting heat advisories, heat warnings, and those types of things that you've probably heard more frequently than was previously presented.

1212
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:06,862
[SPEAKER_10]: The QR code directly links.

1213
02:29:06,942 --> 02:29:11,024
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have the document yourself, there's a hot link in there.

1214
02:29:11,624 --> 02:29:22,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the QR code is for if you have a paper copy that will automatically open up the MIA's heat protocol for us to pay attention to and to use that.

1215
02:29:23,804 --> 02:29:26,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Member Ruseau, for that suggestion.

1216
02:29:28,570 --> 02:29:31,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are in the process of developing a checklist.

1217
02:29:32,374 --> 02:29:38,100
[SPEAKER_10]: We have updated the numbers in there as well.

1218
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:43,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be checking the temperature inside as well, Member Branley, so thank you for that.

1219
02:29:44,667 --> 02:30:00,235
[SPEAKER_10]: The best instrument from expanded research over the past however many weeks since I last presented to you, sorry, is the Spear scientific heat stress meter, which will

1220
02:30:02,456 --> 02:30:05,418
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically this, it's a wet heat globe.

1221
02:30:05,678 --> 02:30:07,940
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the wrong term, I apologize.

1222
02:30:08,380 --> 02:30:11,343
[SPEAKER_10]: But the best way is not with a thermometer or anything like that.

1223
02:30:11,443 --> 02:30:23,011
[SPEAKER_10]: But by this scientific tool, I looked at the middle range price because they go up as high as $700 for us to invest in a few of those.

1224
02:30:24,472 --> 02:30:24,693
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1225
02:30:25,945 --> 02:30:48,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that this protocol puts it more in the hands of the extreme heat operations team to really come together to pay attention to what the National Weather Service and other providers are telling us, that we are prepared and ready to move as the heat builds as opposed to being caught flat footed as we may have been in September.

1226
02:30:52,554 --> 02:30:52,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1227
02:30:52,895 --> 02:30:57,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the changes especially closing the missing one degree gap.

1228
02:31:00,793 --> 02:31:02,416
[SPEAKER_09]: There's on the first page.

1229
02:31:03,243 --> 02:31:14,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Right under the first table, the last sentence of that paragraph, during high heat days, there's... I missed that on the formatting, so I'll fix that.

1230
02:31:14,848 --> 02:31:15,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1231
02:31:15,188 --> 02:31:21,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, actually, the sentence before that, which is a complete sentence, actually, it doesn't seem to actually... I don't know what on earth it could mean.

1232
02:31:21,491 --> 02:31:25,492
[SPEAKER_09]: The information will allow a five-day window of preparation for extreme heat.

1233
02:31:28,792 --> 02:31:47,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that is suggesting will happen for that five days, because there are date there there are timeframes about like how far ahead etc to, you know, to plan for these events so that that that sentence also seems like if you took the sentence out, it seems like it would actually say the same stuff, which is

1234
02:31:49,062 --> 02:31:51,244
[SPEAKER_09]: that doesn't need to add anything, so less is always more.

1235
02:31:51,264 --> 02:32:04,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so by the five days was basically saying that we should be able to have prepared five days out, and understanding of the level of heat that's going to be coming, so that we can be prepared.

1236
02:32:04,677 --> 02:32:06,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not sure why that sentence didn't finish.

1237
02:32:07,059 --> 02:32:11,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because in the keyboard in the chair, I understand that.

1238
02:32:11,683 --> 02:32:15,927
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the definitions, there are all these other time frames that are not related to the five days.

1239
02:32:16,427 --> 02:32:20,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I feel like this five days is just sort of like randomly in there.

1240
02:32:20,091 --> 02:32:22,653
[SPEAKER_09]: That isn't reflective elsewhere.

1241
02:32:22,713 --> 02:32:24,815
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't entertain a motion to strike that.

1242
02:32:25,055 --> 02:32:25,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1243
02:32:26,416 --> 02:32:28,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly, this isn't actually a policy in our manual.

1244
02:32:28,958 --> 02:32:31,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So I certainly hope you would strike that.

1245
02:32:31,881 --> 02:32:32,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other thing that

1246
02:32:34,181 --> 02:32:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we did talk about this at the last meeting about using different words from caution, extreme caution, danger, and extreme danger.

1247
02:32:40,346 --> 02:32:49,272
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I understand what you're saying, they use the exact same colors and they are in the exact same order.

1248
02:32:49,632 --> 02:32:53,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And in fact, lower risk level even includes in parentheses, the word caution.

1249
02:32:55,138 --> 02:33:13,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We either have to give up the color coding on the top table, or we need to bring the risk levels in line with the NWS Heat Index because there is way too much confirmation going on that these are related concepts in this one page.

1250
02:33:14,317 --> 02:33:15,378
[SPEAKER_09]: The exact same colors

1251
02:33:16,274 --> 02:33:17,715
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really close together.

1252
02:33:17,735 --> 02:33:24,477
[SPEAKER_09]: No rational person is going to see that top chart and not think that it's related to the bottom one.

1253
02:33:25,037 --> 02:33:28,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And then to see different wording, and I understand why.

1254
02:33:30,117 --> 02:33:55,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would recommend either we give up the use of color coding in the top entirely, whether we change risk level to just being one, two, three, four, and do something different there to take away that excessive, there's just an enormous amount of information here that makes you think they're related when they're not.

1255
02:33:58,624 --> 02:34:05,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand why you would want to not have them be related, because this is the preparation stuff at the top.

1256
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:10,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I will say, I apologize for cutting you off, is

1257
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,983
[SPEAKER_10]: These were taken from the exact same page on the National Weather Service.

1258
02:34:15,443 --> 02:34:19,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I would say more to take away the color from the top.

1259
02:34:21,108 --> 02:34:31,957
[SPEAKER_10]: And maintain, I really think maintaining the caution, extreme caution, danger, extreme danger, really paints a very clear picture.

1260
02:34:31,977 --> 02:34:35,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think that as we go through this,

1261
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:53,848
[SPEAKER_10]: that working with our communications director, that we'll be able to put out information to families as well to help them over the weekends and in times when school may not be in session in September and late June as we have some days during those months.

1262
02:34:54,348 --> 02:34:55,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good to me.

1263
02:34:55,309 --> 02:34:55,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1264
02:34:55,749 --> 02:35:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only other thing, you know, just some formatting stuff, there's like a random sentence under the temperature chart that

1265
02:35:03,172 --> 02:35:05,633
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's actually what I meant on the formatting.

1266
02:35:05,733 --> 02:35:07,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

1267
02:35:07,474 --> 02:35:12,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, there, I was looking through our, the, the MSC policy service.

1268
02:35:13,456 --> 02:35:18,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a policy that at least one district has possibly only one that.

1269
02:35:18,718 --> 02:35:21,399
[SPEAKER_09]: heat modification policy, JJIH.

1270
02:35:22,299 --> 02:35:32,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that it might make sense once you've finished kind of getting all this stuff done, if you can just, you know, it doesn't have to be another presentation, but, you know, just include it in our packets.

1271
02:35:32,302 --> 02:35:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one of us could motion perhaps to send it to subcommittee to adopt it as a policy officially.

1272
02:35:39,204 --> 02:35:47,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Formatting wise, you know, I couldn't find any policies anywhere that include interesting things like color and graphics.

1273
02:35:48,687 --> 02:35:52,631
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a limitation of our policy service that will continue to bug me.

1274
02:35:53,932 --> 02:35:59,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So figuring out a way to make this into just words for the purposes of policy would be a little work.

1275
02:36:00,018 --> 02:36:04,322
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it makes sense to get it adopted as a policy.

1276
02:36:04,622 --> 02:36:09,126
[SPEAKER_09]: But for instance, the equipment needs, I mean, that's not a policy.

1277
02:36:09,166 --> 02:36:11,608
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a list of things we need to buy.

1278
02:36:11,628 --> 02:36:11,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So

1279
02:36:14,292 --> 02:36:14,592
[SPEAKER_09]: but thank you.

1280
02:36:14,952 --> 02:36:19,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you do have questions on that, there's wide variation in the misting devices.

1281
02:36:20,216 --> 02:36:35,868
[SPEAKER_10]: We would be able to get, they're called CoolZone portable fans that would be about $150 per day per unit that would be able to be positioned outside of the schools as students would enter back in if they were doing.

1282
02:36:36,388 --> 02:36:42,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously that's less important potentially than other items on here.

1283
02:36:42,833 --> 02:37:00,606
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we definitely need to consider, it's being considered and has been considered in the McGlynn playground reconstruction is natural shade, but there may be some playgrounds as we move through our other schools and rebuild when natural shade, just for whatever reason, is an option.

1284
02:37:01,126 --> 02:37:04,208
[SPEAKER_10]: So considering shade structures,

1285
02:37:05,869 --> 02:37:20,795
[SPEAKER_10]: that are put up and taken down or permanently installed and with shade sails, for lack of a better term, that can be taken in and taken out during the winter months so they have a longer life.

1286
02:37:21,455 --> 02:37:21,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1287
02:37:21,796 --> 02:37:26,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one other question on the water bottle filling stations.

1288
02:37:26,077 --> 02:37:27,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they really that expensive?

1289
02:37:28,513 --> 02:37:37,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So the filling stations themselves, and Mr. McLaughlin will be able to answer this best, but are about $1,000 a piece.

1290
02:37:37,885 --> 02:37:41,449
[SPEAKER_10]: The installation and retrofit to the

1291
02:37:43,852 --> 02:37:47,096
[SPEAKER_10]: to the existing area is what's very expensive.

1292
02:37:47,516 --> 02:37:55,185
[SPEAKER_10]: We did just get invited into a program with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for testing of the water in the buildings.

1293
02:37:55,385 --> 02:38:04,756
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're providing them building maps and also either discounted or free bottle filling stations.

1294
02:38:05,515 --> 02:38:05,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1295
02:38:05,975 --> 02:38:08,336
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd still have to install them, I take it.

1296
02:38:08,516 --> 02:38:15,098
[SPEAKER_10]: That's up for interpretation right now, but we're hopeful that we'll be able to get that discounted.

1297
02:38:15,358 --> 02:38:15,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1298
02:38:16,098 --> 02:38:19,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yep.

1299
02:38:22,180 --> 02:38:22,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Reinfeld.

1300
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:23,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1301
02:38:23,821 --> 02:38:27,702
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if we could reorder things in the definition section.

1302
02:38:27,722 --> 02:38:34,364
[SPEAKER_14]: The rest of this protocol does a great job of going from progressively, introducing progressively more

1303
02:38:35,758 --> 02:38:41,204
[SPEAKER_14]: extreme conditions and I found myself jumping around and reading it backwards.

1304
02:38:42,905 --> 02:38:52,435
[SPEAKER_14]: With the definitions that the outlook is kind of the first stage and then we're looking at the watches or the advisory.

1305
02:38:54,761 --> 02:38:56,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can definitely reorder that.

1306
02:38:56,842 --> 02:39:02,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Interestingly enough, that is how they are, which is equally confusing on the National Weather Service.

1307
02:39:03,327 --> 02:39:17,557
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think if we flip them, it'll make it more... I think the goal here was perhaps to make the excessive, the most extreme thing first, so we see that first, but it felt really inconsistent with... I'm happy to flip it.

1308
02:39:17,918 --> 02:39:18,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1309
02:39:22,775 --> 02:39:26,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had one, maybe two questions.

1310
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:36,874
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is from an equipment needs perspective, how much of this money needs to be spent expended this year, like what's the total that we are seeking from a budget perspective.

1311
02:39:39,531 --> 02:39:58,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So the biggest thing, so right now, we'll be rating, we are currently rating myself, Mr. McLaughlin, members from the city team, Brenda Pike, Fiona Maxwell, Alicia Hunt, and anyone I forgot to mention, my apologies.

1312
02:39:58,958 --> 02:40:11,561
[SPEAKER_10]: but we're currently actually rating and we'll have a meeting on Wednesday on the owner's project manager aspect of the McGlynn and Andrews HVAC project.

1313
02:40:11,581 --> 02:40:14,642
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so that is moving along, all right?

1314
02:40:16,582 --> 02:40:22,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've been very clear about our desire for the electric facility.

1315
02:40:24,605 --> 02:40:41,635
[SPEAKER_10]: full electrification of that, that there may be some backup of a natural gas generator in the event of a power failure, but that's something that we're actively working on.

1316
02:40:42,375 --> 02:40:49,539
[SPEAKER_10]: The other, and we have to look at how feasible that is, but it is the ultimate goal that we're there.

1317
02:40:49,559 --> 02:40:53,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize, I'm having a really hard time reading.

1318
02:40:54,713 --> 02:41:05,259
[SPEAKER_10]: No, so it's really right now the purchasing of the fans for MHS and AC Limited.

1319
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:07,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's $50 times 200.

1320
02:41:09,262 --> 02:41:13,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the neighborhood with delivery probably around $10,000.

1321
02:41:16,006 --> 02:41:23,911
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottle filling stations is unrealistic in this budget cycle before the end of the year, if I'm being honest.

1322
02:41:28,108 --> 02:41:35,612
[SPEAKER_10]: The maintain on hand supply of the 40,000 waters can be easily accomplished as well as I would say a replenishment as necessary.

1323
02:41:37,753 --> 02:41:44,517
[SPEAKER_10]: The sphere scientific, it would be nice to have two of those in the district, one for athletics and one to be moved around the district as necessary.

1324
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:56,226
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are, and I mean, the artificial shades, that would be a really wonderful, these are easy ups, pop-ups.

1325
02:41:56,927 --> 02:42:04,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And so with these, you need to make sure that they're secured in the ground so that if we do on high heat days, high wind is also a problem.

1326
02:42:05,414 --> 02:42:09,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to make sure that these don't become projectiles for staff and students.

1327
02:42:09,678 --> 02:42:13,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'd need the sandbags and just other anchoring as well.

1328
02:42:13,901 --> 02:42:16,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So all in, it's about $4,500 per school.

1329
02:42:17,643 --> 02:42:21,746
[SPEAKER_10]: If any PTOs or PTGs would like to have branded, that would be nice.

1330
02:42:23,527 --> 02:42:27,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all in, probably about $15,000 to $16,000.

1331
02:42:27,189 --> 02:42:27,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1332
02:42:27,289 --> 02:42:31,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And will you, Superintendent, report back to us on whether

1333
02:42:44,176 --> 02:42:46,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of other budget conversations going on.

1334
02:42:47,041 --> 02:42:56,175
[SPEAKER_12]: When we have a budget update again, can we talk about whether these requests can be filled in this calendar, in this academic year?

1335
02:42:56,977 --> 02:42:57,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

1336
02:42:57,718 --> 02:42:58,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1337
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:10,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just one other question, or it's maybe just sort of a related note is, can we make sure that the filters on the water filling stations are replaced in a timely way?

1338
02:43:10,991 --> 02:43:25,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hearing some chatter amongst the high schoolers who have thoughts and feelings about lots of things, but commenting about how the filling stations that are there don't work because of the filters.

1339
02:43:26,604 --> 02:43:37,773
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the things that we will do, we're still in the process of it's a copious amount of work, building out the new ticket system to make sure that every room and every space is accounted for.

1340
02:43:38,313 --> 02:43:42,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So we haven't launched yet but that work is ongoing just so that everybody is aware.

1341
02:43:44,078 --> 02:43:59,536
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things in that system that we will be able to do is to put in, not just for bottle filling stations, but for others, time checks that are prompted to certain individuals for them to go and check and then to actually fill out a report of what they see.

1342
02:44:00,037 --> 02:44:08,038
[SPEAKER_10]: the light was green, but so that will be light was yellow or whatever it was so that then we'll be able to be on a time schedule.

1343
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Realize those are not on a time schedule.

1344
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:21,941
[SPEAKER_10]: There aren't an amount of filling, but what we'll do is we'll put in a monthly check or a bi-monthly check to make sure that those are being appropriately monitored and filters replaced.

1345
02:44:22,781 --> 02:44:22,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

1346
02:44:23,081 --> 02:44:23,401
