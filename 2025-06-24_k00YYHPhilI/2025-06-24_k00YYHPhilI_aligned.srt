00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:35,618
Hello everyone and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:48,628
I am John Petrella and the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:57,201
And our guest for today's show is Patrick Clerkin, who is a candidate for our Meffitt City Council.

4
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:00,765
I want to thank you, Patrick, for joining us today.

5
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:05,871
I also want to thank you for being a candidate for City Council.

6
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,355
It's important that we have people actually run for the job.

7
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,117
So thank you for being with us.

8
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,739
Thank you for having me, John.

9
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:13,580
It's really great to be here.

10
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,260
OK.

11
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,300
We're going to get right into it, Patrick.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,461
We're not going to hold back here.

13
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:31,205
So we'll start the show by asking you to share with our audience just some background, general background information about yourself.

14
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:35,147
Who's Patrick Clark, and how long you've been in Medford?

15
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:35,327
Sure.

16
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:40,854
So I've been in Medford for nine years now, coming up in September.

17
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,656
And before that, I grew up in North Reading.

18
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,417
I've been a North Shore guy my whole life.

19
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:48,819
And I went to North Reading Public School.

20
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,363
And when I was in school, my favorite subjects were actually history, geography, and literature.

21
00:01:55,843 --> 00:02:00,026
So what does somebody whose favorite subjects are those do after that?

22
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,247
They go to school for engineering, of course.

23
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,995
I went to Northeastern for mechanical engineering and it was it was partly

24
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,614
My high school had a couple programs.

25
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:23,259
It was not like the Medford High School with these great vocational programs, but it had an architecture program or a class, I should say, an engineering class, and those sort of stoked my curiosity.

26
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,701
So when I went to Northeastern Mechanical Engineering, did a couple co-ops there.

27
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:32,463
If you're familiar, they have this, you do classes one semester, jobs another semester.

28
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,124
That was great because that was work experience.

29
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:42,248
And I also got involved with a fraternity when I was there and was eventually the president of the fraternity.

30
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:44,969
So that's my entry point into leadership roles.

31
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:53,614
And really post-college, I started working for a company in the semiconductor test industry.

32
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,555
Nothing that you or I would ever work with.

33
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,596
It's really company to company stuff.

34
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:06,248
And I was there for a couple years and I just kind of decided, you know, corporate was not really like I was too restless for corporate.

35
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:11,916
And so I ventured out on my own and I really got involved with

36
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:21,384
At one point, I was doing my own entrepreneurial pursuit called Tether, and that was in the realm of communications and software.

37
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:30,230
And then I also started making money through doing handyman work, which I really enjoyed because that was more practical, hands-on.

38
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:34,974
It was very face-to-face with clients, and I got to know a lot of my neighbors.

39
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,195
So I'll say that

40
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:43,106
Those were sort of my entry points into, because people look at why you're involved in politics.

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:56,366
Engineering is sort of this profession that allows you to look deeply at problems from a systemic level and to look at the limitations of systems and to look at the possibilities.

42
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:57,827
So it's that.

43
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:01,529
It's a combination of having gotten to know my neighbors through the handyman work.

44
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:09,193
And I would say it's also the desire to be civically involved and an intermediary between people.

45
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:09,673
OK.

46
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,154
Good answer.

47
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,695
Interesting stuff.

48
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:20,125
Can you give us a couple of reasons why you're running for a seat?

49
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,309
What prompted you to decide to run for the job?

50
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, so I mentioned before that I started doing handyman work.

51
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:38,387
And at one point, one of my neighbors said, oh, I really wish that we had better options for city council and that people were better addressing these issues.

52
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:39,368
So I looked into it.

53
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,569
That was 2023.

54
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,890
And I really jumped in at the last minute.

55
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,993
This was like a week before the you have to get signatures to get your name on the ballot.

56
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,815
It was like a week before the signature deadline.

57
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:57,620
So when I say I was running for council, it was more like I was sprinting for council because it was such an immersive and quick process.

58
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:15,210
But what I learned from last time, I didn't win last time, but what I learned was that one of the biggest issues that affects the city, that affects all of the problems that people see, is the communications issue that's citywide and it's gotten

59
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:24,019
particularly bad over the last five or six years with the lack of a common hub of information, like a city paper or something like that.

60
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:31,227
And so now we have some of these new sources, like we've got Medford Happenings, we've got Gotta Know Medford, we've got some things that have filled that void.

61
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:35,311
But after I ran last time, I really got this

62
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:40,956
civically oriented group of people together who really all saw the communications as a problem.

63
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:47,561
And we were meeting every week at the library, pretty much from New Year's to Memorial Day, trying to set something up.

64
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,263
And what we came up with was called the Medford Community Network.

65
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:55,166
And it kind of got shelved, but we got pretty far with that.

66
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:58,849
And that's the foundation that I'm building upon this time.

67
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,492
I have some ideas around improving the communications throughout the city.

68
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,213
Okay, so you mentioned a few things there.

69
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:18,500
You know, our current city council, obviously you're running, you mentioned, you know, things aren't going maybe in the direction that a lot of people want to see the city going.

70
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:25,704
You know, what suggestions or what, you know, how do you go about resolving?

71
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,995
I mean, you could pick a couple of issues.

72
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:29,256
Sure.

73
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:31,018
Let's just even take one or two issues.

74
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,242
How do you resolve them?

75
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,945
I mean, what's the best way to go about it?

76
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:42,070
Well, so there's kind of two things that need to, two realms of problem that need to be addressed.

77
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,551
One of them is infrastructure, and one of them is more cultural in the city.

78
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:53,154
And so from the infrastructural side of things, I'm really focusing, first of all, on citywide issues and local issues.

79
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:58,496
But the ones that I've put on the back of my literature are the city budget,

80
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:03,981
The development, both commercial and residential, zoning is a big, big topic right now.

81
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:14,071
The high school, what to do with that, whether it's going to be a new high school, whether it's going to be doing renovations.

82
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:16,373
And then the fire station is another one.

83
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:19,517
And I think that was pretty much it.

84
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:29,845
One of the biggest things that I've noticed is lacking is it's unclear what the processes are for these things, or if there are processes.

85
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:36,109
And I'm not putting that on any given person, but coming from that engineering perspective that I mentioned before,

86
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:42,222
What I would be looking for is some kind of a flow chart that says, OK, this is the first stage.

87
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,443
This is the second stage.

88
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:44,925
Does it pass this stage?

89
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:45,625
Yes or no.

90
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,508
If it's a yes, it goes in this direction.

91
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:49,149
If it's a no, it goes in this direction.

92
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,335
And it says the different departments that are involved, the different stakeholders that are involved.

93
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:55,456
And it really gives...

94
00:07:56,297 --> 00:08:06,544
It would really add to the transparency and accountability that you often hear politicians talk about, which often unfortunately falls through the cracks.

95
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:10,026
So I think that there's ways to do that now.

96
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:18,132
fiddled around, people talk a lot about AI these days, and I'm not really on the doom train.

97
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,633
I'm not really on the hype train.

98
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,134
I try to walk the middle path.

99
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:40,850
But I was fiddling around with chat GPT and just asking it some questions like, you know, hey, generate for me a sample of a of a flowchart depicting a municipal Department of Public Works filling in cracks and holes in city streets, you know, what that would look like, or

100
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,551
Or show me what a typical budgeting process would look like for a city of 65,000 people.

101
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,332
And it's a little bit wonky.

102
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:51,513
It'll spit out something with typos.

103
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:54,634
But generally, it's pretty good.

104
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:55,294
It's impressive.

105
00:08:55,554 --> 00:09:02,036
And I think that those could be models for what we could build in the city.

106
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:02,816
That's one thing.

107
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,236
There's others, but yeah.

108
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:10,494
So you mentioned communication and transparency.

109
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,896
And I'm going to bring this up.

110
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:18,478
And this is like, I have an issue with it.

111
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:28,603
A lot of people that I associate with, a lot of people, seem to think there is a serious

112
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:45,427
You know, there's a lack of transparency, there's a lack of communication, whether it's they're not listening, whether it's they're not being clear, whether the word's not getting out, the word's getting out.

113
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:52,844
late, not blaming anybody, but there is definitely a lack of the communication.

114
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:55,824
To me, personally, that's like a big issue.

115
00:09:56,505 --> 00:10:00,686
So, you know, what are your thoughts on that?

116
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:02,766
Is there a solution?

117
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:03,706
Can you solve it?

118
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:04,687
What's the story?

119
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:07,533
Yes, yes, and yes.

120
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,536
I hear that problem all the time.

121
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:19,030
I mean, that's probably the biggest problem that I hear, and I do think it can be addressed and it can be solved, but it's not an easy snap your fingers fix.

122
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,055
Yeah, the zoning thing right now that's happening.

123
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:42,099
I would say that thankfully, I just saw the other day, the mayor is releasing a letter saying, hey, I think we should move the decision for this process to the fall because a lot of the public is feeling caught off guard or uninformed about this, and I think that's very much the right choice.

124
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's take the zoning.

125
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:57,896
A lot of people feel like this information is being dropped out of the void at the last minute and that the public comment period has passed and that there are these sort of

126
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:11,813
uh, in sincere efforts to get public opinion, like the, these, uh, cardboard cutout attempts to, to, hey, we're, we're listening to the public, but are you really listening to the public?

127
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:18,235
And so, um, once again, I'm not trying to, to put that on, on any given, you know, person.

128
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:29,598
Uh, in some cases I do think it's deliberate where, you know, the, the process has already gotten to a certain point and all the consultants have gotten involved and, and it's just about done and it's like,

129
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,606
Like we don't want to get the public to shut this down at this point.

130
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:39,016
So let's kind of you know Pass it through the through the later hours of the night or something like that.

131
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,381
But then I think other times there's

132
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:52,252
there really is information that's posted out there, but it's posted in one of the drawers of the bureau in the city website, and who is ever going to find that?

133
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,633
It doesn't come out of the drawer.

134
00:11:53,713 --> 00:12:00,640
It doesn't come out of the drawer, and so a couple weeks ago I really scoured the city website, and I'll be the first to say that

135
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:07,024
The new city website is actually, it has some problems, but it's much better than what it was.

136
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:08,966
And there's a lot of great stuff on there.

137
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,387
There's maps of the city that show these plans.

138
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,810
There's all these different project proposals.

139
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,973
But if you don't know that they're there, like what good are they to some extent?

140
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:32,857
And so so that's why I think that there needs to be a bunch of people in the city the council included Working together to to address that to work with this, you know, you've interviewed gotta know Medford, right?

141
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,018
They could be a new they could fill that void.

142
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:38,079
Yeah, and and I think that the city

143
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:50,344
On the front page of the city website, there currently is a section that shows the quick links for city services.

144
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:52,846
And then beneath that, there's news and events.

145
00:12:53,266 --> 00:13:05,472
But I think there needs to be either a link or a little bulletin board that shows all of the currently ongoing city projects and links to key maps and key project developments.

146
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,313
I think that would go a long way as well.

147
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,454
So, you know, you mentioned the mayor.

148
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:15,076
I want to thank her because I read that letter, as have a lot of people that she wrote.

149
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:17,858
And I think it it's accurate.

150
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,539
I think it's a good letter.

151
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:26,061
And I think she's, you know, standing up for the people on this on this issue.

152
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,883
And as you said, it's a big issue.

153
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,326
And you made a lot of good points, and I appreciate that.

154
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:41,333
But yeah, I want to thank the mayor, because I think it was important that she took the lead on this.

155
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,355
And I think she did a good job doing it.

156
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,197
Yeah, I think it was the right choice.

157
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:55,264
So now I'd like to just talk about, we're talking about zoning, we're talking about everything else.

158
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,466
It's no secret, it really isn't,

159
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:01,370
economic growth.

160
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:06,316
It's stagnant, not there.

161
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,419
How do you approach it?

162
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,601
How do you get on the council?

163
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,564
How do you approach the issue?

164
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:15,688
What's the best direction you think to go in?

165
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:31,716
Yeah, I mean I don't think that the immediate, and things have gotten bad enough where to some extent people might feel that this is the only option that they have, but I don't feel like the answer is just to squeeze the life out of the homeowners, you know, and wrench money out of their equity.

166
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:48,088
You know, it's not to say like taxes are a necessary evil, but I think if it's part of a bigger package and a wider lens view of how to balance the city budget, I do need to familiarize myself more with the the details of the city budget.

167
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,292
But broadly, I think we need to focus on seriously

168
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:59,598
increasing and diversifying the commercial and industrial tax base, and you don't do that in the residential areas.

169
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:12,930
The residential component of development is a separate issue, but you do it on the Mystic Ave corridor, you do it partly in the Wellington area, in East Medford, you do it in places that are already really

170
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:18,717
you know, zoned for and have significant commercial and industrial development.

171
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:29,568
I think it's a damn shame that in the city, and this isn't just someone who's deeply at this point, I consider myself pretty aware of what's going on, but I've heard these comments from people who

172
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,950
really are just casually observing.

173
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,330
They go for walks with their dogs, they take notes of things.

174
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:46,153
But some of these boarded up shops and stretches of boarded up windows, I have a friend who lives over near the royal house and we used to take my dog for a walk and it can't even be real.

175
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:52,075
There's a sausage casing business and it's just been shut forever and there's a whole strip of

176
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:56,059
And you see a lot of those types of things throughout Medford.

177
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:04,587
So I think that the city can create certain incentives, like maybe expedited permitting processes could be one.

178
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:16,598
Maybe the utilities are a mess, in the sense of particularly the streets, making streets in front of businesses more attractive.

179
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:17,558
Yeah, that would be nice.

180
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,499
I hear you on that, sure.

181
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,900
And there's other financial arrangements that can be made.

182
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:33,382
Down by the courthouse and a few other spots down there, there's development.

183
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,963
It's begging for development.

184
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,946
Mr. Gav is begging for development.

185
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:45,493
And the squares, yeah, I think we need to do some things.

186
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:48,136
How big and how much, that's the question.

187
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:49,718
But appreciate your input.

188
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,241
answer.

189
00:16:53,321 --> 00:17:05,747
One last thing is I do think that it doesn't have to be an either or thing of you have to wholly satisfy the homeowners or wholly satisfy the renters or wholly satisfy the landlords.

190
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:12,391
It's something that if it's done wisely, it can balance all of those forces.

191
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:16,033
Because Medford at the end of the day is an ecosystem and you need all those groups.

192
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:20,075
And Medford has always, I'm going to say it, they've always been able

193
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:21,296
to do it.

194
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:31,367
People have always, you know, I've lived here my whole life and it's, everyone's always been able to work with each other to get things done.

195
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:36,592
And, you know, I think that's another part of the whole process.

196
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:39,235
I think you're right on that, you know, the people and everything.

197
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:48,161
All right, let's you mentioned now you mentioned taxes spending whatever so what's your priorities?

198
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,962
I mean spending in taxes spending in taxes.

199
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:51,502
What do we do?

200
00:17:52,343 --> 00:18:08,969
Yeah well It would be nice if there if there was an audit but that is there's been some resistance to that and When it comes to priorities in the city for for spending I would say

201
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:31,287
putting a significant amount of that money into projects that are already underway, like the fire station is a big one that was already promised to the firemen and the fire tower when the new police station was put in.

202
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,629
And there's a plan for that on the city website.

203
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,991
So seeing that through is one thing.

204
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:43,979
looking seriously at how far we can stretch the money that we have.

205
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:51,363
I do think that, you know, Rick Orlando was on in one of your episodes and he was talking about the process of building schools.

206
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,264
The school is one of these looming things.

207
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:54,245
What do we do with the school?

208
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:55,286
Do we renovate it?

209
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:56,386
Do we do it over again?

210
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:59,068
Well, Rick talked about how if we're

211
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:07,370
you know, if we were even to consider redoing the school all over again, we're not going to get the same, you know, abatements as previously.

212
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,492
You know, there was that racial balancing that paid for, you know, like 90% of the schools or 75% of the schools.

213
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:20,794
So I think we should prioritize the school because this school does have this studio that we're in right now is a gem.

214
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,475
There's the robotics club that's a gem.

215
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:24,935
This school has,

216
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,157
I'm blanking on the name right now, Bistro 489.

217
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:34,241
There's some really great stuff at this school, both vocational and otherwise.

218
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:40,024
But maybe we could look at it, how do we stretch our dollars?

219
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,027
Some people say, absolutely no way, never renovation, redo the whole thing.

220
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:48,169
Well, first of all, we're not going to get those refunds that we previously did.

221
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:49,090
Second of all,

222
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,971
There's good bones in this school.

223
00:19:50,991 --> 00:20:05,442
There's a lot of, I mean, it's a brutalist architectural style like the Boston City Hall, but maybe efforts could be done to make it more, you know, coming into the school to feel less sort of ominous, I would say.

224
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:06,603
A little more palatable.

225
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,284
And to just renovate parts of the building.

226
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:16,648
It was built for a certain number of students that it currently is not filling, I don't think.

227
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:20,631
I've taken a tour of the whole school, so that is a goal of mine.

228
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:21,831
I have a neighbor down the street.

229
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:29,674
a couple, and they just moved here a couple years ago, and they're saying that they're already considering moving out.

230
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:37,736
Like, they have a baby, they have another one on the way, and they're like, the school system, we just, you know, whether it's true or not, perception is reality to them.

231
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,437
And they say, you know, we're moving out.

232
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,097
And I think they're not alone with that.

233
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,398
There's people who look at the school.

234
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:43,738
So I would consider that like,

235
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:47,761
A hemorrhage within Medford is the school system.

236
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:53,066
And outside of that, I would just say, yeah, the streets.

237
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,627
The streets are a mess.

238
00:20:54,887 --> 00:21:02,113
And putting forward on the city website, there's a plan for all the streets, prioritizing them by area.

239
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:08,438
Really putting that forward and putting that next to that process flowchart that I was describing before.

240
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,961
So people can see and hold the city accountable.

241
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,201
Those are the big ones.

242
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,623
Figuring out how to make it a reality.

243
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:15,303
That's a key.

244
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:17,685
So we covered a lot of things.

245
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:25,650
I just want you to, I sort of, how do I say it?

246
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:36,737
I think it would be helpful if you could, let's say, paint a picture for your concerns, solutions, ground up.

247
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:37,878
I call it,

248
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,405
And you mentioned it earlier, the streets, the cleanliness, whatever you want to call it.

249
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:46,928
I call it meat and potatoes of running a city.

250
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,031
What do you think about the meat and potatoes?

251
00:21:55,858 --> 00:22:17,167
see it from two angles one is the on the streets level which is the meat and potatoes of like what is what is the average resident of Medford see and they see bad quality streets they see and unfortunately the bad things tend to stick out more than the good things and the things that are working you know you don't you know and when you're paying attention to things you don't go oh that's working really well you go oh that's a mess

252
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:18,710
So it's really unfortunate.

253
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,375
But people tend to lock into the things that aren't working.

254
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:26,685
So the state of the streets, the fact that we have a bunch of business sections that are

255
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:42,782
more worn down or mismatched or, uh, you know, not really diversified in the sense of, you know, not to, not to demean banks and credit unions and barbershops, but we have a lot as I walk around, we have a lot of both, both of those.

256
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:53,510
So, um, a, a focus on the, what people actually see on the front end and then simultaneously on the back end, there's all these, these, um,

257
00:22:53,911 --> 00:23:01,709
these processes and communications failures that are happening that would make addressing the front end more possible.

258
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,892
And I'll say that

259
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:29,074
this is both meat and potatoes and back end but I mentioned before how there's an infrastructural part of this and then there's also a cultural part just getting people to talk to each other again and not see each other as villains you know it's it's really like the number of people that have just disengaged has left the the smaller public square open to to be taken over by

260
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:46,909
Brats and bullies I would say And there's a lot of people who do participate who really just want to see things work and they're trying to get things work get things to work, but you know, there's there's also a lot of rancor and a lot of

261
00:23:48,502 --> 00:24:00,925
stuff that sucks the oxygen out of the room, you know, and I do, I want to see neighbors talking to neighbors again and seeing each other as such, rather than like, you're a red, you're a blue, you're this, you're that.

262
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:02,926
It's not helping.

263
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:13,448
And so that cultural component play in people talking to each other again, plays into whether this stuff gets done and whether neighborhoods can start participating in the political process.

264
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:14,929
You know, that was a great answer.

265
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:15,289
Yeah.

266
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:15,889
It was.

267
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,651
I mean, it's it's truthful, too.

268
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:18,892
I mean, I agree with it.

269
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,013
That was a good answer.

270
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:21,634
Thank you.

271
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:24,856
And by the way, block parties are one of the biggest examples of this.

272
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:30,621
Like that might seem like a small thing, but it's a sign in my it's like a vital sign, in my opinion, of like a healthy neighbor.

273
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,022
Honest answer.

274
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:33,783
And we appreciate that.

275
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:40,328
So now let's just you know, I always got to ask a personal question.

276
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:41,429
I got to get something in.

277
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,370
Sure.

278
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,932
So let's what's your least

279
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:53,784
and most favorite things going on in Method that Patrick likes to do.

280
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:54,285
Yeah.

281
00:24:54,325 --> 00:25:05,228
Well, some of the more relatable things would just be discovering new restaurants and trying new things on the menu and discovering like, oh, we've got Wright's Pond in North Medford that has its own beach.

282
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,810
You know, that's not a lot of towns have that, you know, that aren't oceanfront.

283
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,431
So there's just a lot of cool stuff that I've been discovering.

284
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:41,409
sort of a behind-the-scenes satisfaction is just seeing how How much common ground that there is with all the people that I talked to I really enjoy the conversations that I have with people and just finding out that like this person who would Never associate with that person actually has so much So much of a common description of what they consider the strengths and the weaknesses of the city, you know, and and so there really is like a

285
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:43,870
a ton of budding potential.

286
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,451
And it's just seeing that validated is really reinforcing, I would say.

287
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:50,472
So that's one of my favorite things.

288
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:54,013
But negative things is the counter to that.

289
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:58,194
Well, first of all, driving over all those potholes all the time, that's definitely a negative thing.

290
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:03,436
Passing by a lot of these things that have so much potential, but it's just not realized.

291
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:10,999
Those boarded up buildings, those neighborhoods that could be having block parties and could be getting together but aren't.

292
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:21,061
Um, and then also just the people who are talking past each other, but, but missing the opportunity to sort of connect, you know, like two ships in the night.

293
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,762
So, no, that's.

294
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:25,842
Thank you for that answer.

295
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,943
Uh, it's, it's true.

296
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:28,763
Good one.

297
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:37,705
And I just want to mention one thing now, because while we're on the subject of people getting together this Saturday, we have circle the square.

298
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:38,145
Yes.

299
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:39,505
It's always crowded.

300
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:41,406
