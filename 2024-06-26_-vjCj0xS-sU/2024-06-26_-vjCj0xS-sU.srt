11
00:09:52,404 --> 00:10:06,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, we're gonna get that audio turned down.

12
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:12,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've never had to say before.

13
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,388
[SPEAKER_04]: For present, one absent, the meeting is called to order.

14
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Action and discussion items 24033 offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innis associates team.

15
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here again.

16
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:34,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the member says number five, this feels like definitely more than six or seven meetings we've had on this topic.

17
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be meeting many more times this year.

18
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you as always for being with us.

19
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:43,008
[SPEAKER_04]: At our last committee meeting with our zoning consultant on June 12th,

20
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about the status of the mapping analysis, we talked about the status of the work plan, organizing the various goals and topics from our climate action and adaptation plan and our comprehensive plan, turning those into a work plan that's full of

21
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:14,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Council and city staff and community initiatives into topics that can be broken down then into actual language changes to apply to our code of zoning ordinances to bring Medford zoning more in line with what the community has been articulating that it really wants over the past few years.

22
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:23,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So the agenda for today is to review that more comprehensive work plan of all of those goals and topics into something that the Council

23
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:33,666
[SPEAKER_04]: can take action on in coming months with a focus on what we'll work on over the next couple months and view the status of the mapping analysis that we got a little preview of on the 12th.

24
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any preliminary comments from my fellow Councilors before we turn it over to Innis Associates?

25
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, take it away.

26
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Councilors.

27
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:50,480
[SPEAKER_12]: For the record, my name is Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates.

28
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm joined by two of my colleagues that you've met before, Paula and Jimmy.

29
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:57,425
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to take you through two separate topics today.

30
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:01,948
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to give an overview and then I'm going to turn it over to each of my colleagues individually.

31
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:08,393
[SPEAKER_12]: The first, as you said, is the work plan and the second is our progress on the mapping updates.

32
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:16,439
[SPEAKER_12]: For the, for the meeting itself I'd love to come away with two sort of next steps.

33
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:21,823
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is, you will see in a moment when I hold it up and when Alice starts to go through it.

34
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,927
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a very long work plan with a lot of moving pieces.

35
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:33,431
[SPEAKER_12]: We feel that the time has come to start applying them to a geography.

36
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:39,134
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd like to start off with the Mystic Ave area and the Salem Quarter area as well.

37
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:51,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We think a lot of the pieces that we've been talking about will start to fall in place as we use two geographies really to start thinking about those in the context of what is the actual

38
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:56,987
[SPEAKER_12]: physical environment that's affecting some of these zoning changes.

39
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,348
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's item number one.

40
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:06,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Item number two is we're going to show online and pass around some printed maps, kind of, honestly, it's a teaser for you.

41
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:10,900
[SPEAKER_12]: City staff hasn't had a chance to see the maps yet, so we would like them to see it.

42
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,882
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, these are only on 11 by 17s.

43
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:29,487
[SPEAKER_12]: We would love to schedule a working session with Councilors, with yourselves, to put them on on a larger scale, be able to spread them out on tables and really work through some of the information that they're presenting to us.

44
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:34,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, I'm just going to show you visually what Paola is going to go through.

45
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,608
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our work plan.

46
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:38,809
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three sheets of it.

47
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:51,456
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, this is the first sheet you're going to see how it's going to dive into the details, but you're going to see the topics down to the.

48
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:56,834
[SPEAKER_12]: left-hand side, I think for you, right-hand side for me, and then the timeline.

49
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:07,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We have plotted out the city council, the committee meetings that we're having now, and we have identified four key points to get public input as well.

50
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:12,346
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will be talking about, you know, beyond just the meetings that we're having here.

51
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:17,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be talking about which states those are and what we present in more detail as we go.

52
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,272
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is the first,

53
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:23,374
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll pass it over to you.

54
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:38,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Three separate sheets that are breaking the topics that we've been discussing for the last two months, maybe three months, down into grouped in by where we're showing them.

55
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,327
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, as you can see,

56
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,402
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the topics overlap each other.

57
00:14:48,522 --> 00:15:00,131
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we hear that we need to start with some physical geography is to see how exactly the topics overlap and do they have implications for specific areas or for the city as a whole.

58
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:05,775
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Paola to go through the details of the plan.

59
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:07,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

60
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for the introduction.

61
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Paola, looking forward to seeing these a bit more in depth and

62
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:20,416
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned this to Emily before the meeting, we are working on under a bit of a time crunch today because the regular meeting a bit after 7pm.

63
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:25,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could try to keep this section of the meeting to 20 or 30 minutes, that would be ideal.

64
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can keep things moving.

65
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

66
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good afternoon.

67
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,267
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Paola.

68
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share my screen.

69
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I need to.

70
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:37,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm disabled.

71
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:38,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can make

72
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:49,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one second.

73
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:50,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

74
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,258
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to go through two things.

75
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that I want to show you the more updated table that we did.

76
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I presented one a bit more simplified.

77
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:11,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how we decided to update that table.

78
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can share now.

79
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:17,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

80
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:27,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are.

81
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:34,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new, I'm going to take this out, give me one second.

82
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.

83
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:39,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new table we showed last time, one a bit more simplified.

84
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:49,312
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is to establish the organization or the structure right now is by goals.

85
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:55,526
[SPEAKER_00]: city objectives, and then we go from there into the strategies.

86
00:16:56,167 --> 00:17:01,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks a lot as your comprehensive plan, this kind of a structure.

87
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that it's better to organize it by goals and by later on objectives.

88
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:19,380
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is easier when we go through strategies that we are already looking at a big set of strategies that are aligned into certain

89
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,225
[SPEAKER_00]: objectives and their goal.

90
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:32,873
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did is also establish the topics, where does it come from, the code and the description of the strategy, and then the zoning also by section and subsection.

91
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:49,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So these strategies, what are the sections and subsections that are affecting, so that it's easier later on to look at each of these chapters more in depth and to review all the inconsistencies within those sections of the zoning.

92
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:54,027
[SPEAKER_00]: We have phase, importancy, the urgency.

93
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:58,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's high urgency, we start with that immediately.

94
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:05,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And then geographical implications, so if it's any specific area or if it's citywide.

95
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the status, so if it's in progress, if it's completed.

96
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, we can see all the strategies from the comp plan.

97
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:23,314
[SPEAKER_00]: all the strategies that came from the city council, from the building department, from the planning department, and from the CAP.

98
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:28,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot, as Emily said, there are a lot of them.

99
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:34,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use this to start our work plan.

100
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:40,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see in those big sheets that Emily showed?

101
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,610
[SPEAKER_00]: are all these strategies.

102
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:53,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that are on the list are in here on the work plan that will help us to never overlook any of this so that we can always track them.

103
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,320
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so in detail.

104
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,523
[SPEAKER_00]: We have on the left side all the strategies.

105
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:07,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right side, we have all the timeline.

106
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:18,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as they, as Emily said, we have here, it's in a, in a brownish color, the days where we have, uh, planning meetings as the one of today.

107
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:21,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have proposed at the moment.

108
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:30,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times, and these are these black lines four times for public engagement so that we can get feedback and then we can implement it in the zoning as well.

109
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:35,746
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four of those distributed, uh, at the moment is a specific time.

110
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,607
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we will look at it later.

111
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,064
[SPEAKER_00]: as we go.

112
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:45,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the last part of the table are these more brownish color in the background.

113
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one month and a half.

114
00:19:49,632 --> 00:20:07,525
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to at least two months, one month and a half to leave without any strategy so that we can implement and starting to finalize or the document and to save any inconsistencies that we had, things that needed to change from the beginning that we have some time in order to do that.

115
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,739
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to look at this?

116
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can share in the PDF.

117
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is all complete.

118
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:31,004
[SPEAKER_00]: We start, as Emily said, with a geographical area that has high importance at the moment and high urgency, and that is Salem Corridor and Mystic Avenue.

119
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:37,206
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with this part of mixed uses, and we

120
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,978
[SPEAKER_00]: as we look into that, we will be looking as well as other topics that are related.

121
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:52,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, transit oriented mixed use developments will be also looked at this time because we think there is a lot of relationship.

122
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:57,705
[SPEAKER_00]: When these two, we will be looking at mixed use.

123
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:03,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we will, sorry, we'll be looking at housing dimensions and diversity of buildings.

124
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:05,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will look and go to

125
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,960
[SPEAKER_00]: the affordable housing for all.

126
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:19,246
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanted to give some time for the ADU law that is being built at the moment at a state level, that to take some time.

127
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go in depth into it, nothing changes.

128
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is all in this part, in this area.

129
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:32,974
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some process, oh, sorry, there are some more

130
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,967
[SPEAKER_00]: process-like, and that is in this area with definitions.

131
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:41,208
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bit more fragmented, that's why you see it in this way.

132
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we leave climate resiliency.

133
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:55,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more spread out, but it will start, let's say, from the second third of the timeline, and little by little we will adjust that.

134
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:02,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly what we wanted is to establish some kind of efficient base for

135
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:13,147
[SPEAKER_00]: density, business, economic development, mixed use, and after that to start introducing the climate resiliency into it.

136
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:24,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, we have this legal process that we'll be looking at through the entire time, through the entire process.

137
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:32,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's always, it's this purple line that it's always with us, because we will review in all these sections.

138
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:41,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any question to this or any... I cannot go into every little detail.

139
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:43,510
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we will pass it on to you.

140
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:52,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have any specific questions, you can totally ask us and send any comment.

141
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,538
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look into them and adapt it.

142
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:03,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is more the generic from what we felt last time in the topics that had high importance.

143
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,268
[SPEAKER_00]: and urgency and how this could fit.

144
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:17,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this will move, this will shift as we go more in depth, but at least to have a more generic framework.

145
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Paola.

146
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:25,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go first to President Bears and then to Councilor Scarpelli.

147
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

148
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Paola, for presenting this.

149
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:32,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one question, which is just the timeline side of the document.

150
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, have we seen that yet?

151
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't in the packet.

152
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to, okay.

153
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, it's.

154
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I will leave this printed copy.

155
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:45,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Just know that it's a draft.

156
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:50,568
[SPEAKER_12]: We're continuing to refine it, but I have it here and I'll leave it with Alicia and Danielle.

157
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:50,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

158
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:51,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Very tiny.

159
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the only comment I really have at this point, I'm going to need to review it and digest it.

160
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:14,956
[SPEAKER_05]: that I hope that it helps, it's helping me to see the scope and scale of the ambition of the project that we have been working on and are undertaking and I hope to anyone watching or present that they can also see just how much work we are doing on this and how ambitious this project is.

161
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really exciting and big for Medford to be taking this on and the culmination of

162
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:28,707
[SPEAKER_05]: at least 10 years of this council before I was here, as well as the planning office, doing really amazing work.

163
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:34,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So beyond that, there's so many details that I'm going to leave my comments very general.

164
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

165
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Skidmore.

166
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.

167
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:41,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

168
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited about the direction we're going into because we hear a lot of, you know, why can't METFORD move forward and going through the reclassification, I think that the zoning and understanding the changes we haven't had in so long.

169
00:24:54,812 --> 00:25:01,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what we're seeing, especially in the last couple of weeks with one of the zoning issues, one of the,

170
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:21,054
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the placements of a very volatile issue we talk about what we've seen is we've seen neighborhoods now get more involved and I'm so happy that one of the biggest things we talked about setting up those teams that are going to go right into the neighborhoods that are really going to talk to those neighbors

171
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:28,658
[SPEAKER_06]: and get their input to see what we're looking for as a community, what they want in their front door and their backyard.

172
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:37,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So my only thing is, as we get started, I know that, you know, is how we're gonna get the word out to, you know, when that time comes.

173
00:25:37,723 --> 00:25:41,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's not for now, but I just wanted to share how excited I am that we're moving through this.

174
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's a lot of work with a lot of good people, and I'm really excited about it.

175
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we move forward, I think that

176
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:51,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The piece that we're seeing now is that community really getting involved.

177
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I was part of the, I was working in Somerville at the time when Somerville did their rezoning.

178
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:03,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mayor at the time really had every department deeply involved.

179
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:05,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we went from,

180
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:15,795
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, from square to square and neighborhood to neighborhood, we had everybody represented, every department there.

181
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:22,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the community members had an input, we were taking our fluorescent orange dots and putting it to where they thought was relevant.

182
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:23,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really helped us.

183
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:29,764
[SPEAKER_06]: put together and zone their neighborhoods and be part of that.

184
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very excited about that.

185
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna thank you for all your hard work and I'm gonna need bigger glasses for those bigger bullets.

186
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

187
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

188
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:43,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll echo that last comment specifically.

189
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:46,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love a Gantt chart and that's certainly the most prodigious one I've seen so far.

190
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate the granular level of detail because as President Bears said, I think that

191
00:26:53,055 --> 00:27:01,301
[SPEAKER_04]: This data visualization, you know, it puts into sharp relief, how many issues and topics and goals we're trying to work on really in the span of exactly one fiscal year now.

192
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:07,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So knowing exactly where we are in that process will be critical to accomplishing as much of this as possible.

193
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some quick reactions from me.

194
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:21,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You know at this time, I'm really heartened to hear of the priority list that we've drafted and of course all of this is going to shift and evolve as projects tend to do over the next year.

195
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been clear to me from our previous conversations in this committee and hearing feedback from

196
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:42,387
[SPEAKER_04]: City staff and of course from the community that, you know, that Mystic F corridor is one of the areas of the city that I hear the most about from just regular average people when it comes to why is this the way that it is and what are we going to do to make it what we really want there.

197
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:43,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Same for Salem corridor.

198
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:49,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's really right that we're thinking about how to approach that geography first.

199
00:27:51,413 --> 00:28:09,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And in reviewing that kind of off the cuff list of priorities from Councilors at our previous committee meeting on the 12th, I know we all agreed that each one of these topics is urgent and critical, but that doing what we can around affordable housing, really implementing what we've already resolved to do around affordable housing absolutely has to come first.

200
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:11,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am,

201
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: excited to address those starting in the summer.

202
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:30,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to interrupt myself very quickly, Councilor Callahan on Zoom requests if we could focus the Zoom on the left portion of the chart again before we take that down.

203
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:36,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And just lastly, I'm really glad that Councilor Scarpelli brought up the note about public participation.

204
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know with these public meetings, we're always thinking about how to make sure that there are more people in the room and more people know about them, especially when it comes to things affecting people in their own neighborhoods.

205
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think it could be meaningful since so many of these zoning goals came out of the community input process informing the comprehensive plan and the climate action adaptation plan.

206
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:55,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where these goals come from.

207
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it could be meaningful if it's possible to dig up any of those old, like,

208
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:13,640
[SPEAKER_04]: public participation worksheets from those months of sessions just to kind of illustrate here's where some of these goals came from here's what residents have already in a sense voted for like here's the why behind some of these proposals and then we can add an additional testimony on top of that.

209
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:20,402
[SPEAKER_12]: So to that point, Madam Chair, first of all, thank you, Councilors, for your feedback.

210
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:26,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Really helpful to us as we work with you to tackle all these projects.

211
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:34,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I can also reach out, as you know, I was one of the team that agency put together to do the comprehensive plan.

212
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I can reach out to agency and see if they're willing to share.

213
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:43,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've got some of those reports, but I can see what else I have in terms of the actual data.

214
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,551
[SPEAKER_12]: that we received.

215
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:50,514
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always nice to be able to go back and show people, demonstrate to people that you really heard what they said.

216
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:53,015
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that'd be a great thing to do.

217
00:29:54,416 --> 00:30:03,921
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's no further questions on this, with your permission, I think we'd like to, and just keeping an eye on the time, I think we'd like to share the maps with you as well.

218
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,101
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be great.

219
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:05,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

220
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:08,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you don't mind stopping sharing in your side.

221
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:08,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

222
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:09,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

223
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,523
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to turn this over to Jimmy to show them out.

224
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,904
[SPEAKER_12]: And as he does that, can I hand out this over the barrier?

225
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

226
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:18,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

227
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We will want these.

228
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:28,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everyone.

229
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:28,827
[SPEAKER_07]: My

230
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:33,294
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's one to share around.

231
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:35,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll walk them back because they're drafts.

232
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:36,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

233
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sorry.

234
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking that there was multiple packages.

235
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:45,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

236
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:47,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, everyone.

237
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:48,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having us.

238
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jimmy.

239
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:52,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm the spatial analyst over at Innis Associates.

240
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:57,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm on the Zoom if you would like to just allow me to share my screen.

241
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:02,879
[SPEAKER_08]: else.

242
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,741
[SPEAKER_04]: One second, Jimmy.

243
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:05,481
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.

244
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:06,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Take your time.

245
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:28,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

246
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:46,013
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

247
00:31:55,771 --> 00:32:02,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So as Emily was stating out, we're gonna start to take a look at the maps.

248
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:05,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one that we're gonna start with is the transit map.

249
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:09,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me just hide the top for you.

250
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And go back.

251
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the first map I have here is,

252
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:30,974
[SPEAKER_07]: We started to look outside of Medford, looking in, so that's why we kind of have a scaled-out version of Medford.

253
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:36,575
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of wanted to see everything surrounding Medford and its relationship with the neighboring towns.

254
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:40,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first map I have for you is the transit map.

255
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:50,458
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, we have some symbology on the left-hand side, but it's showing the transit networks throughout the city and the connecting towns.

256
00:32:51,311 --> 00:33:13,736
[SPEAKER_07]: We have blue bike stations, plain blue bike stations, as well as bike trails, as well as Medford's bike lanes, as well as MBTA bus routes, transit stations, transit lines, and radii signaling a quarter mile from a transit station or a half mile from a transit station.

257
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:18,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer.

258
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:22,389
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is just a scaled out version of the transit.

259
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:28,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

260
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:29,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

261
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have 20 maps.

262
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:31,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

263
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:36,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next map, when it loads, sorry about that.

264
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:53,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that, everyone.

265
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:55,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just waiting for Adobe to catch up with me.

266
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:14,327
[SPEAKER_09]: You should notice that what the public and the Councilors can see is that your title is hidden and the bottom of the map is hidden.

267
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:14,527
Okay.

268
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:14,647
Okay.

269
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:21,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So this next map I'll go over is the hydrography map.

270
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:24,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It's showing the hydrological features of Medford.

271
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:38,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanted to point out some important features as well, including the Amelia Earhart Dam, which is in the bottom right hand corner of the Mystic River, and the FEMA National Flood Hazard Layers.

272
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:49,611
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought this would be important to show just exactly where Medford may be impacted regarding flooding and its hydrological features.

273
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll move on to the next map.

274
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:10,373
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map I have for you guys is the recreation map.

275
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:16,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just showing all the public open space, hiking and walking trails.

276
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I include bike trails on there as well, because it's part of the recreation.

277
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:27,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I have included bus stops, which are 100 feet in front of parks.

278
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't include all bus stops, just ones that were directly accessible and outside of an open space park.

279
00:35:51,823 --> 00:36:03,409
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map I have is the Mass Historic Commission inventory, and these are all the inventoried historical properties that Mass Historic Commission categorizes.

280
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,471
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see on the legend on the left hand side.

281
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: They're defined as different features, but some are inventoried, some are local historic districts.

282
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:22,203
[SPEAKER_07]: We have National Register of Historic Places, National Register of Historic Places and Local Historic District, as well as preservation restrictions.

283
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:32,731
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map, we're getting more granular on the data and just showing you what Medford is looking like in 2024.

284
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So here is mapped the median age, whereas you can see the lower age is yellow and the higher age is a darker purple.

285
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:49,204
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is the median income.

286
00:36:49,764 --> 00:37:03,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is for 2022 and the lower end is around 60,000 for the median income across Medford and the higher end is the darker green.

287
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:11,134
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is the 2020 environmental justice populations.

288
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,719
[SPEAKER_07]: These are populations defined by Massachusetts State.

289
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,063
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have questions on how they define them, you can check out their website.

290
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is just showing the makeup in Medford itself.

291
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:31,519
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is a race and ethnicity map of Medford.

292
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:39,502
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see on the left-hand side of the legend, it shows you a breakdown of the total Medford population by race.

293
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:46,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And inside Medford, there are pie graphs visualizing each particular census tract.

294
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:55,536
[SPEAKER_07]: The next maps, they get a little more detailed and data oriented regarding Medford.

295
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:59,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So these were fun to make and visualize.

296
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:01,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have building value.

297
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pulled directly from the assessor's data table.

298
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are just mapped as building value by square foot of the parcel.

299
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:21,042
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map, we have a land value, and it's the same scenario as a building value.

300
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:24,986
[SPEAKER_07]: We're mapping it land value by square foot of each parcel.

301
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:33,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last map in this series for value is a total value.

302
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is in the assessor's data table, but this is building plus land value divided by square foot.

303
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:50,617
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map, we have residential clusters.

304
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:57,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So here visualized is only the residential uses and residential parcels throughout Medford.

305
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can see, there's quite a varying different amount of different uses for residences, but here we only visualize residential use.

306
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:21,268
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map, I have the age of residential housing stock in Medford.

307
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a pretty cool map to visualize.

308
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:30,491
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see there's very little housing built from 1990 to currently.

309
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:34,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like a lot of the housing stock was built from 1900 to 1929.

310
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, this is the average age.

311
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:59,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is an analysis of the building frontage.

312
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So the building frontage, we define it as the lot line that is shared with the principal street that the lot is assessed as.

313
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:21,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the assessor's table, each parcel has a street name, and that is the assessed street that we go by to determine the frontage.

314
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:27,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So the lot line that shares that assessed street, that's the measure of the frontage.

315
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:30,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only one side of the lot.

316
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: two sides, if it's a corner lot, it's only one.

317
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:47,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So here, as you can see, we broke it down to these buckets, similar to the table of dimensions, just to visualize what the frontage looks like throughout the city.

318
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:54,553
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one is the front building setback.

319
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the

320
00:40:57,162 --> 00:41:02,325
[SPEAKER_07]: distance that the building is closest to the front lot line.

321
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:13,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see, we broke it down into buckets again, just to visualize, you could see in the Wellington area, there's a higher setback because there's more commercial businesses down there.

322
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is a building height map.

323
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is data that's pulled from the assessor's table.

324
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:30,672
[SPEAKER_07]: This just visualizes building height in stories throughout Medford.

325
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,119
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map is a lot size map.

326
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:43,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this just visualizes lot size, this time in square feet.

327
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,069
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, there are a lot of parcels under 5,000 feet and many between 5,000 and 10K.

328
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The next map I have is the dimensions building coverage map.

329
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:09,088
[SPEAKER_07]: This building coverage is measured by the area of the building footprint within each lot.

330
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:12,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the percentage that the building covers in each parcel.

331
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:17,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see here, as it gets darker, there's more coverage.

332
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:24,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last one I have is impervious coverage.

333
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is defined as all impervious area within a lot.

334
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:39,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So versus building coverage, this includes driveways, you know, gravel and things like that.

335
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:44,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is all impervious surfaces as a percentage of the entire lot.

336
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:48,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the last map I have for you guys.

337
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:50,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much.

338
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:53,129
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer.

339
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was just negotiating the mic here.

340
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:12,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to let you know that these base maps provide the data that we're going to need as we look at each geographic district.

341
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:21,351
[SPEAKER_12]: So the thresholds that we have chosen are based for that last series are based primarily on your table of dimensional standards.

342
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:27,675
[SPEAKER_12]: We found some interesting issues with that table that we're going to look forward to talking with you about as we move forward.

343
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:39,620
[SPEAKER_12]: But what this allows us to do is as we go into each specific geographical area, we can take this data and figure out which ones are non-conforming based on the zoning for that area.

344
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:47,104
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the many reasons we want to start working with the geography is so that we can take that next step of analysis.

345
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:55,368
[SPEAKER_12]: But this at least gets us to an understanding of what's happening where citywide and allows us to see the different patterns.

346
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, good evening.

347
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:19,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So one thing I did want to sort of mention that I think Jimmy mentioned and Emily mentioned sort of briefly is this idea that these maps have a lot of data and we'd love to be able to sit around them and draw on them and just talk about them and sort of like, what do you see here?

348
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:21,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And what does this make you think?

349
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:29,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would really lend itself to a working group kind of format where we sit in one of the conference rooms

350
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:35,095
[SPEAKER_10]: with the big table and spread out maps, and we all stand around and walk around and draw on them.

351
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:52,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we just wanted to be clear that we thought that that would be a really great exercise to have maybe in July, or if not August, but that maybe that would be in place of one of the evening meetings on Zoom, that it could be a publicly advertised meeting, but that it might be in a very different format than these meetings.

352
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director Hunt, before I recognize President Bears.

353
00:44:57,952 --> 00:44:59,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll note, I think that that's a great idea.

354
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:02,916
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a ton to digest from these maps.

355
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that overview, Jimmy and Emily.

356
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:11,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are really quite amazing to see this data laid out visually.

357
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:13,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to see that.

358
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:22,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe we can look at a date that would work for this committee, in addition to our already scheduled July meeting for this group, so that we can continue to move ahead on proposed

359
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:35,521
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing proposals, either from the, you know, perhaps that'll, I don't think that we really want to push back our first meeting about the corridor level zoning, but I think that this would be fantastic to wrap our head around the kind of global approach.

360
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:41,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a long time since we had a meeting where we all just stand around a table together.

361
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that'll be very useful.

362
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:44,885
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

363
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:46,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

364
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:53,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a couple questions on the zoning with the neighborhood, the neighboring cities and towns.

365
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:59,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be possible for when we get the final versions of those to have one that is just the Medford and then one with both?

366
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:01,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And could we add Everton if possible?

367
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

368
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:10,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that we kind of tried to take the zones from the neighboring communities and comp them to ours.

369
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:11,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what the color?

370
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:12,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

371
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

372
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:12,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

373
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sorry for glossing over that.

374
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:15,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mention that.

375
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:24,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So the zoning colored around Malden, Winchester, Arlington, and Somerville, they are colored to your zoning, but what they allow.

376
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:35,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example, down here in Somerville, where it meets this part of Medford, they allow the type of uses that you allow in your apartment to district.

377
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:40,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And same for Winchester up here, they only allow single family.

378
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:48,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does match your zoning, but definitely we can get you a map with just your zoning as well as Everett.

379
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:50,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will reach out to them again for that.

380
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:50,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

381
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:53,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we did try.

382
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:56,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I did try two times to reach out to Edward.

383
00:46:56,241 --> 00:47:03,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get anything back, but if you know anyone in Edward that I could get that from, I'd appreciate it.

384
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:03,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

385
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:04,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

386
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:05,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the efforts.

387
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:18,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think, you know, when I talk about, and I don't know, maybe it might be worth Melrose too, but it's just interesting to see how our zoning is like almost like a pizza pie of the surrounding communities.

388
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:24,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting analysis to look at, but I think the average would show why Wellington is the way Wellington is a little bit too.

389
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely, of course.

390
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Paris and Jimmy.

391
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:31,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Attorney Silverstein's hand raised on Zoom.

392
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Please go ahead and state your name.

393
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:34,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor.

394
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonathan Silverstein.

395
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the legal consultant working with the Innis team.

396
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:45,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working with both Everett and Melrose on their zoning recodifications.

397
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:57,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be happy to coordinate with Jimmy to get the information he needs with the caveat that Everett zoning in particular might be changing pretty substantially in the next year.

398
00:47:57,525 --> 00:48:00,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jonathan.

399
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you very much, Attorney Silverstein.

400
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:19,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has been, I think, a helpful overview of the main guide and the main set of tools that we'll be using over the summer and beyond to set some of these goals and topic areas in motion.

401
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Using the work plan to keep ourselves apace on the many goals called from, you know, years of community outreach into the comp plan and the climate plan.

402
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:36,392
[SPEAKER_04]: and discussing ways to make those manifest and changes to our zoning code, whether that be on the basis of topic.

403
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:39,845
[SPEAKER_04]: addressing specific corridors, specific districts or global approaches.

404
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:48,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to be guided by this new suite of maps, which give us many overlapping pieces of insight into what we're talking about.

405
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about different areas of Medford.

406
00:48:51,895 --> 00:49:02,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And this plan for our next steps in terms of next month, sound good to me as one Councilor, we already have a meeting on the books with this committee and the zoning consultant.

407
00:49:02,862 --> 00:49:14,632
[SPEAKER_04]: and it sounds like there's consensus around using that to begin our conversation around potential proposals for the Salem Street corridor and the Mystic Ave corridor, two priority areas for the community and the council.

408
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:28,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it'd be really advantageous to, I don't know the July date off the top of my head, but if it's possible to even to fit in that map meeting before that, so we can have that in our heads as we go forward to think about all the other goals and topics with those layers in mind.

409
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would set us off on the right foot.

410
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other councilor Reming?

411
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:36,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a small question.

412
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:41,514
[SPEAKER_06]: When do you think these maps are going to be available online in PDF format?

413
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:45,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council.

414
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:48,750
[SPEAKER_12]: We do want staff to have a look at them as well.

415
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,272
[SPEAKER_12]: We worked right up to the last minute to make sure they were ready.

416
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:54,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I don't want to give them out permanently today.

417
00:49:54,414 --> 00:50:05,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say after staffs have a chance to review them, as soon as that's done, so maybe mid-July, because if we need to make any changes that come out of that, then we'd be happy to share them with you.

418
00:50:07,323 --> 00:50:08,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're available online as well.

419
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:12,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

420
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:21,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And likewise, I know that the work plan is too physically large to put in the council packets this week, but if that could be distributed to members of this committee as well, that would be very helpful.

421
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:26,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I will send it.

422
00:50:28,182 --> 00:50:28,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paula.

423
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:34,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at our previous meeting, we were reviewing the work plan just in draft before it was reformatted.

424
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:47,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Councilors had a chance to review everything that was included within it to make sure that, you know, all key priorities and suggestions from individual Councilors and residents via Councilors had been included.

425
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:54,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I took another pass today at the work plan that we received on Friday, and I know that all of my pet projects were in there for myself.

426
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, I know that I'm sure that additional projects and topics will get added as we work through this.

427
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly it doesn't need to be any longer than it already is.

428
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:26,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that we are starting to get to a place where we can be picking up that pipeline that we kind of test drove with site plan review and definitions and municipal exemptions in May, where we can be working on this kind of two track approach of reviewing proposals to corridors and global strategies.

429
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:46,433
[SPEAKER_04]: figuring out a cadence to be reviewing proposed language to get at those topics and goals from NS Associates that are in line with the goals and priorities that we agree on, discussing them, voting them out of committee, and making sure that we are, you know, as best we can, going in order of priority and also going in order of actionability when we're ready to move on.

430
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:52,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that it's urgent to move on so that we can make sure our zoning reflects what we want for our community.

431
00:51:55,094 --> 00:52:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that takes us to the end of our formal agenda for tonight, because I know we wanted to mostly get a preview of these tools and guidelines we'll be working with for the rest of the summer and the year.

432
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:12,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any last questions from Councilors on the mapping analysis, the work plan, or on what to expect from our next steps in July?

433
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:24,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, is there any comment from city staff or any member of the public who wish to speak?

434
00:52:26,783 --> 00:52:29,944
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to speak and come up to the microphone and state your name and address for the record.

435
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:33,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, just name and address for the record.

436
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:38,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name is Paulette Vardabedian, 27 Central Avenue, and this is my first time at a council meeting.

437
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:41,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, and I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

438
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:43,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm Vice President Collins.

439
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:43,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Collins.

440
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:51,753
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could speak a little slower, because I can't, you speak so fast and sometimes you swallow your words.

441
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:54,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really understand a lot of what you're saying.

442
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:54,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

443
00:52:58,502 --> 00:53:03,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other further comment from members of the public, city staff, councilors?

444
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for being here tonight.

445
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:10,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for all your work that's gotten us to this point.

446
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:16,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to July and we'll work together to schedule that working meeting around the maps as well.

447
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:16,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

448
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:17,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for your time.

449
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,750
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it.

450
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:19,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

451
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

452
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:23,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

453
00:53:23,892 --> 00:53:27,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn from President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lemingng.

454
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:30,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them click when you're ready, please call the roll.

455
00:53:30,886 --> 00:53:32,287
Yes.

456
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:38,731
Vice President Collins.

457
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:01,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

458
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:03,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

459
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:06,269
Okay.

460
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

461
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:09,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

462
00:54:10,252 --> 00:54:10,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

463
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:12,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins.

464
00:54:12,434 --> 00:54:12,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:54:14,515 --> 00:54:15,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemingng.

466
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

467
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott Peli.

468
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:17,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

469
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:19,338
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears.

470
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:19,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

471
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:21,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And his presence.

472
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to switch that out and I'll be right back.

473
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,863
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you all.
