00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:08,216
I would be remiss tonight if I did not mention our neighbors in the Ukraine who are suffering right now due to the Russian invasion.

2
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:14,140
We pray for all involved and hope this conflict ends peacefully and quickly.

00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,143
Immediately following my remarks today, Mr. Murphy,

4
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:30,373
Nurse Avery and Director of the Board of Health, Mary Ann O'Connor, will be joining us to discuss COVID-19 policies.

5
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:38,659
I also wanna take this moment to reiterate that our mask policy remains in effect until March 14th.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:50,647
Also in conjunction with our nurses and the Board of Health, Medford High School will be hosting free vaccine clinics Wednesday,

00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:56,265
March 2nd and Wednesday, March 9th from three to 6 p.m.

00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:00,847
Both COVID-19 and flu shots will be available.

00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:10,653
For those in our school community who have not received either the vaccine, the booster or a flu shot, you are welcome to attend these clinics.
