1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:01,331
So hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:02,552
My name is Craig Altschmidt.

3
00:00:02,732 --> 00:00:15,894
I'm the executive director of 350 Mass Action, and I'm delighted to be stepping in as host here as I'm introducing and interviewing Anna Callahan, who has an announcement to our listeners to make today.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,975
Anna, do you want to share the big news with folks?

5
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:20,815
Sure.

6
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:28,537
I am running for state representative in the 34th Middlesex District, which is part Somerville and part Medford.

7
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,496
which is super exciting.

8
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:39,717
And as you know, and as folks can hopefully imagine, I am very proud and excited to be supporting Anna in this race.

9
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:46,559
And, you know, obviously Anna, you know, running for office, you know, it takes a lot, like it's a big commitment.

10
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,539
It's a big step.

11
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,720
You're really putting yourself out there and, you know, it's not for everyone.

12
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:57,442
So what is it that drove you to want to take this big step and run for office?

13
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:09,578
Yeah, there is something that someone I highly respect said to me a few years ago that really drives everything that I have done for the last few years.

14
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:17,963
She says, if they have the money and we have the people, we cannot win by preaching to the choir.

15
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:26,579
So that to me drives home this point that we're not gonna pass a Green New Deal without a movement behind it.

16
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,280
Not here in Massachusetts, not nationally.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,842
We're not gonna pass Medicare for all without a movement behind it.

18
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:44,067
We're not gonna get any of the things that we want, need, and deserve, including literally saving our planet and our species from extinction.

19
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,429
We are not gonna get those things.

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:55,145
unless we really bring more people, like a lot more people, into the political process.

21
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:14,630
So I've been spending my last four years training people in kind of a different model of political organizing that elects slates of progressives to city councils while building a movement on the ground to support those people.

22
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:23,138
And I just concluded that it's about time for me to step in and do the candidates part of that.

23
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:33,647
Can you tell us more about that model and what motivated, I guess you're talking motivation, but how is it structured and how is it effective?

24
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:40,520
Yeah, so the model is really quite different from what most people around the country are currently doing.

25
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:48,044
And we got this, so I started this organization four years ago, three and a half years ago, called The Incorruptibles.

26
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:50,846
And that's what we've been doing.

27
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,487
We've been training people around the country in this model.

28
00:02:54,248 --> 00:03:01,291
So the difference between the two models is, here's the old model, probably sound kind of familiar.

29
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,833
You get a bunch of people together,

30
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:09,776
You wait until candidates announce that they're running.

31
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,119
You choose the least bad one of the candidates.

32
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,584
And then you do everything that you can to get that person elected, which is where most of the training in this country happens.

33
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:26,248
The training is around getting people elected, whether they are great, good, or mediocre.

34
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:32,452
And then the last step is after that person is elected and they start doing something you don't like,

35
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,293
get angry, and start over at the top.

36
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,678
It's not actually a very effective model.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,983
It doesn't lead to sort of lasting change.

38
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:48,748
We're always back at the beginning again trying to elect one more progressive.

39
00:03:50,728 --> 00:04:02,331
The new model involves putting together a coalition that comes up with a single platform and then runs slates of candidates.

40
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:06,572
And those candidates hopefully are not people who self-select.

41
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:14,173
When people self-select, they are more likely to be wealthier, more likely to be white, more likely to be male.

42
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:30,024
But when through your coalition, you are, and the coalition is all of, you know, a lot of working class people, marginalized, vulnerable communities.

43
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:51,627
And when you work through that coalition to bring people, to sort of train people up to be candidates, to encourage people to be candidates who might never have thought of being a candidate, then you get a much better diversity of candidates who's more likely to maintain those ties.

44
00:04:54,086 --> 00:05:02,150
And then once you run these slates of candidates on a single platform, once they get elected, and this part is really, really different.

45
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:08,733
Everybody talks about holding representatives accountable, and that is an antagonistic relationship.

46
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:17,518
But the way that this model works, there is an intimate working relationship between the coalition

47
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:22,279
and the elected official, where that coalition is really co-governing.

48
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:32,363
So they are helping to figure out what is on the agenda, what maybe is missing on the city council meetings, or the state agenda for that cycle.

49
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:48,457
to strategize together about how we're going to pass policy, to be involved sometimes in writing the policy, and really to work together and get the grassroots out to pass that policy.

50
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,740
Yeah, it's a really exciting model.

51
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,145
How did you discover that or create that or what led to that?

52
00:05:57,571 --> 00:05:58,511
I did not create it.

53
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:07,793
So I had the great fortune of working with Gail McLaughlin, who was the mayor of Richmond, California.

54
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:19,596
And in Richmond, the town of Richmond really had been owned by Chevron for 100 years, to the point that Chevron actually had a desk inside City Hall.

55
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:23,377
And they would pay off every single politician.

56
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,198
And by pay off, they're donating to their campaign.

57
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:42,624
So in the early 2000s, some people formed the Rich and Progressive Alliance and they did this whole model and over the course of seven or eight years, they had a majority on the city council plus the mayor and they passed

58
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:45,745
most incredible suite of policies.

59
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,526
They passed the first rent control bill in the state of California in 30 years.

60
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:53,848
They reduced the homicide rate from the second highest homicide rate in the country.

61
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:54,968
They reduced it by 75%.

62
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:59,690
They got $100 million in new taxes from Chevron.

63
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,931
I mean, I could go on and on.

64
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,912
There's like some amazing, amazing things that they

65
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:05,512
continue to do, right?

66
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:06,532
They're still in power.

67
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,213
So that does not change.

68
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,573
They are still there.

69
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:11,954
They have a strong coalition.

70
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:13,854
And so I got to work with them.

71
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:19,696
I also worked with Jane McAlevey, who is such a powerhouse.

72
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:25,757
She's one of the most successful union organizers in the last 40 or 50 years.

73
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:34,039
She gets 95% participation in the unions where she organizes, and it's not because everybody there is pro-union.

74
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:42,119
It is because she does the really hard work of convincing people to join the struggle.

75
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,181
And she has done it thousands of times.

76
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:54,423
She has perfected this, you know, the sort of convincing conversation, this long relationship where in the end, those people join the struggle.

77
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,464
And so I got to incorporate her ideas.

78
00:07:56,504 --> 00:08:01,285
She's the one who said, if they have the money and we have the people, we'll never win by preaching to the choir.

79
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:10,708
So she has really proven that herself hundreds of times and gotten, you know, her, the unions she works with,

80
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:14,171
get amazing wins.

81
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,835
Awesome.

82
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:25,042
So tell us, why does Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Statehouse specifically need this type of model?

83
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:26,528
Oh, yes.

84
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:31,592
So people who have listened to this podcast will have heard this many times.

85
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:44,725
In Massachusetts, there is a combination of a set of rules, financial incentives, and a culture that basically puts all power in the hands of the speaker.

86
00:08:47,673 --> 00:09:02,472
You know, AOC talks about the vice grip of pressure that she is under, psychological pressure, social pressure, political pressure, every moment of every day to conform, and that kind of pressure exists at the State House as well.

87
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:16,742
Specifically, one of the things that we're trying to change first is transparency, that there is really no way for you or anyone to know how their state rep is voting.

88
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:18,943
It's all done secretly.

89
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:32,429
And so most bills, the decision as to whether a bill will move forward or not is done by a very small group of people in a backroom deal, and it is completely undemocratic.

90
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:47,966
And, you know, as, as you're just talking about, you know, AOC and the pressures to conform, obviously, you know, I think most, or at least a lot of folks who seek public office do do it with really sincere intentions and really

91
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:56,116
want to go in and help people and make a difference in the world and, you know, be responsible and accountable community leaders.

92
00:09:56,316 --> 00:10:07,718
So why is it, do you feel like we have this, this sense of, of, of, you know, a lot of the policies that emerge want to really catering to, to special interests and the wealthy members of our society.

93
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:09,499
Okay.

94
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,619
I'm going to give a little bit of a long answer here.

95
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm going to, I'm going to start with,

96
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:20,636
with national politics, only to make a point.

97
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:40,029
So there was a study done by some Princeton researchers on, they took about 20 years of bills that went through Congress, every single bill, 20 years of Congress, every single bill that entered, that passed, that failed.

98
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,111
And they basically looked at

99
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:55,055
whether how people felt about those bills, how, you know, the top 10% of wage earners felt about those bills, and how the bottom 90% of wage earners felt about those bills.

100
00:10:56,236 --> 00:11:02,420
And the conclusion of that research study was that it was about 2000 bills.

101
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,943
So the conclusion of that research study was that

102
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:15,136
The top 10% of wage earners pretty much control which bills pass and which bills fail, especially which bills fail.

103
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:19,097
Anything that they don't like, they can absolutely make fail.

104
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:36,342
The bottom 90% of wage earners, I believe their quote was, the desires of the average American have a minuscule, near zero, statistically insignificant impact on public policy.

105
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:43,253
So that is really something to like take some serious pause at.

106
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:48,635
That our Congress serves the wealth, period.

107
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:50,476
Full stop.

108
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:56,678
And what people say a lot is they talk about money in politics.

109
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,298
It's all money in politics.

110
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,299
And I don't believe that it's all money in politics.

111
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,841
I, like you, I believe that most people enter public office with good intentions.

112
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:17,674
So now I want to talk a little bit about what life is like for progressive elected officials right after they get elected.

113
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:32,687
And this is from my experience providing these training sessions to people around the country, in Oklahoma, in, you know, northern, central, and southern California, in Pennsylvania, in Kansas, in Rhode Island, in Massachusetts.

114
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,584
and sometimes having mayors or city councilors attend the workshops.

115
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,142
And these are all, the progressive ones are the ones attending the workshops, right?

116
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:54,351
Because we give these workshops through an Our Revolution group, through a DSA chapter, through an indivisible group, through a PDA, Progressive Democrats of America.

117
00:12:54,471 --> 00:13:01,056
So it's always, we find a group that is interested in the coalition building side of it.

118
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,300
And then elected officials that are friendly with them sometimes attend.

119
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:10,164
So here's what happens when a progressive gets elected.

120
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:12,265
They have a whole team of people.

121
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,765
This is to city council or state.

122
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:19,167
They have a whole team of people working to get them elected.

123
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,868
And they have this great party on election night.

124
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,369
And everybody is really happy.

125
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:35,212
And all those volunteers go home and pretty much totally stop interacting with that elected official for six months, eight months, a year.

126
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:36,950
right?

127
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,532
They just, they're gone.

128
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,536
Meanwhile, the elected official goes to work.

129
00:13:46,296 --> 00:14:02,507
And while they are at work, they're contacted and asked to have meetings with developers, lobbyists, chamber of commerce, CEOs, the

130
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:18,655
As things pass through the city council or through the state house, there are all sorts of consultants that develop, you know, beautiful reports that have all these graphs that are well-researched, that have lots of photos.

131
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,576
And most of those, who's paying for those?

132
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,277
Corporations are paying for those, right?

133
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,397
Somebody has to pay for those reports.

134
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:31,618
That's where these sitting elected officials get their information.

135
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:34,994
because no one else is providing information for them.

136
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:55,741
And even their own constituents, I talked to a state rep, actually one of the earlier podcasts, one of the state reps said that if she didn't go out of her way, out of a district of 40,000 people, she would probably hear from the same 100.

137
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:07,695
The people who feel like it's their prerogative to contact a state representative are people in general in the top 20% of wage earners.

138
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:15,056
So even your own constituents, that's part of the job, is you have to serve your constituents.

139
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:25,359
But if you don't try to have some control over who you listen to, you will literally only hear from

140
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:35,933
pro corporate, pro wealthy, top 20% people, 24 hours a day.

141
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,475
That's the nature of the job.

142
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:53,827
And so let's flash forward, you know, six months and you have been elected to the state house.

143
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,741
Given that that is the nature of the job.

144
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,685
What, what can you do to guard against that.

145
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:05,374
How do you defend against that that that insular mindset that creeps in.

146
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,697
Yes.

147
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,359
So part of the model.

148
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:37,493
is a very specific, deliberate strategy to ensure that the elected official is hearing not only from the sort of grass tops, like the leadership of organizations that either serve or whose members are part of working class communities, but that you're directly listening to vulnerable, marginalized working class people.

149
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:40,303
And here's how it goes.

150
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:44,105
It's not super difficult, but it's time consuming and it's hard work and you have to do it.

151
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,450
You start off, and I recommend doing this with others, not by yourself.

152
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,093
So hopefully with an organization that wants to be involved because it's a lot of work and they can help you out.

153
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:08,160
Step one is really to list who are the underrepresented, marginalized, vulnerable people who live in your city or district.

154
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:15,826
And that's probably gonna include like 30 or 40 demographics, sometimes overlapping.

155
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:27,335
With that list, you then start to make another list, which is who are the individuals or organizations that have access to those people?

156
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,457
Who are the ones that are trusted by those people?

157
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:36,501
Who are the ones that serve those people in some capacity?

158
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,583
And then you start having one-on-ones.

159
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:45,404
and you meet with those folks with the goal of setting up listening sessions.

160
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:57,798
So let's say, for example, that you want to meet with, you know, that there is like a Haitian community in your area.

161
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:08,767
And you have done a few one-on-ones, and through talking to those people, you've identified that there is a particular church leader that knows a lot of folks.

162
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,831
And you meet with them, and they're very excited about the idea.

163
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:19,898
So then they help you set up a meeting that they bring their people to.

164
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:25,533
with translators if necessary, you know, whatever you need to make happen.

165
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:31,515
And ideally, it's at their location, so they feel comfortable, and it's at their timeline.

166
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:36,777
So if it is at a church, it might be like immediately after the service at the church.

167
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,679
And it's this the whole meeting is 70% listening.

168
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:47,501
So the idea is you ask people how state politics affects their lives, right?

169
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,422
How many people in this room have

170
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,873
not gone to the doctor because of cost.

171
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,804
And then you get their stories, their personal stories.

172
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:06,378
After, so you do that throughout for every, you keep doing this and you, and this never stops.

173
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,739
You can be in office for 20 years.

174
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,221
Frankly, this is exactly what Bernie does and has always done.

175
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:20,729
I remember reading, I kind of knew this, but I, I remember reading in one of his books and on page 202, one of his books, he says, oh, I, it's May.

176
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:27,515
And I just had my sixth town hall with high school students only of the year.

177
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:34,727
So he had already done 600 town halls that year, more than one per month, that only included high school students.

178
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:45,989
And you know, he's also done half a dozen for every other, you know, underrepresented community in his area, right?

179
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,510
In his state, in his city, whatever it is.

180
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:57,732
So, so this is the way that you maintain those connections and you hear the stories of how policy is actually affecting people's lives.

181
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:11,400
And the last thing I'll say is that it doesn't quite stop there because those personal stories, like when you're at the meeting, you are engaging, you try to engage those people in the political process, right?

182
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:23,242
You help them to understand, you can narrow in on some particular policy that they want to change, and then you help them and get them to be activated in something that they can affect.

183
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:32,702
But after that, the personal stories are incredibly effective for motivating other people to action.

184
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:42,211
So those personal stories, you can use them with permission to help everyone else that you have then been involved with.

185
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:51,479
Everybody from like all the more politically active activist organizations to all of these, you know, more underserved groups that you're meeting with.

186
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:59,414
when they hear that personal story they will be motivated to act on an issue that maybe isn't their issue.

187
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:01,836
So that's the model.

188
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:15,490
Beautiful model and yeah I think our politics would be very well served if a lot more folks were to embrace that or if we had more folks who did embrace that like you in office.

189
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:24,944
So yeah, so what else do you think is important for listeners to understand about your candidacy, about this race?

190
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:26,765
Sure.

191
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,529
Movement building is the reason that I'm running.

192
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:39,804
I think we can do a lot, not just within the district to, you know, I just described it.

193
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:44,768
So, you know, doing all of that work in the district will be important.

194
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:52,235
But I think with those connections with people in the district, you also connect with people in other districts.

195
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm also running, I mean, you know, you said,

196
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,558
It would be great if more politicians were doing this.

197
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:05,841
And that is the entire purpose of the incorruptibles and what I've spent my life doing for the last four years.

198
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:13,786
So I really intend to help bring this model to other elected officials.

199
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:20,650
It really is to their best interest, because if you do this model really well, you will, they can run anybody they want against you.

200
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,352
They can pour millions of dollars against you and you will win your reelection.

201
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:43,118
So those sorts of, like the long-term goal of being able to, as an elected official, I think I'll be able to get the word out more and get more interest in the model as an elected official than I have been just as a regular person.

202
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:48,205
And then, you know, transparency matters.

203
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:59,930
The culture at the Statehouse, the rules at the Statehouse, the financial incentives at the Statehouse mean that Massachusetts cannot move forward.

204
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:01,431
We cannot be a leader.

205
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:06,674
Our people, the Bay Staters, are ready to lead.

206
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,351
We are ready to lead.

207
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,292
We want to lead.

208
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:24,728
On environmental stuff, everybody is ready to even spend a little bit more money so that Massachusetts can lead in, you know, really pushing back against climate change.

209
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,311
But we can't do it because of the

210
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:36,837
the culture happening, the rules, the financial incentives, essentially the stranglehold that the speaker has over policy that passes.

211
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:45,023
So I will do everything that I can to get democracy at our statehouse.

212
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:48,825
Absolutely.

213
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:58,052
And if folks are interested in helping you achieve that, to help you win this election, what's the best way for people to help?

214
00:23:58,665 --> 00:23:59,806
Yeah, thanks for asking.

215
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:04,049
AnnaCallahan.com is the website for the campaign.

216
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,332
Donations are always appreciated during COVID.

217
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,093
Everything costs more.

218
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:11,855
We can't just knock on doors.

219
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:17,539
We've got to pay for phone banking tools, text banking tools, and all of that.

220
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,302
And we would love to have more volunteers.

221
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,584
So we have a volunteer page on the website.

222
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:25,565
You can sign up there as well.

223
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,550
Fantastic.

224
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:35,135
Well, Anna, thank you again for taking the time to chat with us today.

225
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:46,544
And thank you so much for stepping up and putting yourself out there and bringing this model around the country and bringing it here to Massachusetts and to this district.

226
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,826
Because obviously, these are critical times.

227
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,727
The stakes cannot be higher, as you've said.

228
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:57,011
And we need really good people who are really listening to the right folks when they're in office and presenting us.

229
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:57,912
So thank you again.

230
00:24:58,473 --> 00:24:58,934
Thank you.

231
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,597
Thanks for doing the, uh, for doing the interview.

232
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,700
My pleasure.

233
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:05,382
All right.

234
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:06,043
See you next time.

235
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:08,647
Till next time.
