1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:04,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and read the meeting notice so we can get started and.

3
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it will not take us the entire time.

4
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will see what we see.

5

[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Dickinson.

24
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:14,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bob.

25
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fiona Maxwell.

26
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:28,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're on mute, but I think you said yeah.

27
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:35,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so for attendance purposes, we have three present, one absent.

28
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So the meeting can be called to order.

29
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:42,505
[SPEAKER_04]: We also thank you, Alicia, for joining us.

30
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:49,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited Alicia, who's our head of everything, it seems.

31
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:56,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Development and sustainability and something else, right, Alicia?

32
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:00,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Planning, development and sustainability.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I was forgetting something.

35
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:09,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of the things that we'll be talking about certainly have some crossover into Alicia's world.

36
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:14,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And so thank you for being here and for joining us.

37
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We have just two items on our agenda for tonight.

38
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:25,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly if people have questions along the way, it's a small group and you can feel free to stop me.

39
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:29,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm happy to field those questions as best I can.

40
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:31,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two agenda items.

41
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So one was,

42
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:44,518
[SPEAKER_04]: to start a discussion about potential sites for Medford High School that would inform our next steps in the process, which ultimately is getting towards a feasibility study.

43
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:52,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing that we have on our agenda is to discuss the anticipated budget for the feasibility study.

44
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the mayor's not here, we may just table that.

45
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:59,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we talk about potential sites,

46
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:27,347
[SPEAKER_04]: there I think there have been some questions raised in the community certainly over over the period of years around how to think about a new Medford High School and where it might be and I think you know certainly where it is right now is one very viable option but I think there is like a sort of a broader sense of possibility potentially in terms of what we might be thinking about

47
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't need to make any decisions tonight, but I wanted to start the conversation because if there is a broadening of what needs to be studied in the feasibility study, we'll need to know that in order to start to sort of weave that into our process and our application.

48
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our first agenda item.

49
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:50,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am happy to

50
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,370
[SPEAKER_04]: take any comments that you all have.

51
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Fiona and Bob, you may not have as much to say about that.

52
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:58,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally fine.

53
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,795
[SPEAKER_04]: But just trying to start to think through, you know, as a group, where do we

54
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:13,254
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, where do we begin in terms of sort of what is possible?

55
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Alicia, thank you for being here.

56
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:19,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That's certainly a very helpful person to have on the team.

57
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:26,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will stop talking and see if there's any questions, comments, thoughts, that kind of thing.

58
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

60
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what other sites have ever been discussed in this project.

61
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:34,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been kind of in the

62
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:37,063
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, daydreams for a long time.

63
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:44,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And clearly when they built the high school in the 70s, I would assume what was there was woodlands before, was part of the fell.

64
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:50,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't imagine taking any other chunks of woods or any other sites in the city.

65
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:57,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if there's already any places that have been thought of or city-owned land that could even be an option.

66
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:01,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like there might not be a lot of other places.

67
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that is certainly possible.

68
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:11,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, I have certainly heard people talk about Placedead Park as a possibility.

69
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

70
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:22,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess if you're going to talk about Placedead you could talk about potentially any of those like sort of open green spaces which all are under city control.

71
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:29,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I want to sort of be the committee that takes parks away, takes parks out of Medford.

72
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that, I promise.

73
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be a swamp.

74
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But that, you know, I know that that at least sounds like it has been a discussion over the course of years in the city.

75
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:48,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, you know, as people speculate about what this project could be, that comes up fairly often.

76
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it comes up often because at some point in time,

77
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,233
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a discussion about if there was going to be a new high school, could it be somewhere else?

78
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And somehow that seems to have been the thing that sort of stuck in the.

79
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: public purview.

80
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:03,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

81
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:14,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And criteria, I assume for thinking about this, obviously there are lots of parks, but I mean, centrally located access to, if not transportation, like major roads, so easy to get to.

82
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:22,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'd have placed the benefit being it backs up to the train line, so it's not necessarily butting up to a bunch of houses.

83
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

84
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:25,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the criteria.

85
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not centrally located in the city, but neither is the high school right now.

86
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

87
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:31,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much better.

88
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:31,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

89
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:42,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I do hear, I hear a lot of people talk about how it is not central in the city and it is not particularly easy to get to.

90
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:49,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I can sort of speak to like our busing situation so currently we provide buses

91
00:07:52,952 --> 00:08:00,638
[SPEAKER_04]: at for those students who are more than two miles outside of the school zone in the secondary level.

92
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,020
[SPEAKER_04]: So that includes middle school and high school.

93
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The way we do that at the high school is in part through MBTA buses.

94
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:13,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there is some yellow bus service to North Medford where there is no MBTA service.

95
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So certainly central location is something that's been discussed a whole bunch of times.

96
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:22,816
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, over the years.

97
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So that certainly is a factor when we think about the high school and the, you know, the sheer amount of traffic that has to get to and from every day.

98
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:40,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Leisha?

99
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff that I could say about these various things.

100
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:56,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if you wanted, is it more useful for me to sort of throw out a bunch of information?

101
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:03,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as you were talking, there have been speculation for a very long time.

102
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the planning office, we've thought about these things as we did things like comprehensive plan and what could change and why should it change.

103
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly,

104
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:28,758
[SPEAKER_06]: As planners, we lament the fact that Medford High School ever moved out of Medford Square, because that was such invigoration to the business district here.

105
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,079
[SPEAKER_06]: It really changed things.

106
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,982
[SPEAKER_06]: People talk about how the square used to be a long time ago, much more vibrant.

107
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, frankly, if you had 1,000 high school students here, it would really

108
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:48,718
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't get me wrong high school students come to the square and so to middle school students, perhaps not in the droves that they would have when the school was here.

109
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:57,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, in my mind, anything is literally possible with enough money.

110
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have unlimited money.

111
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to recognize that, like, that is attention, right?

112
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:10,683
[SPEAKER_06]: One could, in fact, buy that old location and like, knock it down and build like, it's, it's possible.

113
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not possible for Medford at this time in this financial situation.

114
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:25,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming, but I wanted to say that I like to state my assumptions explicitly in case I'm missing something that other day.

115
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:46,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I do when you mentioned the transportation issue, there are a couple of things that I should flag, no matter where in the city you put this transportation is going to be an issue for North Medford, because it's hilly it's windy MBTA he doesn't get buses up there I was literally talking to somebody from the state about that today.

116
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:59,152
[SPEAKER_06]: about why do our school buses fit but not MBTA buses and they thought it might have to do with the clearance and how low to the ground the buses go because that's why there's no MBTA.

117
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it's not the only reason but there's actual like MBTA has said to us we cannot run our large ADA buses through Fulton Heights.

118
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't literally work.

119
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you say, well, it's not accessible, the problem is it's always not gonna be accessible somewhere.

120
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:20,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The MBTA system is not the best.

121
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:28,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have a working group on transportation that is talking about the transportation issues.

122
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually why I was talking to the state today.

123
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have some city Councilors, Peter and some, oh my gosh,

124
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:53,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan from the schools are meeting with us along with some transportation companies, staff from my office, our traffic director, Pam from the senior center, someone from West Medford Community Center.

125
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to try to talk about this and we're talking to other communities, how do they choose transportation,

126
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:09,441
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at grants around electric school buses and whether owning our own school buses would be cost effective and would also solve some of our transportation equity issues.

127
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:23,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not saying that we're definitely doing it, but we were gonna look into it to see if, is this something that's worth proposing to the schools and to the city as something that could make sense.

128
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:34,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were in fact talking to the state today about technical assistance and grants for micro transit, which is what they call it when you run your own little bus and stuff within the city.

129
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:45,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all stuff we're looking into, and I wouldn't want to cite a new school just on transit simply because you can move transportation.

130
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You're really done.

131
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:50,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But once you pick a site for the building, that site is done.

132
00:12:52,474 --> 00:13:08,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I did grab, I pulled out our open space and rec plan because one of the things that that does do is that there is a map that has, and I'm sure I could get it online and point people to it, but at the moment I had a copy sitting on my desk.

133
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:22,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there is a map in there and the map I'm currently looking at is regional context, but it marks which green spaces are permanently protected, which are limited protection.

134
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:31,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason I do it with quotes is because in my experience, even something that's permanently protected can be swapped for something else.

135
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Like here's a space that's not protected.

136
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,639
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll permanently protect that to lift this protection over here.

137
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:43,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So there can't be net loss, and it's not always easy, but it can be done.

138
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:53,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that because two of the places that have kind of percolated, there's playstead, that is not permanently protected.

139
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got limited protection on it.

140
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:07,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and but my concern is it is taking it this the school from what is somewhat centrally located.

141
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:08,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like

142
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:22,624
[SPEAKER_06]: in the middle and you're really shoving it into the far corner with the wealthiest families or all the wealthiest neighborhoods in the biggest houses they can walk and everybody else has a long haul to get there.

143
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really love it and it's near station, but it's commuter rail.

144
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely useless to our students in any and every way.

145
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for school.

146
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:34,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

147
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:39,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of where I'm not loving it as a location.

148
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:53,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But if one had a need to say what are possible locations and then let's, like, check off the pros and cons, it's rational to put it on the list so one can say we did a comparison of possible sites.

149
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,188
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one that has been bounced around more recently is Tufts Park.

150
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:10,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That one does have the label permanently protected on it and I'd have to poke a little harder into this to see what that quote permanent protection is.

151
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:16,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that as an area a little better because it's

152
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:23,398
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to push it into one corner of the city, that's our lower income area.

153
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the students for whom if the bus isn't running, it's more likely that mom and dad can't hop in a car and come pick them up.

154
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,613
[SPEAKER_06]: It is making it more accessible to the people who have fewer resources.

155
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of a rational thing.

156
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:43,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are bus lines that go that way.

157
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:50,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the MBTA improved bus services, they want to run more buses down Main Street.

158
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:53,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not loving it because Main Street's so narrow.

159
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a highly congested area.

160
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd make things worse.

161
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:03,511
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a big green open space there.

162
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:08,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you would have space for a school and parking.

163
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:19,246
[SPEAKER_06]: There is the Curtis Tufts School and I think it was at a school committee meeting where they were very recently talking about whether we should be reconsidering the future of that.

164
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: My hope is that that building could be repurposed for recreation or community center that the city could desperately need.

165
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:33,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But you could certainly include the Curtis Tufts property.

166
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our only outdoor pool.

167
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd hate to lose that too.

168
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:45,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The car park doesn't make any sense for a whole lot.

169
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:49,876
[SPEAKER_06]: The transportation is the worst possible for everything.

170
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:55,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's in the middle of a $7 million renovation, so please don't do that to me.

171
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not clear there are any other open spaces.

172
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,282
[SPEAKER_06]: There are commercial areas that we don't own.

173
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:20,230
[SPEAKER_06]: We did do some site survey kind of like assessments when we were looking for the police station when we cited

174
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: police station where it is, we actually did do some due diligence about, are there other locations in the city where you could put a new police station?

175
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that case, we really came down to, even if we bought something, almost everything would not be as centrally located.

176
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and we were trying to see if we could get it out of floodplain areas.

177
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Property in Medford right now is really, really expensive.

178
00:17:57,457 --> 00:18:04,642
[SPEAKER_06]: For us to purchase something doesn't seem reasonable in this climate.

179
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:07,784
[SPEAKER_05]: What about like Hormel?

180
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:08,899
[SPEAKER_05]: that area.

181
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:16,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know that would involve moving Hormel, but that's... So, Hormel is, yeah, it's more complicated protected.

182
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:29,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Its level of protection at this point is, we do have conservation restriction through the state and a federal conservation restriction on the whole, is it on the whole property?

183
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:34,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know what, we did not end up doing the federal conservation restriction.

184
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be part of the Clippership.

185
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:43,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be our donation to the Clippership Connector was to increase the federal restrictions.

186
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:47,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, I think, approved on the city's end.

187
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:52,898
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the federal government didn't, the state didn't move forward with that piece of it.

188
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would have to deal with state conservation restrictions.

189
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:13,514
[SPEAKER_06]: When we built the schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews, there was actually some conservation restriction swap for the footprints of those.

190
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:18,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So those buildings are exempt from the conservation restriction.

191
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:24,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's land over in Rivers Edge that has a conservation restriction.

192
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_06]: in lieu of those two buildings, the footprints of those buildings.

193
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:35,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So there would need to be a conservation restriction, but somewhere else.

194
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:43,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering what the, it's not completely irrational.

195
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the, I was just looking at the map to see size wise.

196
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:51,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be that,

197
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:59,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you would be dealing with all the buses.

198
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:00,476
[SPEAKER_05]: 43 schools there.

199
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:06,999
[SPEAKER_06]: For three and the congestion of three schools worth of students all in one complex.

200
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's I'm sorry to interject here.

201
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a question.

202
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Has there been some thought at all about

203
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:19,066
[SPEAKER_00]: the moving of one of the middle schools that's in that area and replacing it with the high school?

204
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:42,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that I've spoken to some people in the community, and this is a question on my own, where if you're to have the high school be more centrally located, as we're talking about, let's say, if you were to replace it with the Andrews, let's just say for the moment, you move the Andrews closer to the West Medford area, so you have both an elementary school in the Brooks, and then you have a middle school in the West Medford, slightly more North Medford area, for example, and then you have the,

205
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:56,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Kindergarten through high school, you know more central central to South Medford, okay So Would that be I mean, that's not crazy.

206
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I Think the reason I hadn't thought about it is because I'm still stuck in the new schools mindset.

207
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I

208
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:19,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That building is too, I mean, the reality is the reason we're looking at the whole electrification HVAC upgrade is because the building itself is too new to be saying, oh, we should replace it.

209
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,902
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is only 23 years old.

210
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

211
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I mean, it's not a matter of, oh, we should just

212
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:33,585
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the building is it, is it at all possible to, again, just as because we're just you know praying on Hail Mary's here.

213
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:43,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you, could you redo the Andrews for example and make it high school age student and that age appropriate.

214
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:47,312
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, because I don't want to level the building or start from scratch.

215
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:47,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.

216
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:52,372
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too new of a building to do what you would, in theory, do and start from the beginning.

217
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:59,134
[SPEAKER_00]: But could you use that as a foundation to say, we know how much space we've been using thus far for the Andrews.

218
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:02,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we work off of the standing foundation of the Andrews?

219
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:06,275
[SPEAKER_06]: That it holds 600 students.

220
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:12,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a cafeteria that serves as their auditorium and a gym.

221
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:18,416
[SPEAKER_06]: could you, basically what you would do is add on to that building, right?

222
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:21,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you've seen high schools where they have the old wing and the new wing.

223
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:32,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to school in a building that was an old school and a new school put together with a building in between them back in my town.

224
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:38,652
[SPEAKER_06]: You would have the issue, we would need more of the land around it.

225
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:40,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would need to,

226
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:50,952
[SPEAKER_06]: deal with some of the conservation restrictions that are on there and replacing that somewhere else, I'm sure.

227
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:58,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in theory, the Glen would be almost better because it's just got more space that's not already green.

228
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:04,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it has for now, but of course, then you're displacing two schools because elementary schools there too.

229
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:16,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's partly why I was thinking that McGlynn wouldn't make as much sense because to your point about the two schools, they have a bigger student population and they're having the new playground installed.

230
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,591
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews, less students, but it's an older, it's an older amount of students.

231
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,532
[SPEAKER_00]: The students are a different age grouping.

232
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:24,652
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be,

233
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:31,575
[SPEAKER_00]: that isn't and wouldn't be present if we were to remain, keep the high school, for example, where it is.

234
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:39,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to have the Andrews be closer to the West Bedford area, that would then mean you could have students be able to potentially stay closer to home, for example.

235
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:53,764
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be a big thing we need to worry about right now, but I think the McGlynn might need to stay because of what it offers, even though the space itself is more consistent with what we would need to consider that choice.

236
00:23:55,495 --> 00:24:05,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but what we would end up with would be the cost of doing a major addition and possibly renovation to the Andrews School.

237
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:14,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would have to rebuild some sort of, or renovate the existing- Yeah, you would still have the structural issues of the high school.

238
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:16,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, you still need to put a middle school up there.

239
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:22,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you would be talking about two building projects, not one at that point.

240
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense.

241
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

242
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:34,618
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at the high school, some of the questions that I've had, is it helpful?

243
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:37,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do this without looking at a map and visualizing it.

244
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have it up on my screen.

245
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:41,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anybody wants me to share it, but.

246
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:43,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

247
00:24:43,624 --> 00:24:45,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you share or do I need to let you share?

248
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:46,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to let me.

249
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:48,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

250
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try that.

251
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

252
00:24:52,967 --> 00:25:06,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I need to be seeing it in order to, and then I think if I make my screen smaller like this, make that, zoom in on this.

253
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:14,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I kind of look at this and I think there's, I've had an understanding that the high school is very large for our population.

254
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:21,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the concerns is that we are not gonna get, like there's square footage,

255
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,916
[SPEAKER_06]: calculations that come out of MSBA.

256
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:35,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not terribly familiar with them, but I look at this footprint and then I say, I assume we don't need to replace or that we're not going to get a footprint that's this big.

257
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that.

258
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the stories are probably going to be a smaller footprint.

259
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:42,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my guess.

260
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:46,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there's a couple of variables there, Alicia.

261
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:59,926
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that the school committee has voted that they want to see Curtis Tufts come onto the site of the high school in some sort of co-location perspective.

262
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:10,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one thing that, and obviously that's like 20 kids, so it's not like substantive in terms of the number of students, but the space needs are very specific.

263
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that is part of this grant is our early childhood programming.

264
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:29,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a possibility of changing the amount of early childhood programming happening on the property in a way that would expand it.

265
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other thing that I think is like sort of dicey is like once you throw in the vocational programming,

266
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:49,687
[SPEAKER_04]: The space conversation is completely different than the space conversation about a new high school, but MSBA, you're correct, will go through and they will size the building.

267
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:57,531
[SPEAKER_04]: They will size the enrollment, and then I believe the feasibility study will size the building based on that enrollment.

268
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:09,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And I assume at this point, everybody who's part of this conversation is familiar with the existing, what's here existing.

269
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I am extremely familiar with it from some of the work that I've been doing over the years.

270
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:27,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So, one of the things I've been wondering about is, could we do something where this is the pool in the gym, where we're able to keep the pool in the gym, and then maybe build back here on the field of dreams.

271
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:35,820
[SPEAKER_06]: You build a new front door or something, but this remains as part of the new building.

272
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:38,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that I've wondered about.

273
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:43,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already built into a hill where it's three stories here.

274
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:49,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And back here, you are literally entering onto what is the third floor if you walk to the front of the building.

275
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:58,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's definitely something that we'll consider because edgily is, I mean, you can even see it in the picture.

276
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see more rubber in the picture than grass.

277
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:01,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

278
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so we will, you know, have to contend with that as well.

279
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:17,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But I, you know, I think some of that all of that can be studied, you know, anything about like the current, the current space can certainly be will certainly be part of the feasibility study.

280
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:22,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just a question of like, you know, where are those other possibilities?

281
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So in doing this, are there any, you know,

282
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:31,337
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's helpful for you all to know, this is a field that is part of the school.

283
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:47,932
[SPEAKER_06]: This little area has recently been up for sale, and I was just contacted today by a developer who has the option to buy, and he wants to build, I want to say, a subdivision of eight houses here.

284
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping that maybe there, I couldn't imagine though that the city could have moved fast enough to try and buy that property.

285
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,200
[SPEAKER_06]: But if anybody hears talk about it apparently used to be a horse farm.

286
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:02,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

287
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:18,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that if we're staying on the same site, which I think is entirely feasible, there'll be a fair amount of using either one of those two open spaces, even if just temporarily, while construction happens.

288
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:28,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it would probably be better to build onto the existing parking lot that's down where you pull in, just so that when you arrive, you're arriving at a school at a front door.

289
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:33,114
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe move parking to another location, or it moves once you take something else down.

290
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is enough swing space in here to build and then take down or renovate to make the site work.

291
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure of it.

292
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely more tricky than a new separate site, since we're obviously not going to move students somewhere else temporarily.

293
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:50,843
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's doable.

294
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:52,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

295
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:55,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and COLO, moving things around during

296
00:29:57,455 --> 00:30:01,076
[SPEAKER_04]: construction becomes really tricky with our vocational programs.

297
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that will be part of the feasibility study as well.

298
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to say like, you know, it's not the same as like moving a classroom.

299
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an entirely different sort of undertaking.

300
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that we'll have to consider as well.

301
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

302
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:23,282
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alicia, are there any other spaces that

303
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:25,569
[SPEAKER_04]: come to your mind?

304
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:28,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a perfectly fine working list, by the way.

305
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:29,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

306
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:38,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just sort of like, as we go across here, like we have there are these commercial industrial areas.

307
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I don't see how the city could really could do it.

308
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:53,948
[SPEAKER_06]: But we own this parcel and this parcel in the middle of Medford Square, and this one, and there are active plans.

309
00:30:54,229 --> 00:31:07,437
[SPEAKER_06]: We have literally signed a contract in the last few days with a consultant to help us put these out to bid, to put housing, ground floor commercial housing on these properties.

310
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:11,640
[SPEAKER_06]: with the assumption that we would also build a parking garage over here.

311
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have vision and ideas.

312
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:19,425
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a parking garage that we feel is highly underutilized, but it's privately owned.

313
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:23,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to like capture this somehow and be able to use it.

314
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: In a dream world, what if you put the high school here, right?

315
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:33,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Across these properties, and that would be really interesting.

316
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,084
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm not sure that we can move this boat that quickly to pivot to something like that.

317
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would lose out on all the revenue that we're anticipating from developing this as housing.

318
00:31:47,749 --> 00:32:01,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not huge revenue, it is revenue, but what if you did that and then you allowed the high school site to be redeveloped and half that site to become housing instead?

319
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

320
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was wondering about those parking lots.

321
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems like a great spot.

322
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:11,983
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also good for development.

323
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that's not a parking lot.

324
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:14,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

325
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:15,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

326
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:16,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

327
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:23,526
[SPEAKER_06]: The project has moved slower than I would have liked, but we signed a consultant today.

328
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And none of this, we don't really own any of this.

329
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all private.

330
00:32:29,268 --> 00:32:31,750
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of this is ripe for redevelopment.

331
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:43,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say some of this is so ripe for redevelopment that we have been having conversations with various developers who are talking about what could they do here, be allowed, how can we help them with it?

332
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:52,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine that we actually would want to put the high school on Mystic Ave, but again, it would be more central

333
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:59,907
[SPEAKER_06]: It would really make it hard for anybody to walk to school because of that location.

334
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But in theory, you would improve your streets and your sidewalks and your crossings and your bike paths if you did that.

335
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:09,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's State Road, right?

336
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a State Road.

337
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a State Road.

338
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:15,571
[SPEAKER_06]: It's local.

339
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:24,548
[SPEAKER_06]: from about, I forget exactly, when I'm on it, you can tell where it drops.

340
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here.

341
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:31,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is actually the line, because you can see the pavement change.

342
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:44,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that that's, I do believe that that is this, from here north, this is city, and the part there, that's state, because Eversource paved it as part of the project for the city.

343
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:45,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

344
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,501
[SPEAKER_06]: This must be a really recent photo.

345
00:33:52,241 --> 00:34:01,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so this part is, and interestingly, a lot of the owners along here are actually longtime Medford residents.

346
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:05,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not investor developers at this point.

347
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:13,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't see it as being impossible to negotiate a deal, but I'm not sure it's a great idea.

348
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:15,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

349
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:31,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel like it's better to be thorough and to say, we thought about it, we talked about it, and then it, and this area, this is all owned by, I'm going to call him an investor developer, the core power.

350
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,881
[SPEAKER_05]: My yoga studio, okay.

351
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:36,544
[SPEAKER_06]: He says it's hugely popular.

352
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:38,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I met with them last week.

353
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:39,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

354
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:42,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, they pack them in there.

355
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia, thank you for all this.

356
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this was really helpful.

357
00:34:49,589 --> 00:35:00,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to, I just got access to the MSBA's portal that requires us to submit a bunch of information that feeds enrollment projections.

358
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:08,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, Bob and Alicia, there's definitely some tentacles there that will require your input around, you know,

359
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:14,484
[SPEAKER_04]: growth, planned growth, and that kind of thing.

360
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:16,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will sort of funnel that off to you.

361
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just started looking at it though.

362
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, I don't think there's anywhere where we have to sort of describe this just yet, but perhaps it has to be described in the RFP when we are at the point of like going out either to the OPM or out to,

363
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,115
[SPEAKER_04]: the actual feasibility study.

364
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:44,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So hard to say like exactly when this information will be useful, but I think it's sort of on the minds of lots of people.

365
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad that we had the conversation because now I can assure people that we are talking broadly about all the possibilities and really thinking through all of that.

366
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that was, uh, that was very helpful.

367
00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:58,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

368
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the other item on our agenda for tonight is to start to talk about, um, the anticipated budget for the feasibility study.

369
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:10,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and, you know, I can talk a little bit about next steps.

370
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:12,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So before, um,

371
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:31,929
[SPEAKER_04]: before we can get out of the eligibility phase, we have to, the city has to authorize a feasibility, the cost of a feasibility study and demonstrates MSBA that we have the money, whatever that mechanism is, and, you know, an amount.

372
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, I know I have been talking to the mayor about that and, you know,

373
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:44,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe her plan is to use free cash.

374
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:48,044
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's where she was at the last time I spoke with her.

375
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:58,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we won't need to take a vote to do a bond or a debt exclusion, but the council will have to take some sort of vote.

376
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:08,154
[SPEAKER_04]: that authorizes its use and it needs to be in a pile that is demonstrable for the MSBA in order for them to sort of flag us into the next phase.

377
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:10,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So procedurally, that's what needs to happen.

378
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:17,783
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've been talking to people about sort of what the budget needs to be, I've heard

379
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:24,565
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a variety of numbers between two and a quarter and $3 million for the feasibility study.

380
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:31,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Roughly half of that, a little bit more than half, it sounds like, would come back to us eventually in this process.

381
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: If we get all the way through with MSBA, they do credit you back the same thing as your reimbursement rate.

382
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:41,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we had our kickoff call with them, I think they said our reimbursement rate was like 52.5%.

383
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: seven or 52.69 as of that day.

384
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:50,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So it changes, apparently it can change all the time, but 52% of that would come back.

385
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,408
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually, but not, but the city has to put the money up front to do the feasibility study.

386
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:07,779
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that was raised to my attention was that, and actually we took a tour of Arlington High School and they're in the middle of their project.

387
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of the building is open, part of it is not.

388
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:16,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said something sort of related, which was, we're still learning how to use this building.

389
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:31,411
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's all kinds of things that happen in the building where they're like oh there's something wrong with the building and it just turns out like they don't know how to use the building like the entire infrastructure of the building is different than what they're used to and so they're very much in this like learning process.

390
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So our CFO at the schools said that it's not uncommon for districts to

391
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:56,390
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to bringing on the OPM and ultimately the designer to bring somebody on on the district side to ride sort of side saddle with the project and really intimately understand all of the various components

392
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:07,500
[SPEAKER_04]: of the build and how it works and how it's envisioned to work and how the plan changed to the actual and all of that from a facilities maintenance perspective.

393
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:16,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that's a job that's sort of bigger than like the director of facilities just being able to do that in addition to all the other things that he does already.

394
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:23,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And that Jerry was saying that the other thing we might consider is, and I need to

395
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:38,058
[SPEAKER_04]: connect back with him on this, but the other thing we might consider is making sure that that set aside funded this like this position that sort of helps us like sort of smooth that out and bridge the gap over time.

396
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:42,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's sort of another thing that we need to think about in terms of funding.

397
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:53,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, by all the accounts that I've heard somewhere between two and a half and three is probably the right amount of money based on all the things that have to happen.

398
00:39:54,696 --> 00:40:03,844
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bob and Fiona, I wasn't sure whether you had resources that you could tap into in terms of other procurements.

399
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:30,207
[SPEAKER_04]: and the budgets being set for communities like ours for this for these processes that might help inform that that ultimate number that needs to be set aside and I don't know what sort of digging and investigating you all have done in your free time on this up till now and I don't know you know sort of how you are connected to other communities but I wanted to give you some space to

400
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:44,773
[SPEAKER_04]: talk to us about what those, where you might have information that could plug into that, or even Alicia, if you have those connections, like how can we sort of leverage the city side and talk about all of that as well, sort of actively?

401
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:59,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really, I don't have any experience

402
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:03,150
[SPEAKER_01]: in building a school or doing any of this.

403
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:06,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really don't know.

404
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:19,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Nantucket built a new intermediate school six, seven years ago.

405
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:27,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could call up my buddy Martin and see if he knows anything about it.

406
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:30,145
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's that

407
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:47,397
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that process, we had, you know, Nantucket had the land, they knew where they were building it, and the entire budget for it was one tenth of what we're talking about.

408
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:50,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a big difference between middle school and high school.

409
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:55,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, then you have building on Nantucket, which is entirely different than building here.

410
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

411
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Nantucket thing is that

412
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:21,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably a good 10% of the cost of building the new school was simply staging costs for the contractor to get equipment and people over here and rent housing for the people to build it, which would be slightly different than it is in Medford, where hopefully there's somebody around here with a crane.

413
00:42:21,214 --> 00:42:23,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?

414
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:25,197
[SPEAKER_01]: With a few cranes.

415
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

416
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:32,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk to Martin about it.

417
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:38,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think that Nantucket is a very different place for all those reasons you cite.

418
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Fiona, if you are connected to other purchasing folks that might have some light to shed.

419
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:50,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And Libby, I know you sort of work in this space, if you have any light to shed.

420
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really just more to sort of get the juices flowing and thinking about before we go too far.

421
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a group, maybe some surrounding communities.

422
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:03,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you mentioned Arlington more recently.

423
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:04,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

424
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:11,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Somerville is also another community that has done a new high school.

425
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:11,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

426
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of Stoneham in the last few years, which is a little different.

427
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a town a lot smaller.

428
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:28,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a pretty good relationship with the procurement officer in Stoneham as well as Somerville.

429
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can certainly reach out to some of the group and see how things worked with them.

430
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just say this is similar to Bob.

431
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:49,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot of experience building a new school other than the community that I lived in, but that was on the different side of it.

432
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:57,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so this is, um, yeah, something I can definitely, I haven't, I haven't done that yet, but I can certainly.

433
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,750
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could, that would be great.

434
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the other thing that would be helpful Fiona to start the wheels turning in, um, in a related way is to.

435
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,443
[SPEAKER_04]: to find out if they have copies of their procurements for their owner's project manager.

436
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be our net, you know, that's going to be our like big thing is to like get ready to issue that RFP because once the OPM gets on board, life for all the rest of us gets easier, hopefully.

437
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to that.

438
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:27,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

439
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

440
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:28,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

441
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city does have templates for RFQs for OPM for designers.

442
00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:39,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we've done it for the library.

443
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:40,957
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done it for the police station.

444
00:44:41,197 --> 00:44:43,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done it for the fire station.

445
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:47,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing it for the McGlynn and Andrews right now.

446
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We just hired an OPM.

447
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:56,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we definitely have, you know, some templates and some foundations.

448
00:44:58,324 --> 00:44:58,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

449
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:00,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And Fiona, I'm thinking that there's also, um,

450
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:14,892
[SPEAKER_04]: some very school-specific things about building with MSBA that maybe your counterparts in those other communities could provide as well, because the MSBA's process is very prescriptive, sort of at every step.

451
00:45:14,952 --> 00:45:30,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything that they can tell us, because my goal, you know, my goal, whenever we're done with eligibility and they invite us to the next phase, which is hiring our OPM, is like, my goal is that the next day our RP goes out the door and we are moving right along.

452
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:42,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And so obviously we'll sort of convene a working group with you between now and then to sort of get that procurement ready to go and make sure that it has all of its moving parts.

453
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:49,112
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're talking to them anyway, maybe grabbing that stuff too from them would be really helpful.

454
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

455
00:45:52,214 --> 00:46:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: If I might, I was on the committee for all of those OPM hires and a couple of things that

456
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I have noted is that that is the right time and place to sort of set a tone for the city's goals and what's important to the city.

457
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: When we hired different OPMs for the library versus the police versus the schools, we had different core

458
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:24,572
[SPEAKER_06]: issues and goals in mind.

459
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:28,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And I set aside the fact that I'm a sustainability director.

460
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a sustainability director and all that.

461
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were like, oh, we want low green net energy schools.

462
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:36,315
[SPEAKER_06]: But what are you thinking about with the library?

463
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:43,777
[SPEAKER_06]: The library director knew what her strengths and weaknesses were and looked for an OPM that could fill in

464
00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: like be a good partner for her where she had these strengths and these weaknesses, they would have the other as opposed to be like together.

465
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:57,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually interesting when we were coming to the final decision around that.

466
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:09,807
[SPEAKER_06]: When we were interviewing for the OPM for the HVAC work, it was interesting that I kind of wondered if some of them

467
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:14,646
[SPEAKER_06]: were aware that there was a new school on our horizon.

468
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:28,316
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one firm that bid or that put in a proposal that clearly that they did was big new schools with real big, with MSBA experience heavy.

469
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:30,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of, I didn't ask them.

470
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:35,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I wondered though, were they, did they feel like they were, you know,

471
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: being a preview for what, for us to get used to them.

472
00:47:40,386 --> 00:47:44,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this idea that maybe did a good job there, we would want to hire them for the high school.

473
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:47,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But what- Yes, they were doing that.

474
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

475
00:47:49,428 --> 00:48:01,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what I did notice is that some of them really spoke to their experience and abilities with MSBA, which is why I wondered because that project is not MSBA funded.

476
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:02,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

477
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:07,044
[SPEAKER_06]: but some of them really seem to have a good understanding of that.

478
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:23,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did work on when the city did the boilers at the high school, that project, not high school, not the boilers, we did a boiler project too, but it was the science labs that MSBA funded.

479
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:28,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really important actually to have somebody who understood

480
00:48:29,716 --> 00:48:30,717
[SPEAKER_06]: those details.

481
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

482
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Simply because things would come up and we'd be like, can we do this?

483
00:48:36,242 --> 00:48:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd be like, while that might actually make sense if you were paying out of pocket, it doesn't because of these MSBA reasons or MSBA won't pay for that.

484
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that did shape some of what we did.

485
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:50,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And

486
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:15,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I, it seems like it would go without saying, but you want a project manager who is going to lead and drive the project to the sense that they're going to say, we need to meet, who's available to meet, this is the time, let's set this up, let's set up our meetings, you know, and then rally and be an advocate for the city, because I have watched

487
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:23,433
[SPEAKER_06]: OPMs just sit back and say, oh, the city should this is the city's project.

488
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:24,573
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just here to help.

489
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:29,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're like, you didn't tell us and you didn't warn us and we didn't know.

490
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:33,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen other OPMs who were like, here's what you need to know.

491
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:35,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to push back on this contractor.

492
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:40,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to argue with the architect over what's possible.

493
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:41,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

494
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:43,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you need to

495
00:49:44,557 --> 00:49:56,641
[SPEAKER_06]: be or at least call it out like yeah no you can do another iteration or this or have you looked at it this way versus that way and be another set of eyes on it and that's helpful to look at.

496
00:49:58,102 --> 00:50:10,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I did think when we did the library and the police station that literally the fact that the staff person in the room besides the chief of police of the library was the sustainability director set a tone for them.

497
00:50:11,606 --> 00:50:13,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying I want to be in on those interviews.

498
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:19,933
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was set up front, like, this is green is important to us, we value this.

499
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:30,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's important that the school department put forward like, this is important, like, this is gonna be a net zero school, right?

500
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what would it?

501
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the school committee has already outlined that set of goals and objectives.

502
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,284
[SPEAKER_04]: we're sort of on our way with that for sure.

503
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:49,734
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, like making sure that sort of what we envision is well outlined is definitely sort of top of mind.

504
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:51,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

505
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:56,922
[SPEAKER_06]: That you don't need your OPM telling you that that's a bad idea.

506
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:57,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

507
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:01,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had them say it.

508
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:02,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

509
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,460
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've worked for OPMs a lot.

510
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:28,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I obviously have a client, but the OPM kind of is between us and in a good way, you know, helping things along and you need to make sure that their vision aligns with our vision, City of Medford vision, because oftentimes they're very experienced and they have been doing this for a long time and they kind of know how to do things or how they've done things, which makes sure they know how we want to do things in the future.

511
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be very important.

512
00:51:34,402 --> 00:51:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you set your budget for a feasibility study, but I think going to the other cities, I mean, I get this question all the time.

513
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:45,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, you did this plan or this kind of project.

514
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me about it?

515
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:48,528
[SPEAKER_06]: What did these things cost?

516
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:51,249
[SPEAKER_06]: can you give me the RFQs you used?

517
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me what the bids were?

518
00:51:54,912 --> 00:52:00,115
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff that Fiona will know what is legally public record.

519
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:05,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fine for us to ask other communities for this information.

520
00:52:05,578 --> 00:52:06,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I want to know.

521
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:07,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it okay to ask?

522
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you share?

523
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You do share that as long as it's the right documents, right?

524
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:12,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

525
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:13,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can ask.

526
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:15,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, often.

527
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

528
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:27,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Alicia, the numbers I've been hearing are pretty consistent from multiple sources in terms of people familiar with Medford and this project.

529
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,789
[SPEAKER_04]: The numbers are not all over the map, so I think that's a good thing for us.

530
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the mayor is hearing the same, so that is awesome.

531
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:40,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is mostly the fees to cover OPM, architects.

532
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:41,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Feasibility, yep.

533
00:52:41,514 --> 00:52:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And mostly just like consultant fees, mostly, right?

534
00:52:44,956 --> 00:52:45,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

535
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:48,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

536
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:49,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

537
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:59,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, ultimately, we will the city council have to take a vote with some very precise language, but I don't think that's anything for this group to be worried about.

538
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I will like work with MSBA to make sure the language that goes forward is compliant and sort of ready to go.

539
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um.

540
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:10,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think those were our two agenda items.

541
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you all for joining, 655.

542
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done early, so hopefully you can take your hour back.

543
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:29,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Bob and Alicia, I will reach out to you separately about some of the things that we need from a planning and projection perspective.

544
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:32,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be more Alicia than Bob.

545
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:33,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

546
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just literally got the access like two hours ago.

547
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll keep you posted.

548
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:41,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jenny, I know I told you this, but I'll just share.

549
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:50,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So the MAPCs are regional planning agency and they do population projections as part of what they do and for various purposes and ways.

550
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:54,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually already spoken to them and they just asked that we provide them

551
00:53:54,747 --> 00:54:08,513
[SPEAKER_06]: with the exact language, because sometimes the different words are nuanced and mean things, but they can help us develop some projections that they can put data behind.

552
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:15,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not using up staff time that's so limited, but they have the bandwidth for that.

553
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:16,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

554
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:16,936
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

555
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:26,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there are no other questions, is there a motion to adjourn?

556
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:29,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn.

557
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion adjourned by Aaron, seconded by Libby.

558
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:36,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

559
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:40,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And roll call.

560
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:42,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Graham, yes.

561
00:54:42,427 --> 00:54:43,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, absent.

562
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Libby Brown.

563
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

564
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:47,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And Aaron Olapade.

565
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:48,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

566
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:51,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Three in the affirmative, one absent.

567
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:52,394
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is adjourned.

568
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

569
00:54:53,677 --> 00:54:55,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.

570
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:55,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Alicia.
