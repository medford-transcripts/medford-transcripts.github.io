    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=658.014s">21st</a>  regular meeting Medford City Council November 12 2024 is called to order Mr please call the roll Council Callahan, Vice President Collins Council is our Council Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President, President bears present seven present none absent the meeting is called to order please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=692.89s">Announcements</a>  accolades remembrances reports and records records the records of the meeting of October 29 2024 pastor counselor Callahan counselor Callahan how did you find those records. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=706.698s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Callahan to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Collins Mr. Clerk please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=716.303s">Council</a>  Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=723.407s">Councilor</a>  Tseng President bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=727.389s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative negative the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=731.331s">Refer</a>  to committee for further discussion just a reminder that the intent of this section is for us to refer items to committee for further discussion, no final action will be taken on these items during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=743.844s">24491</a>  resolution to discuss compensation ordinance for elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=747.145s">It</a>  looks like there's an amended version resolution to discuss ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials by councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=756.267s">Whereas</a>  only the city council can change the salaries of Medford elected officials, mayor, city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=761.388s">And</a>  whereas there's no way for elected officials to adjust elected official salaries for inflation or general cost of living increases without the city council voting to change elected official salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=770.211s">And</a>  whereas there is a personal incentive for city counselors to increase their own salaries, whereas the city council increasing salaries that are increasing salaries of others is viewed as in form of impropriety and be it resolved that this governance committee take up an ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials and to encourage city council to consider Cola adjustments for elected officials in the next cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=793.456s">I</a>  would just note before turning this over for a brief, I hope, discussion or introduction by the proponent before the motion to refer to committee that I don't think an ordinance would affect this at all we already have three charter and state laws that affect this so as a plan a charter chapter 4317 a. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=813.599s">already</a>  applies to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=816.36s">Chapter</a>  71, section 52 governs how school committees are compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=820.261s">And</a>  then the acts of 2002 chapter 447 is a Medford specific law that would supersede any ordinance passed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=828.583s">So</a>  the way to go at this is with charter amendment, not with an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=832.844s">But</a>  with that, I will go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=842.193s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=843.493s">I</a>  would note that I forgot to remove that last half of the sentence so at the bottom of full text and description before the potential language. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=851.515s">It</a>  should also remove and to encourage the city council to regularly to consider regular cola adjustments that whole half should be removed, because I removed all of that, that that would be my revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=865.279s">As</a>  I stated in January at the meeting, I believe that, I know that this is the law in a number of states. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=873.286s">It</a>  is also the law in some other cities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=877.99s">And</a>  essentially what it says is that you can vote to change the salaries, but they can't take effect until after the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=889.079s">And</a>  that is essentially what I'm proposing be discussed in the governance committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=894.023s">It</a>  probably makes sense if, like, if we vote this to the Governance Committee, when the Governance Committee takes it up, for the very first thing be to send it to legal to see whether it could even be passed by an ordinance, or we could do that from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=909.011s">Because</a>  if it can't be passed by an ordinance, and it can only be passed by a charter change, then obviously there's no point in us discussing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=915.054s">So</a>  I'm happy if that's the first step.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=920.299s">We're</a>  on the motion of Councilor Callahan to refer to governance committee seconded by Councilor Collins, excuse me, please wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=926.562s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=927.882s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=930.844s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=938.317s">resolution</a>  stated that it go to governance committee to discuss COLA raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=945.503s">So</a>  now it's that, so in essence, this is saying that the city council shouldn't be voting for their own raises and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=954.871s">I'm</a>  confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=955.471s">I'm</a>  just.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=958.093s">Well,</a>  what I can say is that state law controls here no matter what, but I will go to councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=964.559s">You've</a>  amended your resolution.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=967.261s">Yeah,</a>  thanks to reply. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=968.262s">So</a>  what it what this always was even from the beginning was to disallow any future city council from voting to increase their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=979.518s">And</a>  then in addition, I had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=983.953s">put</a>  on the agenda to discuss whether the future would have a color adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=989.415s">But,</a>  you know, as I was discussing them with this with some of my volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=994.016s">Somebody</a>  brought up the point that that really doesn't belong in an ordinance, it's not in the other cities ordinances, that would simply be up to city counselors to bring that up as something if they feel like bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1005.24s">So</a>  the important meat and potatoes of this was always what I have here, which is making it no longer legal for city councilors to increase their own salaries, but simply to vote to increase the salary of a future city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1018.891s">That's</a>  always what this was about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1020.572s">And</a>  I simply removed the part that really shouldn't be part of an ordinance, but would be at the discretion of city councilors in the future.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1027.617s">if</a>  I can, because I received numerous calls, as you can imagine, because the way it read really alarmed a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1036.16s">This</a>  has been a very trying week, both on the national level and also in the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1043.001s">And</a>  part of the discussions and making sure that the residents know is that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1049.059s">you</a>  know, after such a close vote and half of the community split over the override and so much contention still left in the community to divide the fact that we had elected officials, especially the mayor dancing in celebration that half of the community is going to be in pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1066.153s">Um,</a>  to add this, the next day was so, you know, for the next meeting was very, very touching. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1072.458s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1073.607s">I</a>  just I don't know where this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1075.188s">We</a>  have our own ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1076.388s">We</a>  have our own rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1078.029s">It</a>  seems like the way I read it is someone maybe talked to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1082.351s">Your</a>  friends might have talked to you and told you don't do this the day after an override vote because <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1088.84s">this</a>  community needs a lot to heal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1091.222s">And</a>  in the process that we went through and the questions we had with the original raise, I don't even understand why this is on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1097.987s">I</a>  would imagine you should rule it out of order, Mr President, just for the fact that, as you already stated, these are things that we've already had in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1105.213s">And</a>  again, as as the senior member of this council and understanding <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1110.777s">you</a>  know historically why people join this council in the past is really being part of the community and looking at this position as a full-time position should never be looked at a full-time not Medford maybe in a major city but in the city of Medford to even look at a salary adjustment in any way to move forward I think it's totally disingenuine especially the week that we had last week so I would um <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1135.208s">My</a>  I will know anyway, but I would hope that this would be ruled out of order and disperse because this doesn't say anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1144.017s">It</a>  said something early that really riled the whole community up and then looking for a cola when we have we have departments that haven't gotten a raise in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.008s">We</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1155.996s">We</a>  have city departments that go three years without raises or colds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1160.938s">So</a>  that was something that just to let you know, this is what I'm saying this out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1164.979s">So</a>  the people that are watching because they were very interested in what was being said tonight that to <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1171.966s">to</a>  review this isn't, hopefully this isn't asking for any sort of Kohler adjustment like other communities or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1180.59s">Until</a>  we take care of our own here, I think that we should stay away from this completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1184.892s">Stay</a>  away from any money paper when it's talking about funding this council a penny more after fiscal crisis and what we went through on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1192.976s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1194.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1195.498s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1195.718s">And</a>  I would just note again, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1199.355s">The</a>  existing law for the school committee is Chapter 71 Section 52, which means we have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1205.139s">And</a>  the existing law for the city is the Mass General Law Acts of 2002 Chapter 447, which I think was an attempt to in 2003 to try to get this to be more of a something that happens as <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1223.252s">part</a>  of the course of other folks, specifically that says that the mayor and the council salaries would increase the same amount as the director of budgets, finance director, director of community development, city clerk, city treasurer, city solicitor, chief assessor, the average percentage for those offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1243.563s">So</a>  those are the current laws that apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1245.004s">Any</a>  further discussion from members of the council before I go back to Councilor Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1250.287s">Seeing</a>  none, I'll go to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1254.482s">I'm</a>  sorry, I have to comment here because I am really. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1258.985s">I</a>  brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1262.767s">I'm</a>  supposed to speak to the chair, because I literally was trying to appeal to I think the people who are here because of misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1274.373s">I</a>  brought this up because I wanted to make sure that the city council could never again vote for their own raises that is what this was always about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1283.109s">It</a>  did absolutely not suggest that we have coal increases every year or anything of the kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1290.792s">If</a>  you read the original that I wrote, and look, I can understand if some people read it very quickly and did not understand what that said, but the only thing that it mandated is that no future city council could ever vote to increase their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1311.055s">So</a>  I will say that I am feeling surprised that I am trying to bring forward things that I believe the people who are here would genuinely want to be passed, genuinely. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1325.441s">And</a>  yet somehow, the part that said like, hey, maybe it should be like, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1335.111s">on</a>  an agenda to consider, which does not mean that it should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1339.134s">Like,</a>  that is the thing people focused on instead of focusing on the only actual thing that it did, which is to make sure no city council could ever vote for their own raises, and I'm surprised that Councilor Scarpelli wants a future city council to vote for their own raises to be able to raise their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1355.967s">This</a>  is the only thing that it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1357.808s">So,</a>  I'm... <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1361.711s">I</a>  am surprised and I hope that people will read what is actually being proposed instead of making assumptions based on who is putting something forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1372.616s">What</a>  does it say? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1379.979s">That's</a>  what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1380.44s">I</a>  mean, read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1381.48s">It</a>  says no city council, no change in the salary</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1389.821s">So</a>  first of all, that has been removed and that's like... I think the problem is that we didn't need to have this discussion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1398.939s">That's</a>  the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1399.84s">I</a>  mean, I just think this is a waste of everyone's time to be completely honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1403.623s">There's</a>  a law in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1404.644s">And</a>  in fact, the city council and the mayor, like what the law is, is that when other people's salaries go up, the senior management of the city, the council and the mayor salary would also go up by that same average percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1415.532s">That's</a>  the current law on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1417.274s">That's</a>  what happened in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1418.875s">So</a>  I think there's misrepresentation on all sides of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1421.737s">And</a>  I think that's just my perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1425.7s">And</a>  I apologize for <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1427.901s">just</a>  giving my opinion from the chair without recognizing anybody else, but I just didn't like, really don't think this is a productive conversation on any front, because everybody seems pretty confused and frustrated on all sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1443.915s">There</a>  was a motion to refer it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1445.397s">It</a>  was seconded, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1451.102s">Give</a>  me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1451.843s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1456.058s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Callahan bringing this forward with the intention of following your genuine hopes to put forward something that would <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1473.288s">What</a>  the original suggestion here was, was that council would vote for a cola increase, which is a cost of living increase for a future if they wanted to for a future city council not for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1487.676s">It</a>  wouldn't take effect until the next two years, if it if it ever did. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1491.838s">That</a>  is what she intended, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1494.079s">That's</a>  my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1495.66s">Meaning</a>  you could never and that is true for some other cities, but it's part of their charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1501.703s">So</a>  this this wouldn't be something that we can put in as an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1505.505s">My</a>  understanding is you would have to do it as a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1507.146s">So</a>  that's why it would be referred to governance, we could talk about it in the governance committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1510.247s">That's</a>  where we talk about charter changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1512.956s">I</a>  don't think we need to discuss it in a regular meeting, we could talk about it in governance, and I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1519.022s">I</a>  also think that voting publicly for cost of living increases for ourselves that people can witness and if they can, if they are upset about that and I think a 2% increase for a body that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1533.078s">makes</a>  currently $29,000 a year, 30,000 maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1536.9s">If</a>  you want to vote us out because of that increase, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1539.361s">That's</a>  your right as voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1540.842s">And</a>  I think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1541.763s">And</a>  we're doing it transparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1543.003s">We've</a>  decided to do it and you can vote us out if you don't like that we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1547.306s">Because</a>  that's a democratic choice that you can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1550.267s">All</a>  of that being said, I think it's bad faith to see what was written and <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1560.58s">argue</a>  that Councilor Callahan was trying to say, we will like across the board, give ourselves insane increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1570.626s">And</a>  that that is what this discussion is about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1572.647s">I</a>  don't think that's what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1573.708s">I</a>  think we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1575.149s">I</a>  know that, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1577.07s">And</a>  I, if we haven't, if we don't have a second on moving us to governance, then I would second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1581.953s">Well,</a>  I think that we should move it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1584.675s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1585.455s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Leming, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1589.201s">I'd</a>  also like to point out that people are confused about this because an organization that Councilor Scarpelli is in the leadership, I've sent people out an email saying that this was what was written in the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1598.951s">So</a>  if you send an email.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1600.413s">I'm</a>  just gonna let him finish and you can go.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1602.255s">Why</a>  would you say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1603.877s">I'm</a>  not part of any group, I'm a member of many groups, but to say that you use my name in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1611.303s">I</a>  can use the best metrics in so many different ways that this person did, and just embarrass my community.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1617.044s">Well,</a>  I think we just did a very good thing for our community, but...</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1619.0s">I</a>  mean, you can't send an email out saying that this is what it's about.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1624.966s">I</a>  didn't send anything out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1626.007s">So</a>  don't use my name.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1627.587s">Let's</a>  not get back and forth, guys.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1629.347s">Use</a>  my name.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1630.028s">I</a>  hear you, but let's not go for it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1631.448s">It's</a>  a meeting, tell them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1634.689s">We</a>  went through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1635.769s">You're</a>  causing confusion and saying there's confusion in the community.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1638.049s">You</a>  did publicly represent the organization, so... <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1641.007s">People</a>  talk about me and our revolution from this council floor all the time, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1646.929s">Do</a>  what, George? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1653.771s">Okay,</a>  people are just saying what they want to say, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1655.731s">You</a>  say a lot of stuff all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1657.072s">I'll</a>  let you talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1660.733s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1661.653s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1672.116s">The</a>  comments that have been said around this oval that we're talking about, these are conversations I've had with people that have reached out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1680.644s">And</a>  what was said, what was written in the original may be changed after someone woke up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1685.948s">But</a>  whereas the Medford School Committee recently went 24 years without a cost of living adjustment, COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1692.834s">So</a>  now this starts to think, well, what does it say? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1695.897s">They're</a>  looking for COLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1696.958s">These</a>  are the questions they asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1698.792s">be</a>  it resolved that the governance committee take up the ordinance to disallow the city council from passing salary change to affected city officials, and to encourage the city council to consider regular color adjustments for elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1710.816s">That's</a>  exactly what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1713.056s">I</a>  didn't say it wasn't for next year, but what I'm saying is the phone calls I received and the understanding that I'm trying to explain to my people, and if those people are my people, the ones that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1725.72s">that</a>  the 60,000 that live in this community, those are those people that had those questions after a very contentious election cycle on Tuesday night, and then put this forward the way it was written. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1738.304s">You</a>  could spin it any way you want today, but that's how it was written, and that's why there were questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1744.042s">So</a>  any organization to put on email that spun anything anyway, take it for what it's worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1750.127s">Because</a>  this councilor over and over again, whenever I brought anything forward, have backed it up with video or specific instances that all of you have witnessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1762.496s">So</a>  these are makeup things that have been going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1766.039s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1767.14s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1769.902s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1772.487s">I</a>  hope that people can discuss what is on here with the removal of that second half of the thing because this is the only thing that is being proposed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1784.777s">All</a>  right, there's a motion to refer to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1788.04s">Is</a>  there a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1791.102s">All</a>  right, then we any further discussion by members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1797.153s">Members</a>  of the public, three minutes, same address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1800.634s">We'll</a>  alternate between Zoom and in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1809.758s">You</a>  can go.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1810.078s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1813.737s">You</a>  can go.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1814.838s">Steve</a>  South 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1816.639s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1818.36s">So</a>  I just wanted to tell you, Mr. Chairman, Councilor Callahan, and whoever else was behind this, the level of disrespect towards...</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1826.0s">I</a>  wasn't behind this, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1828.367s">Well,</a>  it's your organization, like Mr. Leming said, your organization is putting this forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1833.611s">There's</a>  no organization behind this.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1834.952s">So</a>  our revolution, one week after the... Why don't you let me finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1838.834s">You</a>  gave me three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1839.795s">I</a>  just, you can't lie.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1840.595s">So</a>  our revolution puts forth this proposal one week after the election, where almost half the electorate voted down seven and eight, question seven and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1853.12s">You</a>  can yawn all you want, and you and your little dancing monkey at your after event, okay?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1858.962s">Mr.</a>  South, if you're gonna be disrespectful, we're not gonna continue here.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1862.624s">No,</a>  I can say whatever I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1863.784s">Maybe</a>  you don't understand the freedom of speech.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1865.405s">Mr.</a>  South, if you're gonna be disrespectful.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1866.886s">So</a>  I'm gonna continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1868.286s">So</a>  all the while while Councilor Callahan and our revolution are looking for raises for elected officials that already got you voted to raises for yourselves this year, the city council got to the school committee got one big one this year and one big one next year, the mayor got three raises this year because she's on the school committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1891.55s">a</a>  city official, she got three raises in the first item, the very first item you bring up after the election where you and your organization said there was going to be huge pain and huge cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1904.898s">If</a>  these overrides didn't go through, you bring up raises for yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1909.341s">Now</a>  Councilor Callahan, her first draft, which I just saw her second one a minute ago, talked about regular COLAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1916.983s">Even</a>  the second draft talks about wage increases and other increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1922.125s">Now</a>  I want to bring up some facts for you guys because you love talking about misinformation and disinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1928.467s">The</a>  City of Medford DPW superintendents <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1932.128s">building</a>  inspectors and recreation department haven't had a raise in three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1936.953s">Currently,</a>  we're in fact finding which is part of mediation, and the city is demanding huge concessions of the $7200 per person, and is also looking to cut their fuel allowance you can yarn all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1951.967s">The</a>  police do not have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1954.71s">The</a>  police superiors do not have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1957.453s">The</a>  dispatchers don't have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1960.096s">So</a>  the level of disrespect, let alone the dancing at your little after party, but putting forth a discussion about raises for yourselves right after the election, where you were asking for huge <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1973.11s">tax</a>  increases for the homeowners which five of the 7 you don't own homes is disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1980.715s">You</a>  should be ashamed of yourself, Mr Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1983.597s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1990.626s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South as you know the city council does not negotiate union contracts, and this was proposed by one counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1998.131s">I</a>  don't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1999.932s">I</a>  don't think it was something that we should be bringing up right now but we can continue to say whatever we want for political purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2009.278s">I</a>  don't know what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2010.599s">I</a>  don't know what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2015.282s">There's</a>  no overseers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2016.283s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2017.143s">Well,</a>  you can believe, sir, please stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2021.53s">You're</a>  an embarrassment, Mr. South. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2028.153s">Get</a>  out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2031.695s">You</a>  should leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2033.396s">Mr.</a>  Self, on the motion to recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2038.239s">No,</a>  I don't, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2040.48s">If</a>  you can't handle, you need to work a little better at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2044.762s">And</a>  you maybe need to go to a little anger management. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2047.844s">You're</a>  disgusting.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2437.015s">That's</a>  right, there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2438.544s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2441.325s">All</a>  right, here's what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2443.045s">A</a>  couple of years ago, the city council got in, about the same time as it works with our election schedule, school committee got in. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2451.407s">All</a>  right, that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2453.908s">And</a>  then the city council, this body, passed a rule, law ordinance, can't think of the right word at the minute, that said they're gonna get a raise in school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2463.991s">And</a>  a lot of people were very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2467.321s">that</a>  raise took effect more or less immediately, or maybe at the end of the fiscal year or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2474.285s">This</a>  rule that Councilor Callahan is proposing would have prevented that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2480.248s">People</a>  who thought that was bad, corrupt, obnoxious, annoying, whatever word they want to use, would have gotten some respite from that because it would have prevented that raise going into effect until the election would have intervened. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2495.896s">That's</a>  all this proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2498.317s">I</a>  understand there's ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2499.898s">I</a>  don't understand the way all of the exact rules go together, but I think that Councilor Callahan makes a good point that maybe that was a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2507.503s">Should</a>  have been against the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2508.864s">It</a>  was a process issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2510.345s">Wasn't</a>  about individual personalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2512.586s">This</a>  person hates this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2514.067s">This</a>  one thinks this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2515.468s">No,</a>  it's just about, no, for good government perspective, we're not doing it this way no more. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2520.451s">Whether</a>  that goes to the ordinance charter statute, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2524.52s">It</a>  could be a council rule even, just the chair will not entertain kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2529.423s">Lots</a>  of ways you could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2530.444s">I</a>  think it's a good thing to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2532.245s">It</a>  would have, I think, brought some sanity and a little bit of calvity to the discussion that happened at the beginning of this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2540.571s">And</a>  it would have made it a less urgent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2544.934s">It</a>  could have made things calmer, more normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2548.096s">And</a>  it would have had this benefit at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2551.348s">a</a>  good government measure to prevent anybody being seen to correctly give a raise to somebody who was just elected at the premise of a salary that had been published before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2564.499s">That's</a>  all this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2566.021s">It</a>  makes a lot of sense to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2568.703s">If</a>  this isn't the right venue, I'm sure that that could come out and the council could act appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2577.381s">But</a>  that's all this is, it just would have prevented that going through would have deleted 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2582.665s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I think I've said enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2585.267s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2587.528s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2588.509s">We'll</a>  go to the podium name and address the record please you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2593.453s">Nick</a>  Jorleo 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2596.315s">Before</a>  I criticize this resolution I'll just say, I'm sorry, President bears you had to go through that that was very inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2603.325s">We</a>  probably disagree on a lot of things but nobody deserves to be treated like that so I guess</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2607.0s">It</a>  is what it is</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2608.0s">we</a>  have to have civil discussions</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2609.0s">I'm</a>  behind the podium and I'm going to restart your three minutes because you're nice to me.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2612.347s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2612.827s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2617.148s">So</a>  now for the criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2620.209s">There's</a>  mentioned in this resolution here of cost of living, a cost of living increase.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2629.178s">Let's</a>  just let him, let's just go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2630.579s">And</a>  the initial one that mentioned it, the counselor has edited it to remove it.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2634.563s">I</a>  have revised it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2638.687s">This</a>  is the revised version.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2640.97s">Okay,</a>  well I wasn't aware.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2641.931s">It's</a>  not there, it is gone.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2643.853s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2643.973s">Totally,</a>  totally gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2644.533s">Great,</a>  so that makes it.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2645.314s">This</a>  is all the branches, and this is what I'm trying to do.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2651.761s">not</a>  attacking you, the version of the resolution that I had in front of me said that, so I didn't know that that was taken out.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2657.368s">We're</a>  going back to three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2658.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2660.032s">In</a>  any case... I should be nicer to you more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2668.944s">We</a>  can have civil discussions in the city council, we really can, even though we disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2672.787s">But</a>  I'll speak about just in general then the cost of living issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2676.811s">You</a>  know, our city, these overrides, this is what it was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2679.233s">I</a>  mean, this is what was raised as a problem, cost of living crisis across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2683.556s">I</a>  mean, we saw in the national election here that cost of living crisis really impacted voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2689.221s">It</a>  really made a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2690.082s">It</a>  led to a very unexpected outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2691.563s">So</a>  it's something that can't be, in any context, when we're talking about raises, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2695.746s">something</a>  that can be disregarded here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2698.168s">And</a>  we have to take, you know, what people are experiencing, what people are feeling, what people are suffering through into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2706.256s">I</a>  mean, we can't be forgetting, as Bernie Sanders himself said, the working class people. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2712.602s">I</a>  mean, we have to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2714.083s">We</a>  have to think about the impact of our fiscal decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2716.806s">So</a>  that's just my general comments tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2718.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2720.709s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2725.953s">School</a>  Committee member Bramley, you will have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2728.195s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2729.916s">Nicole</a>  Bramley, 54 North Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2732.619s">I</a>  am a current member of the Meffitt School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2735.021s">And</a>  when I saw this, I was a little surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2738.023s">So</a>  I'm happy that it's been revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2739.384s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2739.785s">I</a>  think it going to committee to be talked about further is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2744.709s">But</a>  I would just like to have some of these things kept in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2749.983s">I</a>  did ask Mr. South if he wanted me to go first, maybe I should have went first. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2755.626s">I</a>  just wanted to remind everybody that as I took office in January, our salary was $12,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2764.03s">We</a>  received a $5,000 raise come July 1st, and we'll receive another $5,000 raise next July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2767.211s">So</a>  our salary will go from 12,000 to 22,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2779.241s">that</a>  is our part-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2781.626s">It</a>  is not lost on me as an elected official here in this city that we are considered part-time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2787.918s">right,</a>  but we are, you know, asked to be at everybody's beck and call 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2794.539s">And</a>  that's not lost on me, especially being on this side of the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2801.021s">I've</a>  stood here for years talking, but you do have a different perspective when you cross the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2808.602s">People</a>  reach out to you on a Sunday, like many of you may be talking about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2813.243s">motion,</a>  this resolution, like Councilor Scarpelli, I too have received a lot of calls and people inquiring about this, this resolution and, you know, people expect you to be there when when they send the email they expect you to be there on a Sunday if if they don't like what they see when they when they read the, you know, the paperwork for the meetings so that's not lost on me that we are part time employees, but <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2840.823s">You</a>  know, people do want you to show up all the time and I and I can respect that because I expected it when I was here, demanding change. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2848.845s">So,</a>  I think, going into committee, I don't know if I'm at three minutes but I'm being really nice so just keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2855.367s">So</a>  just want to also remind people that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2862.95s">There</a>  are a lot of unions in the city, as Councilor Scarpelli said, that don't have raises, that are fighting, I think, close to three years for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2874.373s">The</a>  fire department went three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2875.954s">Other</a>  unions in the city that don't have raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2879.495s">I</a>  sit in those executive sessions where we talk about contracts regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2883.596s">It</a>  is not fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2885.777s">Budget</a>  season is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2891.095s">It's</a>  really horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2893.417s">I</a>  lost a lot of sleep and I don't feel comfortable that we would get any more raises or anything else put forward for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2901.724s">So</a>  just to keep in mind that, you know, if the line of COLA or anything else that gets put forward for an elected official matches, no more then. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2915.222s">what</a>  other unions in the city would get. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2917.183s">I</a>  don't think that we need anything more, but I think that if unions are getting 2% or 1%, that we should not get anything more than that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2928.808s">So</a>  I just wanna make sure that that is brought up and talked about and kept in mind for your future meetings.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2935.171s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2935.872s">Thank</a>  you guys.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2940.666s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Lori]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2943.028s">Lori,</a>  55 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2944.91s">I</a>  just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2947.111s">I</a>  think that this proposal, was this corrected one distributed? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2953.977s">Because</a>  most people saw the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2956.339s">That's</a>  why all your confusion, because you didn't send out your correction until today. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2964.586s">Sounds</a>  a little convenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2967.168s">My</a>  question is about, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2969.895s">your</a>  salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2971.876s">These</a>  positions, I've grown up in this city and I've watched the council meetings for years, and you're a little disrespectful with your 30 minute call people are in the middle of their thought process, and you just like two seconds left, and <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=2991.233s">It</a>  like, maybe that's your tactic, I don't know, but I've never heard in all the school city council meetings that I've watched or been to, was there a time limit for a resident to speak on an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3008.201s">I</a>  think that's a bit disrespectful in itself to the citizens of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3015.544s">And</a>  as far as your salary goes, these jobs were never salaried positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3022.587s">As</a>  you mentioned, they're part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3024.648s">Well,</a>  back in the day, I'd like to get Pinter or Mallorca or one of those guys up here and find out what they were getting paid is their stipend, because that's what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3035.632s">You</a>  were serving the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3039.164s">It</a>  was your desire to serve the city and you got a stipend for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3044.927s">It</a>  wasn't meant for a full-time position or a salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3052.37s">I</a>  don't understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3054.351s">And</a>  the fact that it was such a close margin on the vote yes or no on six, seven and eight was so close. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3066.789s">I</a>  think it was very disrespectful to bring this up as an agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3071.176s">It</a>  was like sticking it in our eye that we just got a 10% tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3078.035s">And</a>  for me personally, that's $560 a year, not $47 as everybody was trying to spout it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3088.898s">You</a>  are killing the senior population in this city and then have the nerve to bring up raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3098.421s">Most</a>  people haven't had a COLA raise in the last at least four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3104.182s">And</a>  even prior to COVID, the average raise was a 2% raise, if you were lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3111.844s">My</a>  company was trying to do bonuses in lieu of raises, which wouldn't go into our retirement fund at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3122.006s">So</a>  I think it's very disrespectful of all of you to bully the citizens in this city over some of these issues.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3131.468s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3137.557s">name</a>  and address for the record you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Moretti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3145.245s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3146.566s">Nadine</a>  already burgered out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3149.229s">I</a>  was home watching this meeting, and as you saw my hand was raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3153.871s">What</a>  prompted me to come down was what was erupting in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3158.157s">And,</a>  you know, I just I actually watched the meeting because of that resolution and I said I can't believe that something like this is on this I'm probably just reiterating what everybody before me has said. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3168.447s">We</a>  voted no on six, seven and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3170.449s">Okay,</a>  I'm sure you don't find that surprising. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3172.271s">So</a>  we're very upset to see that seven and eight past, but my when I look at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3178.658s">I</a>  don't want to think of people that all you can think about is what you make and what you don't make. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3183.363s">I've</a>  been coming to city council meetings for years, and I just don't think that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3190.031s">the</a>  atmosphere in here is healthy for the city, you, you, we know you who you represent, and it is not me it's not many people that I'm friends with, or hang out with or whatever, but it's still not, it's very disheartening to see what I saw that prompted me to get in my car, leave my dinner mind you to come here to speak, you know I said, you know, take my name off the thing but it didn't come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3213.837s">I</a>  think that this is insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3215.218s">I</a>  don't think that worrying about even if you guys are still going to be on here in the future years what you might or might not make you already got raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3223.203s">you</a>  just put a huge increase for most of the city who did not want this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3229.144s">And</a>  that should be really what's in the back of your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3231.285s">You're</a>  still not working for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3234.086s">And</a>  it's so disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3237.306s">But</a>  to see what's erupting and who's yelling and who's calling names, and I would never think this should come from behind the bench or whatever it is behind here, especially the lead or the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3250.1s">You</a>  should table it or put it away for now, because it's a moot point. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3254.143s">You</a>  do not need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3256.124s">You</a>  need to help the residents that did not want the raises, who will be struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3260.587s">Somebody</a>  just told you what it's going to raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3262.388s">It's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3264.329s">You</a>  have to sit back and think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3266.55s">It's</a>  really not about you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3269.032s">You're</a>  representing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3270.793s">I</a>  only voted for one of you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3272.634s">I'm</a>  not afraid to admit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3274.867s">And</a>  I'm sorry, you know, and for good reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3278.03s">You</a>  have one person working for people like me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3280.852s">And</a>  I just, it's disheartening to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3284.795s">So</a>  I really hope you guys rethink this and you just get rid of it altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3287.918s">I</a>  don't know what the rules are, but there's no need for it.</p>

    <p>[Gareau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3323.601s">Cool,</a>  just projection towards my iPad. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3325.562s">52</a>  Lambert Street, apartment number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3331.195s">First</a>  of all, President Bears, I'm aware that you're saying that the ordinance itself isn't needed given state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3340.68s">However,</a>  I did see the All Medford email that Councilor Scarpelli is a board member of.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3351.166s">Thankfully,</a>  I actually was able to... Councilor Scarpelli has just noted that he is not a board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3356.869s">...organization</a>  that I follow.</p>

    <p>[Gareau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3363.101s">Okay,</a>  he says he's not a board member noted I saw that in a prior Facebook post apologies counselor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3371.769s">However,</a>  Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3375.274s">I</a>  actually do like this ordinance in terms of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3379.756s">I</a>  do think it's actually excellent that you're at least thinking of the fact of trying to make sure councils do not raise funds for themselves in a sitting session. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3393.42s">I</a>  think it's a brilliant idea to make sure it follows for things that may not impact you yourself in a future session. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3403.379s">I</a>  was able to, because of the clerk portal, actually look up the original ordinance that you had proposed, not the amended one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3414.527s">I</a>  know you're saying the amended one is not needed, or has the cost of living removed, but it's, I think, important to note, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3426.445s">If</a>  that was to happen in the future, one of my, my comments that I was wanting to make was, it would be nice to put the cost of living separately as an ordinance or budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3436.372s">Just</a>  so additional transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3440.134s">But</a>  again, it's great having the portal available. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3444.138s">President</a>  Baird, Councilor Levin, you both know that if I have questions about any financials, I tend to harass you guys pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3452.725s">And</a>  you're always really quick to respond and I greatly appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3456.989s">I</a>  also appreciate the fact that you were very open in terms of and not artificially inflating <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3467.357s">how</a>  much was trying to be raised by the city, because I do believe that added to some of the contention in the past several months with amount of fear mongering. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3479.726s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3481.348s">Have</a>  a great night.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3483.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3484.19s">We'll</a>  go to the podium name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3486.571s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3489.568s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3490.469s">Gaston</a>  Fiore, 61 Stickney Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3492.691s">Just</a>  a few comments specifically about what Councilor Callaghan proposed, the latest one, and then some other general comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3501.019s">So</a>  regarding the latest, the one that got just handed out right before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3506.984s">So</a>  I would add to, for example, the examples that are provided with Everett and Watertown, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3513.123s">Not</a>  only that, whatever gets approved applies to the council that comes after the following election. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3520.786s">But,</a>  um, I would like to remind everyone that, you know, as least is here the mayor the city council and the school committee, you work for us, you work for the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3531.289s">and</a>  we pay your salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3533.31s">And</a>  as such, I think it would be nice to add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3536.953s">So</a>  if you vote for any races, since it will apply after the following election, put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3543.957s">And</a>  ask the taxpayers, do you actually vote yes or no for this salary increase? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3550.281s">Since</a>  you work for us, we pay your salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3553.083s">So</a>  that's what I would add. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3556.358s">Second,</a>  just a few general comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3560.079s">I</a>  think this was mentioned before as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3564.9s">Most</a>  of the problems with this happens because we forget that, again, so people in the city council or school committee are supposed to do this as a service to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3575.963s">And</a>  I commend you all for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3578.984s">And</a>  as such, you're supposed to get a stipend, not a salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3585.166s">And</a>  I think that would be a lot easier if we kept a limited government that just took care of administering the city and do, in the case of the City Council, just legislative work. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3599.439s">And</a>  I would like to provide, lastly, the example of what I love in this regard, which is the legislature of New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3608.456s">I</a>  don't know how many people know this, but in the legislature of New Hampshire, in both chambers, so all state representatives, that's the state representatives, it would be the equivalent of Representative Donato for us, and the state senators, their salary is $200 per term. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3627.542s">That</a>  means $100 per year plus daily commute cost covering. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3636.917s">$100</a>  per year plus daily community expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3641.342s">So</a>  I think that's the example that we should follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3645.807s">Thank</a>  you very much for listening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3647.369s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McGill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3648.01s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3655.538s">Harry</a>  McGill repeat my road method, so I'm pretty sure we beat the ordinance thing to death but I will say that it was, it was very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3663.381s">I</a>  was going to send a message to Councilor lemming to get some clarification because we've been going back and forth and he's been helpful clarifying things but I said I'll just go to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3675.666s">I</a>  don't think any municipal bargaining unit in the city has ever got a legitimate COLA raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3683.571s">They've</a>  all been, for the last probably 15 to 20 years, 2% or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3689.314s">We</a>  don't see the threes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3690.435s">We</a>  don't see fours or unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3693.057s">So</a>  when you say the word COLA, that's going to get people's attention, because the cost of living is probably over 4% or 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3708.055s">Again,</a>  as far as the overrides went, yeah, it was a close vote, a lot closer than I actually thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3716.623s">So</a>  I think a lot of people should pay attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3718.865s">I</a>  think you're all gonna have your hands full with citizens calling to get their streets replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3723.709s">Because</a>  as a guy that's been working police details for over 20 years, watching how we do it, I'm just not seeing that you're gonna get the curb to curb street replacements for that, for what was, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3734.978s">uh,</a>  published in that, in that, um, question. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3738.34s">And</a>  finally, because no one else really knows, no one talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3742.322s">Your</a>  police department, both, both associations have going on two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3747.304s">We're</a>  going to be three years without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3749.545s">It's</a>  going to probably be settled in arbitration. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3752.227s">When</a>  it gets settled in arbitration, it will be expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3755.508s">So</a>  when we come before you with the settlement, you're going to be funding an expired contract and we'll be right back at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3763.527s">We're</a>  not going public. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3764.909s">We're</a>  not making a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3766.731s">We're</a>  kind of in the background. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3768.173s">And</a>  you know what we're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3769.114s">We're</a>  doing our jobs and we're doing them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3772.218s">I</a>  have to say, I'm seeing this from a different level now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3776.343s">I</a>  was president of the patrolman's union for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3779.246s">I'm</a>  the vice president of the supervisor's union now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3782.717s">And</a>  those police officers on the street right now are dealing with much, much more than we were dealing with five, 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3791.443s">They</a>  have a tough job, a very tough job. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3794.285s">They</a>  came to work during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3796.587s">They</a>  never complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3798.148s">They</a>  did their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3799.149s">We</a>  had police officers having to be put up in hotels during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3803.012s">There's</a>  no COVID money on the table for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3806.034s">And</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3806.975s">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3808.116s">We</a>  just come to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3809.136s">We</a>  do our jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3810.859s">They</a>  need to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3812.54s">Those</a>  officers that are out in the street need to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3814.801s">They're</a>  taking firearms off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3817.202s">They're</a>  doing a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3818.602s">And</a>  I don't know if the public knows how good a job they're doing, because no one talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3824.385s">All</a>  I've been hearing for the last two years, teachers are going to get a big pay raise because we had an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3829.787s">Good</a>  for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3831.148s">The</a>  police department, the fire department, and the DPW are just as important to the operations of this city as the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3838.271s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3839.351s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3843.663s">Name</a>  and address for the record, you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3848.765s">Thank</a>  you, Council President Andrew Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, Cushman Street, East Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3854.006s">I</a>  walked in here a little bit late. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3855.667s">Please</a>  excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3857.067s">And</a>  there's a lot of yelling and screaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3859.128s">It</a>  was like a hornet's nest. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3860.889s">What</a>  the heck happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3862.749s">I'm</a>  sorry for the lack of civil order or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3867.891s">However,</a>  it seems to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3871.641s">It's</a>  something to do with salaries for the City Council, am I right?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3877.908s">I</a>  believe the proposal as it stands is that the City Council could not increase its own salary or the salary of any other elected official until, if an increase were to go into effect, it would go into effect after the next election.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3892.742s">Basically,</a>  I have two simple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3896.064s">One</a>  is, what is the Medford City Council, what is your salary or stipends all totaled per year?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3902.707s">The</a>  current compensation is, I believe $30,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3905.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.088s">30,000</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.289s">400,</a>  I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3906.629s">And</a>  other stipends or other funds, US dollars come into your?</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3920.47s">into</a>  your hands also besides that no really well not from the city of medford for this job you don't get stipends for papers and pencils i thought you did no no oh thank you for confirming that yeah uh my second question is uh with all your brains and all your computers can you tell me where method ranks out of the 351 <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3947.489s">communities</a>  in Massachusetts, as far as your salary, what is the rank, Boston's 110, Buck 25, they got a raise I think last year, but what do you rank at 30,400? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3962.019s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3963.119s">Does</a>  any, with all your computers and all your brains and college education, no one can tell me that answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3967.462s">Does</a>  any other council have any answer?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3972.406s">I</a>  don't think that information is immediately available.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3975.157s">Oh</a>  my god, I'm, I guess I'm living in a twilight zone myself.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3979.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3979.719s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3987.302s">Had</a>  a conversation about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3990.283s">Believe</a>  we have a motion to refer this to the Governance Committee by Councilor Callahan as amended and seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=3999.647s">Any</a>  further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4002.268s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4006.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4012.074s">I</a>  brought this up and I apologize for having anything about COLA in it at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4020.155s">I</a>  wish that it had been this second version, which almost no one talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4027.477s">I</a>  brought this up knowing that it would not be friendly <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4036.892s">to</a>  many of my fellow city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4041.613s">I</a>  brought it up because I believe that it is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4045.074s">I</a>  believe that city councilors, as is true in many states, and as is true in some other cities in Massachusetts, city councilors should not be able to raise their own salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4056.637s">That</a>  is why I brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4059.778s">I</a>  brought it up despite knowing that other city councilors here <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4065.865s">who</a>  voted yes, when I voted no against those raises earlier this year, that those other city councilors might have their feelings hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4073.947s">They</a>  might feel that this was not friendly to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4082.169s">I</a>  felt a little ballsy and I felt that I was doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4096.405s">I</a>  still feel that I'm doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4097.806s">And</a>  I don't mind being ballsy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4100.407s">I'm</a>  just a little bit sad that I am attacked not for what is actually what I am, this, what I am proposing today, which I believe if it had been put forward by councilor, that every person in this room who spoke out against it would be speaking out in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4122.1s">Now,</a>  maybe I am wrong, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4126.158s">Wow,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4127.578s">I</a>  should not have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4128.539s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4129.399s">I</a>  don't want to put words in anyone's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4131.379s">I</a>  am very sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4132.399s">I'm</a>  sorry, go ahead, continue.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4136.34s">I</a>  genuinely was trying to do what I believed and continue to believe is the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4143.422s">And</a>  I do hope that things like this can be read <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4156.665s">and</a>  spoken about with some attempt at understanding that it is a good faith effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4165.631s">And</a>  literally what is written here and what I am trying to do is to make it not possible for the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4176.417s">to</a>  raise salaries of any sitting elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4181.199s">I</a>  believe that is what I personally believe in, and I will stand by it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4188.322s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4189.143s">And</a>  I'm just going to go real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4191.244s">I</a>  think there's two things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4192.184s">I</a>  think there are the facts and the substance of the matter right now, the way it works by state law and charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4201.522s">is</a>  that the school committee compensation is set by a vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4206.425s">The</a>  city council controls the amount and the timing for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4210.907s">For</a>  the mayor and the city council, the city council, that is actually set by an average of the, let me read it exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4223.477s">The</a>  salaries may be increased at the recommendation of the Mayor and the approval of the City Council if the salaries of each of the following officers of the City of Medford are increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4231.725s">Director</a>  of Budgets and Personnel, Finance Director Auditor, Director of Community Development, City Clerk, City Treasurer, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4238.894s">collector</a>  city solicitor and the chief assessor appraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4242.235s">Any</a>  salary increase for the office of mayor and the members of the city council should not increase exceed the average percentage by which the salaries for the aforesaid officers is increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4250.398s">The</a>  city council does not have the power to set its own salary at whatever it amount tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4255.94s">There</a>  are restrictions right now on what the city council can do in terms of the salaries of the mayor and the city council and it's that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4264.173s">If</a>  the mayor puts it forward and the council approves, they can go up by the average of essentially the main management of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4271.277s">That's</a>  the current law. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4273.358s">Councilor</a>  Kellyanne, I believe's intent, and I think to be honest, it was not a particularly clear resolution to make the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4281.728s">It</a>  references other city charters, but talks about an ordinance, it references COLA, but I believe the intent was to move away from what I just read, which is that the city council and mayor salary can increase by the average of essentially city managing staff, to that the city council's salary could not increase in the term in which the city council voted, current city council is sitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4303.481s">I</a>  think that's a substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4306.923s">I</a>  think on the optics and the discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4312.659s">people</a>  aren't going to go into the substance all the time and discuss the good faith substance that someone may be proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4319.003s">We've</a>  had a lot of contentious conversations about compensation that we can call it salaries or stipends or whatever else we wanna call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4327.488s">This</a>  council has had it for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4329.81s">There</a>  were discussions in the 2000s and the 2010s and the 1990s about compensation for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4336.654s">The</a>  city council in 2016, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4338.915s">or</a>  sorry 2013 completely changed the way the city council is compensated because it used to be based on what Andy was talking about pencils and supplies and travel and all of these kind of nebulous things. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4352.229s">So</a>  there's been a lot of there's a lot of legislative history on the compensation elected officials in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4357.076s">And</a>  I think what people are expressing, and I think those people maybe are both folks behind the other side of the rail who are saying, I don't like that we're talking about raising elected officials' compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4369.607s">And</a>  to be quite frankly, I think what you were saying, Councilor Callahan, about some of us who felt that since school committee hadn't changed since 2000 and the city council since 2016, that following the laws as are laid out to adjust that compensation was a fair thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4384.62s">but</a>  we also didn't want to be having this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4387.221s">At</a>  least I think so by the looks on everybody's faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4389.522s">I</a>  think George doesn't want to be having it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4391.763s">And</a>  I can't see Justin right now, but I bet he doesn't want to either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4394.484s">So</a>  the substance, it's a fair discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4400.307s">How</a>  do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4401.147s">How</a>  do elected official salaries get changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4405.048s">It's</a>  a state law and a charter issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4407.429s">We're</a>  going to have discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4408.57s">I</a>  think the charter study committee actually has some recommendations around that, that we'll be discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4414.872s">But</a>  then there's also what happened last week, what happened this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4419.214s">And</a>  I think we all acknowledge there's some people in the room who are happy question six didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4424.956s">There's</a>  some people in the room who are happy question seven and eight did pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4428.678s">Nobody's</a>  happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4430.589s">There's</a>  a mixed result. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4432.09s">We</a>  don't even have to get into other elections that happened last Tuesday that I'm sure a lot of people have a lot of feelings about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4437.174s">But</a>  I think that's more what the question is here than the substance of, and some people may well be happy about, as I see as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4448.122s">But</a>  I think it's just like, is this the conversation we'll be having today? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4451.004s">And</a>  I think a lot of us feel the answer is no, but beyond that, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4458.763s">We'll</a>  go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4460.344s">We'll</a>  just do a couple more minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4462.604s">Go</a>  ahead, Harry, let me turn on the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4465.805s">You</a>  got three minutes.</p>

    <p>[McGill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4466.466s">Harry,</a>  before Piedmont Road mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4469.047s">So</a>  now I get what the resolution is trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4473.048s">I</a>  understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4474.308s">And</a>  I'm not saying it's a bad idea or it's a good idea, but I understand the concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4480.711s">What</a>  I hope the folks on this side of the reel can understand <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4485.37s">that</a>  the folks on this side, what we see is we have to sometimes wait two, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4493.597s">We</a>  have to go to mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4494.958s">We</a>  have to go to arbitration. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4496.86s">We</a>  would love to have an 18-month mechanism built into pay raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4503.625s">We</a>  would love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4504.326s">And</a>  we would love to get actual cost of living increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4508.55s">But</a>  we understand <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4510.313s">As</a>  union officials, we understand the budgetary constraints, the city is under we've we've traditionally settled for way less than than than cola raises and I've been negotiating a long time I outside of probably Bobby Jones from the fight apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4527.166s">I</a>  don't think anybody in the city has been negotiating with the city is as long as I have and and <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4534.684s">You</a>  know, we had good days, we had bad days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4537.025s">I</a>  will say that probably the Burke administration was probably the best at getting union contracts settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4542.668s">That's</a>  just a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4544.429s">This</a>  administration, I have to say, is probably the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4549.631s">That's</a>  not me being critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4551.032s">That's</a>  not me name-calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4552.173s">That's</a>  a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4553.893s">Negotiations,</a>  for whatever reason, aren't negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4557.81s">They're</a>  just a waste of everyone's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4560.172s">And</a>  let's get to mediation and arbitration and mediation turns out to be a waste of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4564.616s">So</a>  we're going to have to sit in front of an arbitrator. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4567.018s">And</a>  that's what we never like to go to arbitration. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4570.861s">We</a>  always like to have a settled contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4573.223s">And</a>  we always say when both sides walk away angry, then that's a good contract because they got something, we got something. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4580.899s">We're</a>  angry, they're angry, that's a good settlement. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4583.301s">That's</a>  usually the rule of thumb. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4584.902s">We're</a>  not even having that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4586.643s">So</a>  again, we're not an angry mob. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=4592.008s">I</a>  saw that resolution and I was like, whoa, what is that?

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5557.484s">So</a>  when it's red, it's good? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5559.105s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5559.245s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5561.566s">I</a>  just wanted a clarification on whether all of this <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5569.369s">Subjects</a>  are actually subjected to chapter 30B procurement procedures, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5578.459s">And</a>  if so, then again, just to review my understanding, it means that, for example, for the last item, so the window restoration, so the $322,500 <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5592.76s">That</a>  is like, so is the bidding happening after this or it has already been, the bidding has already been done, a competitive open bidding process? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5605.025s">I</a>  have trouble understanding every time that this happens, what's subjected to chapter 30B. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5610.356s">procurement</a>  procedures, what's not, and how can the taxpayer make sure that there's a competitive open bidding process for any of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5619.365s">Because</a>  I see like 322,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5620.846s">Well,</a>  clearly, it's not going to be 322,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5622.588s">It's</a>  going to be like 318,419.32. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5632.758s">if,</a>  you know, someone could provide some clarification, I know maybe not today, but I should have asked for this earlier, but so, so, so, you know, we can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5642.564s">So,</a>  but it calls my attention to that, for example, for engine truck, engine three truck pump replacement, that one says 51,643.24. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5649.828s">So</a>  I'm not sure why, you know, why some of them looked like, you know, they got a bill and like the truck, like the fudge,</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5661.215s">I</a>  would have to go back and double check the recording, but I believe they bid out for the engine three truck pump and it came in at a higher cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5668.841s">So</a>  this is covering a difference in a bidded amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5673.044s">The</a>  cemetery swill removal, I think will go to bid and is based on an estimate or a quote or multiple quotes, but would still go to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5679.488s">The</a>  grant matches based on the grant and I, I'd have to double check 30 be, but I think because the grant match it's not subject to fitting right anything over 10,000 except there's some certain exceptions legal legal services, and a couple other things aren't subject to 30 be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5694.885s">And</a>  then the third, the fourth one though, it is something that's already the windows, I believe the windows is definitely Yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5700.95s">And</a>  but I believe this is based. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5703.091s">Mr.</a>  Ricky said that he had an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5705.393s">And</a>  that's how he determined this cost and then it would go out to bid through the 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5708.255s">Okay,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5709.276s">And</a>  just for the general public because I think you think you mentioned person for clarification so for the matching, I think what. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5715.885s">I'm</a>  sorry, the staff member from the CD last time the finance person explained that so forth for the match. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5722.994s">They</a>  have to appropriate like the maximum for the match and then if it turns out that it's less than yes it gets returned.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5730.883s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5731.905s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5740.162s">No,</a>  I just wanted to clarify that in our correspondence that I had with Paul Raihee, he said that he did select the contractor already that will be doing this work, the same company that did historic renovations for Faneuil Hall in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5755.932s">So</a>  I don't know the name of that company specifically, but I had a back and forth with him about with him and some members of the CPA about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5764.257s">So</a>  that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5765.828s">already</a>  is selected as my okay so he did that already Yeah, okay.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5769.709s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5770.169s">I</a>  didn't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5776.89s">Right,</a>  if they're, what is that I can't remember what that's called. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5781.071s">It's</a>  the state bid list. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5781.891s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5785.191s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5786.151s">All</a>  right, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli seconded by Vice President Collins to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5791.172s">Mr</a>  please call.</p>

    <p>[Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5829.668s">My</a>  name is Ellen Epstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5830.909s">I</a>  live at 15 Grove Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5833.05s">And</a>  I'm just really distressed about what happened earlier in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5838.993s">And</a>  I'm wondering if there's any kind of more exacting <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5850.492s">guidelines</a>  or rules that could be established so that no one on this council is ever disrespected in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5859.519s">No</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5859.979s">I</a>  think there's a lot of us in this city that really don't feel like anyone here deserves that kind of disrespect, no matter what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5876.975s">It</a>  just feels a little out of control to me as a resident of the city and someone who's been watching city council meetings for a while.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5886.358s">I</a>  think there is only so much we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5892.86s">Most</a>  of the time, most people are respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5896.041s">I</a>  think we've made some strides even in the last few months from some <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5901.081s">less</a>  than respectful interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5903.462s">To</a>  be quite frank, I think this was a situation where somebody needs to check themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5912.064s">I</a>  don't know what else to say about that, but you know, we had an individual who has persistently and consistently not felt that he feels the need to respect this chair, particularly me, in a very personal way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5927.548s">So</a>  other than replacing me, if anyone wants the job, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5932.067s">I</a>  don't know that that'll solve this problem, but we have had, we've tried to institute some decorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5938.951s">I</a>  was able to, you know, now with the new system to shut off the microphone at the three minute mark, but I understand your distress. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5947.476s">I</a>  share in your distress. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5948.337s">I'm</a>  sure you could tell that I was frustrated and felt the need to combat it maybe in a way that I should have breathed through a little more, but yeah, sometimes some people, <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5961.124s">want</a>  to come here to make a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5962.885s">And</a>  given that we are an open forum, it's difficult to manage sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5969.491s">Just</a>  some kind of statement about civil discourse at the beginning of the meeting and respect for all opinions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5978.157s">I</a>  think we could consider that for sure.</p>
