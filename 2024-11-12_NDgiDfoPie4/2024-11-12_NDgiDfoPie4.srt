[SPEAKER_01]: Test one two.

[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion of Councilor Callahan to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Collins Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, 70 affirmative negative the motion passes.

9
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:21,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Refer to committee for further discussion just a reminder that the intent of this section is for us to refer items to committee for further discussion, no final action will be taken on these items during this meeting.

10
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:27,125
[SPEAKER_20]: 24491 resolution to discuss compensation ordinance for elected officials.

11
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:35,727
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like there's an amended version resolution to discuss ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials by councilor Callahan.

12
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:41,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Whereas only the city council can change the salaries of Medford elected officials, mayor, city council and school committee.

13
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:49,510
[SPEAKER_20]: And whereas there's no way for elected officials to adjust elected official salaries for inflation or general cost of living increases without the city council voting to change elected official salaries.

14
00:12:50,211 --> 00:13:12,635
[SPEAKER_20]: And whereas there is a personal incentive for city counselors to increase their own salaries, whereas the city council increasing salaries that are increasing salaries of others is viewed as in form of impropriety and be it resolved that this governance committee take up an ordinance to disallow the city council from passing any salary changes that affect sitting elected officials and to encourage city council to consider Cola adjustments for elected officials in the next cycle.

15
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:31,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I would just note before turning this over for a brief, I hope, discussion or introduction by the proponent before the motion to refer to committee that I don't think an ordinance would affect this at all we already have three charter and state laws that affect this so as a plan a charter chapter 4317 a.

16
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,159
[SPEAKER_20]: already applies to the city.

17
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Chapter 71, section 52 governs how school committees are compensated.

18
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:48,283
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the acts of 2002 chapter 447 is a Medford specific law that would supersede any ordinance passed by the city.

19
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,764
[SPEAKER_20]: So the way to go at this is with charter amendment, not with an ordinance.

20
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,045
[SPEAKER_20]: But with that, I will go to Councillor Callahan.

21
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

22
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:10,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I would note that I forgot to remove that last half of the sentence so at the bottom of full text and description before the potential language.

23
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:22,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It should also remove and to encourage the city council to regularly to consider regular cola adjustments that whole half should be removed, because I removed all of that, that that would be my revised.

24
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:33,046
[SPEAKER_06]: As I stated in January at the meeting, I believe that, I know that this is the law in a number of states.

25
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It is also the law in some other cities in Massachusetts.

26
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:48,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially what it says is that you can vote to change the salaries, but they can't take effect until after the next election.

27
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is essentially what I'm proposing be discussed in the governance committee.

28
00:14:54,023 --> 00:15:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably makes sense if, like, if we vote this to the Governance Committee, when the Governance Committee takes it up, for the very first thing be to send it to legal to see whether it could even be passed by an ordinance, or we could do that from here.

29
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:14,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it can't be passed by an ordinance, and it can only be passed by a charter change, then obviously there's no point in us discussing it.

30
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy if that's the first step.

31
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:26,482
[SPEAKER_20]: We're on the motion of Councilor Callahan to refer to governance committee seconded by Councilor Collins, excuse me, please wait.

32
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:26,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

33
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion by members of the council.

34
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:31,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli.

35
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:44,042
[SPEAKER_10]: resolution stated that it go to governance committee to discuss COLA raises.

36
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:53,389
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it's that, so in essence, this is saying that the city council shouldn't be voting for their own raises and that's it.

37
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm confused.

38
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:55,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just.

39
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:04,459
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what I can say is that state law controls here no matter what, but I will go to councilor Callahan.

40
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,900
[SPEAKER_20]: You've amended your resolution.

41
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks to reply.

42
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:17,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So what it what this always was even from the beginning was to disallow any future city council from voting to increase their own salaries.

43
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:21,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in addition, I had it.

44
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:29,175
[SPEAKER_06]: put on the agenda to discuss whether the future would have a color adjustment.

45
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:32,856
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, as I was discussing them with this with some of my volunteers.

46
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:44,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody brought up the point that that really doesn't belong in an ordinance, it's not in the other cities ordinances, that would simply be up to city counselors to bring that up as something if they feel like bringing it up.

47
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:58,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So the important meat and potatoes of this was always what I have here, which is making it no longer legal for city councilors to increase their own salaries, but simply to vote to increase the salary of a future city council.

48
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,012
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always what this was about.

49
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And I simply removed the part that really shouldn't be part of an ordinance, but would be at the discretion of city councilors in the future.

50
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:15,679
[SPEAKER_10]: if I can, because I received numerous calls, as you can imagine, because the way it read really alarmed a lot of people.

51
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,361
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been a very trying week, both on the national level and also in the local level.

52
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And part of the discussions and making sure that the residents know is that

53
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, after such a close vote and half of the community split over the override and so much contention still left in the community to divide the fact that we had elected officials, especially the mayor dancing in celebration that half of the community is going to be in pain.

54
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:51,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, to add this, the next day was so, you know, for the next meeting was very, very touching.

55
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:52,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

56
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I just I don't know where this is.

57
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,268
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our own ordinance.

58
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:57,289
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our own rules.

59
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:01,911
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like the way I read it is someone maybe talked to you.

60
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:07,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Your friends might have talked to you and told you don't do this the day after an override vote because

61
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,661
[SPEAKER_10]: this community needs a lot to heal.

62
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:17,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the process that we went through and the questions we had with the original raise, I don't even understand why this is on there.

63
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:24,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I would imagine you should rule it out of order, Mr President, just for the fact that, as you already stated, these are things that we've already had in place.

64
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:30,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, as as the senior member of this council and understanding

65
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:54,322
[SPEAKER_10]: you know historically why people join this council in the past is really being part of the community and looking at this position as a full-time position should never be looked at a full-time not Medford maybe in a major city but in the city of Medford to even look at a salary adjustment in any way to move forward I think it's totally disingenuine especially the week that we had last week so I would um

66
00:18:55,208 --> 00:19:02,295
[SPEAKER_10]: My I will know anyway, but I would hope that this would be ruled out of order and disperse because this doesn't say anything.

67
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:14,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It said something early that really riled the whole community up and then looking for a cola when we have we have departments that haven't gotten a raise in years.

68
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:15,369
[SPEAKER_10]: We have

69
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:20,537
[SPEAKER_10]: We have city departments that go three years without raises or colds.

70
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:24,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was something that just to let you know, this is what I'm saying this out loud.

71
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:30,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people that are watching because they were very interested in what was being said tonight that to

72
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: to review this isn't, hopefully this isn't asking for any sort of Kohler adjustment like other communities or anything like that.

73
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Until we take care of our own here, I think that we should stay away from this completely.

74
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:52,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay away from any money paper when it's talking about funding this council a penny more after fiscal crisis and what we went through on Tuesday.

75
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Mr. President.

76
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:55,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

77
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:55,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

78
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:56,918
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would just note again,

79
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:04,519
[SPEAKER_20]: The existing law for the school committee is Chapter 71 Section 52, which means we have to do that.

80
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:21,951
[SPEAKER_20]: And the existing law for the city is the Mass General Law Acts of 2002 Chapter 447, which I think was an attempt to in 2003 to try to get this to be more of a something that happens as

81
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:43,543
[SPEAKER_20]: part of the course of other folks, specifically that says that the mayor and the council salaries would increase the same amount as the director of budgets, finance director, director of community development, city clerk, city treasurer, city solicitor, chief assessor, the average percentage for those offices.

82
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:44,984
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are the current laws that apply.

83
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:49,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion from members of the council before I go back to Councilor Callahan?

84
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none, I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

85
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:58,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I have to comment here because I am really.

86
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought this up.

87
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:13,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm supposed to speak to the chair, because I literally was trying to appeal to I think the people who are here because of misinformation.

88
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:22,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought this up because I wanted to make sure that the city council could never again vote for their own raises that is what this was always about.

89
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:30,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It did absolutely not suggest that we have coal increases every year or anything of the kind.

90
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:49,561
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read the original that I wrote, and look, I can understand if some people read it very quickly and did not understand what that said, but the only thing that it mandated is that no future city council could ever vote to increase their own salaries.

91
00:21:51,055 --> 00:22:01,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will say that I am feeling surprised that I am trying to bring forward things that I believe the people who are here would genuinely want to be passed, genuinely.

92
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:14,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet somehow, the part that said like, hey, maybe it should be like,

93
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:19,114
[SPEAKER_06]: on an agenda to consider, which does not mean that it should happen.

94
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:35,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that is the thing people focused on instead of focusing on the only actual thing that it did, which is to make sure no city council could ever vote for their own raises, and I'm surprised that Councilor Scarpelli wants a future city council to vote for their own raises to be able to raise their own salaries.

95
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,788
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the only thing that it does.

96
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:38,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm...

97
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:52,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I am surprised and I hope that people will read what is actually being proposed instead of making assumptions based on who is putting something forward.

98
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:59,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it say?

99
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says.

100
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, read it.

101
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It says no city council, no change in the salary

102
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:17,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So first of all, that has been removed and that's like... I think the problem is that we didn't need to have this discussion right now.

103
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,740
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the issue.

104
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,642
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I just think this is a waste of everyone's time to be completely honest.

105
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:24,564
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a law in place.

106
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:35,512
[SPEAKER_20]: And in fact, the city council and the mayor, like what the law is, is that when other people's salaries go up, the senior management of the city, the council and the mayor salary would also go up by that same average percentage.

107
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,753
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the current law on the books.

108
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:38,314
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what happened in June.

109
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,377
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think there's misrepresentation on all sides of what happened.

110
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,979
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's just my perspective.

111
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,661
[SPEAKER_20]: And I apologize for

112
00:23:47,901 --> 00:24:00,452
[SPEAKER_20]: just giving my opinion from the chair without recognizing anybody else, but I just didn't like, really don't think this is a productive conversation on any front, because everybody seems pretty confused and frustrated on all sides.

113
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,377
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a motion to refer it to committee.

114
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:08,319
[SPEAKER_20]: It was seconded, Councilor Zaro.

115
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:11,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me one second.

116
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:14,325
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

117
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:32,058
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate Councillor Callahan bringing this forward with the intention of following your genuine hopes to put forward something that would

118
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:47,156
[SPEAKER_12]: What the original suggestion here was, was that council would vote for a cola increase, which is a cost of living increase for a future if they wanted to for a future city council not for themselves.

119
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:51,298
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't take effect until the next two years, if it if it ever did.

120
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,019
[SPEAKER_12]: That is what she intended, I believe.

121
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:54,920
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my understanding.

122
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning you could never and that is true for some other cities, but it's part of their charters.

123
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:04,945
[SPEAKER_12]: So this this wouldn't be something that we can put in as an ordinance.

124
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,126
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is you would have to do it as a charter.

125
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:10,227
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why it would be referred to governance, we could talk about it in the governance committee.

126
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,568
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where we talk about charter changes.

127
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:17,120
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we need to discuss it in a regular meeting, we could talk about it in governance, and I think that's fine.

128
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:32,377
[SPEAKER_12]: I also think that voting publicly for cost of living increases for ourselves that people can witness and if they can, if they are upset about that and I think a 2% increase for a body that

129
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:36,160
[SPEAKER_12]: makes currently $29,000 a year, 30,000 maybe.

130
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,341
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to vote us out because of that increase, that's fine.

131
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,382
[SPEAKER_12]: That's your right as voters.

132
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:41,623
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's fair.

133
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:42,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing it transparently.

134
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:46,465
[SPEAKER_12]: We've decided to do it and you can vote us out if you don't like that we did it.

135
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's a democratic choice that you can make.

136
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:57,331
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that being said, I think it's bad faith to see what was written and

137
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:09,866
[SPEAKER_12]: argue that Councilor Callahan was trying to say, we will like across the board, give ourselves insane increases.

138
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And that that is what this discussion is about tonight.

139
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:13,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that's what's happening.

140
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:14,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we know that.

141
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:16,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that, I understand that.

142
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,353
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, if we haven't, if we don't have a second on moving us to governance, then I would second it.

143
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think that we should move it.

144
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:24,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

145
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,297
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Lemming, then Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lemming.

146
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:38,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also like to point out that people are confused about this because an organization that Councilor Scarpelli is in the leadership, I've sent people out an email saying that this was what was written in the ordinance.

147
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you send an email.

148
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:42,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just gonna let him finish and you can go.

149
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:42,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you say that?

150
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:50,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not part of any group, I'm a member of many groups, but to say that you use my name in that?

151
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:56,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I can use the best metrics in so many different ways that this person did, and just embarrass my community.

152
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:04,946
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I think we just did a very good thing for our community, but... I mean, you can't send an email out saying that this is what it's about.

153
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:05,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't send anything out.

154
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:07,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't use my name.

155
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:09,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not get back and forth, guys.

156
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:09,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Use my name.

157
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,408
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear you, but let's not go for it.

158
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:14,649
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a meeting, tell them.

159
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:15,609
[SPEAKER_20]: We went through the chair.

160
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,029
[SPEAKER_20]: You're causing confusion and saying there's confusion in the community.

161
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,610
[SPEAKER_20]: You didn't publicly represent the organization, so...

162
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:25,168
[SPEAKER_20]: People talk about me and our revolution from this council floor all the time, George.

163
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Do what, George?

164
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:35,671
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, people are just saying what they want to say, George.

165
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,052
[SPEAKER_20]: You say a lot of stuff all the time.

166
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:37,612
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll let you talk.

167
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

168
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:48,975
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

169
00:27:52,116 --> 00:28:00,083
[SPEAKER_10]: The comments that have been said around this oval that we're talking about, these are conversations I've had with people that have reached out to me.

170
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:05,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was said, what was written in the original may be changed after someone woke up.

171
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:12,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But where is the Memphis School Committee recently went 24 years without a cost of living adjustment, COLA.

172
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So now this starts to think, well, what does it say?

173
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:16,918
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking for COLA.

174
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,079
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the questions they asked.

175
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:30,456
[SPEAKER_10]: be it resolved that the governance committee take up the ordinance to disallow the city council from passing salary change to affected city officials, and to encourage the city council to consider regular color adjustments for elected officials.

176
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,056
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly what it says.

177
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:45,200
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say it wasn't for next year, but what I'm saying is the phone calls I received and the understanding that I'm trying to explain to my people, and if those people are my people, the ones that

178
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:57,083
[SPEAKER_10]: that the 60,000 that live in this community, those are those people that had those questions after a very contentious election cycle on Tuesday night, and then put this forward the way it was written.

179
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:02,925
[SPEAKER_10]: You could spin it any way you want today, but that's how it was written, and that's why there were questions.

180
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:09,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So any organization to put on email that spun anything anyway, take it for what it's worth.

181
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:21,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this councilor over and over again, whenever I brought anything forward, have backed it up with video or specific instances that all of you have witnessed.

182
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are makeup things that have been going on here.

183
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

184
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,221
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

185
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:30,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan.

186
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that people can discuss what is on here with the removal of that second half of the thing because this is the only thing that is being proposed.

187
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:48,020
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, there's a motion to refer to committee.

188
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a second.

189
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:53,645
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, then we any further discussion by members of the council.

190
00:29:57,153 --> 00:30:00,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Members of the public, three minutes, same address for the record, please.

191
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:04,276
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll alternate between Zoom and in person.

192
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:10,038
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go.

193
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:13,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chairman, can you hear me?

194
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,117
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go.

195
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:16,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve South 106 Damon Road.

196
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:17,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

197
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:26,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to tell you, Mr. Chairman, Councilor Callahan, and whoever else was behind this, the level of disrespect towards... 

197
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasn't behind this, so thank you.

198
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:33,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's your organization, like Mr. Leming said, your organization is putting this forward.

199
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:34,832
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no organization behind this.

200
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:38,794
[SPEAKER_07]: So our revolution, one week after the... Why don't you let me finish?

201
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:39,695
[SPEAKER_07]: You gave me three minutes.

202
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:40,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, you can't lie.

203
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:53,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So our revolution puts forth this proposal one week after the election, where almost half the electorate voted down seven and eight, question seven and eight.

204
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You can yawn all you want, and you and your little dancing monkey at your after event, okay?

205
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:02,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. South, if you're gonna be disrespectful, we're not gonna continue here.

206
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:03,724
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can say whatever I want.

207
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you don't understand the freedom of speech.

208
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,865
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. South, if you're gonna be disrespectful.

209
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna continue.

210
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:29,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the while while Councilor Callahan and our revolution are looking for raises for elected officials that already got you voted to raises for yourselves this year, the city council got to the school committee got one big one this year and one big one next year, the mayor got three raises this year because she's on the school committee and

211
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:44,418
[SPEAKER_07]: a city official, she got three raises in the first item, the very first item you bring up after the election where you and your organization said there was going to be huge pain and huge cuts.

212
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:48,961
[SPEAKER_07]: If these overrides didn't go through, you bring up raises for yourselves.

213
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:56,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Councilor Callahan, her first draft, which I just saw her second one a minute ago, talked about regular COLAs.

214
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:01,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the second draft talks about wage increases and other increases.

215
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:08,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I want to bring up some facts for you guys because you love talking about misinformation and disinformation.

216
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,448
[SPEAKER_07]: The City of Medford DPW superintendents

217
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:16,372
[SPEAKER_07]: building inspectors and recreation department haven't had a raise in three years.

218
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:31,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, we're in fact finding which is part of mediation, and the city is demanding huge concessions of the $7200 per person, and is also looking to cut their fuel allowance you can yarn all you want.

219
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:34,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The police do not have a contract.

220
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,413
[SPEAKER_07]: The police superiors do not have a contract.

221
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,716
[SPEAKER_07]: The dispatchers don't have a contract.

222
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:51,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So the level of disrespect, let alone the dancing at your little after party, but putting forth a discussion about raises for yourselves right after the election, where you were asking for huge

223
00:32:53,110 --> 00:33:00,355
[SPEAKER_07]: tax increases for the homeowners which five of the 7 you don't own homes is disrespectful.

224
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,417
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr Chairman.

225
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:03,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

226
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:17,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. South as you know the city council does not negotiate union contracts, and this was proposed by one counselor.

227
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:18,911
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't support it.

228
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:25,796
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it was something that we should be bringing up right now but we can continue to say whatever we want for political purposes.

229
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:30,179
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what that means.

230
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,319
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what that means.

231
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,222
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no overseers.

232
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:36,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

233
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:39,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you can believe, sir, please stop.

234
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,051
[SPEAKER_20]: You're an embarrassment, Mr. South.

235
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:48,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of here.

236
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:52,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You should leave.

237
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:56,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Self, on the motion to recess.

238
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,779
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I don't, I don't.

239
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,642
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can't handle, you need to work a little better at that.

240
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,563
[SPEAKER_20]: And you maybe need to go to a little anger management.

241
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:08,464
[SPEAKER_20]: You're disgusting.

242
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,456
[SPEAKER_20]: The emotions are running a little high.

243
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:19,800
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go to the podium, name and address the record.

244
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,404
[SPEAKER_20]: And Nadine, if you're here in person, I'm guessing your hand's not up here on Zoom.

245
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:27,406
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, you're good.

246
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:28,868
[SPEAKER_20]: It just would have been your turn.

247
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:32,571
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, name and address the record.

248
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:33,252
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

249
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,216
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, there you go.

250
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,865
[SPEAKER_18]: William Navar, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

251
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,025
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, here's what this is about.

252
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:51,387
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of years ago, the city council got in, about the same time as it works with our election schedule, school committee got in.

253
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,088
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, that's what happened.

254
00:40:53,908 --> 00:41:03,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the city council, this body, passed a rule, law ordinance, can't think of the right word at the minute, that said they're gonna get a raise in school committee.

255
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of people were very upset.

256
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:12,684
[SPEAKER_18]: that raise took effect more or less immediately, or maybe at the end of the fiscal year or something.

257
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:20,048
[SPEAKER_18]: This rule that Councilor Callahan is proposing would have prevented that, Mr. President.

258
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:34,296
[SPEAKER_18]: People who thought that was bad, corrupt, obnoxious, annoying, whatever word they want to use, would have gotten some respite from that because it would have prevented that raise going into effect until the election would have intervened.

259
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:37,437
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all this proposal is.

260
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:39,658
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand there's ordinance.

261
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:47,083
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand the way all of the exact rules go together, but I think that Councilor Callahan makes a good point that maybe that was a mistake.

262
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:48,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Should have been against the rules.

263
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:50,005
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a process issue.

264
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't about individual personalities.

265
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:54,047
[SPEAKER_18]: This person hates this one.

266
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,168
[SPEAKER_18]: This one thinks this.

267
00:41:55,468 --> 00:42:00,071
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's just about, no, for good government perspective, we're not doing it this way no more.

268
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Whether that goes to the ordinance charter statute,

269
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,043
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be a council rule even, just the chair will not entertain kind of thing.

270
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:10,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots of ways you could do it.

271
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a good thing to discuss.

272
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:20,111
[SPEAKER_18]: It would have, I think, brought some sanity and a little bit of calvity to the discussion that happened at the beginning of this term.

273
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,453
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would have made it a less urgent issue.

274
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:27,095
[SPEAKER_18]: It could have made things calmer, more normal.

275
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,918
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would have had this benefit at that time.

276
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:44,479
[SPEAKER_18]: a good government measure to prevent anybody being seen to correctly give a raise to somebody who was just elected at the premise of a salary that had been published before the election.

277
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:45,981
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all this is.

278
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,722
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes a lot of sense to me, Mr. President.

279
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:55,209
[SPEAKER_18]: If this isn't the right venue, I'm sure that that could come out and the council could act appropriately.

280
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:02,205
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's all this is, it just would have prevented that going through would have deleted 30 seconds.

281
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:05,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think I've said enough.

282
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:07,268
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.

283
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:07,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

284
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:10,931
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go to the podium name and address the record please you have three minutes.

285
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Jorleo 40 Robinson Road.

286
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:22,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I criticize this resolution I'll just say, I'm sorry, President bears you had to go through that that was very inappropriate.

287
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:27,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably disagree on a lot of things but nobody deserves to be treated like that so I guess 

287
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
[SPEAKER_20]: It is what it is

287
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to have civil discussions 

287
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,187
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm behind the podium and I'm going to restart your three minutes because you're nice to me.

288
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:32,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

289
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:33,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

290
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So now for the criticism.

291
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mentioned in this resolution here of cost of living, a cost of living increase.

292
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:50,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's just let him, let's just go through.

293
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:54,543
[SPEAKER_20]: And the initial one that mentioned it, the counselor has edited it to remove it.

294
00:43:54,563 --> 00:43:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I have revised it.

295
00:43:58,687 --> 00:43:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the revised version.

296
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well I wasn't aware.

297
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not there, it is gone.

298
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:03,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

299
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:04,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally gone.

300
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:05,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, so that makes it.

301
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:09,058
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all the branches, and this is what I'm trying to do.

302
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: not attacking you, the version of the resolution that I had in front of me said that, so I didn't know that that was taken out.

303
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:18,630
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going back to three minutes.

304
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

305
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:25,799
[SPEAKER_02]: In any case... I should be nicer to you more often.

306
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:32,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have civil discussions in the city council, we really can, even though we disagree.

307
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:36,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll speak about just in general then the cost of living issue.

308
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:39,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, our city, these overrides, this is what it was all about.

309
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:43,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is what was raised as a problem, cost of living crisis across the country.

310
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we saw in the national election here that cost of living crisis really impacted voters.

311
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:50,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It really made a difference.

312
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It led to a very unexpected outcome.

313
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that can't be, in any context, when we're talking about raises,

314
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:57,388
[SPEAKER_02]: something that can be disregarded here.

315
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:04,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to take, you know, what people are experiencing, what people are feeling, what people are suffering through into consideration.

316
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:12,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can't be forgetting, as Bernie Sanders himself said, the working class people.

317
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:14,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have to think about that.

318
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to think about the impact of our fiscal decisions.

319
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:18,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just my general comments tonight.

320
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

321
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:21,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

322
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:28,175
[SPEAKER_20]: School Committee member Bramley, you will have three minutes.

323
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:29,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

324
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:30,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Nicole Bramley, 54 North Circle.

325
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:35,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a current member of the Meffitt School Committee.

326
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:37,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I saw this, I was a little surprised.

327
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:39,264
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm happy that it's been revised.

328
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:39,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

329
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:44,068
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it going to committee to be talked about further is a good idea.

330
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,091
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would just like to have some of these things kept in mind.

331
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:53,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I did ask Mr. South if he wanted me to go first, maybe I should have went first.

332
00:45:55,626 --> 00:46:03,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to remind everybody that as I took office in January, our salary was $12,000.

333
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We received a $5,000 raise come July 1st, and we'll receive another $5,000 raise next July 1st.

334
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:08,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So our salary will go from 12,000 to 22,000.

335
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:20,584
[SPEAKER_14]: that is our part-time position.

336
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:26,997
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not lost on me as an elected official here in this city that we are considered part-time employees.

337
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:34,419
[SPEAKER_14]: right, but we are, you know, asked to be at everybody's beck and call 24-7.

338
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:40,941
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not lost on me, especially being on this side of the podium.

339
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:47,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I've stood here for years talking, but you do have a different perspective when you cross the rail.

340
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:52,303
[SPEAKER_14]: People reach out to you on a Sunday, like many of you may be talking about this,

341
00:46:53,243 --> 00:47:19,902
[SPEAKER_14]: motion, this resolution, like Councilor Scarpelli, I too have received a lot of calls and people inquiring about this, this resolution and, you know, people expect you to be there when when they send the email they expect you to be there on a Sunday if if they don't like what they see when they when they read the, you know, the paperwork for the meetings so that's not lost on me that we are part time employees, but

342
00:47:20,823 --> 00:47:28,225
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, people do want you to show up all the time and I and I can respect that because I expected it when I was here, demanding change.

343
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:35,347
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think, going into committee, I don't know if I'm at three minutes but I'm being really nice so just keep that in mind.

344
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:36,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So just want to also remind people that

345
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:53,653
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a lot of unions in the city, as Councilor Scarpelli said, that don't have raises, that are fighting, I think, close to three years for the police department.

346
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:55,594
[SPEAKER_14]: The fire department went three years.

347
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:57,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Other unions in the city that don't have raises.

348
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:03,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I sit in those executive sessions where we talk about contracts regularly.

349
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:05,517
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not fun.

350
00:48:05,777 --> 00:48:07,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Budget season is horrible.

351
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:11,976
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really horrible.

352
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:21,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost a lot of sleep and I don't feel comfortable that we would get any more raises or anything else put forward for us.

353
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:34,094
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to keep in mind that, you know, if the line of COLA or anything else that gets put forward for an elected official matches, no more then.

354
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:37,143
[SPEAKER_14]: what other unions in the city would get.

355
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:48,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that we need anything more, but I think that if unions are getting 2% or 1%, that we should not get anything more than that either.

356
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:54,831
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanna make sure that that is brought up and talked about and kept in mind for your future meetings.

357
00:48:55,171 --> 00:48:55,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

358
00:48:55,872 --> 00:48:56,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys.

359
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

360
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:04,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Lori, 55 Garfield Avenue.

361
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a few questions.

362
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:13,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this proposal, was this corrected one distributed?

363
00:49:13,977 --> 00:49:15,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people saw the other one.

364
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:22,164
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why all your confusion, because you didn't send out your correction until today.

365
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds a little convenient.

366
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:28,810
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is about,

367
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:31,115
[SPEAKER_00]: your salaries.

368
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:49,861
[SPEAKER_00]: These positions, I've grown up in this city and I've watched the council meetings for years, and you're a little disrespectful with your 30 minute call people are in the middle of their thought process, and you just like two seconds left, and

369
00:49:51,233 --> 00:50:05,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It like, maybe that's your tactic, I don't know, but I've never heard in all the school city council meetings that I've watched or been to, was there a time limit for a resident to speak on an issue?

370
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:13,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a bit disrespectful in itself to the citizens of the city.

371
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:21,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as your salary goes, these jobs were never salaried positions.

372
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,208
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, they're part-time.

373
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:35,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, back in the day, I'd like to get Pinter or Mallorca or one of those guys up here and find out what they were getting paid is their stipend, because that's what it was.

374
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,473
[SPEAKER_00]: You were serving the city.

375
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:44,486
[SPEAKER_00]: It was your desire to serve the city and you got a stipend for that.

376
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:49,529
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't meant for a full-time position or a salary.

377
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand that.

378
00:50:54,351 --> 00:51:05,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that it was such a close margin on the vote yes or no on six, seven and eight was so close.

379
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:10,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was very disrespectful to bring this up as an agenda item.

380
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:15,223
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like sticking it in our eye that we just got a 10% tax increase.

381
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:28,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, that's $560 a year, not $47 as everybody was trying to spout it to be.

382
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:37,440
[SPEAKER_00]: You are killing the senior population in this city and then have the nerve to bring up raises.

383
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:43,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people haven't had a COLA raise in the last at least four years.

384
00:51:44,182 --> 00:51:50,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And even prior to COVID, the average raise was a 2% raise, if you were lucky.

385
00:51:51,844 --> 00:52:00,525
[SPEAKER_00]: My company was trying to do bonuses in lieu of raises, which wouldn't go into our retirement fund at all.

386
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:10,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very disrespectful of all of you to bully the citizens in this city over some of these issues.

387
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:12,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your time.

388
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:19,119
[SPEAKER_20]: name and address for the record you have three minutes.

389
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:23,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you put it on or do I. You're good.

390
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:24,965
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a new system.

391
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:26,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

392
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:28,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Nadine already burgered out.

393
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I was home watching this meeting, and as you saw my hand was raised.

394
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:37,096
[SPEAKER_16]: What prompted me to come down was what was erupting in here.

395
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:47,030
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I just I actually watched the meeting because of that resolution and I said I can't believe that something like this is on this I'm probably just reiterating what everybody before me has said.

396
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:50,229
[SPEAKER_16]: We voted no on six, seven and eight.

397
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:52,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'm sure you don't find that surprising.

398
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:58,177
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're very upset to see that seven and eight past, but my when I look at the city council.

399
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:02,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to think of people that all you can think about is what you make and what you don't make.

400
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:07,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been coming to city council meetings for years, and I just don't think that

401
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:32,697
[SPEAKER_16]: the atmosphere in here is healthy for the city, you, you, we know you who you represent, and it is not me it's not many people that I'm friends with, or hang out with or whatever, but it's still not, it's very disheartening to see what I saw that prompted me to get in my car, leave my dinner mind you to come here to speak, you know I said, you know, take my name off the thing but it didn't come down.

402
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:35,198
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that this is insane.

403
00:53:35,218 --> 00:53:42,443
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that worrying about even if you guys are still going to be on here in the future years what you might or might not make you already got raises.

404
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:48,604
[SPEAKER_16]: you just put a huge increase for most of the city who did not want this.

405
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:51,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And that should be really what's in the back of your mind.

406
00:53:51,285 --> 00:53:54,066
[SPEAKER_16]: You're still not working for everybody.

407
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:56,806
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's so disheartening.

408
00:53:57,306 --> 00:54:08,449
[SPEAKER_16]: But to see what's erupting and who's yelling and who's calling names, and I would never think this should come from behind the bench or whatever it is behind here, especially the lead or the president.

409
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,083
[SPEAKER_16]: You should table it or put it away for now, because it's a moot point.

410
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:16,044
[SPEAKER_16]: You do not need more money.

411
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:20,166
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to help the residents that did not want the raises, who will be struggling.

412
00:54:20,587 --> 00:54:22,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody just told you what it's going to raise.

413
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:23,568
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not fair.

414
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:25,990
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to sit back and think about this.

415
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really not about you guys.

416
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,112
[SPEAKER_16]: You're representing us.

417
00:54:30,793 --> 00:54:32,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I only voted for one of you here.

418
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:33,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not afraid to admit that.

419
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:38,010
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry, you know, and for good reason.

420
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,991
[SPEAKER_16]: You have one person working for people like me.

421
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:44,515
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, it's disheartening to see what's going on.

422
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really hope you guys rethink this and you just get rid of it altogether.

423
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what the rules are, but there's no need for it.

424
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,521
[SPEAKER_20]: 30 seconds.

425
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:52,962
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm done now, thank you.

426
00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:53,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Nadine.

427
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:01,630
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna go to Zoom real quick and then we'll come back at Stone.

428
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,667
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna go to Ken Garrow on Zoom.

429
00:55:05,988 --> 00:55:08,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Ken, name and address for the record for this little three minutes.

430
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

431
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're sounding a little funky there.

432
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:21,279
[SPEAKER_20]: How about this?

433
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,020
[SPEAKER_20]: That's better, yep.

434
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, just projection towards my iPad.

435
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:28,965
[SPEAKER_03]: 52 Lambert Street, apartment number three.

436
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:40,180
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, President Behrs, I'm aware that you're saying that the ordinance itself isn't needed given state law.

437
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:49,225
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I did see the All Medford email that Councilor Scarpelli is a board member of.

438
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:56,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Thankfully, I actually was able to... Councilor Scarpelli has just noted that he is not a board member.

439
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,230
[SPEAKER_20]: ...organization that I follow.

440
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,571
I'm done hearing this.

441
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:10,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, he says he's not a board member noted I saw that in a prior Facebook post apologies counselor.

442
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,110
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Councillor Callahan.

443
00:56:15,274 --> 00:56:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do like this ordinance in terms of things.

444
00:56:19,756 --> 00:56:32,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it's actually excellent that you're at least thinking of the fact of trying to make sure councils do not raise funds for themselves in a sitting session.

445
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:41,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a brilliant idea to make sure it follows for things that may not impact you yourself in a future session.

446
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:52,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to, because of the clerk portal, actually look up the original ordinance that you had proposed, not the amended one.

447
00:56:54,527 --> 00:57:03,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're saying the amended one is not needed, or has the cost of living removed, but it's, I think, important to note,

448
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:14,711
[SPEAKER_03]: If that was to happen in the future, one of my, my comments that I was wanting to make was, it would be nice to put the cost of living separately as an ordinance or budget meeting.

449
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:18,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so additional transparency.

450
00:57:20,134 --> 00:57:22,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it's great having the portal available.

451
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: President Baird, Councilor Levin, you both know that if I have questions about any financials, I tend to harass you guys pretty quickly.

452
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:36,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're always really quick to respond and I greatly appreciate that.

453
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:46,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I also appreciate the fact that you were very open in terms of and not artificially inflating

454
00:57:47,357 --> 00:57:59,386
[SPEAKER_03]: how much was trying to be raised by the city, because I do believe that added to some of the contention in the past several months with amount of fear mongering.

455
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

456
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:01,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

457
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:04,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

458
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,551
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go to the podium name and address for the record, please.

459
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:07,132
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

460
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:10,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:12,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stickney Road.

462
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:20,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a few comments specifically about what Councillor Callaghan proposed, the latest one, and then some other general comments.

463
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:25,803
[SPEAKER_17]: So regarding the latest, the one that got just handed out right before the meeting.

464
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:32,249
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would add to, for example, the examples that are provided with Everett and Watertown,

465
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:40,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only that, whatever gets approved applies to the council that comes after the following election.

466
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:50,489
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um, I would like to remind everyone that, you know, as least is here the mayor the city council and the school committee, you work for us, you work for the taxpayer.

467
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:53,150
[SPEAKER_17]: and we pay your salary.

468
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,892
[SPEAKER_17]: And as such, I think it would be nice to add that.

469
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:03,357
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you vote for any races, since it will apply after the following election, put it on the ballot.

470
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:10,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And ask the taxpayers, do you actually vote yes or no for this salary increase?

471
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:13,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Since you work for us, we pay your salary.

472
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:13,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I would add.

473
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:18,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Second, just a few general comments.

474
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this was mentioned before as well.

475
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:35,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of the problems with this happens because we forget that, again, so people in the city council or school committee are supposed to do this as a service to our community.

476
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,783
[SPEAKER_17]: And I commend you all for doing that.

477
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:43,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And as such, you're supposed to get a stipend, not a salary.

478
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:57,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that would be a lot easier if we kept a limited government that just took care of administering the city and do, in the case of the City Council, just legislative work.

479
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:07,707
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to provide, lastly, the example of what I love in this regard, which is the legislature of New Hampshire.

480
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:27,462
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how many people know this, but in the legislature of New Hampshire, in both chambers, so all state representatives, that's the state representatives, it would be the equivalent of Representative Donato for us, and the state senators, their salary is $200 per term.

481
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:35,585
[SPEAKER_17]: That means $100 per year plus daily commute cost covering.

482
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:40,641
[SPEAKER_17]: $100 per year plus daily community expenses.

483
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:45,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's the example that we should follow.

484
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:47,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for listening, Mr. President.

485
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:47,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

486
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:53,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

487
01:00:55,538 --> 01:01:02,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Harry McGill repeat my road method, so I'm pretty sure we beat the ordinance thing to death but I will say that it was, it was very confusing.

488
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:13,085
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to send a message to Councilor lemming to get some clarification because we've been going back and forth and he's been helpful clarifying things but I said I'll just go to the meeting.

489
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:22,990
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think any municipal bargaining unit in the city has ever got a legitimate COLA raise.

490
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:28,854
[SPEAKER_19]: They've all been, for the last probably 15 to 20 years, 2% or less.

491
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,375
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't see the threes.

492
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,296
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't see fours or unheard of.

493
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:43,423
[SPEAKER_19]: So when you say the word COLA, that's going to get people's attention, because the cost of living is probably over 4% or 5%.

494
01:01:48,055 --> 01:01:56,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, as far as the overrides went, yeah, it was a close vote, a lot closer than I actually thought.

495
01:01:56,623 --> 01:01:58,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think a lot of people should pay attention to that.

496
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:03,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you're all gonna have your hands full with citizens calling to get their streets replaced.

497
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:14,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Because as a guy that's been working police details for over 20 years, watching how we do it, I'm just not seeing that you're gonna get the curb to curb street replacements for that, for what was, you know,

498
01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:17,820
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, published in that, in that, um, question.

499
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And finally, because no one else really knows, no one talks about it.

500
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:26,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Your police department, both, both associations have going on two and a half.

501
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:28,905
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be three years without a contract.

502
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,586
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to probably be settled in arbitration.

503
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:35,128
[SPEAKER_19]: When it gets settled in arbitration, it will be expired.

504
01:02:35,508 --> 01:02:42,972
[SPEAKER_19]: So when we come before you with the settlement, you're going to be funding an expired contract and we'll be right back at it.

505
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:44,869
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going public.

506
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:46,230
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not making a big deal.

507
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:48,053
[SPEAKER_19]: We're kind of in the background.

508
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:49,054
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what we're doing?

509
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:51,597
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing our jobs and we're doing them well.

510
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:56,283
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to say, I'm seeing this from a different level now.

511
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:59,226
[SPEAKER_19]: I was president of the patrolman's union for a lot of years.

512
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:01,890
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the vice president of the supervisor's union now.

513
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:11,083
[SPEAKER_19]: And those police officers on the street right now are dealing with much, much more than we were dealing with five, 10 years ago.

514
01:03:11,443 --> 01:03:13,925
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a tough job, a very tough job.

515
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:16,107
[SPEAKER_19]: They came to work during COVID.

516
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:17,768
[SPEAKER_19]: They never complained.

517
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:19,089
[SPEAKER_19]: They did their job.

518
01:03:19,149 --> 01:03:22,732
[SPEAKER_19]: We had police officers having to be put up in hotels during COVID.

519
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:25,634
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no COVID money on the table for the police department.

520
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:26,795
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's okay.

521
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,395
[SPEAKER_19]: I get it.

522
01:03:28,116 --> 01:03:29,096
[SPEAKER_19]: We just come to work.

523
01:03:29,136 --> 01:03:29,937
[SPEAKER_19]: We do our jobs.

524
01:03:30,859 --> 01:03:32,180
[SPEAKER_19]: They need to be taken care of.

525
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Those officers that are out in the street need to be taken care of.

526
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:37,162
[SPEAKER_19]: They're taking firearms off the street.

527
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:38,562
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing a tremendous job.

528
01:03:38,602 --> 01:03:43,985
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know if the public knows how good a job they're doing, because no one talks about it.

529
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:49,747
[SPEAKER_19]: All I've been hearing for the last two years, teachers are going to get a big pay raise because we had an override.

530
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:50,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Good for them.

531
01:03:51,148 --> 01:03:57,471
[SPEAKER_19]: The police department, the fire department, and the DPW are just as important to the operations of this city as the school department.

532
01:03:58,271 --> 01:03:58,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

533
01:03:59,351 --> 01:03:59,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

534
01:04:03,663 --> 01:04:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

535
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:13,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, East Method Mass.

536
01:04:14,006 --> 01:04:15,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked in here a little bit late.

537
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Please excuse me.

538
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:19,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of yelling and screaming.

539
01:04:19,128 --> 01:04:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a hornet's nest.

540
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:21,869
[SPEAKER_04]: What the heck happened?

541
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:27,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for the lack of civil order or whatever.

542
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:30,692
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it seems to me that

543
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:37,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something to do with salaries for the City Council, am I right?

544
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:50,403
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe the proposal as it stands is that the City Council could not increase its own salary or the salary of any other elected official until, if an increase were to go into effect, it would go into effect after the next election.

545
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:55,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I have two simple questions.

546
01:04:56,064 --> 01:05:02,647
[SPEAKER_04]: One is, what is the Memphis City Council, what is your salary or stipends all totaled per year?

547
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:04,928
[SPEAKER_20]: The current compensation is, I believe $30,400.

548
01:05:05,648 --> 01:05:06,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

549
01:05:06,088 --> 01:05:06,268
[SPEAKER_20]: 30,000 what?

550
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:06,569
[SPEAKER_20]: 400, I think.

551
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:12,411
[SPEAKER_20]: And other stipends or other funds, US dollars come into your?

552
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:45,098
[SPEAKER_04]: into your hands also besides that no really well not from the city of medford for this job you don't get stipends for papers and pencils i thought you did no no oh thank you for confirming that yeah uh my second question is uh with all your brains and all your computers can you tell me where method ranks out of the 351

553
01:05:47,489 --> 01:06:01,458
[SPEAKER_04]: communities in Massachusetts, as far as your salary, what is the rank, Boston's 110, Buck 25, they got a raise I think last year, but what do you rank at 30,400?

554
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

555
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Does any, with all your computers and all your brains and college education, no one can tell me that answer?

556
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:11,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Does any other council have any answer?

557
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:14,467
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that information is immediately available.

558
01:06:15,157 --> 01:06:18,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I'm, I guess I'm living in a twilight zone myself.

559
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:19,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

560
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:25,321
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

561
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:28,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Had a conversation about it.

562
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:38,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Believe we have a motion to refer this to the Governance Committee by Councilor Callahan as amended and seconded by Councilor Collins.

563
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:40,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion.

564
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:42,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Callahan.

565
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:48,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

566
01:06:52,074 --> 01:07:00,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought this up and I apologize for having anything about COLA in it at the beginning.

567
01:07:00,155 --> 01:07:04,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that it had been this second version, which almost no one talked about.

568
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:15,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought this up knowing that it would not be friendly

569
01:07:16,892 --> 01:07:19,193
[SPEAKER_06]: to many of my fellow city councilors.

570
01:07:21,613 --> 01:07:24,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it up because I believe that it is the right thing to do.

571
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:35,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that city councilors, as is true in many states, and as is true in some other cities in Massachusetts, city councilors should not be able to raise their own salaries.

572
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,697
[SPEAKER_06]: That is why I brought this up.

573
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:44,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it up despite knowing that other city councilors here

574
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:53,407
[SPEAKER_06]: who voted yes, when I voted no against those raises earlier this year, that those other city councilors might have their feelings hurt.

575
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:58,968
[SPEAKER_06]: They might feel that this was not friendly to them.

576
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:06,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt a little ballsy and I felt that I was doing the right thing.

577
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:17,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I still feel that I'm doing the right thing.

578
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't mind being ballsy.

579
01:08:20,407 --> 01:08:40,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a little bit sad that I am attacked not for what is actually what I am, this, what I am proposing today, which I believe if it had been put forward by councilor, that every person in this room who spoke out against it would be speaking out in favor of it.

580
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maybe I am wrong, but I think that

581
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay.

582
01:08:47,578 --> 01:08:48,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I should not have said that.

583
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:49,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

584
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth.

585
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:52,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I am very sorry.

586
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, go ahead, continue.

587
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:03,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I genuinely was trying to do what I believed and continue to believe is the right thing.

588
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:13,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do hope that things like this can be read

589
01:09:16,665 --> 01:09:25,231
[SPEAKER_06]: and spoken about with some attempt at understanding that it is a good faith effort.

590
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:33,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And literally what is written here and what I am trying to do is to make it not possible for the city council

591
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:40,839
[SPEAKER_06]: to raise salaries of any sitting elected official.

592
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:46,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that is what I personally believe in, and I will stand by it.

593
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:48,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

594
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,523
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just going to go real quick.

595
01:09:51,244 --> 01:09:52,164
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's two things here.

596
01:09:52,184 --> 01:10:00,668
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there are the facts and the substance of the matter right now, the way it works by state law and charter.

597
01:10:01,522 --> 01:10:05,764
[SPEAKER_20]: is that the school committee compensation is set by a vote of the city council.

598
01:10:06,425 --> 01:10:09,987
[SPEAKER_20]: The city council controls the amount and the timing for school committee.

599
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:22,034
[SPEAKER_20]: For the mayor and the city council, the city council, that is actually set by an average of the, let me read it exactly.

600
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:30,985
[SPEAKER_20]: The salaries may be increased at the recommendation of the Mayor and the approval of the City Council if the salaries of each of the following officers of the City of Medford are increased.

601
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:38,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Director of Budgets and Personnel, Finance Director Auditor, Director of Community Development, City Clerk, City Treasurer,

602
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:41,675
[SPEAKER_20]: collector city solicitor and the chief assessor appraiser.

603
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:49,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Any salary increase for the office of mayor and the members of the city council should not increase exceed the average percentage by which the salaries for the aforesaid officers is increased.

604
01:10:50,398 --> 01:10:54,739
[SPEAKER_20]: The city council does not have the power to set its own salary at whatever it amount tomorrow.

605
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:03,042
[SPEAKER_20]: There are restrictions right now on what the city council can do in terms of the salaries of the mayor and the city council and it's that

606
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:10,176
[SPEAKER_20]: If the mayor puts it forward and the council approves, they can go up by the average of essentially the main management of the city.

607
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:12,077
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the current law.

608
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:20,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Kellyanne, I believe's intent, and I think to be honest, it was not a particularly clear resolution to make the point.

609
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:43,461
[SPEAKER_20]: It references other city charters, but talks about an ordinance, it references COLA, but I believe the intent was to move away from what I just read, which is that the city council and mayor salary can increase by the average of essentially city managing staff, to that the city council's salary could not increase in the term in which the city council voted, current city council is sitting.

610
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:44,722
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's a substance.

611
01:11:46,923 --> 01:11:49,905
[SPEAKER_20]: I think on the optics and the discussion,

612
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:58,162
[SPEAKER_20]: people aren't going to go into the substance all the time and discuss the good faith substance that someone may be proposing.

613
01:11:59,003 --> 01:12:07,448
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had a lot of contentious conversations about compensation that we can call it salaries or stipends or whatever else we wanna call it.

614
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,129
[SPEAKER_20]: This council has had it for many years.

615
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:16,594
[SPEAKER_20]: There were discussions in the 2000s and the 2010s and the 1990s about compensation for the city council.

616
01:12:16,654 --> 01:12:17,374
[SPEAKER_20]: The city council in 2016,

617
01:12:18,915 --> 01:12:30,587
[SPEAKER_20]: or sorry 2013 completely changed the way the city council is compensated because it used to be based on what Andy was talking about pencils and supplies and travel and all of these kind of nebulous things.

618
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:36,333
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's been a lot of there's a lot of legislative history on the compensation elected officials in the city.

619
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:49,587
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think what people are expressing, and I think those people maybe are both folks behind the other side of the rail who are saying, I don't like that we're talking about raising elected officials' compensation.

620
01:12:49,607 --> 01:13:04,200
[SPEAKER_20]: And to be quite frankly, I think what you were saying, Councilor Callahan, about some of us who felt that since school committee hadn't changed since 2000 and the city council since 2016, that following the laws as are laid out to adjust that compensation was a fair thing.

621
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,741
[SPEAKER_20]: but we also didn't want to be having this conversation.

622
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,502
[SPEAKER_20]: At least I think so by the looks on everybody's faces.

623
01:13:09,522 --> 01:13:11,743
[SPEAKER_20]: I think George doesn't want to be having it either.

624
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,424
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can't see Justin right now, but I bet he doesn't want to either.

625
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:19,386
[SPEAKER_20]: So the substance, it's a fair discussion.

626
01:13:20,307 --> 01:13:21,027
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we do that?

627
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,188
[SPEAKER_20]: How do elected official salaries get changed?

628
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:26,529
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a state law and a charter issue.

629
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:28,530
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have discussions.

630
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:33,472
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the charter study committee actually has some recommendations around that, that we'll be discussing.

631
01:13:34,872 --> 01:13:37,933
[SPEAKER_20]: But then there's also what happened last week, what happened this week.

632
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:44,336
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we all acknowledge there's some people in the room who are happy question six didn't pass.

633
01:13:44,956 --> 01:13:47,777
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some people in the room who are happy question seven and eight did pass.

634
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:49,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody's happy.

635
01:13:50,589 --> 01:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a mixed result.

636
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:56,593
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't even have to get into other elections that happened last Tuesday that I'm sure a lot of people have a lot of feelings about.

637
01:13:57,174 --> 01:14:06,541
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think that's more what the question is here than the substance of, and some people may well be happy about, as I see as well.

638
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:10,964
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think it's just like, is this the conversation we'll be having today?

639
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:17,749
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think a lot of us feel the answer is no, but beyond that,

640
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:19,803
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go back to the podium.

641
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:21,884
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll just do a couple more minutes.

642
01:14:22,604 --> 01:14:23,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead, Harry, let me turn on the mic.

643
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:26,446
[SPEAKER_20]: You got three minutes.

644
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Harry, before Piedmont Road mentioned.

645
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,528
[SPEAKER_19]: So now I get what the resolution is trying.

646
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:33,668
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand it.

647
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:38,690
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not saying it's a bad idea or it's a good idea, but I understand the concept.

648
01:14:40,711 --> 01:14:44,672
[SPEAKER_19]: What I hope the folks on this side of the reel can understand

649
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:53,037
[SPEAKER_19]: that the folks on this side, what we see is we have to sometimes wait two, three years.

650
01:14:53,597 --> 01:14:54,898
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to go to mediation.

651
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,119
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to go to arbitration.

652
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:03,365
[SPEAKER_19]: We would love to have an 18-month mechanism built into pay raises.

653
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,186
[SPEAKER_19]: We would love it.

654
01:15:04,326 --> 01:15:07,989
[SPEAKER_19]: And we would love to get actual cost of living increases.

655
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,410
[SPEAKER_19]: But we understand

656
01:15:10,313 --> 01:15:27,146
[SPEAKER_19]: As union officials, we understand the budgetary constraints, the city is under we've we've traditionally settled for way less than than than cola raises and I've been negotiating a long time I outside of probably Bobby Jones from the fight apartment.

657
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:33,691
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think anybody in the city has been negotiating with the city is as long as I have and and

658
01:15:34,684 --> 01:15:36,505
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we had good days, we had bad days.

659
01:15:37,025 --> 01:15:42,248
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that probably the Burke administration was probably the best at getting union contracts settled.

660
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:43,568
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just a fact.

661
01:15:44,429 --> 01:15:48,571
[SPEAKER_19]: This administration, I have to say, is probably the worst.

662
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,012
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not me being critical.

663
01:15:51,032 --> 01:15:52,152
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not me name-calling.

664
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:52,793
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a fact.

665
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:57,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Negotiations, for whatever reason, aren't negotiations.

666
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,972
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just a waste of everyone's time.

667
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:04,576
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's get to mediation and arbitration and mediation turns out to be a waste of time.

668
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:06,397
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to have to sit in front of an arbitrator.

669
01:16:07,018 --> 01:16:10,821
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what we never like to go to arbitration.

670
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:12,783
[SPEAKER_19]: We always like to have a settled contract.

671
01:16:13,223 --> 01:16:19,609
[SPEAKER_19]: And we always say when both sides walk away angry, then that's a good contract because they got something, we got something.

672
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:22,981
[SPEAKER_19]: We're angry, they're angry, that's a good settlement.

673
01:16:23,301 --> 01:16:24,622
[SPEAKER_19]: That's usually the rule of thumb.

674
01:16:24,902 --> 01:16:26,083
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not even having that.

675
01:16:26,643 --> 01:16:29,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, we're not an angry mob.

676
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:36,511
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw that resolution and I was like, whoa, what is that?

677
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:47,039
[SPEAKER_19]: And the timing was poor, but I hope you can appreciate what's going on in this city with labor, with municipal employees.

678
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:49,541
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been a difficult, you know,

679
01:16:51,089 --> 01:16:55,873
[SPEAKER_19]: bunch of years and then we have an override to give one bargaining unit pay raises.

680
01:16:56,853 --> 01:17:14,727
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a horrible message and I was bringing that up to several school committee people and counselors along the way and 30 seconds, and you know I get the fact you want to have the highest paid teachers in the area good for the teachers, but we're losing police officers, we're losing police officers at a rate that I've never seen.

681
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:20,208
[SPEAKER_19]: to neighboring cities and towns because of better benefits and better pay scales.

682
01:17:20,629 --> 01:17:28,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Other cities and towns are giving $10,000 bonuses, $10,000 bonuses to get police officers to lateral transfer.

683
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:33,772
[SPEAKER_19]: When I took the test to become a police officer, I waited in line with about 3000 people.

684
01:17:34,173 --> 01:17:36,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we have about 50 people taking the test.

685
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:37,634
[SPEAKER_19]: No one wants this job.

686
01:17:38,294 --> 01:17:42,255
[SPEAKER_19]: And if this city doesn't get its act together, you get what you pay for.

687
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:48,237
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to have the lowest lowest paid police department in the Commonwealth.

688
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:50,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no one's going to work here.

689
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

690
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:53,561
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Harry.

691
01:17:53,581 --> 01:18:00,568
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do just want to know that we have heard from a lot of our union partners here before the rail.

692
01:18:01,454 --> 01:18:19,539
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't participate in the negotiations, but we do, what our small part is, we do approve the final agreements and we have, I think, consistently waived readings to move agreed collective bargaining agreements to get the pay to the folks as soon as those agreements have been met.

693
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:23,800
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record, three minutes.

694
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Nadine Moretti, Birkenau.

695
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:38,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, so the reason I came down here like I already mentioned before, I think that seeing even this amended resolution.

696
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:44,023
[SPEAKER_16]: It still isn't okay for me, I mean I can't speak for everybody we have 55,000 people in the city.

697
01:18:45,973 --> 01:18:57,566
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the last thing that should be on anyone's mind after the overrides passing in all the people that have been coming to these council meetings to tell you how badly we didn't want the raises.

698
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:06,096
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, if this was proposed by another counselor, even the people that support the counselor would would not be okay with it but.

699
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:07,697
[SPEAKER_16]: He would never propose this.

700
01:19:08,197 --> 01:19:14,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So the point is you have to really, I don't think anybody's listened to anybody but the people that support you this whole time.

701
01:19:15,323 --> 01:19:28,252
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to listen to the city to everybody all the residents, because unfortunately, this is the council, and you have to sit there and really listen to what everybody's saying a lot I mean I think a lot of you are a lot younger than me.

702
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:32,575
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a lot more life experience I might not be behind the podium.

703
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:41,601
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean behind this real but you really have to listen to us and care, and what I saw when I was at home prompted me to come down, because all I saw was just a.

704
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:44,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't wanna swear, so I'm not going to.

705
01:19:44,718 --> 01:19:45,438
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just a mess.

706
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:50,400
[SPEAKER_16]: And I couldn't believe I was seeing this as a city, like see the city council meeting going on like this.

707
01:19:50,941 --> 01:19:52,041
[SPEAKER_16]: It just can't be like this.

708
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:59,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I am devastated that the overrides passed, but worried about what Harry just said about the police.

709
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:00,885
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to think about this stuff.

710
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:06,208
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so much more important than worrying about the future councils, because we have enough with just this council here.

711
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:09,749
[SPEAKER_16]: So it shouldn't even be discussed at another thing.

712
01:20:09,789 --> 01:20:10,650
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not important.

713
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:15,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone has said, you guys make a decent stipend for what you do.

714
01:20:16,572 --> 01:20:19,233
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you do more than what you should do, that goes with the job anyway.

715
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:25,916
[SPEAKER_16]: But this should not be on the agenda and it should not be an important thing, amended or not.

716
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,256
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not important.

717
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:29,037
[SPEAKER_16]: It really isn't.

718
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:32,258
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to think about what you're hearing from just a small amount of us.

719
01:20:32,338 --> 01:20:34,199
[SPEAKER_16]: I know some nights you have a lot of people here.

720
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:36,380
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to start to really listen to us.

721
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:40,119
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to, you know, cause you have no choice.

722
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,059
[SPEAKER_16]: You represent everybody.

723
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:41,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

724
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

725
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:55,485
[SPEAKER_20]: I do hope that the rest of the meeting was less of an SS then, which I think was the swear word you wanted to say, but less of a mess then.

726
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:05,509
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, we can have the civil conversations as Nick said, but yeah.

727
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:18,663
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we've had the discussion on the motion of Councilor Callahan as amended by Councilor Callahan a seconded by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

728
01:21:19,324 --> 01:21:22,245

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, 60 formative one in the negative this is referred to governance committee 24492 resolution receive update on roads whereas it has been more than six months and city council was last updated on our roads.

735
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:59,580
[SPEAKER_20]: And whereas during the election of November 5, the voters of Medford considered a budget override provision in question seven providing funds for among other purposes fiscal year 2025 general operations of the Department of Public Works.

736
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:05,583
[SPEAKER_20]: including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair, and that ballot question was successful.

737
01:22:06,043 --> 01:22:18,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Now therefore be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite Engineer Owen Wartella and DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting to talk about the state of the roads and the plan moving forward given the outcome of the election.

739
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:29,355
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is on the motion to refer to the Public Works and Facilities Committee.

740
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:30,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

741
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:36,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Six or eight months ago we had these.

742
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:49,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So engineer own we're Tella and the Commissioner Tim McGivern at the public works meeting, and it was great to sort of be able to get their take on an update on the roads.

743
01:22:50,628 --> 01:22:55,691
[SPEAKER_06]: because they will have the extra $500,000 per year.

744
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to go ahead and get another update from them.

745
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:11,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And I invite everyone who's interested in our roads, which I think is everyone, I hope, I'm certainly interested in our roads, to come and have questions for them prepared so that we can get all the information that we need.

[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

747
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:17,760

01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:19,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

749
01:23:21,676 --> 01:23:24,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing no discussion by members of the council members of the public, please call the roll.

750
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:24,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

751
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:24,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

752
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:54,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, negative the motion passes 24493 resolution established volunteer tree planting program whereas Medford loses an estimated 500 or more trees a year and plants 250 fewer than 250 trees each year.

753
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:57,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And whereas the cost of planning city trees is primarily in labor to plant the trees.

754
01:23:58,912 --> 01:24:19,470
[SPEAKER_20]: and whereas Medford only has one full-time staff member dedicated to our trees, the tree warden, and whereas Medford currently contracts out for tree planting, which is more expensive than planting with an in-house crew, and whereas trees are a vital part of fighting climate change, helping cool buildings and streets in the summer, and add to the beauty of our city, and whereas Medford has many residents who want to volunteer to plant city trees,

755
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:34,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Now therefore be it resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite you BW Commissioner McGibbon to attend an upcoming meeting to begin discussing the possibility of allowing Metro residents to volunteer to help plant city trees on the motion to refer to public works and facilities committee counselor Callahan.

756
01:24:37,688 --> 01:24:38,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

757
01:24:38,888 --> 01:24:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: This was something that I talked about a lot, as I was knocking on doors.

758
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:57,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Last summer, and I found that a lot of people were especially in South Medford we're really interested in helping to plant trees in their city I know that there are other cities that allow residents to help with this.

759
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:58,133
[SPEAKER_06]: program.

760
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:05,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it's this only with the proper training with the proper trees at the proper depth, you know, doing everything exactly the right way.

761
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:11,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like as I talked to Commissioner given that he is open to it.

762
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:24,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is simply to have him come to a meeting and so that we can begin discussing how this might work in our city and get the sort of best ideas of the way this would move forward.

763
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:24,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And

764
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:35,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that we might by spring, if spring is the right time to plant trees, that we might be able to have our first pilot program.

765
01:25:38,111 --> 01:25:38,351
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

766
01:25:38,371 --> 01:25:39,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

767
01:25:41,193 --> 01:25:45,937
[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion referred to Public Works and Facilities Committee by Councillor Callahan, seconded by Councillor Collins.

768
01:25:47,218 --> 01:25:49,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Fiori, name and address the record of three minutes.

769
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, give me one second.

770
01:25:57,222 --> 01:25:57,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

771
01:25:57,703 --> 01:25:57,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

772
01:25:58,645 --> 01:26:00,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got some fear 61 stingy road.

773
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:05,238
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to say that I really like this idea from cancer Galahad.

774
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:20,576
[SPEAKER_17]: And I actually think that, you know, even in terms of training, we could train like a small group of people, and then once they're experts on how to plant trees, then that group can keep training other residents that wanna get involved in this.

775
01:26:21,796 --> 01:26:28,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this goes right in the direction of a limited efficient government, and I think it's a great idea.

776
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,441
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you so much for proposing.

777
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:30,381
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

778
01:26:31,122 --> 01:26:31,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

779
01:26:33,223 --> 01:26:34,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none, Mr. Chair, please call the roll.

780
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:46,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang.

781
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:47,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

782
01:26:48,318 --> 01:26:48,898
[SPEAKER_11]: President Beers.

783
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:52,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, affirmative, non-negative, the motion passes.

784
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,182
[SPEAKER_20]: 24484, this was tabled from our last meeting.

785
01:26:56,202 --> 01:26:59,424
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a resolution to adopt the local options of the HEROES Act.

786
01:26:59,664 --> 01:27:05,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we heard back from council and the city solicitor, or sorry, council and the city assessor.

787
01:27:07,093 --> 01:27:16,797
[SPEAKER_20]: fingers crossed on that city solicitor, that this was sufficient as to form and that the impact would not be significant.

788
01:27:16,957 --> 01:27:19,718
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be addressed by the overlay, but I will go to Councilor Leopold.

789
01:27:20,038 --> 01:27:22,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Council President Bares.

790
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: The only amendment to this that council advised was to remove the up to and up to 100% in the very last paragraph of the resolution.

791
01:27:35,425 --> 01:27:42,551
[SPEAKER_08]: but otherwise both council and the assessor thought that this was perfectly acceptable.

792
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:52,720
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would motion to amend this to remove the two words up to in the very last paragraph and pass it.

793
01:27:54,241 --> 01:27:55,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So the amended version would read

794
01:27:56,773 --> 01:28:13,109
[SPEAKER_20]: be it further resolved that the city of Medford accept general laws chapter 59 section 5 clause 22 J which authorizes an annual increase in the amount of the exemption granted under general laws chapter 59 section 5 clause 22 22 a 22 b 22 c 22 e and 22 f by 100% of the personal exemption amount subject to the conditions in clause 22 J to be effective July 1 2025 that is correct.

795
01:28:13,149 --> 01:28:13,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

796
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:31,002
[SPEAKER_20]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Lemming, as amended by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Callahan, any further discussion?

797
01:28:33,063 --> 01:28:45,525
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to note, this is expanding property tax exemptions for veterans pursuant to the HERO Act, which was passed as Chapter 178 of the Acts of 2024 by the legislature.

798
01:28:45,765 --> 01:28:46,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Collins.

799
01:28:49,506 --> 01:28:49,966
[SPEAKER_20]: One second.

800
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:53,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

801
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:54,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

802
01:28:55,368 --> 01:29:01,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you President bears and I wanted to thank Councilor loving for researching the implementation of the new heroes act and for putting this forward.

803
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:13,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really proud that over this term and the previous term the city council has worked to make sure that the city of Medford is maximized out on all of the tax exemption programs that are offered to us by the state.

804
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:22,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thank the counselor for his quick work on making sure that we adopted this one too, so that we could extend tax exemption benefits to veterans in our community.

805
01:29:25,677 --> 01:29:27,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

822

[SPEAKER_20]: The stabilization fund has a balance of $3,923,737.

823
01:31:01,643 --> 01:31:02,604
[SPEAKER_20]: And if these appropriations remain all approved,

824
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,340

825

01:31:22,386 --> 01:31:26,928
[SPEAKER_20]: And subsequently to that, Councilor Scarpelli invoked rule 21 table in this paper until the next meeting.

828

01:32:14,543 --> 01:32:25,332

[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none, we'll go to the podium.

836
01:32:28,558 --> 01:32:30,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.

837
01:32:30,139 --> 01:32:31,000
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

838
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:35,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

839
01:32:36,243 --> 01:32:36,703
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll get there.

840
01:32:37,484 --> 01:32:39,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So when it's red, it's good?

841
01:32:39,105 --> 01:32:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

842
01:32:39,245 --> 01:32:41,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

843
01:32:41,566 --> 01:32:46,569
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted a clarification on whether all of this

844
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:57,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Subjects are actually subjected to chapter 30B procurement procedures, is that correct?

845
01:32:58,459 --> 01:33:08,550
[SPEAKER_17]: And if so, then again, just to review my understanding, it means that, for example, for the last item, so the window restoration, so the $322,500

846
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:24,605
[SPEAKER_17]: That is like, so is the bidding happening after this or it has already been, the bidding has already been done, a competitive open bidding process?

847
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:28,807
[SPEAKER_17]: I have trouble understanding every time that this happens, what's subjected to chapter 30B.

848
01:33:30,356 --> 01:33:39,345
[SPEAKER_17]: procurement procedures, what's not, and how can the taxpayer make sure that there's a competitive open bidding process for any of this?

849
01:33:39,365 --> 01:33:40,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I see like 322,500.

850
01:33:40,846 --> 01:33:42,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, clearly, it's not going to be 322,500.

851
01:33:42,588 --> 01:33:43,469
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be like 318,419.32.

852
01:33:52,758 --> 01:34:02,524
[SPEAKER_17]: if, you know, someone could provide some clarification, I know maybe not today, but I should have asked for this earlier, but so, so, so, you know, we can understand.

853
01:34:02,564 --> 01:34:08,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but it calls my attention to that, for example, for engine truck, engine three truck pump replacement, that one says 51,643.24.

854
01:34:09,828 --> 01:34:19,814
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sure why, you know, why some of them looked like, you know, they got a bill and like the truck, like the fudge,

855
01:34:21,215 --> 01:34:28,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have to go back and double check the recording, but I believe they bid out for the engine three truck pump and it came in at a higher cost.

856
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:31,763
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is covering a difference in a bidded amount.

857
01:34:33,044 --> 01:34:38,909
[SPEAKER_20]: The cemetery swill removal, I think will go to bid and is based on an estimate or a quote or multiple quotes, but would still go to bid.

858
01:34:39,488 --> 01:34:53,704
[SPEAKER_20]: The grant matches based on the grant and I, I'd have to double check 30 be, but I think because the grant match it's not subject to fitting right anything over 10,000 except there's some certain exceptions legal legal services, and a couple other things aren't subject to 30 be.

859
01:34:54,885 --> 01:35:00,629
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the third, the fourth one though, it is something that's already the windows, I believe the windows is definitely Yeah, yeah.

860
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,551
[SPEAKER_20]: And but I believe this is based.

861
01:35:03,091 --> 01:35:04,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Ricky said that he had an estimate.

862
01:35:05,393 --> 01:35:08,175
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's how he determined this cost and then it would go out to bid through the 30.

863
01:35:08,255 --> 01:35:09,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, perfect.

864
01:35:09,276 --> 01:35:14,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And just for the general public because I think you think you mentioned person for clarification so for the matching, I think what.

865
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:22,393
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, the staff member from the CD last time the finance person explained that so forth for the match.

866
01:35:22,994 --> 01:35:30,743
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to appropriate like the maximum for the match and then if it turns out that it's less than yes it gets returned.

867
01:35:30,883 --> 01:35:31,764
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you very much.

868
01:35:31,905 --> 01:35:32,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, thank you.

869
01:35:40,162 --> 01:35:55,452
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just wanted to clarify that in our correspondence that I had with Paul Raihee, he said that he did select the contractor already that will be doing this work, the same company that did historic renovations for Faneuil Hall in Boston.

870
01:35:55,932 --> 01:36:04,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know the name of that company specifically, but I had a back and forth with him about with him and some members of the CPA about this.

871
01:36:04,257 --> 01:36:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So that

872
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:09,289
[SPEAKER_08]: already is selected as my okay so he did that already Yeah, okay.

873
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:10,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

874
01:36:10,169 --> 01:36:10,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't want to.

875
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, if they're, what is that I can't remember what that's called.

876
01:36:21,071 --> 01:36:21,871
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the state bid list.

877
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:22,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah.

878
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:25,471
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

879
01:36:26,151 --> 01:36:30,432
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli seconded by Vice President Collins to approve.

880
01:36:31,172 --> 01:36:31,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr please call.

881
01:36:36,837 --> 01:36:43,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Singh.

882
01:36:44,722 --> 01:36:44,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

883
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:46,523
[SPEAKER_11]: President Behrs.

884
01:36:47,604 --> 01:36:49,765
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I mean affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

885
01:36:51,086 --> 01:36:52,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further public participation?

886
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:55,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Take public participation on any item that was not on the agenda.

887
01:36:58,051 --> 01:37:02,934
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, Andy, name and address the record or Ellen.

888
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:06,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Ellen, name and address for record.

889
01:37:06,566 --> 01:37:07,167
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

890
01:37:09,668 --> 01:37:10,869
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Ellen Epstein.

891
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:12,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 15 Grove Street.

892
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:18,592
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just really distressed about what happened earlier in the meeting.

893
01:37:18,993 --> 01:37:29,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm wondering if there's any kind of more exacting

894
01:37:30,492 --> 01:37:39,199
[SPEAKER_15]: guidelines or rules that could be established so that no one on this council is ever disrespected in that way.

895
01:37:39,519 --> 01:37:39,959
[SPEAKER_15]: No one.

896
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:53,910
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a lot of us in this city that really don't feel like anyone here deserves that kind of disrespect, no matter what the issue is.

897
01:37:56,975 --> 01:38:03,837
[SPEAKER_15]: It just feels a little out of control to me as a resident of the city and someone who's been watching city council meetings for a while.

898
01:38:06,358 --> 01:38:08,039
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there is only so much we can do.

899
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the time, most people are respectful.

900
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:19,903
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we've made some strides even in the last few months from some

901
01:38:21,081 --> 01:38:22,481
[SPEAKER_20]: less than respectful interactions.

902
01:38:23,462 --> 01:38:31,624
[SPEAKER_20]: To be quite frank, I think this was a situation where somebody needs to check themselves.

903
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:46,648
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what else to say about that, but you know, we had an individual who has persistently and consistently not felt that he feels the need to respect this chair, particularly me, in a very personal way.

904
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:50,009
[SPEAKER_20]: So other than replacing me, if anyone wants the job,

905
01:38:52,067 --> 01:38:58,891
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know that that'll solve this problem, but we have had, we've tried to institute some decorum.

906
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:06,336
[SPEAKER_20]: I was able to, you know, now with the new system to shut off the microphone at the three minute mark, but I understand your distress.

907
01:39:07,476 --> 01:39:08,317
[SPEAKER_20]: I share in your distress.

908
01:39:08,337 --> 01:39:20,505
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure you could tell that I was frustrated and felt the need to combat it maybe in a way that I should have breathed through a little more, but yeah, sometimes some people,

909
01:39:21,124 --> 01:39:22,565
[SPEAKER_20]: want to come here to make a show.

910
01:39:22,885 --> 01:39:28,130
[SPEAKER_20]: And given that we are an open forum, it's difficult to manage sometimes.

911
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:37,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Just some kind of statement about civil discourse at the beginning of the meeting and respect for all opinions.

912
01:39:38,157 --> 01:39:39,639
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we could consider that for sure.

913
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:40,539
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, thank you.

914
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:41,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all.

915
01:39:45,543 --> 01:39:46,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

916
01:39:46,524 --> 01:39:47,545
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll go to Mr. Castaneda.

917
01:39:47,705 --> 01:39:49,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Three minutes, name and address for the record.

918
01:39:52,162 --> 01:40:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Council President bears Castaneda Andrew Cushman street, he's met forward near Magoon Park and the Buddhist temple.

919
01:40:03,848 --> 01:40:07,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two parts of comments.

920
01:40:18,035 --> 01:40:37,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Part one, I am sure six of you city councilors and more are very happy with the unprecedented passage of on two prop two and a half overrides in Medford Mass, USA.

921
01:40:39,004 --> 01:40:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope this will not become a city hall habit.

922
01:40:45,387 --> 01:40:47,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I pray to God our senior citizens

923
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,200
[SPEAKER_04]: and others will be able to pay the real estate tax bills.

924
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:59,542
[SPEAKER_04]: For the answer is blowing in the wind still.

925
01:41:01,143 --> 01:41:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Part two, President-elect Trump won in a landslide, 75 plus more million votes.

926
01:41:14,627 --> 01:41:15,147
[SPEAKER_04]: The Senate,

927
01:41:16,826 --> 01:41:18,828
[SPEAKER_04]: and retain the House of Representatives.

928
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:21,210
[SPEAKER_04]: The jig is up.

929
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is the time for all good Americans to come together and heal and keep our democratic Republic intact, if we can.

930
01:41:33,339 --> 01:41:41,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But my major concern is that our country may be too far gone and it is not fixable.

931
01:41:43,522 --> 01:41:49,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Also worried our country may fall into another 1929 style economic depression.

932
01:41:50,906 --> 01:41:52,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Even your parents don't know what I'm talking about.

933
01:41:54,748 --> 01:41:59,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with a $34 trillion plus national debt.

934
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:02,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's over $250,000 per taxpayer, over $100,000 per test, translation per head.

935
01:42:02,772 --> 01:42:03,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Legal or illegal?

936
01:42:13,184 --> 01:42:17,105
[SPEAKER_04]: or, and a world war three that would really suck.

937
01:42:18,545 --> 01:42:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be bad.

938
01:42:19,526 --> 01:42:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

939
01:42:21,226 --> 01:42:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it would hit every place with all these weapons.

940
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also worried for our children's future, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

941
01:42:30,408 --> 01:42:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: God, please help us unite and live in harmony or else there's going to be war in my opinion.

942
01:42:40,011 --> 01:42:41,611
