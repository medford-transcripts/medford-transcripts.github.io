123
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,201

124
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:14,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

125
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:22,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

126
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,334
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a ninth grader at Mefford High School.

127
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:27,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to begin by congratulating all of you for being sworn into office yesterday.

128
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:31,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your service to our community, and I wish you well in the upcoming term.

129
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:39,459
[SPEAKER_14]: While I have only been at Mefford High School for four months, I quickly became aware of the poor conditions of the MHS complex, especially the bathrooms, which is my focus tonight.

130
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I initiated on a petition on change.org on November 15th to draw attention to this matter.

131
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:46,602
[SPEAKER_14]: This petition has

132
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:52,264
[SPEAKER_14]: been signed by close to 450 students, educators, and parents.

133
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:57,126
[SPEAKER_14]: This prompted me to email the school committee members on December 16th of 2019.

134
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I used many of the restrooms throughout the building.

135
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:08,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that there are a lot of priorities in regard to funding, but I believe the school environment is important for students' ability to learn.

136
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the following issues need to be addressed for safety and health concerns.

137
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:21,538
[SPEAKER_14]: like the bugs in the soap dispensers, black molds, water damage to various ceiling tiles, exposed radiator pipes, missing ceiling tiles, and insects.

138
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:28,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to give each of you a few pictures to help illustrate the issues that the students at MHS encounter every day.

139
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:37,570
[SPEAKER_14]: While some of these issues will take significant spending to fix, I believe that some of these issues can be addressed immediately and would like to respectfully ask your help in addressing these needs.

140
00:41:50,443 --> 00:41:53,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank you for your time and would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

141
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:24,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

142
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

143
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:37,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I just would like to sort of reiterate that community participation is, because the item is not on the agenda, we are not supposed to be discussing the item.

144
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:42,817
[SPEAKER_19]: It is on the agenda as something else later.

145
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:44,438
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can discuss it then.

146
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:45,579
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

147
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just let me put your mic on first, one second?

148
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:54,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let me put your mic on, so that everybody can hear you.

149
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,249
[SPEAKER_11]: School committee woman, Van de Kloof.

150
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:08,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to make a motion that we take up item number three under the report of superintendent, NPS bathrooms, from Mr. McLaughlin, so that we can address this right now.

151
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to suspend the rules, to take paper under report of superintendent?

152

159
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:39,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

160
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:47,855
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, while we wait, I just want to thank Joey for coming forward and for making this statement and being proactive about what he's seeing at the high school.

161
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:53,096
[SPEAKER_11]: We are only as good as our information we received, Joey, so thank you very much.

162
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:57,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McLaughlin.

163
00:43:58,158 --> 00:43:59,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

164
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:00,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

165
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Council, student committee.

166
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:03,879
[SPEAKER_16]: So,

167
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:10,402
[SPEAKER_16]: I did, Peter will have something to add as well to the report.

168
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:21,892
[SPEAKER_16]: So upon social media, I took, Mr. Falco did a good job.

169
00:44:23,273 --> 00:44:26,075
[SPEAKER_16]: We went out and I went out and personally inspected all the bathrooms.

170
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:27,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I went out and

171
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:33,970
[SPEAKER_16]: made sure that they're old, the bathrooms are old.

172
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,492
[SPEAKER_16]: You cannot take that away.

173
00:44:36,572 --> 00:44:39,694
[SPEAKER_16]: But let me just run through the report real quick.

174
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:51,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So I went through the bathrooms and some of my findings was some of the fin tube radiator covers are in need of replacement.

175
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:54,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this time we have started the replacement of the radiator covers.

176
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:59,811
[SPEAKER_16]: We're waiting for some parts to come in from Granger to finish it.

177
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:04,413
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't find any signs of rodent activity or insect activity.

178
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:11,455
[SPEAKER_16]: I encourage people to report it because we do have an integrated pest management plan in all of our schools.

179
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:23,400
[SPEAKER_16]: And we need to know immediately if there's anything like that happening because we can call in our contractor and take care of it right off the bat.

180
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,751
[SPEAKER_16]: So the restrooms are old.

181
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:29,032
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not aesthetic.

182
00:45:30,214 --> 00:45:33,257
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been many years of repainting and painting.

183
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:34,238
[SPEAKER_16]: The tile's old.

184
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:35,239
[SPEAKER_16]: It's outdated.

185
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,282
[SPEAKER_16]: The fixtures and the sinks are all running.

186
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:42,987
[SPEAKER_16]: We went through this past vacation.

187
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:48,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the contract cleaners do a heavy cleaning of the bathrooms.

188
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:57,751
[SPEAKER_16]: We went in and did some sealant tile replacements, replaced locks that needed to be replaced on stall doors, made sure everything was running.

189
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:06,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides being old, we're trying to do what we can for them.

190
00:46:06,895 --> 00:46:08,436
[SPEAKER_16]: They clean, they don't look good.

191
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,691
[SPEAKER_16]: So over the past few years, they used to have Bradley sinks in them.

192
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:19,833
[SPEAKER_16]: We replaced them with regular sinks and put Formica countertops on them.

193
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,815
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Formica's wearing out, it's 15 years old.

194
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:26,958
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, we do have some work to do.

195
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:39,907
[SPEAKER_16]: I think at this point, and I know Pete is gonna allude to it, that we do have some available cash to possibly do at least two of them.

196
00:46:41,272 --> 00:46:50,354
[SPEAKER_16]: over, we just have to make decisions on which ones that we'd like to do and then go through the process of hiring a contractor.

197
00:46:51,594 --> 00:47:03,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also work with Paul DeLaval, which was a big thing, is we got together and we decided that in the mornings, when they open up the cafeteria side for breakfast,

198
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:13,207
[SPEAKER_16]: When they close them, when the kids pass to the hallways, the custodians are going in, cleaning them, making sure they're all clean, and then they don't get open till lunch.

199
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:20,254
[SPEAKER_16]: On the other side, on the guidance side that's been open all morning, we are cleaning them at noontime when they lock.

200
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:26,279
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going in there and freshening them up, trying to keep them as fresh as possible as we can.

201
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:28,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, if there's any issues during the day,

202
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:38,787
[SPEAKER_16]: the assistant principals will contact us and we'll do what we need to do to freshen them up as best we can.

203
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:48,412
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, yeah, so over the holiday break, like I said, we did the heavy duty cleaning in there.

204
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,952
[SPEAKER_16]: They're better, but they're old.

205
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:51,953
[SPEAKER_16]: They just don't show anything.

206
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:55,495
[SPEAKER_16]: They've been painted over and over and over again.

207
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:04,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

208
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:06,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the report.

209
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:14,488
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a question about how students and staff can quickly report things.

210
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,781
[SPEAKER_19]: well-known process that if you ask students and staff, they would have an answer.

211
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,322
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, to that, I can't answer it.

212
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:30,948
[SPEAKER_16]: I would assume that they would go through the assistant principals, or a teacher, or anybody that can get in touch with Headmaster DeLave or whomever.

213
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:46,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Normally, if something goes on in a bathroom, we'll get a report, mainly by the assistant principal, that'll say, hey, we need a clean up here in bathroom two in C building, and then over the radio, and then we'll send somebody right up.

214
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:53,656
[SPEAKER_19]: And how often are custodians actually checking each bathroom throughout the day?

215
00:48:53,997 --> 00:49:04,403
[SPEAKER_18]: So with the schedule that Mr. McLaughlin talked about, we've been trying to kind of clean, shut down, open, clean, shut down, open.

216
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:10,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's happening twice a day, which is more than what we were doing before.

217
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:30,816
[SPEAKER_18]: The frequency of the cleaning also helps us with reporting as well because being an assistant principal and being a male as well or being a headmaster, I can't get into every single bathroom or I have to wait for somebody to come and look at another bathroom as well.

218
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:36,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, what's been helping is that schedule of cleaning.

219
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:49,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Because sort of what we've utilized at the Andrews when I was there as well is that when you're constantly updating the bathrooms, we're getting more reports regarding graffiti, things of that nature.

220
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:58,223
[SPEAKER_18]: For the other stuff, I've always asked, too, if anybody has any concerns or complaints, to just please see me so I can address it.

221
00:49:58,984 --> 00:49:59,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

222
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,661
[SPEAKER_02]: School Committeewoman Kratz.

223
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:04,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

224
00:50:04,622 --> 00:50:04,702
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

225
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the report, Mr. McLaughlin.

226
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:12,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a question, because I know Mr. Falco mentioned that he noticed some black mold.

227
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:13,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just concerned.

228
00:50:13,568 --> 00:50:16,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear that, and I didn't read that in the report that was presented.

229
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:21,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you, when you were doing the deep cleaning, was there any sign of any black mold?

230
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:25,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm afraid I didn't get any reports to that.

231
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:31,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if there's something going on, yeah, we'll go back in there immediately for sure.

232
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And then were the soap dispensers, were they cleaned out?

233
00:50:36,753 --> 00:50:40,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Or were they, do you think maybe it was like particles in the soap dispenser?

234
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it, you know, maybe just a change of soap?

235
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,435
[SPEAKER_16]: The soap dispensers are a closed item, so I don't know.

236
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:51,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we've had some instances in the last month where we had to replace six of them.

237
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:56,217
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't, you know, I don't know how it happened.

238
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:57,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I did.

239
00:50:57,437 --> 00:51:00,158
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I had more information so that I could've

240
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:04,137
[SPEAKER_16]: been conclusive on what was happening.

241
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:18,230
[SPEAKER_16]: And just for the fact that, like I said, if there was insect activity, if there was rodent activity, if there was any kind of activities in there, to get in there as fast as we can.

242
00:51:19,053 --> 00:51:22,895
[SPEAKER_16]: would be the most appropriate thing to do.

243
00:51:23,295 --> 00:51:42,823
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that we know now that we're going to probably get some kind of a reporting system going where the kids know exactly who to either call me, either call headmaster, assistant principal, so that we can respond in a manner that's prudent and fast.

244
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:45,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be helpful if the students

245
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:50,277
[SPEAKER_02]: let us know exactly what location the bathroom is, like C building.

246
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

247
00:51:52,018 --> 00:52:00,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Any information that we can get is going to help the solution to the problem, and as fast as we can get it.

248
00:52:02,603 --> 00:52:05,625
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to reiterate that these are old bathrooms.

249
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:11,548
[SPEAKER_18]: These are bathrooms that we can do the facelift part of everything.

250
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,191
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think where the concern is that we're talking 15 years.

251
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:25,063
[SPEAKER_18]: of a change, and if anything, cars, anything like that need to be updated in that sort of way.

252
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:37,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And like I said, with the reporting process, if we know right away, we do have enough bathrooms at the high school where if we do end up shutting one down, we can notify people which one would be open as well.

253
00:52:38,629 --> 00:52:38,829
[SPEAKER_18]: So.

254
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:40,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

255
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a suggestion.

256
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Would we be able to put just a little

257
00:52:46,802 --> 00:53:00,710
[SPEAKER_02]: note on the website, the Meffitt High School Meffitt Vocational website, just with the brief note that, you know, to inform students and parents if there's an issue to please contact and then provide like the names, you know, if there's an issue in the bathroom.

258
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:04,096
[SPEAKER_02]: if that's something that would be helpful.

259
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:20,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a lot of what might help us, too, is we are working on the see something, say something app, which is going to be rolling out at some point, which is definitely going to be another way to get reporting in as quick as possible.

260
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:27,646
[SPEAKER_16]: And that'll be really good, but for now, the assistant principals, even buildings and grounds, the door's always open.

261
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:30,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on down, we'll go right up there, take care of it.

262
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:32,549
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, everybody's willing to help.

263
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:40,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody wants what we feel or what the students feel is happening.

264
00:53:40,894 --> 00:53:42,175
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want that.

265
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:44,376
[SPEAKER_16]: We want it as good as we can get it.

266
00:53:45,797 --> 00:53:46,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

267
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:49,019
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committee, Woman McLaughlin.

268
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:51,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your report.

269
00:53:52,363 --> 00:54:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to ask, following up on the black mold issue, clearly we have a student that was good enough to bring us in some photographs.

270
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:06,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is black mold somewhere in some of the bathrooms that is a concern.

271
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:12,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the questions that I would have is what is the process for removing black mold in those situations?

272
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know or what do we do?

273
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:22,310
[SPEAKER_16]: We can hit it with the cleaners that we use are sufficient and the green cleaning that can clean it.

274
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I don't know where it was.

275
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:26,573
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't see the picture.

276
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:28,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it like a ceiling tile?

277
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:38,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to add, the pictures are very, very helpful.

278
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I don't know what that is.

279
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,365
[SPEAKER_16]: The ceiling tiles, we went in there and we tried to replace a bunch of them.

280
00:54:46,142 --> 00:54:48,223
[SPEAKER_16]: We replaced a bunch of the stained ceiling tiles.

281
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:51,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're replacing a bunch of the heat registers.

282
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:54,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that looks like it's inside of a bowl.

283
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:56,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know where that could be coming from.

284
00:54:57,489 --> 00:54:57,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Sink?

285
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Joey, sink?

286
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:01,992
[SPEAKER_18]: C3, the countertop.

287
00:55:02,352 --> 00:55:04,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay, all right, all right.

288
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:08,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we might have to take it out and replace it.

289
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:11,998
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't notice it during my tour either.

290
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:13,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

291
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:20,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's going to be a discussion of some funds to at least address, you were saying, perhaps a few of the bathrooms.

292
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:32,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering, I'd like to make a motion that we have maybe a report of how and where those funds are used and what they're being applied to for those bathrooms, maybe within the next 30 days or so.

293
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think.

294
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:48,157
[SPEAKER_16]: actually have that right well the thing what I'm looking at is gutting the bathroom out gone brand-new two of them and that's what the City Council is

295
00:55:48,854 --> 00:55:53,036
[SPEAKER_16]: was expecting and that's I think what Peter's reports can allude to.

296
00:55:53,396 --> 00:56:04,261
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the free cash report that comes later on, we requested in advance of the November 26th City Council report from the Medford City Council, $300,000 of free cash.

297
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:08,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Of that $100,000 is going to be used to gut to the studs two bathrooms.

298
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:12,045
[SPEAKER_15]: There are 16 bathrooms in the high school.

299
00:56:13,466 --> 00:56:17,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. McLaughlin did a very good job in getting a cost estimate simply to retile.

300
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,093
[SPEAKER_15]: So no plumbing, no other things, no demolition.

301
00:56:22,315 --> 00:56:25,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Retiling over what is already there was going to be over $400,000 for those 16 bathrooms.

302
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:38,371
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so hopefully we'll be able to do annual gut and rebuild as free cash or other funds become available to really start a process.

303
00:56:38,611 --> 00:56:46,940
[SPEAKER_15]: There have been conversations about this since I got here in July about the fact that the bathrooms are in need.

304
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,843
[SPEAKER_15]: The vice principals, the headmaster, the maintenance and facilities,

305
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:57,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I myself go through the bathrooms and pick up litter left behind and different things like that as I see it.

306
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:02,797
[SPEAKER_15]: And really would like to implore our students to make sure that they're taking care of their house as well.

307
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:09,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And make sure that when we rebuild these bathrooms that they become a source of pride and a source of respect.

308
00:57:11,763 --> 00:57:13,583
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's a substantial cash investment.

309
00:57:14,104 --> 00:57:20,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this will be ripping out to the studs, replacing ventilation, lighting, the entire thing.

310
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is essentially a new bathroom from the studs out.

311
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:27,546
[SPEAKER_15]: That cost right now is estimated at $50,000 per bathroom.

312
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:37,788
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be having some of our students in our vocational technical side of the school to be able to assist with that as necessary and as they are available.

313
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:39,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

314
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:57,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as a follow-up, so to the reporting process and policies and procedures, so there was a, I'm not sure how this process goes, bear with me, I'm first time, but for the motion that I had on the floor, do we make a vote on that or?

315
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:00,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You could ask which ones will be done within the next 30 days.

316
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a motion for which ones will be done in the next 30 days with a report and maybe some

317
00:58:05,225 --> 00:58:09,507
[SPEAKER_04]: photo evidence, you know, when it's done to show us how nice they look so we can celebrate that as well.

318
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,247
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have photo evidence, we'll be having toys, we'll be having everything.

319
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be nice.

320
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:20,150
[SPEAKER_04]: No, really, so we can see sort of the process would be really helpful and to be able to share and celebrate sort of it moving forward.

321
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:25,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a motion on the floor for an update on that, where and when this will be done.

322
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:26,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

323
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, thank you.

324
00:58:27,492 --> 00:58:29,433
[SPEAKER_16]: As soon as we, as soon as, I know that we're gonna have a

325
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:32,292
[SPEAKER_16]: a session and discuss it.

326
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:41,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that Dr. Maurice had an idea of which one she may want to do, and I have an idea of what we want.

327
00:58:41,077 --> 00:58:42,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to get together.

328
00:58:43,238 --> 00:58:47,260
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll tell you ahead of time which ones we're actually going to do.

329
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:54,224
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll keep you updated during the process, obviously, as much as you need to be updated.

330
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,126
[SPEAKER_16]: And like I said, afterwards, we'll have a ribbon cutting.

331
00:58:57,146 --> 00:58:57,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

332
00:58:58,207 --> 00:58:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

333
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:00,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

334
00:59:00,635 --> 00:59:01,816
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee woman Graham.

335
00:59:04,436 --> 00:59:26,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give us a better understanding of when see click fix or whatever it's called will be a reality because I'm concerned about the reporting process for lots of reasons and I think one of the main reasons I'm concerned is because I think our principals and our assistant principals and you all have pressing things that happen every single day and for

336
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:35,603
[SPEAKER_10]: for those folks to be responsible for that kind of reporting and problem solving feels like the wrong use of resources.

337
00:59:37,204 --> 00:59:44,751
[SPEAKER_10]: That application could go a long way to helping those issues be reported in a more timely fashion so that they can be fixed.

338
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:50,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just curious what your timeline is there and whether that's imminent or there's work to do.

339
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:55,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that whole process of clarity would be really helpful.

340
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:58,036
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we were in queue.

341
00:59:58,116 --> 01:00:01,857
[SPEAKER_16]: The company that does it, I believe that they're from Sandy Hook.

342
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:03,837
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a free application.

343
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:07,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that we're in queue for it.

344
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:08,758
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just waiting to see.

345
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:18,261
[SPEAKER_16]: At the time, when we were making the decision whether to use it or not, we just had, we weren't, I believe, in there first.

346
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:22,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we got put onto a waiting list.

347
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a free app, so it's not gonna cost the city anything.

348
01:00:25,683 --> 01:00:31,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And when it becomes available, we decided that we were going to take it up on it.

349
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:33,888
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't exactly have a timeline.

350
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:39,332
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping it's within the school year, obviously the sooner the better, that we could employ something like that.

351
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:42,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not just going to be for buildings and rounds issues.

352
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:50,299
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be for students that need it and whomever feels the need to use it.

353
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:55,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we follow up and get an update on the timeline at our next meeting?

354
01:00:56,143 --> 01:00:56,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

355
01:00:56,504 --> 01:00:56,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

356
01:00:57,525 --> 01:00:57,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a motion?

357
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:03,475
[SPEAKER_11]: School committee woman, Vanda Kloot.

358
01:01:04,776 --> 01:01:05,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Two things.

359
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:13,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to remind the committee that we had put together a five-year capital improvement plan at the end of last spring.

360
01:01:14,242 --> 01:01:17,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And the bathrooms were part of that plan, if I recall.

361
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:21,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So we might want to take that out again, take a look at it.

362
01:01:22,648 --> 01:01:25,630
[SPEAKER_11]: We had anticipated that there would be certain monies available.

363
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:30,372
[SPEAKER_11]: and just so that we're on track and consistent with that.

364
01:01:31,012 --> 01:01:35,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And we may need to revisit it, of course, but the bathrooms were certainly an issue.

365
01:01:35,614 --> 01:01:45,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And then secondarily, I also want this really falls, there's the sort of short-term immediacy of the issue, but there is the long-term.

366
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:52,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And from our subcommittee on buildings and grounds led by Kathy Kretz, we made a motion that we would

367
01:01:53,923 --> 01:02:01,309
[SPEAKER_11]: have a larger committee put together appointed by the mayor to look into the high school renovations.

368
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:10,176
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I know it's your first day, but that obviously is something that this falls underneath because how much money are we going to invest?

369
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:11,777
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the long term plan?

370
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:12,978
[SPEAKER_11]: What makes sense?

371
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:16,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, John, we need all of your efforts right now to make sure that the

372
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,861
[SPEAKER_11]: they're as presentable as possible.

373
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:19,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

374
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:23,884
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to invest some short-term money, but there is a long-term issue as well.

375
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:31,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what had happened over the years is we were wishing for an MSBA grant.

376
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:40,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ruzzo mentioned it at a meeting not so long ago that we were rated one out of four, one being the best.

377
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:45,457
[SPEAKER_16]: So it doesn't seem like that would be something that would be coming to Medford any time too soon.

378
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:47,619
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I believe Ms.

379
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:53,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Kretz decided that we need to get together and make a list of priorities.

380
01:02:53,705 --> 01:02:55,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Like you just alluded to, Ms.

381
01:02:55,066 --> 01:03:03,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Vandekloot, of how we want to tackle Mefford High School in regard to our capital improvements or funding.

382
01:03:04,172 --> 01:03:04,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

383
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:10,177
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council.

384
01:03:10,197 --> 01:03:10,637
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you.

385
01:03:10,657 --> 01:03:11,758
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee woman, Ms.

386
01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:12,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Stone.

387
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:16,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to hear about the two bathrooms, obviously.

388
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:17,682
[SPEAKER_08]: My ninth grader, Teagan,

389
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,793
[SPEAKER_08]: shares with Joey's concerns on a regular basis.

390
01:03:21,313 --> 01:03:25,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if there's a way, if there's any surplus in the budget, Ms.

391
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:32,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Patterson, if it would be cost effective to try to do four bathrooms if we're having a contracting company in.

392
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:37,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's, I'm glad we're trying to do two at a time.

393
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:40,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But from what I hear, all 16 need to be done now.

394
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm wondering if there's a way we can put our brains together to see if there's more free cash, or if there's a surplus at the end, or if this can be a priority in our budget hearings.

395
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:53,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

396
01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:56,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the more the merrier, the way I see it.

397
01:03:56,525 --> 01:03:59,808
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing is planning a project like that.

398
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:09,035
[SPEAKER_16]: It's right in the middle where the kids are, so we'd have to do some very strategic planning in order to accomplish a project like that.

399
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:15,718
[SPEAKER_16]: It may even require moving kids out of certain places, similar to what we did with the science lab.

400
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:24,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Not on the scale that we had to do it for the science lab, but it may take moving classes for sure.

401
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:28,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

402
01:04:28,924 --> 01:04:29,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all set.

403
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:30,205
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all set.

404
01:04:30,225 --> 01:04:30,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

405
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:33,813
[SPEAKER_02]: school committeewoman Kretz.

406
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:44,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mayor Longo Kern, I just wanted to know if, and I don't know what the timeline would be to find out the status of the app, because I know I submitted an application.

407
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:46,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I know several other people that submitted an application to the vision committee.

408
01:04:48,404 --> 01:04:51,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody reviewing those applications?

409
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:54,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do we know where those applications are?

410
01:04:54,909 --> 01:04:55,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

411
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:56,790
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could

412
01:04:58,989 --> 01:04:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

413
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:00,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering.

414
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Superintendent's office has them.

415
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

416
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're going to work.

417
01:05:04,152 --> 01:05:07,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent and I will work together to appoint as soon as possible.

418
01:05:07,394 --> 01:05:07,694
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

419
01:05:07,754 --> 01:05:10,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know she's going through something in the next couple of days.

420
01:05:10,576 --> 01:05:10,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

421
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:16,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once I review that, as well as the other committees with her, that can be released hopefully by next week.

422
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

423
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

424
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:17,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

425
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,981
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman Graham.

426
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:26,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I also make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to revisit our capital plan?

427
01:05:27,696 --> 01:05:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: There are new members of the committee our New leader is in place and I think it is time to start to talk about that capital plan again I don't recall the bathrooms being on there in a meaningful way.

428
01:05:41,088 --> 01:05:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's time for us to have that conversation In a committee of the whole meeting Yes.

429
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:47,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you

430
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,522
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman McLaughlin.

431
01:05:54,503 --> 01:05:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

432
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:57,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if we now have three motions on the floor?

433
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'll call them at the end.

434
01:05:59,548 --> 01:06:03,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll review them and we'll take a roll call vote unless there's a motion to sever.

435
01:06:03,831 --> 01:06:04,172

[SPEAKER_07]: And then.

[SPEAKER_16]: Just for the record, Mayor, that the name of the app is See Something, Say Something.

[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:41,384
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

445
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't think it was the same as the city side, but that's what I heard.

446
01:06:44,306 --> 01:06:44,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, no, absolutely.

447

[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:59,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our third motion is for, by School Committeewoman Graham, for Committee of the Whole to revisit the capital plan.

453
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:01,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have a motion?

454
01:07:02,683 --> 01:07:09,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to accept by Councilwoman Stone, seconded by Vice Chair Rousseau.

455

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

460
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:16,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Mr. Falco, for coming to voice your concern.

461
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:18,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

462
01:07:20,312 --> 01:07:25,235
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, is there any other community participation?

463
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:31,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Citywide Elementary School, is that what you're?

464
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:35,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, can I participate in what we were just talking about?

465
01:07:35,787 --> 01:07:36,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that okay?

466
01:07:37,148 --> 01:07:37,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

467
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:41,009
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rochelle Patterson, I'm from 146 Fern Road.

468
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:55,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two girls currently in high school, one's a sophomore, one's a junior, and I just wanted to reiterate the importance of, I know money and time is an issue with doing the bathrooms, but just wanted to reiterate how important it is.

469
01:07:56,054 --> 01:07:57,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear from them frequently,

470
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,721
[SPEAKER_03]: how they don't go to the bathroom throughout the day.

471
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,882
[SPEAKER_03]: They're afraid to drink water because they'll have to use the bathroom.

472
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of disturbing to hear.

473
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So just want to reiterate the importance of, in a timely manner, maybe something could be done.

474
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:14,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

475
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:15,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

476
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:16,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

477
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're into community participation, we have the Citywide Elementary Alliance Disney raffle drawing tonight.

478
01:08:24,848 --> 01:08:25,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Exciting.

479
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:29,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have Christy Avino here and Bailey Shindell.

480
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:30,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

481
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,521
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as Melissa DeMeo and her son who are going to help us pull the lottery tickets.

482
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:35,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll leave the floor to you ladies.

483
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:38,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Bailey Shindell, 46 Washington Street.

484
01:08:39,878 --> 01:08:53,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Lungo Kern, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, and school committee members, we are so very pleased to present a drawing of the second Winne-Disney Vacation Raffle organized by the Medford City Elementary Alliance.

485
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:59,233
[SPEAKER_00]: The Elementary Alliance is a working group of four elementary school PTOs and PTGs.

486
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:06,919
[SPEAKER_00]: This all began about 18 months ago when a group of parents and teachers from across the city came together to explore the idea

487
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:11,521
[SPEAKER_00]: of working together on a project or two to benefit all four elementary schools.

488
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:24,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the terrific ideas and incredible hard work of the group, in the first year, we put on three events and raised over $30,000, well beyond our wildest expectations when we first gathered together.

489
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:47,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the initial motivator was fundraising to support the PTOs and PTGs, which fund crucial things like buses for field trips, student enrichment activities, and teacher support, we also discovered the group gave us the opportunity to share best practices and other ideas, as well as the opportunity to advocate together for our elementary schools.

490
01:09:48,232 --> 01:10:00,235
[SPEAKER_00]: This year the group formalized a working relationship among the elementary PTOs and PTGs and adopted the name Citywide Elementary Alliance to further support the group's ability to work together.

491
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:03,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been off to a strong start this year.

492
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:11,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Early this year we had an electronics recycling event and we are again hosting the Wizards basketball team here at Medford High School in March.

493
01:10:12,258 --> 01:10:13,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for more details.

494
01:10:14,768 --> 01:10:15,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the Disney raffle.

495
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:21,350
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to overstate the significance of the community to this fundraising effort.

496
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:30,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get on to the drawing of the winner of this raffle, we'd like to say thank you to a few people whose support has been instrumental in our success.

497
01:10:30,912 --> 01:10:42,655
[SPEAKER_00]: First, from our city government, we'd like to thank Superintendent Edward Vincent, outgoing Mayor Stephanie Burke and her staff, including Allie Fisk and Deanna Devaney.

498
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:52,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also to Kevin Bailey and Danny Folks from the Recreation Department and City Clerk Adam Herdebeest.

499
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:56,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Our elementary school principals have also been critical supporters as well.

500
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:05,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to Principal Johnson from the Roberts, Principal Guarino from the McGlynn, Principal Kaye from the Columbus, and Principal Galusi from the Brooks.

501
01:11:05,945 --> 01:11:08,086
[SPEAKER_00]: and their staff and all the teachers who have helped.

502
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:16,472
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger Medford community has again been incredibly supportive of this effort, and we give a huge thank you to St.

503
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:28,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis of Assisi Church, the Friends of the Medford Public Library, 4 Good Vibes, and Stop and Shop for welcoming us into their business and events to sell raffle tickets.

504
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:34,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi all, I'm Christy Avino, 24 Carberry Street.

505
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:48,874
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to take a moment before we get to drawing the winner to acknowledge our fantastic Disney captains who have done so much work and dedicated many hours of their time, even though they and their families are prohibited from entering this amazing drawing.

506
01:11:49,154 --> 01:11:59,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Our captains included myself and my co-chair, Jenny Graham, Jen Conti, Melissa DeMeo, who's here, Doug Nagengast, Katie Hogan, Emma Heffern, who's here from the Columbus,

507
01:11:59,943 --> 01:12:02,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Gary Papps, Bailey Shindell, and Renee Hanley.

508
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:08,049
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also must thank one person without whom none of this would be possible.

509
01:12:08,509 --> 01:12:11,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to Tamara Morrow, who is our treasurer.

510
01:12:11,672 --> 01:12:13,473
[SPEAKER_17]: She's the treasurer of the Brooks PTO.

511
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:21,999
[SPEAKER_17]: She's taken on an absolutely critical task and time-intensive task of handling the finances, the tax reporting, and compliance.

512
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:28,784
[SPEAKER_17]: You've heard us say it before, raffle compliance is a serious business and one that I think Tamara never thought she would find herself in.

513
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:30,412
[SPEAKER_17]: But here we are.

514
01:12:30,452 --> 01:12:36,335
[SPEAKER_17]: We also want to thank our PTO and PTG boards and the parents who sold tickets.

515
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:40,297
[SPEAKER_17]: This year we had a very friendly competition for top salesperson.

516
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:49,522
[SPEAKER_17]: We think it was a very close tie between my eight-year-old son, Owen, and Robert Elementary School parent, Steve DeMayo, who was very, very, very involved.

517
01:12:49,862 --> 01:12:51,463
[SPEAKER_17]: They both dedicated dozens of hours.

518
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:54,424
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw them selling tickets all over at the city event.

519
01:12:55,344 --> 01:13:05,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Steve DeMayo's 8-year-old son Matthew is here and is going to assist Mayor Lungo Kern in picking the winner ticket, the winner to winning tickets.

520
01:13:07,108 --> 01:13:10,569
[SPEAKER_17]: This year, just to give you some information, we sold at my last count 3,584 tickets.

521
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:17,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Our gross sales plus donations pending Tamara's final accounting are just about $18,000.

522
01:13:18,154 --> 01:13:20,775
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is just really, thank you.

523
01:13:25,178 --> 01:13:26,679
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just really incredible.

524
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:29,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you give that, yeah, give it a couple of spins, Matthew.

525
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:30,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Mix them all up.

526
01:13:31,547 --> 01:13:50,216
[SPEAKER_17]: This is incredible that when you think that we sold tickets for just about two months this year, actually less time than last year due to sort of all of the organization in putting together a working agreement for the four PTOs and also sort of this Christmas break, holiday break that was during our selling period.

527
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:59,980
[SPEAKER_17]: This year after we pay expenses and file the tax returns and also pay the state a gaming tax, our PTOs and P2Gs will receive about $3,000 each.

528
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:08,043
[SPEAKER_17]: which is a huge boost and will really go far in supporting critical needs for our students and our teachers.

529
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:13,205
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you would please draw and announce the grand prize winner first.

530
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:14,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're going to teamwork this.

531
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:18,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Matthew's going to draw and his eyes are closed and I'll announce it, okay?

532
01:14:19,046 --> 01:14:19,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

533
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:20,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Close your eyes.

534
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:21,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We already spun it.

535
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:24,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Dig deep.

536
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You've sold so many you can almost not fit anymore in this bucket.

537
01:14:28,949 --> 01:14:29,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

538
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:30,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so full.

539
01:14:33,689 --> 01:14:39,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And the winner is from Stoneham Mass, Jim Corcoran, Jr.

540
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:41,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

541

[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, Jim.

542
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:43,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

543
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,842
[SPEAKER_17]: The grand prize for the raffle is $5,000 in Disney gift cards or a $5,000 cash option.

544
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:55,825
[SPEAKER_17]: The prize must be claimed within seven business days.

545
01:14:55,865 --> 01:14:57,946
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll give the winner a call tonight.

546
01:14:57,966 --> 01:14:58,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Matthew will help.

547
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:01,708
[SPEAKER_17]: And would you please pull the second prize winner?

548

01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:28,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Second prize is a $250 Disney gift card and we'll get in touch with that winner as well.

554
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:29,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you all so very much.

555
01:15:30,013 --> 01:15:34,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your support of our elementary schools and our fundraising effort.

556
01:15:34,636 --> 01:15:34,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:35,557

561
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:19,005
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:20,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper passes.

563
01:16:20,106 --> 01:16:23,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we're done with community participation.

564
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:24,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

565
01:16:24,487 --> 01:16:24,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

566
01:16:25,187 --> 01:16:26,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Reports of superintendent.

567
01:16:26,488 --> 01:16:31,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell to give us that report.

[SPEAKER_13]: I know that together all of us will make sure we have successful students as we go through the years.

574
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:10,970
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just have one quick report that I'd like to make you aware of tonight.

575
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:16,033
[SPEAKER_13]: We had some sad news from the Oconte Rink over the holiday break.

576
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:34,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Our Mustang boys hockey team was playing a game against Norwell and one of our, not our, one of Norwell's team suffered a medical emergency and it's unfortunate but this person did not live and his son was actually playing on the ice.

577
01:17:35,306 --> 01:17:38,270
[SPEAKER_13]: But our team, our Mustang boys stepped up.

578
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:44,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to read a short letter to you that was sent to us from the team.

579
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:48,423
[SPEAKER_13]: This subject of the matter is with gratitude.

580
01:17:49,505 --> 01:18:01,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Mr. DeLeva, Mr. Maloney, and Mr. Bates, I'm writing to thank you, your coaches, and your players for your kindness and your grace during what was a very difficult time for our family.

581
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:14,148
[SPEAKER_13]: On Sunday, December 22nd, a dear friend of ours, Patrick Fetushia, passed away from a brain aneurysm after collapsing at a hockey game, watching his son, Sam, play the game they all loved.

582
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:22,758
[SPEAKER_13]: This game was a high school hockey contest between Norwell and Medford on December 21st at Le Conte Memorial Ice Rink.

583
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:35,147
[SPEAKER_13]: My two nephews play for Norwell and are lifelong friends of the Fetusha boys and our family, and they've known and loved Patrick, his wife, Evan, and their three boys for many, many years.

584
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:42,832
[SPEAKER_13]: At the wake for Patrick on Friday evening, we were extremely moved by the actions

585
01:18:44,281 --> 01:18:47,265
[SPEAKER_13]: of the Medford boys hockey team and their coaches.

586
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:55,738
[SPEAKER_13]: For these boys and their coaches to take the time during this very busy season to come all the way down to Hanover

587
01:18:56,259 --> 01:19:07,282
[SPEAKER_13]: to stand in a very long line to pay respects to the family of a man none of you has ever met goes above and beyond and is truly extraordinary.

588
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:13,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I have always believed that youth sports are about teaching our kids so much more than how to play a game.

589
01:19:14,564 --> 01:19:19,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And the actions of your team and coaches is an excellent example of this.

590
01:19:20,546 --> 01:19:23,027
[SPEAKER_13]: I cannot tell you how much it meant to all of us.

591
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:27,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Please know you have my utmost appreciation and respect.

592
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:30,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Best of luck with the rest of your season.

593
01:19:30,652 --> 01:19:32,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Kirsten Ward from a parent.

594
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:44,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so obviously I don't have to say to you how absolutely proud we are of our boys and our coaches to take the time during the holiday season

595
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,351
[SPEAKER_13]: to drive all the way down to stand in those long lines.

596
01:19:48,512 --> 01:19:55,815
[SPEAKER_13]: We teach the kids more than just fighting and hockey, but we teach them sportsmanship, and it builds character.

597
01:19:55,855 --> 01:19:58,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm so, so very proud of our team.

598
01:19:59,637 --> 01:20:00,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all I have.

599
01:20:00,817 --> 01:20:01,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

600
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

601
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:21,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, after a sad announcement, I think we have a... We have a great announcement right now.

602
01:20:21,673 --> 01:20:32,157
[SPEAKER_07]: A great announcement in recognition of Medford High School senior Max Stevens for achieving a gold medal in the Deaflympics by Dr. Edward Vincent.

603
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:37,740
[SPEAKER_13]: So Medford High School senior Max Stevens, can you come up, Max, please, to the podium?

604
01:20:43,702 --> 01:20:59,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford High School senior Max Stevens traveled to Italy to represent the United States as part of the USA National Deaf Ice Hockey Team at the 2019 Winter Deaflympics.

605
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:04,202

608
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:21,436
[SPEAKER_13]: We are delighted to recognize Max for this honor today.

[SPEAKER_01]: to be here tonight, and thank you for the recognition.

612
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:34,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great experience.

613
01:21:34,715 --> 01:21:35,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of fun.

614
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:36,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a lot of great people.

615
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:41,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a lot of great hockey connections, and overall, an absolute blast.

01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:42,399

[SPEAKER_13]: Can you come up so we can shake your hand, please?

619
01:21:46,922 --> 01:21:48,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Emily, do you have the, it's up here?

620
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:48,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

621
01:21:48,983 --> 01:21:49,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just do everybody right in front.

01:22:50,497 --> 01:22:50,817
[SPEAKER_13]: He does.

631
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:51,918

[SPEAKER_09]: Where's your medal?

633
01:22:53,058 --> 01:22:53,299
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

634
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:54,939
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

635
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:55,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

636
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, look at that.

[SPEAKER_13]: Joe has the best hat.

640
01:23:01,263 --> 01:23:02,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And he has a pocket.

641
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:04,705
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have been wearing that the whole time.

642
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:05,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

643
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:06,546
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

644
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:07,266
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, Mom and Dad.

645
01:23:07,326 --> 01:23:10,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you put up your certificate so we can see the medal?

646
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:11,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

647
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:12,520
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

648
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

649
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:14,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheese.

650
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:15,282
[SPEAKER_08]: One more.

651
01:23:15,322 --> 01:23:18,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheese, Dad.

652
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:18,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

653
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,369
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we want a picture with the school committee as well.

654
01:23:21,389 --> 01:23:21,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

655
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:21,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

656
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:24,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And we started actually waiting so long.

657
01:23:24,492 --> 01:23:25,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

658
01:23:25,573 --> 01:23:25,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

659
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:26,234
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

660
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:27,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

661
01:23:27,315 --> 01:23:27,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

662
01:23:27,595 --> 01:23:28,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on down.

663
01:23:28,116 --> 01:23:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take a picture.

664
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

665
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:29,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

666
01:23:29,757 --> 01:23:30,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

667
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:31,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats to you.

668
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Did the whole family get to visit you?

669
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:35,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

670
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:35,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

671
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:38,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I get a picture with all of them?

672
01:23:38,423 --> 01:23:39,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, absolutely.

673
01:23:39,363 --> 01:23:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

674
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:40,864
[SPEAKER_09]: My pleasure.

675
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:48,188
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys all fit with this one.

676
01:24:02,441 --> 01:24:05,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we see you, Mr. Stevens?

677
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:07,323
[SPEAKER_18]: You're kind of... There we go.

678
01:24:07,783 --> 01:24:08,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Ready?

679
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:11,844
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to try again?

680
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:14,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do three.

681
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:15,166
[SPEAKER_18]: One more.

682
01:24:16,586 --> 01:24:17,086
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

683
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:36,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

684
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:39,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

685
01:24:40,269 --> 01:24:40,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

686
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:44,212
[SPEAKER_09]: He gets nothing for it.

687
01:24:44,252 --> 01:24:47,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations, gentlemen.

688
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:48,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

689
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you did, yeah?

690
01:24:50,016 --> 01:24:51,157
Yeah, yeah.

691
01:24:51,197 --> 01:24:51,997
Thank you.

692
01:24:52,037 --> 01:24:52,458
Thank you.

693
01:26:01,067 --> 01:26:02,968
[SPEAKER_07]: 2019 closeout by Christine Patterson.

694
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:09,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

695
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:14,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, members of the school committee and Madam Mayor, Luan Gokaran.

696
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:17,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to provide you a closeout report for fiscal year 19.

697
01:26:17,852 --> 01:26:22,033
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the school year.

698
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:27,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just kind of provide some general information, layman's terms for the

699
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:41,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Accounting just for the benefit of the new members the 2019 appropriation is the budget so on many of the documents you'll see the word appropriation Which is the budget that has been allocated by the city?

700
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:49,161
[SPEAKER_05]: so the budget for FY 19 was 58 million six hundred eight six hundred thirty dollars and

701
01:26:50,005 --> 01:27:00,871
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an additional $2,020,381 earmarked from other revenue sources that provided an overall budget of services of $60,629,011.

702
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:14,178
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Mass General Law's municipal accounting auditing requirements, the general fund, which is the budget appropriation from the city, cannot be in a deficit from the appropriation amount authorized.

703
01:27:14,638 --> 01:27:19,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So I cannot show you a deficit budget, which is why you have been provided the

704
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:21,693
[SPEAKER_05]: backup for the closeout.

705
01:27:22,393 --> 01:27:31,636
[SPEAKER_05]: The balance of the revenue was used to clear any deficits within school revolving funds such as athletics, pool, rink, and community schools.

706
01:27:32,436 --> 01:27:44,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So each year, each new budgeting year, the intent is to adequately fund areas that support our student programs and provide for the gaps that cannot be recovered through user fees and additional charges and our rate increases.

707
01:27:45,260 --> 01:28:02,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So our goal has been to increase the budget appropriation from the city in order to provide the level of service that we need, and as we've identified, addressing some of the capital improvements that will be going forward as well.

708
01:28:02,769 --> 01:28:10,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to reiterate, we do have those capital meetings along with our budget process.

709
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So after we address our buildings and grounds department program area,

710
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:20,627
[SPEAKER_05]: we are also obtaining the information for capital planning.

711
01:28:21,888 --> 01:28:31,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So the areas identified for the fiscal year appropriation savings that we had identified were larger areas were in the undistributed salaries.

712
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:37,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, just trying to guide you through your new reporting that you're looking at.

713
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The program area, which is a three-digit code,

714
01:28:41,811 --> 01:28:45,614
[SPEAKER_05]: 004 is district-wide undistributed salaries.

715
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:53,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this was budgeted in preparation for the salary negotiations of all of our main unions.

716
01:28:53,779 --> 01:29:02,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, we did not provide any COLA increases within the program areas, departments, and the like.

717
01:29:02,965 --> 01:29:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So we funded one line item in good faith for that negotiating period.

718
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:11,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks as though nothing was spent, but that was the purpose for this.

719
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:21,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And going forward, those COLAs will be addressed in each department based on the salaries that teachers and paraprofessionals are within that coding area.

720
01:29:23,033 --> 01:29:39,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The district-wide account under the 005, the major savings we had was the assistant superintendent position that we had budgeted last fiscal year had not been able to be filled at that point in time, so that was considered savings.

721
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:45,726
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 017, or the vocational programming area, we did have staffing changes.

722
01:29:46,286 --> 01:29:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some resignations, retirements, and the replacements resulted in lower than projected budget amounts.

723
01:29:54,232 --> 01:30:02,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Within our library media, code 029, we did have staffing changes as well that had lower than projected budget amounts.

724
01:30:03,775 --> 01:30:11,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our last category of transportation, or the 033, our homeless transportation and additional runs came in lower than projected.

725
01:30:12,257 --> 01:30:12,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a good thing.

726
01:30:13,197 --> 01:30:15,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like to see our homeless transportation

727
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:22,270
[SPEAKER_05]: so high because that indicates we've got more homeless that are in and out of the district.

728
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:31,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So each year during the budgeting process, our revenue sources are identified to supplement the appropriated budget as a means to achieve the district goals.

729
01:30:32,336 --> 01:30:35,598
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we will be looking at starting our budget season.

730
01:30:35,798 --> 01:30:41,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You will be presented with potential dates for Committee of the Wholes as we

731
01:30:43,525 --> 01:30:47,466
[SPEAKER_05]: prioritized in our process last year that seemed to work very efficiently.

732
01:30:48,366 --> 01:30:54,628
[SPEAKER_05]: The amounts utilized from each source were dependent on program needs and the available balances.

733
01:30:55,208 --> 01:31:03,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we closed out and reconciled the fiscal year 19, the after school program was identified, the before school programs

734
01:31:04,598 --> 01:31:07,784
[SPEAKER_05]: The MEEP, which is the Medford Early Education Program.

735
01:31:08,465 --> 01:31:14,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Circuit Breaker, which is state-funded special education tuition costs.

736
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:24,971
[SPEAKER_05]: transportation reimbursement and vocational tuitions and transportation reimbursements from the state and other providers, as well as our building facility rentals.

737
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:36,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of these revenue sources provided additional services and they covered the additional categories of costs that was above and beyond what we were allocated by the city.

738
01:31:37,635 --> 01:31:49,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a summary of the revolving funds, I've also provided that document for your review and identification of the various revolving accounts that we do have.

739
01:31:49,763 --> 01:31:52,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am open to any questions that you might have.

740
01:31:54,286 --> 01:31:55,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

741
01:31:56,407 --> 01:31:58,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for this report.

742
01:31:58,608 --> 01:32:06,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just suggest, so that we don't have to listen to me for 20 minutes, that maybe we could do it page by page, if that makes sense to everybody else.

743
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:13,316
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have a number of questions, which I think will be easy and quick to answer.

744
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:23,801
[SPEAKER_19]: But on page one, under the finance, the technology tech spec line, the expenditures were

745
01:32:25,132 --> 01:32:26,813
[SPEAKER_19]: a lot more than planned.

746
01:32:26,873 --> 01:32:28,194
[SPEAKER_19]: What is that expenditure?

747
01:32:28,434 --> 01:32:32,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a contract service and support line item.

748
01:32:32,356 --> 01:32:40,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had additional monitoring services for various fees that we have for district-wide technology initiatives.

749
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our Comcast.

750
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are different areas that we have for technology needs.

751
01:32:45,314 --> 01:32:51,596
[SPEAKER_19]: And do you predict that to be something that we, in the next cycle, you'll put in at a quarter of a million, or is it just this was a weird year?

752
01:32:51,796 --> 01:32:53,517
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's a bubble year.

753
01:32:53,657 --> 01:33:03,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I will reiterate that there are line items within the budget program area that are going to, some are going to be higher, some are going to be a deficit.

754
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:09,522
[SPEAKER_05]: We land on the bottom line number, and that's where our appropriation is, our budget.

755
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

756
01:33:11,742 --> 01:33:13,663
[SPEAKER_19]: And further down under,

757
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:18,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, actually, that was the last thing on that page.

758
01:33:19,102 --> 01:33:26,406
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess if anybody else has something on page one, I could also just keep going to page two.

759
01:33:26,426 --> 01:33:31,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I have something on page one.

760
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:33,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Page one?

761
01:33:34,231 --> 01:33:35,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, page one.

762
01:33:35,432 --> 01:33:36,953
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee woman McLaughlin.

763
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:37,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

764
01:33:39,452 --> 01:33:40,854
[SPEAKER_04]: on the district-wide substitutes.

765
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a really large deficit on the substitutes.

766
01:33:46,519 --> 01:33:59,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering about that, since I'm hearing, at least from community, when we were out talking and asking questions about what was important to people, that substitutes has been a longstanding concern and issue.

767
01:33:59,931 --> 01:34:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if you could tell me a little.

768
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:07,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So that indicates that we do have a lot of substitute fees and costs.

769
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:13,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So when there are extended long-term coverages, they would be covered out of a substitute account.

770
01:34:13,473 --> 01:34:22,677
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the daily substitutes that are within each of the buildings on the outside, as well as the main, the high school building.

771
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a true cost.

772
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:30,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still have difficulty getting enough daily substitutes to cover

773
01:34:30,729 --> 01:34:32,471
[SPEAKER_05]: the absences in a given day.

774
01:34:32,911 --> 01:34:41,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have increased our daily rate in hopes to recruit more daily subs.

775
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:44,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a difficult position to fill.

776
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just a Medford issue.

777
01:34:46,865 --> 01:34:51,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a problem with many school systems in the Commonwealth.

778
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:53,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a per diem

779
01:34:53,544 --> 01:35:02,687
[SPEAKER_05]: position, there's no benefits, it's as you go, day to day, people will fill in bids for jobs that are open on any given day.

780
01:35:03,087 --> 01:35:04,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask what the daily rate is?

781
01:35:05,128 --> 01:35:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $90.

782
01:35:06,269 --> 01:35:13,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $90 for the daily rate for a Medford substitute, and we're about almost $100,000 over for the cost of substitutes for the budget.

783
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:13,911
[SPEAKER_04]: For last year.

784
01:35:15,832 --> 01:35:16,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

785
01:35:19,693 --> 01:35:21,194
[SPEAKER_10]: School Committeewoman Graham.

786
01:35:22,549 --> 01:35:25,671
[SPEAKER_10]: How does our substitute rate compare to surrounding communities?

787
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:28,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We've increased it a couple of times.

788
01:35:28,733 --> 01:35:35,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're getting very close to what other municipalities are paying in that regard.

789
01:35:35,617 --> 01:35:38,358
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not paying what Boston public would be paying.

790
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:41,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not paying what Lexington would be paying.

791
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:48,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're competitive in the comparison of size of our school system.

792
01:35:52,145 --> 01:35:57,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a number that you could share about somebody that you think is sort of relative?

793
01:35:59,172 --> 01:36:02,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, $90 is a competitive rate.

794
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:04,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're seeing.

795
01:36:04,557 --> 01:36:06,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We were much lower.

796
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:07,160
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at $70.

797
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we were at $80.

798
01:36:08,381 --> 01:36:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at $90 now.

799
01:36:09,902 --> 01:36:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a competitive rate for the locals that we can certainly look toward.

800
01:36:16,954 --> 01:36:24,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do pay higher rates for those that are licensed and those that are coming in for long-term coverages.

801
01:36:24,599 --> 01:36:30,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another incentive that we try to gain folks to stay within our district.

802
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:32,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

803
01:36:33,825 --> 01:36:34,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

804
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:36,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Page two.

805
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:43,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

806
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:43,832
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good.

807
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:44,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

808
01:36:45,874 --> 01:36:48,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I canceled all my questions on page two for some reason.

809
01:36:48,816 --> 01:36:51,438
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't have anything on page two.

810
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:51,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

811
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:55,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody?

812
01:36:57,423 --> 01:36:59,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give everybody a second to review page two.

813
01:37:02,867 --> 01:37:03,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to go first?

814
01:37:03,768 --> 01:37:03,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

815
01:37:05,783 --> 01:37:07,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's more of a follow.

816
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:10,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the substitutes again.

817
01:37:11,067 --> 01:37:13,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the permanent substitutes?

818
01:37:14,088 --> 01:37:14,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

819
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

820
01:37:15,169 --> 01:37:16,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an additional 45.

821
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it is about 130 over budget that we're at currently for substitutes.

822
01:37:25,296 --> 01:37:25,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

823
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:27,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Including permanent substitutes.

824
01:37:28,578 --> 01:37:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

825
01:37:28,818 --> 01:37:34,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So permanent substitutes, it's a loose term, but it's for substitutes that are assigned

826
01:37:35,078 --> 01:37:48,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day at the high school, they are full-time, full-year position, and they do obtain benefits, as well as a slightly higher rate for a daily rate, a per diem, and it's annualized.

827
01:37:48,742 --> 01:37:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: However, again, given the low compensation as a daily employee, this is a very fluid position, and there's a lot of turnover.

828
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:03,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of challenges within that.

829
01:38:07,151 --> 01:38:08,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

830
01:38:08,932 --> 01:38:11,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have any permanent substitutes in the other schools?

831
01:38:11,654 --> 01:38:12,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

832
01:38:12,215 --> 01:38:14,116
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one at each of the other schools.

833
01:38:14,156 --> 01:38:16,098
[SPEAKER_05]: The high school typically has eight.

834
01:38:17,018 --> 01:38:20,921
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, that's when we can keep them in that capacity.

835
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:21,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

836
01:38:25,385 --> 01:38:26,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Page three or four.

837
01:38:26,606 --> 01:38:27,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Page three.

838
01:38:29,348 --> 01:38:33,971
[SPEAKER_19]: The kindergarten aids for the elementary schools, I'm looking at the appropriation.

839
01:38:36,937 --> 01:38:40,840
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can't remember this stuff from last year, unfortunately.

840
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:45,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Those salaries, I mean, how many people is that?

841
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:47,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Not like 50,000 at the Brooks.

842
01:38:48,205 --> 01:38:49,446
[SPEAKER_19]: How many people is that?

843
01:38:50,326 --> 01:38:57,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So at each of the elementaries, there was a varying number, and some of them only had a part-time kindergarten aid.

844
01:38:58,231 --> 01:39:00,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why the amount fluctuated.

845
01:39:00,213 --> 01:39:01,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different.

846
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: In fiscal year 20,

847
01:39:03,972 --> 01:39:08,896
[SPEAKER_05]: We made all of the kindergarten aides full-time and they had the same.

848
01:39:08,956 --> 01:39:12,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe some buildings had four, some buildings had two.

849
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:18,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are, the kindergarten aides are part of a collective bargaining unit.

850
01:39:18,483 --> 01:39:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

851
01:39:18,723 --> 01:39:19,623
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my next question.

852
01:39:19,683 --> 01:39:20,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

853
01:39:20,064 --> 01:39:28,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Page three, four or five.

854
01:39:35,188 --> 01:39:36,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Page four.

855
01:39:38,189 --> 01:39:41,369
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I know your answer to this one, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

856
01:39:41,429 --> 01:39:44,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Under special ed, there's all these teacher salaries.

857
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:47,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this one of those things where you moved it between?

858
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:52,851
[SPEAKER_19]: They're budgeted for zero, but we spent, I'm guessing, a couple million dollars there.

859
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:53,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

860
01:39:53,751 --> 01:40:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the areas that we have program costs that are outside the appropriation that we try to offset from various funding sources.

861
01:40:02,113 --> 01:40:03,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we were to budget,

862
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:18,808
[SPEAKER_05]: and put in all the lines for the various teachers in this, our appropriation budget would be significantly higher, closer to a million plus higher than what we were allocated.

863
01:40:19,308 --> 01:40:31,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So we show it as no budget because we don't have an appropriation for it, but this is the appropriate recording place to show that by each school building, we did have special education teachers.

864
01:40:31,955 --> 01:40:39,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do have to report to the Department of Ed based on a function, based on a building, where the teachers are actually located.

865
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:45,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And so therefore, we provide the actual salaries in their appropriate reporting area.

866
01:40:47,888 --> 01:40:49,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And the LD, does that mean learning disability?

867
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:51,892
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the LD in that description?

868
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:52,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Lead.

869
01:40:52,052 --> 01:40:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Lead.

870
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:53,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

871
01:40:53,193 --> 01:40:54,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Lead teachers, yes.

872
01:40:54,354 --> 01:40:55,835
[SPEAKER_19]: I was trying to figure that out.

873
01:40:56,335 --> 01:40:58,117
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are.

874
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:00,267
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of staff.

875
01:41:00,407 --> 01:41:03,028
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm like 10 or more people.

876
01:41:03,048 --> 01:41:04,428
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot.

877
01:41:05,828 --> 01:41:15,630
[SPEAKER_19]: And we, every year, we go into the year, we don't have any money for them, because we know we're going to find the money elsewhere.

878
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,831
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

879
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:19,351
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an important story to tell the network.

880
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:24,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hence the goal to fund all of the program areas.

881
01:41:25,834 --> 01:41:31,419
[SPEAKER_05]: but we have always provided additional revenue sources to offset where we cannot provide.

882
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:39,687
[SPEAKER_19]: So when the community says we shouldn't be renting out the high school, what they're also saying is we shouldn't be having special ed teachers at the McGlynn.

883
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:47,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't put that in so many words, but you can deduct from your own information there.

884
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:48,555
OK.

885
01:41:49,016 --> 01:41:49,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

886
01:41:56,007 --> 01:41:59,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Page 4567, School Committeewoman McLaughlin.

887
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:04,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, getting back to just to follow up on that question, again, forgive me since I'm new at this.

888
01:42:05,013 --> 01:42:10,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I'm going to have questions that may be obvious or already asked.

889
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:16,742
[SPEAKER_04]: So why aren't the special education costs included in the appropriation?

890
01:42:17,863 --> 01:42:19,804
[SPEAKER_05]: The costs are.

891
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:21,645
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a line item budget.

892
01:42:22,226 --> 01:42:25,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the budget, if we provided the budget for those

893
01:42:26,492 --> 01:42:31,456
[SPEAKER_05]: lines would be much higher than what the city allocated for our appropriation.

894
01:42:32,456 --> 01:42:43,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I were to include the amounts that we spend on those teachers, we would be in a deficit budget situation right off the bat, and I can't do that.

895
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:53,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not shown as a budget item, but it's shown as the expenditure to accurately report that our

896
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:58,569
[SPEAKER_05]: funding is going towards special education services at each location.

897
01:42:59,469 --> 01:43:01,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And then how is that made up every year?

898
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:04,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is different every year, or I'm confused.

899
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:04,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

900
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:04,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

901
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:14,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we have a variance in terms of what the city provides us and what the school departments have to backfill, if you will, with offsetting revenue sources.

902
01:43:15,533 --> 01:43:23,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are different program areas that help fund the areas that we need or that are identifying

903
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: for services provided for the students.

904
01:43:28,204 --> 01:43:30,446
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'll ask more questions later.

905
01:43:30,506 --> 01:43:30,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

906
01:43:33,768 --> 01:43:34,408
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all learning.

907
01:43:34,428 --> 01:43:35,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions are good questions.

908
01:43:35,789 --> 01:43:42,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think going through the budget process itself will be beneficial and helpful so that it's seen.

909
01:43:44,954 --> 01:43:46,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

910
01:43:46,215 --> 01:43:50,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, page five, I'm assuming the adjustment counselors is the same situation?

911
01:43:50,397 --> 01:43:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

912
01:43:52,650 --> 01:44:01,294
[SPEAKER_19]: The psychologists at the elementary schools, for instance, at the Brooks, is that a part-time position?

913
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:02,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is that a full-time?

914
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:06,957
[SPEAKER_19]: You may not have every single person in your head.

915
01:44:07,097 --> 01:44:07,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

916
01:44:07,818 --> 01:44:16,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So each psychologist comes in at a different pay scale based on their academic level and years of experience.

917
01:44:16,562 --> 01:44:18,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So that number would not be consistent.

918
01:44:18,851 --> 01:44:19,472
[SPEAKER_05]: at each building.

919
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:20,873
[SPEAKER_19]: But those are full-time?

920
01:44:21,113 --> 01:44:21,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

921
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:25,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

922
01:44:28,878 --> 01:44:31,940
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why I put a question mark on that, so I won't ask.

923
01:44:33,161 --> 01:44:36,123
[SPEAKER_19]: The out-of-district special ed tuition was

924
01:44:37,315 --> 01:44:39,836
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, 127,000 is a lot less.

925
01:44:40,156 --> 01:44:40,896
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good news.

926
01:44:42,197 --> 01:44:45,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I mean, from a numbers perspective.

927
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is an area that is funded from multiple sources.

928
01:44:50,379 --> 01:44:57,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have Circuit Breaker, which is a reimbursement from the state that we also utilize for our out-of-district tuitions.

929
01:44:57,482 --> 01:44:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have the IDEA federal grant.

930
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So among those three funding sources, our special education out-of-district tuition is more

931
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:09,139
[SPEAKER_05]: in the range of 3.5 million.

932
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:10,380
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, that makes more sense.

933
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:10,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

934
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:11,060
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

935
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,380
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought I'd seen a much bigger number at some point.

936
01:45:14,521 --> 01:45:18,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Although, does the pupil transportation, does anybody give us anything for that?

937
01:45:18,802 --> 01:45:20,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is that totally up to us?

938
01:45:21,382 --> 01:45:24,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to provide transportation for our students.

939
01:45:24,703 --> 01:45:27,123
[SPEAKER_19]: But the circuit breaker, they don't kick in for that or anything?

940
01:45:27,163 --> 01:45:28,484
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's tuition only.

941
01:45:28,624 --> 01:45:29,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Tuition only.

942
01:45:30,744 --> 01:45:31,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else?

943
01:45:32,705 --> 01:45:33,585
[SPEAKER_10]: School Committeewoman Graham.

944
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:45,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Just another question about the adjustment counselors in the FY 19 budget year where they're the same number of adjustment counselors at each of the elementary schools.

945
01:45:46,065 --> 01:45:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they were the same count.

946
01:45:50,106 --> 01:45:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what their actual where they were on the pay scale.

947
01:45:54,448 --> 01:46:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe each school each outside school had the one adjustment counselor.

948
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:04,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And is that true in the current budget.

949
01:46:04,683 --> 01:46:05,804
[SPEAKER_10]: in the FY20?

950
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:11,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to revisit the FY20 budget and see what we had projected for that.

951
01:46:11,608 --> 01:46:11,868
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

952
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:12,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

953
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:18,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Page 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

954
01:46:21,414 --> 01:46:22,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

955
01:46:27,098 --> 01:46:27,478
[SPEAKER_19]: On page 6.

956
01:46:29,385 --> 01:46:34,066
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a guidance, under guidance, there's a PSAT subsidy.

957
01:46:34,106 --> 01:46:36,447
[SPEAKER_19]: We pay for the PSAT for all of our students.

958
01:46:37,707 --> 01:46:47,730
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe, and I don't know if this was the 2020 budget or the previous budget, but we also, I think, put money in for SAT and AP fees.

959
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:52,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Would those be somewhere else, or is this just all in that clump together?

960
01:46:52,751 --> 01:46:58,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this was the fiscal 19 allocation, so if we had identified that for 20, that would be

961
01:46:59,398 --> 01:47:02,821
[SPEAKER_05]: upcoming but this was strictly for the PSAT subsidy.

962
01:47:04,202 --> 01:47:17,892
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on the page 7 under social studies there's field trips and this is for social studies field trips for the entire district right?

963
01:47:17,912 --> 01:47:18,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

964
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:21,134
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just like kind of amazed that $4,000

965
01:47:25,288 --> 01:47:26,089
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a lot of students.

966
01:47:26,109 --> 01:47:27,249
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just wondering what you can even do.

967
01:47:27,269 --> 01:47:32,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of that cost would be for bus transportation to get them to their field trips.

968
01:47:32,753 --> 01:47:38,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an individual bus cost for multiple buildings on multiple days.

969
01:47:39,457 --> 01:47:39,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

970
01:47:43,839 --> 01:47:45,621
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman Graham.

971
01:47:45,821 --> 01:47:48,422
[SPEAKER_10]: The field trips, is it a particular field trip that's in there?

972
01:47:48,522 --> 01:47:52,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even if it's just the buses, that's still not

973
01:47:53,778 --> 01:47:58,081
[SPEAKER_10]: much in terms of an entire district worth of kids going on field trips.

974
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just that program area.

975
01:48:00,703 --> 01:48:09,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe one of the social studies is the royal house.

976
01:48:09,068 --> 01:48:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

977
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:10,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

978
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:12,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And mock trial.

979
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:22,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And is there some way to provide a description of the field trips that the district pays for at all various levels?

980
01:48:24,910 --> 01:48:28,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a comprehensive, and it varies each year.

981
01:48:29,062 --> 01:48:30,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's not.

982
01:48:32,764 --> 01:48:34,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Static so we would have to look at that.

983
01:48:35,045 --> 01:48:56,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that would be substantial to go back in for a fiscal year 19 We can certainly look at going forward if you believe in anything that's out of district is approved by the school committee so any of those are already approved we don't have a running list of Every elementary school field trip or middle school high school.

984
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't have that information for you

985
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:10,256
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, yeah, I'm not interested in sort of backpedaling into FY 19, but I would like to think about looking at how the district is paying for field trips at various levels.

986
01:49:10,336 --> 01:49:14,482
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think we need to come up with some way to do that, but totally open to.

987
01:49:15,377 --> 01:49:16,917
[SPEAKER_10]: how that happens.

988
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:17,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

989
01:49:17,457 --> 01:49:19,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe a lot of them are also paid.

990
01:49:20,418 --> 01:49:27,940
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some student portions that the families are participating in for larger scale trips as well.

991
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:28,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

992
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:39,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where I'm trying to get an understanding of what are we paying for and what aren't we paying for and what are we asking students and families to pay for what are we asking or what our PTO is paying for.

993
01:49:39,723 --> 01:49:41,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that bigger picture of

994
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:58,006
[SPEAKER_10]: field trips and ensuring that we're providing similar educational experiences across all of our buildings and across our students sort of starts with money and what we're paying for here to sort of start to build out that bigger story and that bigger picture.

995
01:49:58,386 --> 01:50:09,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so what I would recommend is that during our budget hearings that we ask the department heads to provide what they are planning for the upcoming year in that respect.

996
01:50:09,631 --> 01:50:10,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would be great.

997
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:18,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Page 7, 8, 9, 10, Vice Chair Rousseau.

998
01:50:19,214 --> 01:50:19,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

999
01:50:19,854 --> 01:50:25,820
[SPEAKER_19]: On page 8 under the arts, there's art music teacher CW.

1000
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:27,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what CW means.

1001
01:50:30,164 --> 01:50:31,886
[SPEAKER_19]: At first I was like, is that the Curtis Tufts?

1002
01:50:31,946 --> 01:50:34,508
[SPEAKER_19]: But then I don't know what CW could possibly mean.

1003
01:50:34,769 --> 01:50:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's district wide.

1004
01:50:37,251 --> 01:50:39,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't have a particular.

1005
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they are covering various buildings, so they might be doing music or arts at multiple sites.

1006
01:50:47,072 --> 01:50:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1007
01:50:48,532 --> 01:50:49,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1008
01:50:50,773 --> 01:51:04,237
[SPEAKER_19]: And then under the phys ed health, the salaries, wages permanent is much smaller than appropriated.

1009
01:51:04,297 --> 01:51:04,957
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just wondering.

1010
01:51:06,421 --> 01:51:22,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Did somebody leave it seems like a big drop that is in the supervisory category Okay, so that would be a Combination I believe of two but I can certainly provide you the breakout on that.

1011
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:22,909
Okay.

1012
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:28,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you and then I noticed that for the Columbus and the Roberts I

1013
01:51:30,694 --> 01:51:34,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this one of those things where the teachers moved from one school to the next?

1014
01:51:34,856 --> 01:51:40,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the Columbus spent twice what we had planned and then the Roberts was half what we planned.

1015
01:51:41,738 --> 01:51:42,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1016
01:51:42,559 --> 01:51:50,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes there's shifting within a department where we projected the costs to be might not have been where they actually landed.

1017
01:51:51,653 --> 01:51:53,514
[SPEAKER_05]: based on the placement during the course of the year.

1018
01:51:54,114 --> 01:51:54,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1019
01:51:55,836 --> 01:52:00,819
[SPEAKER_19]: And then this section is the library media.

1020
01:52:03,361 --> 01:52:08,164
[SPEAKER_19]: And this looks like there's just a bunch of that additional like movement stuff.

1021
01:52:08,184 --> 01:52:10,486
[SPEAKER_19]: So actually, I don't have any other questions on page eight.

1022
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:13,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Page nine.

1023
01:52:17,345 --> 01:52:23,150
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this a COLA issue where the nurses was like almost $50,000 more than we planned?

1024
01:52:23,210 --> 01:52:26,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it doesn't seem, we couldn't have gotten a nurse for $50,000.

1025
01:52:26,213 --> 01:52:37,504
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct, and there are certain instances that mandate nurses to be provided one-on-one, and that is not necessarily known at time of budget.

1026
01:52:37,845 --> 01:52:38,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1027
01:52:38,746 --> 01:52:39,346
[SPEAKER_19]: That makes sense.

1028
01:52:40,087 --> 01:52:40,407
[SPEAKER_19]: And then,

1029
01:52:41,748 --> 01:52:50,012
[SPEAKER_19]: The other one that was kind of surprising to me was to have stipends that we didn't know were going to have to happen under the same.

1030
01:52:50,492 --> 01:53:00,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, the stipends would be covered for if a nurse had to attend special events, mandatory on the field trips, things of that nature.

1031
01:53:01,197 --> 01:53:01,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1032
01:53:01,897 --> 01:53:02,937
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew you were going to get to these quick.

1033
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:10,120
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, since I don't have this for previous years, is the athletics being over 7.5%

1034
01:53:11,877 --> 01:53:16,040
[SPEAKER_19]: over budget, is that pretty in line with what we expect?

1035
01:53:16,801 --> 01:53:20,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Athletics has been historically in a deficit.

1036
01:53:21,305 --> 01:53:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been working to provide truer numbers in this category.

1037
01:53:27,229 --> 01:53:40,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It is offset with the revolving athletic account where we do collect user fees, but those are also, again, we don't know if our teams are going to make it to the finals.

1038
01:53:40,743 --> 01:53:43,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means additional costs for officials.

1039
01:53:43,644 --> 01:53:45,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It means additional transportation.

1040
01:53:45,564 --> 01:53:49,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It means, great, we have to buy some trophies.

1041
01:53:49,705 --> 01:53:53,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So those types of costs are unknown at the time that we budget.

1042
01:53:53,545 --> 01:54:00,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to keep it within reason as we are looking at the total picture.

1043
01:54:01,587 --> 01:54:05,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But this area has been historically in a deficit.

1044
01:54:06,728 --> 01:54:06,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1045
01:54:11,057 --> 01:54:12,278
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committee Member McLaughlin.

1046
01:54:13,098 --> 01:54:13,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1047
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for this report.

1048
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:22,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really informational and I'm wondering, is this accessible to the public?

1049
01:54:22,763 --> 01:54:25,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a public report that's shared?

1050
01:54:26,545 --> 01:54:29,986
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular one, this is provided to the school committee in this regard.

1051
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a public report?

1052
01:54:33,288 --> 01:54:37,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not posted online, if that's what you're inquiring.

1053
01:54:39,265 --> 01:54:40,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a public record.

1054
01:54:40,626 --> 01:54:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a public record.

1055
01:54:41,767 --> 01:54:43,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the public records request, yes.

1056
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:50,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not distributed as the open budget hearing is distributed in that regard.

1057
01:54:50,951 --> 01:54:51,192
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1058
01:54:51,932 --> 01:54:55,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But if folks want it, they can just ask the school for it.

1059
01:54:56,294 --> 01:54:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1060
01:54:59,816 --> 01:55:00,937
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee woman, Vanda Kloot.

1061
01:55:02,197 --> 01:55:06,460
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we're through the 10 pages of the report.

1062
01:55:08,503 --> 01:55:08,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1063
01:55:09,464 --> 01:55:15,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we let Mr. Russo finish his questions, and then I've got a question on this.

1064
01:55:15,688 --> 01:55:15,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1065
01:55:17,790 --> 01:55:18,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Russo.

1066
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:19,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1067
01:55:20,272 --> 01:55:26,076
[SPEAKER_19]: The last page, security, contracted services, what are those?

1068
01:55:28,598 --> 01:55:35,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So contracted services would be the camera replacement, things of that nature.

1069
01:55:35,023 --> 01:55:35,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1070
01:55:35,323 --> 01:55:35,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1071
01:55:39,979 --> 01:55:45,703
[SPEAKER_19]: I was happy to see some of these other buildings, OSP, what does OSP mean again?

1072
01:55:46,143 --> 01:55:49,725
[SPEAKER_19]: Operational, the last category.

1073
01:55:51,306 --> 01:55:52,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Buildings and grounds, right?

1074
01:55:52,247 --> 01:55:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1075
01:55:53,348 --> 01:55:54,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And MSP supplies.

1076
01:55:54,648 --> 01:55:58,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm not certain what that particular acronym refers to.

1077
01:55:59,351 --> 01:56:07,657
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have a budget in it, so those charges would be part of the general supplies within the custodial area.

1078
01:56:09,972 --> 01:56:15,493
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought we had made some major changes to our telephone expenses that brought this way down.

1079
01:56:15,733 --> 01:56:17,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is this actually the way down number?

1080
01:56:18,094 --> 01:56:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the way down number.

1081
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:20,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Gosh, $140,000 is the way down number.

1082
01:56:20,255 --> 01:56:20,455
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1083
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:21,435
[SPEAKER_19]: And then that was my last question.

1084
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:22,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1085
01:56:22,955 --> 01:56:23,735
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.

1086
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:48,067
[SPEAKER_11]: So Christina, I wanted to go back to your main report and on the back you noted we drew down from the following accounts as identified during the FY19 budget development progress.

1087
01:56:48,407 --> 01:56:49,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have numbers?

1088
01:56:49,568 --> 01:56:54,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand you might not have with them tonight, but can you tell me from the after school program

1089
01:56:54,771 --> 01:56:59,534
[SPEAKER_11]: how much money was used to offset other programs?

1090
01:56:59,674 --> 01:57:06,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We had identified in the budget process a million dollars that would be offset from the after school program.

1091
01:57:07,419 --> 01:57:09,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the exact amount, but it was roughly $500,000.

1092
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And the before school, do you have those?

1093
01:57:13,562 --> 01:57:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: They're lumped together.

1094
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:15,544
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1095
01:57:17,925 --> 01:57:18,145
[SPEAKER_05]: MEEP?

1096
01:57:18,946 --> 01:57:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: MEEP was approximately $150,000.

1097
01:57:26,031 --> 01:57:26,391
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1098
01:57:29,492 --> 01:57:34,073
[SPEAKER_05]: The others I don't have a good handle on those offsets.

1099
01:57:35,694 --> 01:57:50,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the community schools and building rentals, those are basically maintaining the cost for the rentals to have custodial service, to have security on hand, to have all of the cleaning supplies that are needed.

1100
01:57:50,682 --> 01:58:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: for those rentals, so a lot of that is just essentially utilizing what we have to maintain, along with our larger organizations, the Japanese Language School, the Lesley University, those are significant contributors to the community school area and the building rental.

1101
01:58:13,103 --> 01:58:16,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so really the major one really is the before and after school.

1102
01:58:16,784 --> 01:58:17,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1103
01:58:17,204 --> 01:58:21,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Of about a half a million dollars that is used to offset other accounts.

1104
01:58:21,585 --> 01:58:24,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, but we had identified one million to utilize.

1105
01:58:24,846 --> 01:58:25,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so it's less than that.

1106
01:58:25,866 --> 01:58:26,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1107
01:58:26,647 --> 01:58:42,331
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it still leaves us the question of saying is that what we want with the tuitions and how else can we, should our budget be expanded so it really reflects real costs rather than the need to do creative fundraising.

1108
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1109
01:58:56,790 --> 01:59:04,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So just sort of following up and again learning curve, understanding these, this revenue that we're getting from these programs will

1110
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:10,364
[SPEAKER_04]: be discussed as part of the budget process for this year so that we're understanding exactly what those numbers are.

1111
01:59:10,384 --> 01:59:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: For the amounts that we have to identify as an offset.

1112
01:59:15,507 --> 01:59:29,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So once we build the budget and we identify the level of service that we indicate that we need, there's the city side that provides the appropriation budget amount that can be afforded.

1113
01:59:30,276 --> 01:59:33,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to come somewhere in between

1114
01:59:33,825 --> 01:59:47,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And any amount that is over what the city is available to provide us as our appropriation line, we would need to then come up with revenue offsets to close that gap.

1115
01:59:48,577 --> 01:59:48,838
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1116
01:59:49,358 --> 01:59:53,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the details of those revenue sources are broken down for us.

1117
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:53,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1118
01:59:54,062 --> 01:59:54,342
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1119
01:59:54,602 --> 01:59:54,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1120
02:00:01,312 --> 02:00:02,352
[SPEAKER_07]: No further questions?

1121
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1122
02:00:07,334 --> 02:00:08,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice Chair Rousseau?

1123
02:00:08,574 --> 02:00:13,255
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to, I don't know, you don't want to make this, I want to make this statement.

1124
02:00:13,776 --> 02:00:21,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I feel like I talk to the community on an almost weekly basis about why are we spending our

1125
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:28,913
[SPEAKER_19]: before and after school programming, extra funds, our MEAP programming, extra funds, and something other than those programs?

1126
02:00:29,413 --> 02:00:35,716
[SPEAKER_19]: And the answer is, we have a huge number of people in special ed that don't have jobs if we don't do that.

1127
02:00:35,876 --> 02:00:41,839
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a huge number of people in, we get rid of all of the adjustment counselors if we don't do that.

1128
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:47,702
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not that we're taking that money and just being like, hey, let's have fun with it.

1129
02:00:47,942 --> 02:00:51,304
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like critical elements of our

1130
02:00:51,687 --> 02:00:54,629
[SPEAKER_19]: education don't happen at all if we don't do that.

1131
02:00:54,769 --> 02:01:04,196
[SPEAKER_19]: So it isn't a choice between whether we give the before and after school programs better digs or better salaries, which is a different conversation.

1132
02:01:04,216 --> 02:01:05,277
[SPEAKER_19]: We definitely have to do that.

1133
02:01:05,717 --> 02:01:08,579
[SPEAKER_19]: But this extra revenue isn't extra revenue.

1134
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:13,243
[SPEAKER_19]: This is revenue plugging the hole because we don't get it somewhere else.

1135
02:01:13,763 --> 02:01:17,286
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel like I think this is just an important time to point that out because

1136
02:01:18,683 --> 02:01:22,384
[SPEAKER_19]: I just hear it a lot, this conversation.

1137
02:01:22,744 --> 02:01:26,645
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very divorced in the budget process and the line items.

1138
02:01:26,665 --> 02:01:28,465
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just so divorced from each other.

1139
02:01:29,386 --> 02:01:36,927
[SPEAKER_19]: But they are not divorced if you want adjustment counselors and this 10 or 20 people in special ed to be doing what they're doing.

1140
02:01:37,027 --> 02:01:39,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to say that.

1141
02:01:39,268 --> 02:01:39,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1142
02:01:41,368 --> 02:01:41,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1143
02:01:42,709 --> 02:01:44,069
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman McLaughlin.

1144
02:01:47,652 --> 02:02:09,066
[SPEAKER_04]: school committee member Russo, in terms of the cost, I think like every budget, there are pluses and minuses on all ends and things balance out in different ways, but I also don't want to give the impression that after school funds go to pay for special education funds, so that we understand that there's also additional money coming in through Circuit Breaker.

1145
02:02:09,266 --> 02:02:16,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I would say is I would really encourage community members to come to the Committee of the Whole meetings, budget meetings, if they really want to be able to understand where

1146
02:02:17,402 --> 02:02:26,164
[SPEAKER_04]: the allocations go back and forth in terms of the pluses and the minuses because it's a lot of shifting money around, as you know, Christine, as we all know, right?

1147
02:02:26,304 --> 02:02:34,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just any particular departments that are more or less, although I know that special education is costly, that it's not more or less in one area or another.

1148
02:02:34,746 --> 02:02:36,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give the community that impression either.

1149
02:02:37,147 --> 02:02:41,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the whole system that we have to balance out and figuring out how to do that is really

1150
02:02:41,568 --> 02:02:42,529
[SPEAKER_04]: part of our job here.

1151
02:02:42,549 --> 02:02:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much for the report and I would really encourage folks for the Committee of the Whole budget meetings to be able to attend those.

1152
02:02:48,993 --> 02:02:53,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all public meetings where people can ask these questions and we can learn, right?

1153
02:02:53,256 --> 02:02:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm still very much learning.

1154
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:55,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate this.

1155
02:02:55,958 --> 02:02:56,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1156
02:02:57,319 --> 02:02:57,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1157
02:02:58,420 --> 02:02:59,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1158
02:03:00,641 --> 02:03:02,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to accept the committee report.

1159
02:03:02,903 --> 02:03:07,766
[SPEAKER_07]: All those seconded by Council... seconded by Vice Chair Rousseau.

1160
02:03:07,846 --> 02:03:08,647
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1161
02:03:09,267 --> 02:03:09,968
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1162
02:03:10,941 --> 02:03:11,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper passes.

1163
02:03:14,564 --> 02:03:16,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any old business?

1164
02:03:17,627 --> 02:03:19,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Report on free cash allocation, Dr. Peter Cushing.

1165
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:28,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, student representatives.

1166
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:29,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for being here.

1167
02:03:29,168 --> 02:03:30,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Really appreciate it.

1168
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:37,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So on November 26, as I mentioned earlier, we had submitted to the Medford City Council for $300,000 in free cash.

1169
02:03:41,261 --> 02:03:45,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So the school district is going to use that in several areas.

1170
02:03:45,645 --> 02:03:55,313
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to repair and expand the high school intercom system where it's been damaged, or as rooms were added, quite simply, it was never put in place.

1171
02:03:56,334 --> 02:04:07,904
[SPEAKER_15]: So the headmaster and other members of his team have a plan in place where the intercoms don't work, but let's be honest, the most quickest way to deliver information is through the school intercom.

1172
02:04:09,081 --> 02:04:10,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So that will be undertaken.

1173
02:04:11,922 --> 02:04:15,943
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the quotes in hand with John McLaughlin right now, and that'll be $59,000.

1174
02:04:16,423 --> 02:04:21,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I've already spoken on the bathroom, so I don't think we need that further right now.

1175
02:04:21,124 --> 02:04:31,187
[SPEAKER_15]: $61,000 will be used to purchase a new backup power generator for the vocational wing, as well as our internet services.

1176
02:04:31,347 --> 02:04:34,407
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, we're on battery backup for internet services.

1177
02:04:34,487 --> 02:04:36,208
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have about an hour to three hours

1178
02:04:36,748 --> 02:04:38,428
[SPEAKER_15]: based on the information that we have.

1179
02:04:38,548 --> 02:04:48,190
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, this generator will be purchased, installed, and will take care of our internet services, as well as the vocational wing of the high school.

1180
02:04:49,131 --> 02:04:56,072
[SPEAKER_15]: The shades and C building at Medford High School will be installed at a cost of $32,500, as well as controlling light.

1181
02:04:56,132 --> 02:05:00,213
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a security feature to be able to keep out people looking in.

1182
02:05:01,473 --> 02:05:04,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, Medford Public Tools is operating desktop computers that are

1183
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:18,841
[SPEAKER_15]: eight or nine years old, operating Windows 7, which Microsoft stopped supporting six days ago or so.

1184
02:05:20,102 --> 02:05:31,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a plan in place right now to upgrade those desktops to Windows 10, but you're putting a rather robust operating system that will use 60%

1185
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:51,425
[SPEAKER_15]: of RAM on startup, and then when you add on other programs, it's not gonna exactly be the fastest solution, but until we can budget and appropriate and come up with a robust game plan, it's the plan that we have right now.

1186
02:05:52,325 --> 02:05:55,626
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to note that in line four of that last paragraph, I have a typo.

1187
02:05:55,666 --> 02:06:00,527
[SPEAKER_15]: I failed to, as you will see, the computer labs at the middle school, as well as two

1188
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:02,409
[SPEAKER_15]: elementary computer labs.

1189
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:12,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're going to do is we're going to deploy 56 new desktops to the middle schools and 49 to the elementary schools.

1190
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:18,404
[SPEAKER_15]: The $100,000 free cash allotment will also be used to outfit the new maker space.

1191
02:06:19,165 --> 02:06:21,906
[SPEAKER_15]: At the high school, the listed items are there.

1192
02:06:22,086 --> 02:06:28,689
[SPEAKER_15]: The specific, you have pictures in your packet that really detail those items well.

1193
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:34,392
[SPEAKER_15]: The MakerBot, I have experience with that from my previous districts, having purchased them.

1194
02:06:34,632 --> 02:06:38,474
[SPEAKER_15]: The MakerCare, while expensive, is really essential to have.

1195
02:06:39,374 --> 02:06:42,195
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually a critical component for those machines.

1196
02:06:43,236 --> 02:06:48,238
[SPEAKER_15]: It is expensive, but it does provide really a cost benefit.

1197
02:06:49,231 --> 02:06:51,913
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's how Medford Public Schools plans to use the free cash.

1198
02:06:51,953 --> 02:06:59,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd really like to thank the city of Medford, the Medford City Council and its citizens for its support in our endeavors.

1199
02:07:00,178 --> 02:07:00,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1200
02:07:01,559 --> 02:07:04,020
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman Grimm.

1201
02:07:04,781 --> 02:07:14,787
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a similar request for free cash last year to replace, I think it was sort of the same exact story, replace aging.

1202
02:07:15,839 --> 02:07:19,922
[SPEAKER_10]: equipment that's no longer going to be supported when they stop supporting Windows 7.

1203
02:07:20,462 --> 02:07:23,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we're here doing that again.

1204
02:07:23,224 --> 02:07:29,589
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is what's left in terms of what other equipment is unreplaced?

1205
02:07:29,669 --> 02:07:35,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think each time we do this, people think we have solved this problem of our aging equipment.

1206
02:07:35,753 --> 02:07:37,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we have, that's great.

1207
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:41,077
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we haven't, I want to be able to talk about that as well.

1208
02:07:41,177 --> 02:07:41,697
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't.

1209
02:07:41,797 --> 02:07:43,839
[SPEAKER_15]: And the number of devices is substantial.

1210
02:07:45,138 --> 02:07:45,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it 100, 1,000?

1211
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:53,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Your second number is probably more accurate based on conversations I've had with Molly Layden.

1212
02:07:53,905 --> 02:07:55,606
[SPEAKER_15]: But as Christine has approached the podium.

1213
02:07:55,626 --> 02:07:57,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, if I may.

1214
02:07:58,008 --> 02:08:02,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last free cash was 200,000 for the purpose of Chromebooks.

1215
02:08:03,352 --> 02:08:05,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That is only 200 devices.

1216
02:08:05,994 --> 02:08:09,516
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're looking at the students in Medford, that's 4,500 that we have to

1217
02:08:10,973 --> 02:08:16,436
[SPEAKER_05]: replaced for not only student use and carts and rooms, classrooms, but teachers as well.

1218
02:08:16,996 --> 02:08:23,399
[SPEAKER_05]: The last major purchase was in 2012, which the city went out to bond for major units.

1219
02:08:23,739 --> 02:08:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe the final payment is coming up.

1220
02:08:27,181 --> 02:08:37,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So our goal is to move forward and fund more of a true 20% replacement of the entire fleet in subsequent budgeting years.

1221
02:08:37,526 --> 02:08:40,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But we cannot do a full replacement

1222
02:08:40,997 --> 02:08:47,242
[SPEAKER_05]: in one year because that would be, again, significant bond-related purchase.

1223
02:08:47,542 --> 02:08:54,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking $1.2 to $2 million in replacing all of the devices district-wide.

1224
02:08:54,507 --> 02:09:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are trying to target the most critical areas and identify those that are most needed if we are able to repair

1225
02:09:05,587 --> 02:09:09,889
[SPEAKER_05]: certain device pieces and maintain equipment, then we are trying to do that.

1226
02:09:09,949 --> 02:09:29,496
[SPEAKER_05]: But the goal is to truly get a funding mechanism in place through the budget to have 20% replacement each year so that we're not in a position where we have to go to capital funding or free cash requests, unless it is something that is outside of the regular routine and need.

1227
02:09:29,616 --> 02:09:33,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what our goal has been, to try to deliberately

1228
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: increase the media tech budget in that category, but we just could not do it in one year.

1229
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:46,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I would not advocate for us to do it in one year, because then we have to do it in one year again in five years.

1230
02:09:46,633 --> 02:09:50,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So I definitely want to move away from that kind of a process.

1231
02:09:50,634 --> 02:09:58,858
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I want to make sure that we do in this upcoming budget cycle is be really transparent about what's in the budget, what's not in the budget, so that

1232
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:10,844
[SPEAKER_10]: our colleagues on the city council understand that if they say yes to $100,000 of free cash or $200,000 of free cash, that that hasn't solved the totality of our problem.

1233
02:10:11,804 --> 02:10:27,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I think to do that, we need to be able to say, this is the goal, this is where we want to be, and this is where we are, and this is how long it's going to take for us to sort of get out of the position that we're in and get to this place where we're replacing our technology every year, 20%, 20%, 20%.

1234
02:10:29,761 --> 02:10:42,348
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think in order to do that, there needs to be a clear description of where we're at, and are we even at the place where we can start 20%, 20%, 20%, or are we in a hole, so to speak?

1235
02:10:42,488 --> 02:10:56,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we need to be really clear and transparent about that in the budget process, so that when the city council feels like they've solved a problem, we can say, yes, you have, in fact, solved this problem, or no, we have not solved that problem, and we have more work to do.

1236
02:10:56,735 --> 02:10:59,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want the folks who,

1237
02:11:00,033 --> 02:11:07,496
[SPEAKER_10]: ultimately have to approve our budget, but also the community to understand exactly where we are and exactly what we do and don't have.

1238
02:11:07,716 --> 02:11:07,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1239
02:11:08,096 --> 02:11:08,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that a motion?

1240
02:11:10,657 --> 02:11:10,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1241
02:11:11,257 --> 02:11:22,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it can be, but with all due respect, we do have that information within the description of our FY 19 and 20 budgets as we are developing and going forward.

1242
02:11:22,461 --> 02:11:28,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is wording along with each of our program areas that delineates and identifies exactly what

1243
02:11:29,299 --> 02:11:31,880
[SPEAKER_05]: the budget request is covering and what would be needed.

1244
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:39,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is within the language of our budget as we went through this process last year.

1245
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:47,383
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at the verbatim information that the department heads have provided as descriptors, a lot of that information is already provided.

1246
02:11:47,483 --> 02:11:58,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to be clear that we have been transparent in that need and identifying that we recognize we don't have enough in our budget appropriation request.

1247
02:11:59,067 --> 02:12:09,951
[SPEAKER_05]: but that we have these urgent needs and the item was identified that as of January 1, 2020, all of the Microsoft items would not be supported.

1248
02:12:10,311 --> 02:12:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have that in place and I just want to, again, reiterate that our process was very open and clear in terms of what we were asking for and where we were at in terms of the need.

1249
02:12:24,556 --> 02:12:27,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did identify and we did make note that this was

1250
02:12:28,210 --> 02:12:34,856
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a problem and we've identified that the 1.2 bonding was not the best solution.

1251
02:12:34,916 --> 02:12:38,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the only solution at that time to get them updated.

1252
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:46,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are working hard and we have worked with our department heads to identify the priority needs.

1253
02:12:46,106 --> 02:12:47,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just would ask,

1254
02:12:48,398 --> 02:12:51,879
[SPEAKER_05]: to reference our budget that we have in place currently.

1255
02:12:52,019 --> 02:12:59,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we, again, will address it going forward for the fiscal 2021 requests as we meet with each of our department heads.

1256
02:13:01,243 --> 02:13:02,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I will take a look at that.

1257
02:13:02,303 --> 02:13:05,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I was pretty plugged into the budget process during that time.

1258
02:13:05,125 --> 02:13:08,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't recall anything that resonated to me in quite that way.

1259
02:13:09,186 --> 02:13:16,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So perhaps it's a matter of being more clear about what those things need to look like so that the picture is

1260
02:13:16,883 --> 02:13:20,245
[SPEAKER_10]: clear to people outside of the school department, because I think that's critical.

1261
02:13:20,806 --> 02:13:25,008
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will go back and take a look at that again, and we can talk about it in the upcoming budget meetings.

1262
02:13:26,269 --> 02:13:26,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1263
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:29,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice Chair Rousseau.

1264
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:29,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1265
02:13:30,412 --> 02:13:33,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you to Member Graham for that.

1266
02:13:33,954 --> 02:13:44,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I've only been through two budgets, but I know I've had conversations with other members where it feels like we come in, we do the budgets,

1267
02:13:46,246 --> 02:13:52,171
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an already agreed upon, like, we pretty much have everything we need, but we wouldn't mind another 3 or 4%.

1268
02:13:53,152 --> 02:13:59,036
[SPEAKER_19]: But I feel like if we got everybody in a room or one-on-one, the number would be we need another 30%.

1269
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:07,861
[SPEAKER_19]: If we never have the conversation that we really need another 30% in our budget, then how does anybody ever know?

1270
02:14:07,881 --> 02:14:15,304
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, Somerville spends $586,000 on computer replacement in their school system every year, year after year.

1271
02:14:16,445 --> 02:14:19,546
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's every year.

1272
02:14:20,926 --> 02:14:23,667
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're not that much bigger than us.

1273
02:14:24,748 --> 02:14:26,508
[SPEAKER_19]: They're like, I think, 1,000 students more.

1274
02:14:28,409 --> 02:14:30,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Their students don't have different computer needs than us.

1275
02:14:31,313 --> 02:14:32,975
[SPEAKER_19]: and our teachers don't either.

1276
02:14:34,236 --> 02:14:37,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Our increase year over year isn't even that amount of money.

1277
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:40,063
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, once you take away the salary portion.

1278
02:14:40,703 --> 02:14:47,751
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, if we're not telling the community that, in fact, our budget is painfully anemic, and this is how it's anemic,

1279
02:14:48,599 --> 02:14:58,381
[SPEAKER_19]: then at some point in the future when we ask the community to step up and say, okay, I guess we do want our kids to have computers that turn on within 20 minutes.

1280
02:14:59,222 --> 02:15:07,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, because an eight year old computer running windows 10, nobody's going to turn it on cause nobody's going to sit there that long.

1281
02:15:08,584 --> 02:15:09,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so

1282
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:18,920
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to have a budget that says, you know, the city thinks they can give us, I don't know, whatever the number will be, 60 million maybe, or whatever the, I don't remember.

1283
02:15:20,542 --> 02:15:29,733
[SPEAKER_19]: But we also have to have the conversation in the public that says, but if we could get 80, this is what we could do for Medford's public schools.

1284
02:15:31,064 --> 02:15:43,930
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't get 80, but if we never even tell anybody that what we really need is 80, then when we say to the residents, you know what, this is why we want more money from you from your taxes, you can't just start there.

1285
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:47,172
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to start with what is it that's such a huge deficit?

1286
02:15:47,372 --> 02:15:52,074
[SPEAKER_19]: And our budget, I think we had $10,000 in the line item for 2020 for computers.

1287
02:15:53,615 --> 02:15:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was closer to $175,000.

1288
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:14,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't remember that number, but I believe you because I trust you but Agreed that the line item is low and your Somerville example is what would a true 20% be once we get to that?

1289
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: to that area so again, we're trying to be cognizant of all all departments within the city structure and

1290
02:16:22,645 --> 02:16:26,508
[SPEAKER_05]: and trying to maintain the resources needed for student learning.

1291
02:16:26,888 --> 02:16:32,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's part of our conversation that we will go through again for fiscal 2021.

1292
02:16:32,573 --> 02:16:44,602
[SPEAKER_19]: But there is no conversation where under Prop 2.5 we ever get to a half a million dollars in computer replacement before I'm so old that I don't even remember how to use a computer.

1293
02:16:44,722 --> 02:16:49,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, that future is decades away at 2.5%.

1294
02:16:52,337 --> 02:16:53,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're not telling anybody that.

1295
02:16:55,079 --> 02:17:05,225
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I just wanted to agree with Member Graham that 20% sounds great, but it's a fantasy right now.

1296
02:17:05,865 --> 02:17:11,548
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's going to remain a fantasy unless we can get a redistricting to Assembly Row and to Medford.

1297
02:17:12,789 --> 02:17:14,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was going to say commercial tax base.

1298
02:17:14,430 --> 02:17:15,090
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to work on it.

1299
02:17:16,891 --> 02:17:17,892
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committeewoman Grimm.

1300
02:17:18,512 --> 02:17:21,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think when we talk about the technology conversation,

1301
02:17:21,902 --> 02:17:25,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to be really clear that there's two parts.

1302
02:17:25,484 --> 02:17:31,946
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, do we have at our disposal the amount that we need, yes or no?

1303
02:17:32,487 --> 02:17:36,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, do we have the means to maintain that base?

1304
02:17:36,728 --> 02:17:40,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the answer to both of those questions right now is no, no and no.

1305
02:17:42,031 --> 02:17:45,512
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's my opinion, and we can talk about that during the budget process.

1306
02:17:46,473 --> 02:17:51,595
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important to be clear about having two real needs with two

1307
02:17:52,196 --> 02:17:57,499
[SPEAKER_10]: particular amounts of money, both which are bigger than we have the budget for.

1308
02:17:57,999 --> 02:18:12,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make sure that we're just being honest about that and the ways that our district is receiving technology right now through PTOs, filing grant requests, all kinds of things.

1309
02:18:12,187 --> 02:18:15,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's technology flowing in that we're not paying for and we're really lucky about that.

1310
02:18:16,849 --> 02:18:20,271
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, that equipment has to be maintained as well.

1311
02:18:20,391 --> 02:18:21,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to talk about

1312
02:18:22,487 --> 02:18:29,152
[SPEAKER_10]: both are we where we need to be in terms of do we have enough equipment to do all the things that we need to do to provide a quality education.

1313
02:18:29,172 --> 02:18:31,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And then do we have the money to maintain it.

1314
02:18:31,374 --> 02:18:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make sure that in the budget conversation that we really clearly have both of those conversations so that the community understands truly where we are and what we cannot do in the confines of this budget because we are required by law to submit a balanced budget.

1315
02:18:48,166 --> 02:18:48,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1316
02:18:48,387 --> 02:18:48,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1317
02:18:49,467 --> 02:18:52,668
[SPEAKER_10]: that there's no magic that makes all of that happen at the same time.

1318
02:18:52,728 --> 02:18:54,648
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want us to be really transparent about that.

1319
02:18:57,529 --> 02:18:58,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1320
02:19:01,010 --> 02:19:02,050

1321
