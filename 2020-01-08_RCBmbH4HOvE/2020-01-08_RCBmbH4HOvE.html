    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2616.706s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2618.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2619.453s">In</a>  the meantime, while we wait, I just want to thank Joey for coming forward and for making this statement and being proactive about what he's seeing at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2628.375s">We</a>  are only as good as our information we received, Joey, so thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2636.917s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2638.158s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2639.778s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2641.058s">Council,</a>  student committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2643.679s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2645.878s">I</a>  did, Peter will have something to add as well to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2651.022s">So</a>  upon social media, I took, Mr. Falco did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2663.273s">We</a>  went out and I went out and personally inspected all the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2666.696s">I</a>  went out and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2670.428s">made</a>  sure that they're old, the bathrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2674.631s">You</a>  cannot take that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2676.572s">But</a>  let me just run through the report real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2684.338s">So</a>  I went through the bathrooms and some of my findings was some of the fin tube radiator covers are in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2691.503s">So</a>  at this time we have started the replacement of the radiator covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2695.309s">We're</a>  waiting for some parts to come in from Granger to finish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2701.011s">I</a>  didn't find any signs of rodent activity or insect activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2705.553s">I</a>  encourage people to report it because we do have an integrated pest management plan in all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2712.296s">And</a>  we need to know immediately if there's anything like that happening because we can call in our contractor and take care of it right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2726.63s">So</a>  the restrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2728.132s">They're</a>  not aesthetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2730.214s">There's</a>  been many years of repainting and painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2733.317s">The</a>  tile's old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2734.258s">It's</a>  outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2735.92s">The</a>  fixtures and the sinks are all running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2738.823s">We</a>  went through this past vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2743.645s">I</a>  had the contract cleaners do a heavy cleaning of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2748.947s">We</a>  went in and did some sealant tile replacements, replaced locks that needed to be replaced on stall doors, made sure everything was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2760.332s">Besides</a>  being old, we're trying to do what we can for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2766.895s">They</a>  clean, they don't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2771.768s">So</a>  over the past few years, they used to have Bradley sinks in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2776.211s">We</a>  replaced them with regular sinks and put Formica countertops on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2780.414s">And</a>  the Formica's wearing out, it's 15 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2783.336s">So</a>  I mean, we do have some work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2786.978s">I</a>  think at this point, and I know Pete is gonna allude to it, that we do have some available cash to possibly do at least two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2801.272s">over,</a>  we just have to make decisions on which ones that we'd like to do and then go through the process of hiring a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2811.594s">And</a>  I also work with Paul DeLaval, which was a big thing, is we got together and we decided that in the mornings, when they open up the cafeteria side for breakfast, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2824.139s">When</a>  they close them, when the kids pass to the hallways, the custodians are going in, cleaning them, making sure they're all clean, and then they don't get open till lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2833.888s">On</a>  the other side, on the guidance side that's been open all morning, we are cleaning them at noontime when they lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2840.674s">So</a>  we're going in there and freshening them up, trying to keep them as fresh as possible as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2846.459s">Obviously,</a>  if there's any issues during the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2850.382s">the</a>  assistant principals will contact us and we'll do what we need to do to freshen them up as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2859.987s">And</a>  I think, yeah, so over the holiday break, like I said, we did the heavy duty cleaning in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2868.632s">They're</a>  better, but they're old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2870.012s">They</a>  just don't show anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2873.174s">They've</a>  been painted over and over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2880.723s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2885.485s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2886.885s">I</a>  had a question about how students and staff can quickly report things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2897.579s">well-known</a>  process that if you ask students and staff, they would have an answer.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2900.801s">You</a>  know what, to that, I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2902.442s">I</a>  would assume that they would go through the assistant principals, or a teacher, or anybody that can get in touch with Headmaster DeLave or whomever. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2911.688s">Normally,</a>  if something goes on in a bathroom, we'll get a report, mainly by the assistant principal, that'll say, hey, we need a clean up here in bathroom two in C building, and then over the radio, and then we'll send somebody right up.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2927.873s">And</a>  how often are custodians actually checking each bathroom throughout the day?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2933.997s">So</a>  with the schedule that Mr. McLaughlin talked about, we've been trying to kind of clean, shut down, open, clean, shut down, open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2946.023s">I</a>  think that's happening twice a day, which is more than what we were doing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2952.187s">The</a>  frequency of the cleaning also helps us with reporting as well because being an assistant principal and being a male as well or being a headmaster, I can't get into every single bathroom or I have to wait for somebody to come and look at another bathroom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2971.71s">So</a>  again, what's been helping is that schedule of cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2976.793s">Because</a>  sort of what we've utilized at the Andrews when I was there as well is that when you're constantly updating the bathrooms, we're getting more reports regarding graffiti, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2989.139s">For</a>  the other stuff, I've always asked, too, if anybody has any concerns or complaints, to just please see me so I can address it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2998.984s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3002.68s">School</a>  Committeewoman Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.261s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.622s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.882s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3007.484s">I</a>  just had a question, because I know Mr. Falco mentioned that he noticed some black mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3012.608s">So</a>  I was just concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3013.568s">I</a>  didn't hear that, and I didn't read that in the report that was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3016.651s">Did</a>  you, when you were doing the deep cleaning, was there any sign of any black mold?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3021.234s">I'm</a>  afraid I didn't get any reports to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3025.938s">I</a>  mean, if there's something going on, yeah, we'll go back in there immediately for sure.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3033.072s">And</a>  then were the soap dispensers, were they cleaned out? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3036.753s">Or</a>  were they, do you think maybe it was like particles in the soap dispenser? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3040.354s">Or</a>  was it, you know, maybe just a change of soap?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3042.914s">The</a>  soap dispensers are a closed item, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3045.495s">I</a>  know that we've had some instances in the last month where we had to replace six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3052.236s">So</a>  I don't, you know, I don't know how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3056.677s">I</a>  wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3057.437s">I</a>  wish I had more information so that I could've <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3061.794s">been</a>  conclusive on what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3064.637s">And</a>  just for the fact that, like I said, if there was insect activity, if there was rodent activity, if there was any kind of activities in there, to get in there as fast as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3079.053s">would</a>  be the most appropriate thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3083.295s">So</a>  I think that we know now that we're going to probably get some kind of a reporting system going where the kids know exactly who to either call me, either call headmaster, assistant principal, so that we can respond in a manner that's prudent and fast.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3104.304s">Would</a>  it be helpful if the students <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3107.015s">let</a>  us know exactly what location the bathroom is, like C building. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3110.357s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3112.018s">Any</a>  information that we can get is going to help the solution to the problem, and as fast as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3122.603s">I</a>  just want to reiterate that these are old bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3126.025s">These</a>  are bathrooms that we can do the facelift part of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3132.229s">But</a>  I think where the concern is that we're talking 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3138.019s">of</a>  a change, and if anything, cars, anything like that need to be updated in that sort of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3145.683s">And</a>  like I said, with the reporting process, if we know right away, we do have enough bathrooms at the high school where if we do end up shutting one down, we can notify people which one would be open as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3158.629s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3159.909s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3161.45s">I</a>  just had a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3162.851s">Would</a>  we be able to put just a little <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3166.802s">note</a>  on the website, the Medford High School Medford Vocational website, just with the brief note that, you know, to inform students and parents if there's an issue to please contact and then provide like the names, you know, if there's an issue in the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3182.716s">if</a>  that's something that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3184.217s">I</a>  think a lot of what might help us, too, is we are working on the see something, say something app, which is going to be rolling out at some point, which is definitely going to be another way to get reporting in as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3200.822s">And</a>  that'll be really good, but for now, the assistant principals, even buildings and grounds, the door's always open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3208.046s">Come</a>  on down, we'll go right up there, take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3210.888s">I</a>  mean, everybody's willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3213.31s">Nobody</a>  wants what we feel or what the students feel is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3220.894s">We</a>  don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3222.215s">We</a>  want it as good as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3225.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3226.397s">School</a>  Committee, Woman McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3229.842s">Thank</a>  you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3232.363s">I</a>  also wanted to ask, following up on the black mold issue, clearly we have a student that was good enough to bring us in some photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3241.445s">So</a>  there is black mold somewhere in some of the bathrooms that is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3246.906s">So</a>  one of the questions that I would have is what is the process for removing black mold in those situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3252.467s">Do</a>  you know or what do we do?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3256.426s">We</a>  can hit it with the cleaners that we use are sufficient and the green cleaning that can clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3262.39s">Now,</a>  I don't know where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3265.132s">I</a>  didn't see the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3267.053s">Was</a>  it like a ceiling tile?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3275.779s">And</a>  I wanted to add, the pictures are very, very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3279.361s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3281.663s">The</a>  ceiling tiles, we went in there and we tried to replace a bunch of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3286.142s">We</a>  replaced a bunch of the stained ceiling tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3289.764s">And</a>  we're replacing a bunch of the heat registers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3292.746s">Yeah,</a>  that looks like it's inside of a bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3294.607s">I</a>  don't know where that could be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3297.489s">Sink?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3298.469s">Joey,</a>  sink?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3301.011s">C3,</a>  the countertop.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3302.352s">Oh,</a>  okay, all right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3305.574s">Yeah,</a>  we might have to take it out and replace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3308.836s">I</a>  didn't notice it during my tour either.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3313.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3314.092s">I</a>  know that there's going to be a discussion of some funds to at least address, you were saying, perhaps a few of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3320.675s">And</a>  I'm wondering, I'd like to make a motion that we have maybe a report of how and where those funds are used and what they're being applied to for those bathrooms, maybe within the next 30 days or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3333.42s">Well,</a>  I think.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3335.021s">actually</a>  have that right well the thing what I'm looking at is gutting the bathroom out gone brand-new two of them and that's what the City Council is <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3348.854s">was</a>  expecting and that's I think what Peter's reports can allude to.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3353.396s">So</a>  in the free cash report that comes later on, we requested in advance of the November 26th City Council report from the Medford City Council, $300,000 of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3364.501s">Of</a>  that $100,000 is going to be used to gut to the studs two bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3370.424s">There</a>  are 16 bathrooms in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3373.466s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin did a very good job in getting a cost estimate simply to retile. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3377.83s">So</a>  no plumbing, no other things, no demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3382.315s">Retiling</a>  over what is already there was going to be over $400,000 for those 16 bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3388.02s">All</a>  right, so hopefully we'll be able to do annual gut and rebuild as free cash or other funds become available to really start a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3398.611s">There</a>  have been conversations about this since I got here in July about the fact that the bathrooms are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3407.12s">The</a>  vice principals, the headmaster, the maintenance and facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3410.343s">I</a>  myself go through the bathrooms and pick up litter left behind and different things like that as I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3418.252s">And</a>  really would like to implore our students to make sure that they're taking care of their house as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3423.898s">And</a>  make sure that when we rebuild these bathrooms that they become a source of pride and a source of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3431.763s">because</a>  it's a substantial cash investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3434.104s">And</a>  so this will be ripping out to the studs, replacing ventilation, lighting, the entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3441.605s">So</a>  it is essentially a new bathroom from the studs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3444.085s">That</a>  cost right now is estimated at $50,000 per bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3447.966s">We'll</a>  be having some of our students in our vocational technical side of the school to be able to assist with that as necessary and as they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3458.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3462.153s">Just</a>  as a follow-up, so to the reporting process and policies and procedures, so there was a, I'm not sure how this process goes, bear with me, I'm first time, but for the motion that I had on the floor, do we make a vote on that or?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3477.161s">You</a>  could ask which ones will be done within the next 30 days.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3480.323s">Yes,</a>  a motion for which ones will be done in the next 30 days with a report and maybe some <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3485.225s">photo</a>  evidence, you know, when it's done to show us how nice they look so we can celebrate that as well.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3489.527s">We'll</a>  have photo evidence, we'll be having toys, we'll be having everything.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3492.287s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that'd be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3493.908s">No,</a>  really, so we can see sort of the process would be really helpful and to be able to share and celebrate sort of it moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3500.17s">So</a>  I have a motion on the floor for an update on that, where and when this will be done.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.112s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.712s">Yep,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3507.492s">As</a>  soon as we, as soon as, I know that we're gonna have a <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3510.651s">a</a>  session and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3512.332s">I</a>  know that Dr. Maurice had an idea of which one she may want to do, and I have an idea of what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3521.077s">So</a>  we're going to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3523.238s">We'll</a>  tell you ahead of time which ones we're actually going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3527.581s">And</a>  we'll keep you updated during the process, obviously, as much as you need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3534.284s">And</a>  like I said, afterwards, we'll have a ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3537.146s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3538.207s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3539.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3540.635s">School</a>  committee woman Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3544.436s">Can</a>  you give us a better understanding of when see click fix or whatever it's called will be a reality because I'm concerned about the reporting process for lots of reasons and I think one of the main reasons I'm concerned is because I think our principals and our assistant principals and you all have pressing things that happen every single day and for <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3567.716s">for</a>  those folks to be responsible for that kind of reporting and problem solving feels like the wrong use of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3577.204s">That</a>  application could go a long way to helping those issues be reported in a more timely fashion so that they can be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3585.171s">So</a>  I'm just curious what your timeline is there and whether that's imminent or there's work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3592.698s">Because</a>  I think that whole process of clarity would be really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3596.055s">I</a>  know we were in queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3598.116s">The</a>  company that does it, I believe that they're from Sandy Hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3602.337s">And</a>  it's a free application. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3604.417s">And</a>  I believe that we're in queue for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3607.598s">We're</a>  just waiting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3608.839s">At</a>  the time, when we were making the decision whether to use it or not, we just had, we weren't, I believe, in there first. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3619.141s">And</a>  so we got put onto a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3622.702s">So</a>  it's a free app, so it's not gonna cost the city anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3625.683s">And</a>  when it becomes available, we decided that we were going to take it up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3631.727s">So</a>  I don't exactly have a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3634.329s">I'm</a>  hoping it's within the school year, obviously the sooner the better, that we could employ something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3639.352s">Because</a>  it's not just going to be for buildings and rounds issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3642.834s">It's</a>  going to be for students that need it and whomever feels the need to use it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3652.057s">Can</a>  we follow up and get an update on the timeline at our next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3656.143s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3656.504s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3657.525s">Is</a>  that a motion?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3662.414s">School</a>  committee woman, Vanda Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3664.776s">Two</a>  things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3666.017s">I</a>  just want to remind the committee that we had put together a five-year capital improvement plan at the end of last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3674.242s">And</a>  the bathrooms were part of that plan, if I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3678.325s">So</a>  we might want to take that out again, take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3682.648s">We</a>  had anticipated that there would be certain monies available. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3686.41s">and</a>  just so that we're on track and consistent with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3691.012s">And</a>  we may need to revisit it, of course, but the bathrooms were certainly an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3695.614s">And</a>  then secondarily, I also want this really falls, there's the sort of short-term immediacy of the issue, but there is the long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3705.719s">And</a>  from our subcommittee on buildings and grounds led by Kathy Kreatz, we made a motion that we would <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3713.923s">have</a>  a larger committee put together appointed by the mayor to look into the high school renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3721.409s">And</a>  so I know it's your first day, but that obviously is something that this falls underneath because how much money are we going to invest? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3730.496s">What</a>  is the long term plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3732.137s">What</a>  makes sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3733.858s">Obviously,</a>  John, we need all of your efforts right now to make sure that the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3737.34s">they're</a>  as presentable as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3738.921s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3739.821s">And</a>  we need to invest some short-term money, but there is a long-term issue as well.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3744.344s">I</a>  think what had happened over the years is we were wishing for an MSBA grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3754.165s">Mr.</a>  Ruzzo mentioned it at a meeting not so long ago that we were rated one out of four, one being the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3760.612s">So</a>  it doesn't seem like that would be something that would be coming to Medford any time too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3765.997s">And</a>  then I believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3767.679s">Kreatz</a>  decided that we need to get together and make a list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3773.705s">Like</a>  you just alluded to, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3775.066s">Vandekloot,</a>  of how we want to tackle Mefford High School in regard to our capital improvements or funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3784.172s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3793.779s">I'm</a>  excited to hear about the two bathrooms, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3796.301s">My</a>  ninth grader, Teagan, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3798.252s">shares</a>  with Joey's concerns on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3801.313s">And</a>  I'm wondering if there's a way, if there's any surplus in the budget, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3805.875s">Patterson,</a>  if it would be cost effective to try to do four bathrooms if we're having a contracting company in. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3812.798s">And</a>  I think it's, I'm glad we're trying to do two at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3817.648s">But</a>  from what I hear, all 16 need to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3820.891s">So</a>  I'm wondering if there's a way we can put our brains together to see if there's more free cash, or if there's a surplus at the end, or if this can be a priority in our budget hearings.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3832.721s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3833.282s">I</a>  mean, the more the merrier, the way I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3836.525s">The</a>  only thing is planning a project like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3841.111s">It's</a>  right in the middle where the kids are, so we'd have to do some very strategic planning in order to accomplish a project like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3849.055s">It</a>  may even require moving kids out of certain places, similar to what we did with the science lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3856.318s">Not</a>  on the scale that we had to do it for the science lab, but it may take moving classes for sure.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5161.067s">2019</a>  closeout by Christine Patterson.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5169.29s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5169.79s">Good</a>  evening, members of the school committee and Madam Mayor, Luan Gokaran. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5174.051s">I</a>  wanted to provide you a closeout report for fiscal year 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5177.852s">We</a>  did the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5182.233s">I</a>  want to just kind of provide some general information, layman's terms for the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5187.715s">Accounting</a>  just for the benefit of the new members the 2019 appropriation is the budget so on many of the documents you'll see the word appropriation Which is the budget that has been allocated by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5202.719s">so</a>  the budget for FY 19 was 58 million six hundred eight six hundred thirty dollars and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5210.005s">There</a>  was an additional $2,020,381 earmarked from other revenue sources that provided an overall budget of services of $60,629,011. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5222.652s">According</a>  to Mass General Law's municipal accounting auditing requirements, the general fund, which is the budget appropriation from the city, cannot be in a deficit from the appropriation amount authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5234.638s">So</a>  I cannot show you a deficit budget, which is why you have been provided the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5240.032s">backup</a>  for the closeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5242.393s">The</a>  balance of the revenue was used to clear any deficits within school revolving funds such as athletics, pool, rink, and community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5252.436s">So</a>  each year, each new budgeting year, the intent is to adequately fund areas that support our student programs and provide for the gaps that cannot be recovered through user fees and additional charges and our rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5265.26s">So</a>  our goal has been to increase the budget appropriation from the city in order to provide the level of service that we need, and as we've identified, addressing some of the capital improvements that will be going forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5282.769s">And</a>  just to reiterate, we do have those capital meetings along with our budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5290.994s">So</a>  after we address our buildings and grounds department program area, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5295.463s">we</a>  are also obtaining the information for capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5301.888s">So</a>  the areas identified for the fiscal year appropriation savings that we had identified were larger areas were in the undistributed salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5311.856s">So</a>  again, just trying to guide you through your new reporting that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5318.02s">The</a>  program area, which is a three-digit code, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5321.811s">004</a>  is district-wide undistributed salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5325.754s">Again,</a>  this was budgeted in preparation for the salary negotiations of all of our main unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5333.779s">Therefore,</a>  we did not provide any COLA increases within the program areas, departments, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5342.965s">So</a>  we funded one line item in good faith for that negotiating period. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5347.815s">So</a>  it looks as though nothing was spent, but that was the purpose for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5351.338s">And</a>  going forward, those COLAs will be addressed in each department based on the salaries that teachers and paraprofessionals are within that coding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5363.033s">The</a>  district-wide account under the 005, the major savings we had was the assistant superintendent position that we had budgeted last fiscal year had not been able to be filled at that point in time, so that was considered savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5380.583s">In</a>  the 017, or the vocational programming area, we did have staffing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5386.286s">We</a>  had some resignations, retirements, and the replacements resulted in lower than projected budget amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5394.232s">Within</a>  our library media, code 029, we did have staffing changes as well that had lower than projected budget amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5403.775s">And</a>  in our last category of transportation, or the 033, our homeless transportation and additional runs came in lower than projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5412.257s">And</a>  that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5413.197s">We</a>  don't like to see our homeless transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5416.686s">so</a>  high because that indicates we've got more homeless that are in and out of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5423.03s">So</a>  each year during the budgeting process, our revenue sources are identified to supplement the appropriated budget as a means to achieve the district goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5432.336s">As</a>  you know, we will be looking at starting our budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5435.798s">You</a>  will be presented with potential dates for Committee of the Wholes as we <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5443.525s">prioritized</a>  in our process last year that seemed to work very efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5448.366s">The</a>  amounts utilized from each source were dependent on program needs and the available balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5455.208s">So</a>  as we closed out and reconciled the fiscal year 19, the after school program was identified, the before school programs <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5464.598s">The</a>  MEEP, which is the Medford Early Education Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5468.465s">Circuit</a>  Breaker, which is state-funded special education tuition costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5474.948s">transportation</a>  reimbursement and vocational tuitions and transportation reimbursements from the state and other providers, as well as our building facility rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5485.331s">So</a>  all of these revenue sources provided additional services and they covered the additional categories of costs that was above and beyond what we were allocated by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5497.635s">So</a>  as a summary of the revolving funds, I've also provided that document for your review and identification of the various revolving accounts that we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5509.763s">And</a>  I am open to any questions that you might have.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5514.286s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5516.407s">So</a>  thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5518.608s">I</a>  would just suggest, so that we don't have to listen to me for 20 minutes, that maybe we could do it page by page, if that makes sense to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5528.753s">So</a>  I have a number of questions, which I think will be easy and quick to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5533.416s">But</a>  on page one, under the finance, the technology tech spec line, the expenditures were <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5545.132s">a</a>  lot more than planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5546.873s">What</a>  is that expenditure?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5548.434s">So</a>  that's a contract service and support line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5552.356s">So</a>  we had additional monitoring services for various fees that we have for district-wide technology initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5560.84s">So</a>  that's our Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5561.98s">Those</a>  are different areas that we have for technology needs.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5565.314s">And</a>  do you predict that to be something that we, in the next cycle, you'll put in at a quarter of a million, or is it just this was a weird year?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5571.796s">No,</a>  there's a bubble year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5573.657s">And</a>  again, I will reiterate that there are line items within the budget program area that are going to, some are going to be higher, some are going to be a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5584.32s">We</a>  land on the bottom line number, and that's where our appropriation is, our budget.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5589.542s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5591.742s">And</a>  further down under, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5595.78s">Oh,</a>  actually, that was the last thing on that page. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5599.102s">So</a>  I guess if anybody else has something on page one, I could also just keep going to page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5606.426s">I</a>  have something on page one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5613.09s">Page</a>  one?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5614.231s">Yes,</a>  page one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5615.432s">School</a>  committee woman McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5617.113s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5619.452s">on</a>  the district-wide substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5622.375s">So</a>  there's a really large deficit on the substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5626.519s">And</a>  I'm wondering about that, since I'm hearing, at least from community, when we were out talking and asking questions about what was important to people, that substitutes has been a longstanding concern and issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5639.931s">So</a>  I'm wondering if you could tell me a little.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5642.408s">So</a>  that indicates that we do have a lot of substitute fees and costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5647.19s">So</a>  when there are extended long-term coverages, they would be covered out of a substitute account. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5653.473s">These</a>  are the daily substitutes that are within each of the buildings on the outside, as well as the main, the high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5662.757s">So</a>  that is a true cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5665.479s">And</a>  we still have difficulty getting enough daily substitutes to cover <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5670.729s">the</a>  absences in a given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5672.911s">And</a>  so we have increased our daily rate in hopes to recruit more daily subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5681.58s">It</a>  is a difficult position to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5684.883s">It's</a>  not just a Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5686.865s">It's</a>  a problem with many school systems in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5691.369s">It's</a>  just a per diem <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5693.544s">position,</a>  there's no benefits, it's as you go, day to day, people will fill in bids for jobs that are open on any given day.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5703.087s">Can</a>  I ask what the daily rate is? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5705.128s">It's</a>  $90. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5706.269s">It's</a>  $90 for the daily rate for a Medford substitute, and we're about almost $100,000 over for the cost of substitutes for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5713.311s">For</a>  last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5715.832s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5719.693s">School</a>  Committeewoman Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5722.549s">How</a>  does our substitute rate compare to surrounding communities?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5726.331s">We've</a>  increased it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5728.733s">So</a>  we're getting very close to what other municipalities are paying in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5735.617s">We're</a>  not paying what Boston public would be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5739.459s">We're</a>  not paying what Lexington would be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5742.04s">So</a>  we're competitive in the comparison of size of our school system.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5752.145s">Do</a>  you have a number that you could share about somebody that you think is sort of relative?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5759.172s">Well,</a>  $90 is a competitive rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5762.215s">That's</a>  what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5764.557s">We</a>  were much lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5766.859s">We</a>  were at $70. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5767.48s">Then</a>  we were at $80. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5768.381s">We're</a>  at $90 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5769.902s">That's</a>  a competitive rate for the locals that we can certainly look toward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5776.954s">But</a>  we do pay higher rates for those that are licensed and those that are coming in for long-term coverages. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5784.599s">So</a>  that's another incentive that we try to gain folks to stay within our district.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5792.544s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5793.825s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5795.726s">Page</a>  two.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5802.61s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5803.512s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5804.012s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5805.874s">Oh,</a>  I canceled all my questions on page two for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5808.816s">So</a>  I don't have anything on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5811.478s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5814.681s">Anybody?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5817.423s">Just</a>  give everybody a second to review page two.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5822.867s">Did</a>  you want to go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5823.768s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5825.783s">I</a>  guess it's more of a follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5827.864s">It's</a>  the substitutes again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5831.067s">And</a>  this is the permanent substitutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5834.088s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5834.429s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5835.169s">So</a>  that's an additional 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5836.83s">So</a>  now it is about 130 over budget that we're at currently for substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5845.296s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5845.996s">Including</a>  permanent substitutes.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5848.578s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5848.818s">So</a>  permanent substitutes, it's a loose term, but it's for substitutes that are assigned <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5855.078s">Every</a>  day at the high school, they are full-time, full-year position, and they do obtain benefits, as well as a slightly higher rate for a daily rate, a per diem, and it's annualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5868.742s">However,</a>  again, given the low compensation as a daily employee, this is a very fluid position, and there's a lot of turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5879.665s">So</a>  there's a lot of challenges within that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5887.151s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5888.932s">Do</a>  we have any permanent substitutes in the other schools?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5891.654s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5892.215s">There's</a>  one at each of the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5894.156s">The</a>  high school typically has eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5897.018s">But</a>  again, that's when we can keep them in that capacity.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5901.021s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5905.385s">Page</a>  three or four.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5906.606s">Page</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5909.348s">The</a>  kindergarten aids for the elementary schools, I'm looking at the appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5916.937s">And</a>  I can't remember this stuff from last year, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5921.78s">Those</a>  salaries, I mean, how many people is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5926.003s">Not</a>  like 50,000 at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5928.205s">How</a>  many people is that?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5930.326s">So</a>  at each of the elementaries, there was a varying number, and some of them only had a part-time kindergarten aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5938.231s">So</a>  that's why the amount fluctuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5940.213s">It</a>  was different. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5942.354s">In</a>  fiscal year 20, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5943.972s">We</a>  made all of the kindergarten aides full-time and they had the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5948.956s">I</a>  believe some buildings had four, some buildings had two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5953.719s">And</a>  they are, the kindergarten aides are part of a collective bargaining unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5958.483s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5958.723s">That's</a>  my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5959.683s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5960.064s">Page</a>  three, four or five.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5975.188s">Page</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5978.189s">I</a>  feel like I know your answer to this one, but I'm going to ask it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5981.429s">Under</a>  special ed, there's all these teacher salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5984.75s">Is</a>  this one of those things where you moved it between? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5988.65s">They're</a>  budgeted for zero, but we spent, I'm guessing, a couple million dollars there.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5993.451s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5993.751s">So</a>  this is one of the areas that we have program costs that are outside the appropriation that we try to offset from various funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6002.113s">So</a>  if we were to budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6004.32s">and</a>  put in all the lines for the various teachers in this, our appropriation budget would be significantly higher, closer to a million plus higher than what we were allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6019.308s">So</a>  we show it as no budget because we don't have an appropriation for it, but this is the appropriate recording place to show that by each school building, we did have special education teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6031.955s">So</a>  I do have to report to the Department of Ed based on a function, based on a building, where the teachers are actually located. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6039.601s">And</a>  so therefore, we provide the actual salaries in their appropriate reporting area.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6047.888s">And</a>  the LD, does that mean learning disability? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6050.11s">What</a>  is the LD in that description? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6051.912s">Lead.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6052.052s">Lead.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6052.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6053.193s">Lead</a>  teachers, yes.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6054.354s">I</a>  was trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6056.335s">So</a>  these are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6059.387s">A</a>  lot of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6060.407s">I</a>  mean, I'm like 10 or more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6063.048s">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6065.828s">And</a>  we, every year, we go into the year, we don't have any money for them, because we know we're going to find the money elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6075.65s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6077.871s">That's</a>  an important story to tell the network. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6079.411s">Hence</a>  the goal to fund all of the program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6085.834s">but</a>  we have always provided additional revenue sources to offset where we cannot provide.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6092.38s">So</a>  when the community says we shouldn't be renting out the high school, what they're also saying is we shouldn't be having special ed teachers at the McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6100.428s">I</a>  wouldn't put that in so many words, but you can deduct from your own information there.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6109.016s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6120.31s">Yes,</a>  getting back to just to follow up on that question, again, forgive me since I'm new at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6125.013s">I'm</a>  sure I'm going to have questions that may be obvious or already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6130.757s">So</a>  why aren't the special education costs included in the appropriation?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6137.863s">The</a>  costs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6140.184s">There's</a>  not a line item budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6142.226s">Because</a>  the budget, if we provided the budget for those <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6146.492s">lines</a>  would be much higher than what the city allocated for our appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6152.456s">So</a>  if I were to include the amounts that we spend on those teachers, we would be in a deficit budget situation right off the bat, and I can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6164.525s">So</a>  it's not shown as a budget item, but it's shown as the expenditure to accurately report that our <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6174.508s">funding</a>  is going towards special education services at each location.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6179.469s">And</a>  then how is that made up every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6181.37s">It</a>  just is different every year, or I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.35s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.57s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.991s">So</a>  that's where we have a variance in terms of what the city provides us and what the school departments have to backfill, if you will, with offsetting revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6195.533s">So</a>  those are different program areas that help fund the areas that we need or that are identifying <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6204.162s">for</a>  services provided for the students.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6208.204s">OK,</a>  I'll ask more questions later. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6210.506s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6213.768s">We're</a>  all learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6214.428s">Any</a>  questions are good questions.</p>
