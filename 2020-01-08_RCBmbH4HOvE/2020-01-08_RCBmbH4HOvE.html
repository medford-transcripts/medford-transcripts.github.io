    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2616.706s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2618.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2619.453s">In</a>  the meantime, while we wait, I just want to thank Joey for coming forward and for making this statement and being proactive about what he's seeing at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2628.375s">We</a>  are only as good as our information we received, Joey, so thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2636.917s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2638.158s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2639.778s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2641.058s">Council,</a>  student committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2643.679s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2645.878s">I</a>  did, Peter will have something to add as well to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2651.022s">So</a>  upon social media, I took, Mr. Falco did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2663.273s">We</a>  went out and I went out and personally inspected all the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2666.696s">I</a>  went out and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2670.428s">made</a>  sure that they're old, the bathrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2674.631s">You</a>  cannot take that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2676.572s">But</a>  let me just run through the report real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2684.338s">So</a>  I went through the bathrooms and some of my findings was some of the fin tube radiator covers are in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2691.503s">So</a>  at this time we have started the replacement of the radiator covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2695.309s">We're</a>  waiting for some parts to come in from Granger to finish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2701.011s">I</a>  didn't find any signs of rodent activity or insect activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2705.553s">I</a>  encourage people to report it because we do have an integrated pest management plan in all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2712.296s">And</a>  we need to know immediately if there's anything like that happening because we can call in our contractor and take care of it right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2726.63s">So</a>  the restrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2728.132s">They're</a>  not aesthetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2730.214s">There's</a>  been many years of repainting and painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2733.317s">The</a>  tile's old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2734.258s">It's</a>  outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2735.92s">The</a>  fixtures and the sinks are all running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2738.823s">We</a>  went through this past vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2743.645s">I</a>  had the contract cleaners do a heavy cleaning of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2748.947s">We</a>  went in and did some sealant tile replacements, replaced locks that needed to be replaced on stall doors, made sure everything was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2760.332s">Besides</a>  being old, we're trying to do what we can for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2766.895s">They</a>  clean, they don't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2771.768s">So</a>  over the past few years, they used to have Bradley sinks in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2776.211s">We</a>  replaced them with regular sinks and put Formica countertops on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2780.414s">And</a>  the Formica's wearing out, it's 15 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2783.336s">So</a>  I mean, we do have some work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2786.978s">I</a>  think at this point, and I know Pete is gonna allude to it, that we do have some available cash to possibly do at least two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2801.272s">over,</a>  we just have to make decisions on which ones that we'd like to do and then go through the process of hiring a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2811.594s">And</a>  I also work with Paul DeLaval, which was a big thing, is we got together and we decided that in the mornings, when they open up the cafeteria side for breakfast, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2824.139s">When</a>  they close them, when the kids pass to the hallways, the custodians are going in, cleaning them, making sure they're all clean, and then they don't get open till lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2833.888s">On</a>  the other side, on the guidance side that's been open all morning, we are cleaning them at noontime when they lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2840.674s">So</a>  we're going in there and freshening them up, trying to keep them as fresh as possible as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2846.459s">Obviously,</a>  if there's any issues during the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2850.382s">the</a>  assistant principals will contact us and we'll do what we need to do to freshen them up as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2859.987s">And</a>  I think, yeah, so over the holiday break, like I said, we did the heavy duty cleaning in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2868.632s">They're</a>  better, but they're old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2870.012s">They</a>  just don't show anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2873.174s">They've</a>  been painted over and over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2880.723s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2885.485s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2886.885s">I</a>  had a question about how students and staff can quickly report things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2897.579s">well-known</a>  process that if you ask students and staff, they would have an answer.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2900.801s">You</a>  know what, to that, I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2902.442s">I</a>  would assume that they would go through the assistant principals, or a teacher, or anybody that can get in touch with Headmaster DeLave or whomever. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2911.688s">Normally,</a>  if something goes on in a bathroom, we'll get a report, mainly by the assistant principal, that'll say, hey, we need a clean up here in bathroom two in C building, and then over the radio, and then we'll send somebody right up.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2927.873s">And</a>  how often are custodians actually checking each bathroom throughout the day?</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2933.997s">So</a>  with the schedule that Mr. McLaughlin talked about, we've been trying to kind of clean, shut down, open, clean, shut down, open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2946.023s">I</a>  think that's happening twice a day, which is more than what we were doing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2952.187s">The</a>  frequency of the cleaning also helps us with reporting as well because being an assistant principal and being a male as well or being a headmaster, I can't get into every single bathroom or I have to wait for somebody to come and look at another bathroom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2971.71s">So</a>  again, what's been helping is that schedule of cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2976.793s">Because</a>  sort of what we've utilized at the Andrews when I was there as well is that when you're constantly updating the bathrooms, we're getting more reports regarding graffiti, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2989.139s">For</a>  the other stuff, I've always asked, too, if anybody has any concerns or complaints, to just please see me so I can address it.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2998.984s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3002.68s">School</a>  Committeewoman Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.261s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.622s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.882s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3007.484s">I</a>  just had a question, because I know Mr. Falco mentioned that he noticed some black mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3012.608s">So</a>  I was just concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3013.568s">I</a>  didn't hear that, and I didn't read that in the report that was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3016.651s">Did</a>  you, when you were doing the deep cleaning, was there any sign of any black mold?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3021.234s">I'm</a>  afraid I didn't get any reports to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3025.938s">I</a>  mean, if there's something going on, yeah, we'll go back in there immediately for sure.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3033.072s">And</a>  then were the soap dispensers, were they cleaned out? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3036.753s">Or</a>  were they, do you think maybe it was like particles in the soap dispenser? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3040.354s">Or</a>  was it, you know, maybe just a change of soap?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3042.914s">The</a>  soap dispensers are a closed item, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3045.495s">I</a>  know that we've had some instances in the last month where we had to replace six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3052.236s">So</a>  I don't, you know, I don't know how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3056.677s">I</a>  wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3057.437s">I</a>  wish I had more information so that I could've <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3061.794s">been</a>  conclusive on what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3064.637s">And</a>  just for the fact that, like I said, if there was insect activity, if there was rodent activity, if there was any kind of activities in there, to get in there as fast as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3079.053s">would</a>  be the most appropriate thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3083.295s">So</a>  I think that we know now that we're going to probably get some kind of a reporting system going where the kids know exactly who to either call me, either call headmaster, assistant principal, so that we can respond in a manner that's prudent and fast.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3104.304s">Would</a>  it be helpful if the students <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3107.015s">let</a>  us know exactly what location the bathroom is, like C building. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3110.357s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3112.018s">Any</a>  information that we can get is going to help the solution to the problem, and as fast as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3122.603s">I</a>  just want to reiterate that these are old bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3126.025s">These</a>  are bathrooms that we can do the facelift part of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3132.229s">But</a>  I think where the concern is that we're talking 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3138.019s">of</a>  a change, and if anything, cars, anything like that need to be updated in that sort of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3145.683s">And</a>  like I said, with the reporting process, if we know right away, we do have enough bathrooms at the high school where if we do end up shutting one down, we can notify people which one would be open as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3158.629s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3159.909s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3161.45s">I</a>  just had a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3162.851s">Would</a>  we be able to put just a little <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3166.802s">note</a>  on the website, the Medford High School Medford Vocational website, just with the brief note that, you know, to inform students and parents if there's an issue to please contact and then provide like the names, you know, if there's an issue in the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3182.716s">if</a>  that's something that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3184.217s">I</a>  think a lot of what might help us, too, is we are working on the see something, say something app, which is going to be rolling out at some point, which is definitely going to be another way to get reporting in as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3200.822s">And</a>  that'll be really good, but for now, the assistant principals, even buildings and grounds, the door's always open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3208.046s">Come</a>  on down, we'll go right up there, take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3210.888s">I</a>  mean, everybody's willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3213.31s">Nobody</a>  wants what we feel or what the students feel is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3220.894s">We</a>  don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3222.215s">We</a>  want it as good as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3225.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3226.397s">School</a>  Committee, Woman McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3229.842s">Thank</a>  you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3232.363s">I</a>  also wanted to ask, following up on the black mold issue, clearly we have a student that was good enough to bring us in some photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3241.445s">So</a>  there is black mold somewhere in some of the bathrooms that is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3246.906s">So</a>  one of the questions that I would have is what is the process for removing black mold in those situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3252.467s">Do</a>  you know or what do we do?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3256.426s">We</a>  can hit it with the cleaners that we use are sufficient and the green cleaning that can clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3262.39s">Now,</a>  I don't know where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3265.132s">I</a>  didn't see the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3267.053s">Was</a>  it like a ceiling tile?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3275.779s">And</a>  I wanted to add, the pictures are very, very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3279.361s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3281.663s">The</a>  ceiling tiles, we went in there and we tried to replace a bunch of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3286.142s">We</a>  replaced a bunch of the stained ceiling tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3289.764s">And</a>  we're replacing a bunch of the heat registers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3292.746s">Yeah,</a>  that looks like it's inside of a bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3294.607s">I</a>  don't know where that could be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3297.489s">Sink?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3298.469s">Joey,</a>  sink?</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3301.011s">C3,</a>  the countertop.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3302.352s">Oh,</a>  okay, all right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3305.574s">Yeah,</a>  we might have to take it out and replace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3308.836s">I</a>  didn't notice it during my tour either.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3313.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3314.092s">I</a>  know that there's going to be a discussion of some funds to at least address, you were saying, perhaps a few of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3320.675s">And</a>  I'm wondering, I'd like to make a motion that we have maybe a report of how and where those funds are used and what they're being applied to for those bathrooms, maybe within the next 30 days or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3333.42s">Well,</a>  I think.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3335.021s">actually</a>  have that right well the thing what I'm looking at is gutting the bathroom out gone brand-new two of them and that's what the City Council is <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3348.854s">was</a>  expecting and that's I think what Peter's reports can allude to.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3353.396s">So</a>  in the free cash report that comes later on, we requested in advance of the November 26th City Council report from the Medford City Council, $300,000 of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3364.501s">Of</a>  that $100,000 is going to be used to gut to the studs two bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3370.424s">There</a>  are 16 bathrooms in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3373.466s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin did a very good job in getting a cost estimate simply to retile. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3377.83s">So</a>  no plumbing, no other things, no demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3382.315s">Retiling</a>  over what is already there was going to be over $400,000 for those 16 bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3388.02s">All</a>  right, so hopefully we'll be able to do annual gut and rebuild as free cash or other funds become available to really start a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3398.611s">There</a>  have been conversations about this since I got here in July about the fact that the bathrooms are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3407.12s">The</a>  vice principals, the headmaster, the maintenance and facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3410.343s">I</a>  myself go through the bathrooms and pick up litter left behind and different things like that as I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3418.252s">And</a>  really would like to implore our students to make sure that they're taking care of their house as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3423.898s">And</a>  make sure that when we rebuild these bathrooms that they become a source of pride and a source of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3431.763s">because</a>  it's a substantial cash investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3434.104s">And</a>  so this will be ripping out to the studs, replacing ventilation, lighting, the entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3441.605s">So</a>  it is essentially a new bathroom from the studs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3444.085s">That</a>  cost right now is estimated at $50,000 per bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3447.966s">We'll</a>  be having some of our students in our vocational technical side of the school to be able to assist with that as necessary and as they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3458.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3462.153s">Just</a>  as a follow-up, so to the reporting process and policies and procedures, so there was a, I'm not sure how this process goes, bear with me, I'm first time, but for the motion that I had on the floor, do we make a vote on that or?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3477.161s">You</a>  could ask which ones will be done within the next 30 days.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3480.323s">Yes,</a>  a motion for which ones will be done in the next 30 days with a report and maybe some <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3485.225s">photo</a>  evidence, you know, when it's done to show us how nice they look so we can celebrate that as well.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3489.527s">We'll</a>  have photo evidence, we'll be having toys, we'll be having everything.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3492.287s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that'd be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3493.908s">No,</a>  really, so we can see sort of the process would be really helpful and to be able to share and celebrate sort of it moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3500.17s">So</a>  I have a motion on the floor for an update on that, where and when this will be done.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.112s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.712s">Yep,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3507.492s">As</a>  soon as we, as soon as, I know that we're gonna have a <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3510.651s">a</a>  session and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3512.332s">I</a>  know that Dr. Maurice had an idea of which one she may want to do, and I have an idea of what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3521.077s">So</a>  we're going to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3523.238s">We'll</a>  tell you ahead of time which ones we're actually going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3527.581s">And</a>  we'll keep you updated during the process, obviously, as much as you need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3534.284s">And</a>  like I said, afterwards, we'll have a ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3537.146s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3538.207s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3539.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3540.635s">School</a>  committee woman Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3544.436s">Can</a>  you give us a better understanding of when see click fix or whatever it's called will be a reality because I'm concerned about the reporting process for lots of reasons and I think one of the main reasons I'm concerned is because I think our principals and our assistant principals and you all have pressing things that happen every single day and for <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3567.716s">for</a>  those folks to be responsible for that kind of reporting and problem solving feels like the wrong use of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3577.204s">That</a>  application could go a long way to helping those issues be reported in a more timely fashion so that they can be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3585.171s">So</a>  I'm just curious what your timeline is there and whether that's imminent or there's work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3592.698s">Because</a>  I think that whole process of clarity would be really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3596.055s">I</a>  know we were in queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3598.116s">The</a>  company that does it, I believe that they're from Sandy Hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3602.337s">And</a>  it's a free application. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3604.417s">And</a>  I believe that we're in queue for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3607.598s">We're</a>  just waiting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3608.839s">At</a>  the time, when we were making the decision whether to use it or not, we just had, we weren't, I believe, in there first. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3619.141s">And</a>  so we got put onto a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3622.702s">So</a>  it's a free app, so it's not gonna cost the city anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3625.683s">And</a>  when it becomes available, we decided that we were going to take it up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3631.727s">So</a>  I don't exactly have a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3634.329s">I'm</a>  hoping it's within the school year, obviously the sooner the better, that we could employ something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3639.352s">Because</a>  it's not just going to be for buildings and rounds issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3642.834s">It's</a>  going to be for students that need it and whomever feels the need to use it.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3652.057s">Can</a>  we follow up and get an update on the timeline at our next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3656.143s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3656.504s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3657.525s">Is</a>  that a motion?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3662.414s">School</a>  committee woman, Vanda Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3664.776s">Two</a>  things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3666.017s">I</a>  just want to remind the committee that we had put together a five-year capital improvement plan at the end of last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3674.242s">And</a>  the bathrooms were part of that plan, if I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3678.325s">So</a>  we might want to take that out again, take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3682.648s">We</a>  had anticipated that there would be certain monies available. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3686.41s">and</a>  just so that we're on track and consistent with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3691.012s">And</a>  we may need to revisit it, of course, but the bathrooms were certainly an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3695.614s">And</a>  then secondarily, I also want this really falls, there's the sort of short-term immediacy of the issue, but there is the long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3705.719s">And</a>  from our subcommittee on buildings and grounds led by Kathy Kreatz, we made a motion that we would <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3713.923s">have</a>  a larger committee put together appointed by the mayor to look into the high school renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3721.409s">And</a>  so I know it's your first day, but that obviously is something that this falls underneath because how much money are we going to invest? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3730.496s">What</a>  is the long term plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3732.137s">What</a>  makes sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3733.858s">Obviously,</a>  John, we need all of your efforts right now to make sure that the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3737.34s">they're</a>  as presentable as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3738.921s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3739.821s">And</a>  we need to invest some short-term money, but there is a long-term issue as well.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3744.344s">I</a>  think what had happened over the years is we were wishing for an MSBA grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3754.165s">Mr.</a>  Ruzzo mentioned it at a meeting not so long ago that we were rated one out of four, one being the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3760.612s">So</a>  it doesn't seem like that would be something that would be coming to Medford any time too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3765.997s">And</a>  then I believe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3767.679s">Kreatz</a>  decided that we need to get together and make a list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3773.705s">Like</a>  you just alluded to, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3775.066s">Vandekloot,</a>  of how we want to tackle Mefford High School in regard to our capital improvements or funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3784.172s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3787.975s">City</a>  Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3790.197s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3790.657s">School</a>  committee woman, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3791.778s">Stone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3793.779s">I'm</a>  excited to hear about the two bathrooms, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3796.301s">My</a>  ninth grader, Teagan, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3798.252s">shares</a>  with Joey's concerns on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3801.313s">And</a>  I'm wondering if there's a way, if there's any surplus in the budget, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3805.875s">Patterson,</a>  if it would be cost effective to try to do four bathrooms if we're having a contracting company in. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3812.798s">And</a>  I think it's, I'm glad we're trying to do two at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3817.648s">But</a>  from what I hear, all 16 need to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3820.891s">So</a>  I'm wondering if there's a way we can put our brains together to see if there's more free cash, or if there's a surplus at the end, or if this can be a priority in our budget hearings.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3832.721s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3833.282s">I</a>  mean, the more the merrier, the way I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3836.525s">The</a>  only thing is planning a project like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3841.111s">It's</a>  right in the middle where the kids are, so we'd have to do some very strategic planning in order to accomplish a project like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3849.055s">It</a>  may even require moving kids out of certain places, similar to what we did with the science lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3856.318s">Not</a>  on the scale that we had to do it for the science lab, but it may take moving classes for sure.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3867.724s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3868.924s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3869.704s">You're</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3870.225s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3910.576s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3911.156s">And</a>  then once I review that, as well as the other committees with her, that can be released hopefully by next week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4116.502s">Bailey</a>  Shindell, 46 Washington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4119.878s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, and school committee members, we are so very pleased to present a drawing of the second Winne-Disney Vacation Raffle organized by the Medford City Elementary Alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4134.369s">The</a>  Elementary Alliance is a working group of four elementary school PTOs and PTGs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4139.934s">This</a>  all began about 18 months ago when a group of parents and teachers from across the city came together to explore the idea <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4147.299s">of</a>  working together on a project or two to benefit all four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4152.361s">Due</a>  to the terrific ideas and incredible hard work of the group, in the first year, we put on three events and raised over $30,000, well beyond our wildest expectations when we first gathered together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4165.567s">Although</a>  the initial motivator was fundraising to support the PTOs and PTGs, which fund crucial things like buses for field trips, student enrichment activities, and teacher support, we also discovered the group gave us the opportunity to share best practices and other ideas, as well as the opportunity to advocate together for our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4188.232s">This</a>  year the group formalized a working relationship among the elementary PTOs and PTGs and adopted the name Citywide Elementary Alliance to further support the group's ability to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4200.895s">And</a>  we have been off to a strong start this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4204.096s">Early</a>  this year we had an electronics recycling event and we are again hosting the Wizards basketball team here at Medford High School in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4212.258s">Stay</a>  tuned for more details. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4214.768s">Back</a>  to the Disney raffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4216.789s">It's</a>  impossible to overstate the significance of the community to this fundraising effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4222.07s">So</a>  before we get on to the drawing of the winner of this raffle, we'd like to say thank you to a few people whose support has been instrumental in our success. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4230.912s">First,</a>  from our city government, we'd like to thank Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, outgoing Mayor Stephanie Burke and her staff, including Allie Fisk and Deanna Devaney. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4244.147s">Thank</a>  you also to Kevin Bailey and Danny Folks from the Recreation Department and City Clerk Adam Herdebeest. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4253.174s">Our</a>  elementary school principals have also been critical supporters as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4256.836s">So</a>  thank you to Principal Johnson from the Roberts, Principal Guarino from the McGlynn, Principal Kaye from the Columbus, and Principal Galusi from the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4265.945s">and</a>  their staff and all the teachers who have helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4268.727s">The</a>  larger Medford community has again been incredibly supportive of this effort, and we give a huge thank you to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4276.512s">Francis</a>  of Assisi Church, the Friends of the Medford Public Library, 4 Good Vibes, and Stop and Shop for welcoming us into their business and events to sell raffle tickets.</p>

    <p>[9sF78fOJr5I_SPEAKER_61]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4291.279s">Hi</a>  all, I'm Christy Avino, 24 Carberry Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4294.682s">I</a>  also want to take a moment before we get to drawing the winner to acknowledge our fantastic Disney captains who have done so much work and dedicated many hours of their time, even though they and their families are prohibited from entering this amazing drawing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4309.154s">Our</a>  captains included myself and my co-chair, Jenny Graham, Jen Conti, Melissa DeMeo, who's here, Doug Nagengast, Katie Hogan, Emma Heffern, who's here from the Columbus, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4319.943s">Gary</a>  Papps, Bailey Shindell, and Renee Hanley. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4323.586s">And</a>  we also must thank one person without whom none of this would be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4328.509s">Thank</a>  you to Tamara Morrow, who is our treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4331.672s">She's</a>  the treasurer of the Brooks PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4333.953s">She's</a>  taken on an absolutely critical task and time-intensive task of handling the finances, the tax reporting, and compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4342.559s">You've</a>  heard us say it before, raffle compliance is a serious business and one that I think Tamara never thought she would find herself in. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4349.791s">But</a>  here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4350.452s">We</a>  also want to thank our PTO and PTG boards and the parents who sold tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4356.855s">This</a>  year we had a very friendly competition for top salesperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4360.357s">We</a>  think it was a very close tie between my eight-year-old son, Owen, and Robert Elementary School parent, Steve DeMayo, who was very, very, very involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4369.862s">They</a>  both dedicated dozens of hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4371.523s">You</a>  saw them selling tickets all over at the city event. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4375.344s">Steve</a>  DeMayo's 8-year-old son Matthew is here and is going to assist Mayor Lungo-Koehn in picking the winner ticket, the winner to winning tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4387.108s">This</a>  year, just to give you some information, we sold at my last count 3,584 tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4392.69s">Our</a>  gross sales plus donations pending Tamara's final accounting are just about $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4398.154s">And</a>  this is just really, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4405.178s">This</a>  is just really incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4406.939s">Why</a>  don't you give that, yeah, give it a couple of spins, Matthew. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4410.101s">Mix</a>  them all up. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4411.547s">This</a>  is incredible that when you think that we sold tickets for just about two months this year, actually less time than last year due to sort of all of the organization in putting together a working agreement for the four PTOs and also sort of this Christmas break, holiday break that was during our selling period. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4430.416s">This</a>  year after we pay expenses and file the tax returns and also pay the state a gaming tax, our PTOs and P2Gs will receive about $3,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4441.521s">which</a>  is a huge boost and will really go far in supporting critical needs for our students and our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4448.443s">So</a>  if you would please draw and announce the grand prize winner first.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4453.605s">Yes,</a>  we're going to teamwork this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4455.125s">Matthew's</a>  going to draw and his eyes are closed and I'll announce it, okay?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5161.067s">2019</a>  closeout by Christine Patterson.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5169.29s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5169.79s">Good</a>  evening, members of the school committee and Madam Mayor, Luan Gokaran. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5174.051s">I</a>  wanted to provide you a closeout report for fiscal year 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5177.852s">We</a>  did the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5182.233s">I</a>  want to just kind of provide some general information, layman's terms for the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5187.715s">Accounting</a>  just for the benefit of the new members the 2019 appropriation is the budget so on many of the documents you'll see the word appropriation Which is the budget that has been allocated by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5202.719s">so</a>  the budget for FY 19 was 58 million six hundred eight six hundred thirty dollars and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5210.005s">There</a>  was an additional $2,020,381 earmarked from other revenue sources that provided an overall budget of services of $60,629,011. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5222.652s">According</a>  to Mass General Law's municipal accounting auditing requirements, the general fund, which is the budget appropriation from the city, cannot be in a deficit from the appropriation amount authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5234.638s">So</a>  I cannot show you a deficit budget, which is why you have been provided the <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5240.032s">backup</a>  for the closeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5242.393s">The</a>  balance of the revenue was used to clear any deficits within school revolving funds such as athletics, pool, rink, and community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5252.436s">So</a>  each year, each new budgeting year, the intent is to adequately fund areas that support our student programs and provide for the gaps that cannot be recovered through user fees and additional charges and our rate increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5265.26s">So</a>  our goal has been to increase the budget appropriation from the city in order to provide the level of service that we need, and as we've identified, addressing some of the capital improvements that will be going forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5282.769s">And</a>  just to reiterate, we do have those capital meetings along with our budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5290.994s">So</a>  after we address our buildings and grounds department program area, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5295.463s">we</a>  are also obtaining the information for capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5301.888s">So</a>  the areas identified for the fiscal year appropriation savings that we had identified were larger areas were in the undistributed salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5311.856s">So</a>  again, just trying to guide you through your new reporting that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5318.02s">The</a>  program area, which is a three-digit code, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5321.811s">004</a>  is district-wide undistributed salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5325.754s">Again,</a>  this was budgeted in preparation for the salary negotiations of all of our main unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5333.779s">Therefore,</a>  we did not provide any COLA increases within the program areas, departments, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5342.965s">So</a>  we funded one line item in good faith for that negotiating period. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5347.815s">So</a>  it looks as though nothing was spent, but that was the purpose for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5351.338s">And</a>  going forward, those COLAs will be addressed in each department based on the salaries that teachers and paraprofessionals are within that coding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5363.033s">The</a>  district-wide account under the 005, the major savings we had was the assistant superintendent position that we had budgeted last fiscal year had not been able to be filled at that point in time, so that was considered savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5380.583s">In</a>  the 017, or the vocational programming area, we did have staffing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5386.286s">We</a>  had some resignations, retirements, and the replacements resulted in lower than projected budget amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5394.232s">Within</a>  our library media, code 029, we did have staffing changes as well that had lower than projected budget amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5403.775s">And</a>  in our last category of transportation, or the 033, our homeless transportation and additional runs came in lower than projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5412.257s">And</a>  that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5413.197s">We</a>  don't like to see our homeless transportation <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5416.686s">so</a>  high because that indicates we've got more homeless that are in and out of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5423.03s">So</a>  each year during the budgeting process, our revenue sources are identified to supplement the appropriated budget as a means to achieve the district goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5432.336s">As</a>  you know, we will be looking at starting our budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5435.798s">You</a>  will be presented with potential dates for Committee of the Wholes as we <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5443.525s">prioritized</a>  in our process last year that seemed to work very efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5448.366s">The</a>  amounts utilized from each source were dependent on program needs and the available balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5455.208s">So</a>  as we closed out and reconciled the fiscal year 19, the after school program was identified, the before school programs <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5464.598s">The</a>  MEEP, which is the Medford Early Education Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5468.465s">Circuit</a>  Breaker, which is state-funded special education tuition costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5474.948s">transportation</a>  reimbursement and vocational tuitions and transportation reimbursements from the state and other providers, as well as our building facility rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5485.331s">So</a>  all of these revenue sources provided additional services and they covered the additional categories of costs that was above and beyond what we were allocated by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5497.635s">So</a>  as a summary of the revolving funds, I've also provided that document for your review and identification of the various revolving accounts that we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5509.763s">And</a>  I am open to any questions that you might have.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5514.286s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5516.407s">So</a>  thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5518.608s">I</a>  would just suggest, so that we don't have to listen to me for 20 minutes, that maybe we could do it page by page, if that makes sense to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5528.753s">So</a>  I have a number of questions, which I think will be easy and quick to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5533.416s">But</a>  on page one, under the finance, the technology tech spec line, the expenditures were <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5545.132s">a</a>  lot more than planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5546.873s">What</a>  is that expenditure?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5548.434s">So</a>  that's a contract service and support line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5552.356s">So</a>  we had additional monitoring services for various fees that we have for district-wide technology initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5560.84s">So</a>  that's our Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5561.98s">Those</a>  are different areas that we have for technology needs.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5565.314s">And</a>  do you predict that to be something that we, in the next cycle, you'll put in at a quarter of a million, or is it just this was a weird year?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5571.796s">No,</a>  there's a bubble year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5573.657s">And</a>  again, I will reiterate that there are line items within the budget program area that are going to, some are going to be higher, some are going to be a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5584.32s">We</a>  land on the bottom line number, and that's where our appropriation is, our budget.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5589.542s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5591.742s">And</a>  further down under, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5595.78s">Oh,</a>  actually, that was the last thing on that page. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5599.102s">So</a>  I guess if anybody else has something on page one, I could also just keep going to page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5606.426s">I</a>  have something on page one.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5613.09s">Page</a>  one?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5614.231s">Yes,</a>  page one.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5615.432s">School</a>  committee woman McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5617.113s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5619.452s">on</a>  the district-wide substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5622.375s">So</a>  there's a really large deficit on the substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5626.519s">And</a>  I'm wondering about that, since I'm hearing, at least from community, when we were out talking and asking questions about what was important to people, that substitutes has been a longstanding concern and issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5639.931s">So</a>  I'm wondering if you could tell me a little.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5642.408s">So</a>  that indicates that we do have a lot of substitute fees and costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5647.19s">So</a>  when there are extended long-term coverages, they would be covered out of a substitute account. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5653.473s">These</a>  are the daily substitutes that are within each of the buildings on the outside, as well as the main, the high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5662.757s">So</a>  that is a true cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5665.479s">And</a>  we still have difficulty getting enough daily substitutes to cover <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5670.729s">the</a>  absences in a given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5672.911s">And</a>  so we have increased our daily rate in hopes to recruit more daily subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5681.58s">It</a>  is a difficult position to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5684.883s">It's</a>  not just a Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5686.865s">It's</a>  a problem with many school systems in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5691.369s">It's</a>  just a per diem <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5693.544s">position,</a>  there's no benefits, it's as you go, day to day, people will fill in bids for jobs that are open on any given day.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5703.087s">Can</a>  I ask what the daily rate is? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5705.128s">It's</a>  $90. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5706.269s">It's</a>  $90 for the daily rate for a Medford substitute, and we're about almost $100,000 over for the cost of substitutes for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5713.311s">For</a>  last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5715.832s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5719.693s">School</a>  Committeewoman Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5722.549s">How</a>  does our substitute rate compare to surrounding communities?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5726.331s">We've</a>  increased it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5728.733s">So</a>  we're getting very close to what other municipalities are paying in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5735.617s">We're</a>  not paying what Boston public would be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5739.459s">We're</a>  not paying what Lexington would be paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5742.04s">So</a>  we're competitive in the comparison of size of our school system.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5752.145s">Do</a>  you have a number that you could share about somebody that you think is sort of relative?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5759.172s">Well,</a>  $90 is a competitive rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5762.215s">That's</a>  what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5764.557s">We</a>  were much lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5766.859s">We</a>  were at $70. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5767.48s">Then</a>  we were at $80. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5768.381s">We're</a>  at $90 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5769.902s">That's</a>  a competitive rate for the locals that we can certainly look toward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5776.954s">But</a>  we do pay higher rates for those that are licensed and those that are coming in for long-term coverages. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5784.599s">So</a>  that's another incentive that we try to gain folks to stay within our district.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5792.544s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5793.825s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5795.726s">Page</a>  two.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5802.61s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5803.512s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5804.012s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5805.874s">Oh,</a>  I canceled all my questions on page two for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5808.816s">So</a>  I don't have anything on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5811.478s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5814.681s">Anybody?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5817.423s">Just</a>  give everybody a second to review page two.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5822.867s">Did</a>  you want to go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5823.768s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5825.783s">I</a>  guess it's more of a follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5827.864s">It's</a>  the substitutes again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5831.067s">And</a>  this is the permanent substitutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5834.088s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5834.429s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5835.169s">So</a>  that's an additional 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5836.83s">So</a>  now it is about 130 over budget that we're at currently for substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5845.296s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5845.996s">Including</a>  permanent substitutes.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5848.578s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5848.818s">So</a>  permanent substitutes, it's a loose term, but it's for substitutes that are assigned <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5855.078s">Every</a>  day at the high school, they are full-time, full-year position, and they do obtain benefits, as well as a slightly higher rate for a daily rate, a per diem, and it's annualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5868.742s">However,</a>  again, given the low compensation as a daily employee, this is a very fluid position, and there's a lot of turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5879.665s">So</a>  there's a lot of challenges within that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5887.151s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5888.932s">Do</a>  we have any permanent substitutes in the other schools?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5891.654s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5892.215s">There's</a>  one at each of the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5894.156s">The</a>  high school typically has eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5897.018s">But</a>  again, that's when we can keep them in that capacity.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5901.021s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5905.385s">Page</a>  three or four.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5906.606s">Page</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5909.348s">The</a>  kindergarten aids for the elementary schools, I'm looking at the appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5916.937s">And</a>  I can't remember this stuff from last year, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5921.78s">Those</a>  salaries, I mean, how many people is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5926.003s">Not</a>  like 50,000 at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5928.205s">How</a>  many people is that?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5930.326s">So</a>  at each of the elementaries, there was a varying number, and some of them only had a part-time kindergarten aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5938.231s">So</a>  that's why the amount fluctuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5940.213s">It</a>  was different. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5942.354s">In</a>  fiscal year 20, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5943.972s">We</a>  made all of the kindergarten aides full-time and they had the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5948.956s">I</a>  believe some buildings had four, some buildings had two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5953.719s">And</a>  they are, the kindergarten aides are part of a collective bargaining unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5958.483s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5958.723s">That's</a>  my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5959.683s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5960.064s">Page</a>  three, four or five.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5975.188s">Page</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5978.189s">I</a>  feel like I know your answer to this one, but I'm going to ask it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5981.429s">Under</a>  special ed, there's all these teacher salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5984.75s">Is</a>  this one of those things where you moved it between? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5988.65s">They're</a>  budgeted for zero, but we spent, I'm guessing, a couple million dollars there.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5993.451s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=5993.751s">So</a>  this is one of the areas that we have program costs that are outside the appropriation that we try to offset from various funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6002.113s">So</a>  if we were to budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6004.32s">and</a>  put in all the lines for the various teachers in this, our appropriation budget would be significantly higher, closer to a million plus higher than what we were allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6019.308s">So</a>  we show it as no budget because we don't have an appropriation for it, but this is the appropriate recording place to show that by each school building, we did have special education teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6031.955s">So</a>  I do have to report to the Department of Ed based on a function, based on a building, where the teachers are actually located. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6039.601s">And</a>  so therefore, we provide the actual salaries in their appropriate reporting area.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6047.888s">And</a>  the LD, does that mean learning disability? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6050.11s">What</a>  is the LD in that description? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6051.912s">Lead.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6052.052s">Lead.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6052.772s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6053.193s">Lead</a>  teachers, yes.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6054.354s">I</a>  was trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6056.335s">So</a>  these are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6059.387s">A</a>  lot of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6060.407s">I</a>  mean, I'm like 10 or more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6063.048s">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6065.828s">And</a>  we, every year, we go into the year, we don't have any money for them, because we know we're going to find the money elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6075.65s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6077.871s">That's</a>  an important story to tell the network. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6079.411s">Hence</a>  the goal to fund all of the program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6085.834s">but</a>  we have always provided additional revenue sources to offset where we cannot provide.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6092.38s">So</a>  when the community says we shouldn't be renting out the high school, what they're also saying is we shouldn't be having special ed teachers at the McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6100.428s">I</a>  wouldn't put that in so many words, but you can deduct from your own information there.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6109.016s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6116.007s">Page</a>  4567, School Committeewoman McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6120.31s">Yes,</a>  getting back to just to follow up on that question, again, forgive me since I'm new at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6125.013s">I'm</a>  sure I'm going to have questions that may be obvious or already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6130.757s">So</a>  why aren't the special education costs included in the appropriation?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6137.863s">The</a>  costs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6140.184s">There's</a>  not a line item budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6142.226s">Because</a>  the budget, if we provided the budget for those <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6146.492s">lines</a>  would be much higher than what the city allocated for our appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6152.456s">So</a>  if I were to include the amounts that we spend on those teachers, we would be in a deficit budget situation right off the bat, and I can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6164.525s">So</a>  it's not shown as a budget item, but it's shown as the expenditure to accurately report that our <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6174.508s">funding</a>  is going towards special education services at each location.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6179.469s">And</a>  then how is that made up every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6181.37s">It</a>  just is different every year, or I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.35s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.57s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6184.991s">So</a>  that's where we have a variance in terms of what the city provides us and what the school departments have to backfill, if you will, with offsetting revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6195.533s">So</a>  those are different program areas that help fund the areas that we need or that are identifying <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6204.162s">for</a>  services provided for the students.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6208.204s">OK,</a>  I'll ask more questions later. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6210.506s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6213.768s">We're</a>  all learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6214.428s">Any</a>  questions are good questions.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6215.789s">Yes,</a>  I think going through the budget process itself will be beneficial and helpful so that it's seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6224.954s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6226.215s">Yes,</a>  page five, I'm assuming the adjustment Councilors is the same situation?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6230.397s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6232.65s">The</a>  psychologists at the elementary schools, for instance, at the Brooks, is that a part-time position? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6241.875s">Or</a>  is that a full-time? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6244.876s">You</a>  may not have every single person in your head. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6247.097s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6247.818s">So</a>  each psychologist comes in at a different pay scale based on their academic level and years of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6256.562s">So</a>  that number would not be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6258.851s">at</a>  each building.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6259.892s">But</a>  those are full-time?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6261.113s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6261.553s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6268.878s">I</a>  don't know why I put a question mark on that, so I won't ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6273.161s">The</a>  out-of-district special ed tuition was <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6277.315s">I</a>  mean, 127,000 is a lot less. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6280.156s">That's</a>  good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6282.197s">Well,</a>  I mean, from a numbers perspective.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6285.738s">So</a>  that is an area that is funded from multiple sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6290.379s">So</a>  we have Circuit Breaker, which is a reimbursement from the state that we also utilize for our out-of-district tuitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6297.482s">And</a>  we also have the IDEA federal grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6300.503s">So</a>  among those three funding sources, our special education out-of-district tuition is more <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6307.139s">in</a>  the range of 3.5 million.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6309.279s">OK,</a>  that makes more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6310.46s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6310.92s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6311.08s">I</a>  thought I'd seen a much bigger number at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6314.521s">Although,</a>  does the pupil transportation, does anybody give us anything for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6318.802s">Or</a>  is that totally up to us?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6321.382s">So</a>  we have to provide transportation for our students.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6324.703s">But</a>  the circuit breaker, they don't kick in for that or anything?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6327.163s">No,</a>  that's tuition only.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6328.624s">Tuition</a>  only. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6330.744s">Anybody</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6332.705s">School</a>  Committeewoman Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6335.28s">Just</a>  another question about the adjustment Councilors in the FY 19 budget year where they're the same number of adjustment Councilors at each of the elementary schools.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6346.065s">I</a>  believe they were the same count. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6350.106s">I</a>  don't know what their actual where they were on the pay scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6354.448s">But</a>  I believe each school each outside school had the one adjustment Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6361.551s">And</a>  is that true in the current budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6364.683s">in</a>  the FY20?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6366.985s">I</a>  would have to revisit the FY20 budget and see what we had projected for that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6371.608s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6372.048s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6377.652s">Page</a>  6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6381.414s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6387.098s">On</a>  page 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6389.385s">There's</a>  a guidance, under guidance, there's a PSAT subsidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6394.106s">We</a>  pay for the PSAT for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6397.707s">I</a>  believe, and I don't know if this was the 2020 budget or the previous budget, but we also, I think, put money in for SAT and AP fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6407.93s">Would</a>  those be somewhere else, or is this just all in that clump together?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6412.751s">So</a>  again, this was the fiscal 19 allocation, so if we had identified that for 20, that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6419.398s">upcoming</a>  but this was strictly for the PSAT subsidy.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6424.202s">And</a>  then on the page 7 under social studies there's field trips and this is for social studies field trips for the entire district right?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6437.912s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6438.912s">And</a>  I'm just like kind of amazed that $4,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6445.288s">We</a>  have a lot of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6446.109s">I'm</a>  just wondering what you can even do.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6447.269s">The</a>  majority of that cost would be for bus transportation to get them to their field trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6452.753s">So</a>  that's an individual bus cost for multiple buildings on multiple days.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6459.457s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6463.839s">School</a>  Committeewoman Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6465.821s">The</a>  field trips, is it a particular field trip that's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6468.522s">Because</a>  even if it's just the buses, that's still not <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6473.778s">much</a>  in terms of an entire district worth of kids going on field trips.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6478.101s">So</a>  this is just that program area. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6480.703s">So</a>  I believe one of the social studies is the royal house. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6489.068s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6489.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6491.85s">And</a>  mock trial.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6494.171s">And</a>  is there some way to provide a description of the field trips that the district pays for at all various levels?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6504.91s">That</a>  would be a comprehensive, and it varies each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6509.062s">It's</a>  not, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6512.764s">Static</a>  so we would have to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6515.045s">I</a>  mean that would be substantial to go back in for a fiscal year 19 We can certainly look at going forward if you believe in anything that's out of district is approved by the school committee so any of those are already approved we don't have a running list of Every elementary school field trip or middle school high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6536.95s">I</a>  just don't have that information for you</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6539.701s">OK,</a>  yeah, I'm not interested in sort of backpedaling into FY 19, but I would like to think about looking at how the district is paying for field trips at various levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6550.336s">So</a>  I do think we need to come up with some way to do that, but totally open to. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6555.377s">how</a>  that happens.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6557.217s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6557.457s">I</a>  believe a lot of them are also paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6560.418s">There</a>  are some student portions that the families are participating in for larger scale trips as well.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6568.24s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6568.5s">And</a>  that's where I'm trying to get an understanding of what are we paying for and what aren't we paying for and what are we asking students and families to pay for what are we asking or what our PTO is paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6579.723s">So</a>  I think that bigger picture of <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6582.32s">field</a>  trips and ensuring that we're providing similar educational experiences across all of our buildings and across our students sort of starts with money and what we're paying for here to sort of start to build out that bigger story and that bigger picture.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6598.386s">Sure,</a>  so what I would recommend is that during our budget hearings that we ask the department heads to provide what they are planning for the upcoming year in that respect.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6609.631s">Yeah,</a>  that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6615.47s">Page</a>  7, 8, 9, 10, Vice Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6619.214s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6619.854s">On</a>  page 8 under the arts, there's art music teacher CW. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6626.621s">I</a>  don't know what CW means. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6630.164s">At</a>  first I was like, is that the Curtis Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6631.946s">But</a>  then I don't know what CW could possibly mean.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6634.769s">So</a>  that's district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6637.251s">So</a>  we didn't have a particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6640.39s">So</a>  if they are covering various buildings, so they might be doing music or arts at multiple sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6647.072s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6648.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6650.773s">And</a>  then under the phys ed health, the salaries, wages permanent is much smaller than appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6664.297s">I'm</a>  just wondering.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6666.421s">Did</a>  somebody leave it seems like a big drop that is in the supervisory category Okay, so that would be a Combination I believe of two but I can certainly provide you the breakout on that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6683.149s">Thank</a>  you and then I noticed that for the Columbus and the Roberts I <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6690.694s">Is</a>  this one of those things where the teachers moved from one school to the next? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6694.856s">Because</a>  the Columbus spent twice what we had planned and then the Roberts was half what we planned.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6701.738s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6702.559s">So</a>  sometimes there's shifting within a department where we projected the costs to be might not have been where they actually landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6711.653s">based</a>  on the placement during the course of the year.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6714.114s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6715.836s">And</a>  then this section is the library media. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6723.361s">And</a>  this looks like there's just a bunch of that additional like movement stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6728.184s">So</a>  actually, I don't have any other questions on page eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6732.708s">Page</a>  nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6737.345s">Is</a>  this a COLA issue where the nurses was like almost $50,000 more than we planned? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6743.21s">I</a>  mean, it doesn't seem, we couldn't have gotten a nurse for $50,000.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6746.213s">That's</a>  correct, and there are certain instances that mandate nurses to be provided one-on-one, and that is not necessarily known at time of budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6757.845s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6758.746s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6760.087s">And</a>  then, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6761.748s">The</a>  other one that was kind of surprising to me was to have stipends that we didn't know were going to have to happen under the same.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6770.492s">So</a>  again, the stipends would be covered for if a nurse had to attend special events, mandatory on the field trips, things of that nature.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6781.197s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6781.897s">I</a>  knew you were going to get to these quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6784.078s">And</a>  then, since I don't have this for previous years, is the athletics being over 7.5% <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6791.877s">over</a>  budget, is that pretty in line with what we expect?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6796.801s">Athletics</a>  has been historically in a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6801.305s">We've</a>  been working to provide truer numbers in this category. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6807.229s">It</a>  is offset with the revolving athletic account where we do collect user fees, but those are also, again, we don't know if our teams are going to make it to the finals. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6820.743s">And</a>  that means additional costs for officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6823.644s">It</a>  means additional transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6825.564s">It</a>  means, great, we have to buy some trophies. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6829.705s">So</a>  those types of costs are unknown at the time that we budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6833.545s">We</a>  try to keep it within reason as we are looking at the total picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6841.587s">But</a>  this area has been historically in a deficit.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6846.728s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6853.098s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6854.319s">Thank</a>  you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6857.42s">It's</a>  really informational and I'm wondering, is this accessible to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6862.763s">Is</a>  this a public report that's shared?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6866.545s">This</a>  particular one, this is provided to the school committee in this regard.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6870.947s">So</a>  it's not a public report?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6873.288s">It's</a>  not posted online, if that's what you're inquiring.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6879.265s">It's</a>  a public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6880.626s">It's</a>  a public record.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6881.767s">Under</a>  the public records request, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6883.668s">But</a>  it's not distributed as the open budget hearing is distributed in that regard.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6890.951s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6891.932s">But</a>  if folks want it, they can just ask the school for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6896.294s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6899.816s">School</a>  committee woman, Vanda Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6902.197s">So</a>  I think we're through the 10 pages of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6908.503s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6909.464s">Why</a>  don't we let Mr. Russo finish his questions, and then I've got a question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6915.688s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6917.79s">Vice</a>  Chair Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6918.651s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6920.272s">The</a>  last page, security, contracted services, what are those?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6928.598s">So</a>  contracted services would be the camera replacement, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6935.023s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6935.323s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6939.979s">I</a>  was happy to see some of these other buildings, OSP, what does OSP mean again? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6946.143s">Operational,</a>  the last category. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6951.306s">Buildings</a>  and grounds, right?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6952.247s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6953.348s">And</a>  MSP supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6954.648s">Honestly,</a>  I'm not certain what that particular acronym refers to. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6959.351s">We</a>  didn't have a budget in it, so those charges would be part of the general supplies within the custodial area.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6969.972s">I</a>  thought we had made some major changes to our telephone expenses that brought this way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6975.733s">Or</a>  is this actually the way down number?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6978.094s">This</a>  is the way down number.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6979.334s">Gosh,</a>  $140,000 is the way down number. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6980.255s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6980.515s">And</a>  then that was my last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6981.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6982.955s">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=6997.12s">So</a>  Christina, I wanted to go back to your main report and on the back you noted we drew down from the following accounts as identified during the FY19 budget development progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7008.407s">Do</a>  you have numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7009.568s">And</a>  I understand you might not have with them tonight, but can you tell me from the after school program <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7014.771s">how</a>  much money was used to offset other programs?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7019.674s">We</a>  had identified in the budget process a million dollars that would be offset from the after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7027.419s">I</a>  don't have the exact amount, but it was roughly $500,000.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7030.44s">And</a>  the before school, do you have those?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7033.562s">They're</a>  lumped together.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7035.263s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7037.925s">MEEP?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7038.946s">MEEP</a>  was approximately $150,000.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7046.031s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7049.492s">The</a>  others I don't have a good handle on those offsets. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7055.694s">And</a>  again, the community schools and building rentals, those are basically maintaining the cost for the rentals to have custodial service, to have security on hand, to have all of the cleaning supplies that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7070.682s">for</a>  those rentals, so a lot of that is just essentially utilizing what we have to maintain, along with our larger organizations, the Japanese Language School, the Lesley University, those are significant contributors to the community school area and the building rental.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7093.103s">Okay,</a>  so really the major one really is the before and after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7096.784s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7097.204s">Of</a>  about a half a million dollars that is used to offset other accounts.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7101.585s">Correct,</a>  but we had identified one million to utilize.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7104.846s">Right,</a>  so it's less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7105.866s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7106.647s">However,</a>  it still leaves us the question of saying is that what we want with the tuitions and how else can we, should our budget be expanded so it really reflects real costs rather than the need to do creative fundraising.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7135.85s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7136.79s">So</a>  just sort of following up and again learning curve, understanding these, this revenue that we're getting from these programs will <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7145.081s">be</a>  discussed as part of the budget process for this year so that we're understanding exactly what those numbers are.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7150.384s">For</a>  the amounts that we have to identify as an offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7155.507s">So</a>  once we build the budget and we identify the level of service that we indicate that we need, there's the city side that provides the appropriation budget amount that can be afforded. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7170.276s">So</a>  we have to come somewhere in between <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7173.825s">And</a>  any amount that is over what the city is available to provide us as our appropriation line, we would need to then come up with revenue offsets to close that gap.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7188.577s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7189.358s">And</a>  then the details of those revenue sources are broken down for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7193.561s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7194.062s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7194.602s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7201.312s">No</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7203.113s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7207.334s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7208.574s">So</a>  I just want to, I don't know, you don't want to make this, I want to make this statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7213.776s">Because</a>  I feel like I talk to the community on an almost weekly basis about why are we spending our <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7222.79s">before</a>  and after school programming, extra funds, our MEAP programming, extra funds, and something other than those programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7229.413s">And</a>  the answer is, we have a huge number of people in special ed that don't have jobs if we don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7235.876s">We</a>  have a huge number of people in, we get rid of all of the adjustment Councilors if we don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7242.32s">So</a>  it's not that we're taking that money and just being like, hey, let's have fun with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7247.942s">It's</a>  like critical elements of our <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7251.687s">education</a>  don't happen at all if we don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7254.769s">So</a>  it isn't a choice between whether we give the before and after school programs better digs or better salaries, which is a different conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7264.216s">We</a>  definitely have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7265.717s">But</a>  this extra revenue isn't extra revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7268.599s">This</a>  is revenue plugging the hole because we don't get it somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7273.763s">And</a>  I feel like I think this is just an important time to point that out because <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7278.683s">I</a>  just hear it a lot, this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7282.744s">It's</a>  very divorced in the budget process and the line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7286.665s">They're</a>  just so divorced from each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7289.386s">But</a>  they are not divorced if you want adjustment Councilors and this 10 or 20 people in special ed to be doing what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7297.027s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7299.268s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7301.368s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7302.709s">School</a>  Committeewoman McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7307.652s">school</a>  committee member Ruseau, in terms of the cost, I think like every budget, there are pluses and minuses on all ends and things balance out in different ways, but I also don't want to give the impression that after school funds go to pay for special education funds, so that we understand that there's also additional money coming in through Circuit Breaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7329.266s">So</a>  what I would say is I would really encourage community members to come to the Committee of the Whole meetings, budget meetings, if they really want to be able to understand where <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7337.402s">the</a>  allocations go back and forth in terms of the pluses and the minuses because it's a lot of shifting money around, as you know, Christine, as we all know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7346.304s">It's</a>  not just any particular departments that are more or less, although I know that special education is costly, that it's not more or less in one area or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7354.746s">I</a>  don't want to give the community that impression either. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7357.147s">It's</a>  the whole system that we have to balance out and figuring out how to do that is really <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7361.568s">part</a>  of our job here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7362.549s">So</a>  thank you so much for the report and I would really encourage folks for the Committee of the Whole budget meetings to be able to attend those. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7368.993s">Those</a>  are all public meetings where people can ask these questions and we can learn, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7373.256s">Because</a>  I'm still very much learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7374.617s">I</a>  appreciate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7375.958s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7404.663s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, student representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7408.367s">Thanks</a>  for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7409.168s">Really</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7411.03s">So</a>  on November 26, as I mentioned earlier, we had submitted to the Medford City Council for $300,000 in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7421.261s">So</a>  the school district is going to use that in several areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7425.645s">We're</a>  going to repair and expand the high school intercom system where it's been damaged, or as rooms were added, quite simply, it was never put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7436.334s">So</a>  the headmaster and other members of his team have a plan in place where the intercoms don't work, but let's be honest, the most quickest way to deliver information is through the school intercom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7449.081s">So</a>  that will be undertaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7451.922s">We</a>  have the quotes in hand with John McLaughlin right now, and that'll be $59,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7456.423s">I've</a>  already spoken on the bathroom, so I don't think we need that further right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7461.124s">$61,000</a>  will be used to purchase a new backup power generator for the vocational wing, as well as our internet services. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7471.347s">So</a>  right now, we're on battery backup for internet services. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7474.487s">So</a>  we have about an hour to three hours <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7476.748s">based</a>  on the information that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7478.548s">So</a>  right now, this generator will be purchased, installed, and will take care of our internet services, as well as the vocational wing of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7489.131s">The</a>  shades and C building at Medford High School will be installed at a cost of $32,500, as well as controlling light. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7496.132s">It's</a>  a security feature to be able to keep out people looking in. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7501.473s">Finally,</a>  Medford Public Tools is operating desktop computers that are <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7505.77s">eight</a>  or nine years old, operating Windows 7, which Microsoft stopped supporting six days ago or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7520.102s">So</a>  we have a plan in place right now to upgrade those desktops to Windows 10, but you're putting a rather robust operating system that will use 60% <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7534.5s">of</a>  RAM on startup, and then when you add on other programs, it's not gonna exactly be the fastest solution, but until we can budget and appropriate and come up with a robust game plan, it's the plan that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7552.325s">I</a>  would like to note that in line four of that last paragraph, I have a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7555.666s">I</a>  failed to, as you will see, the computer labs at the middle school, as well as two <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7561.167s">elementary</a>  computer labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7564.05s">So</a>  what we're going to do is we're going to deploy 56 new desktops to the middle schools and 49 to the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7573.82s">The</a>  $100,000 free cash allotment will also be used to outfit the new maker space. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7579.165s">At</a>  the high school, the listed items are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7582.086s">The</a>  specific, you have pictures in your packet that really detail those items well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7589.47s">The</a>  MakerBot, I have experience with that from my previous districts, having purchased them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7594.632s">The</a>  MakerCare, while expensive, is really essential to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7599.374s">It's</a>  actually a critical component for those machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7603.236s">It</a>  is expensive, but it does provide really a cost benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7609.231s">So</a>  that's how Medford Public Schools plans to use the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7611.953s">We'd</a>  really like to thank the city of Medford, the Medford City Council and its citizens for its support in our endeavors.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7620.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7621.559s">School</a>  Committeewoman Grimm.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7624.781s">We</a>  had a similar request for free cash last year to replace, I think it was sort of the same exact story, replace aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7635.839s">equipment</a>  that's no longer going to be supported when they stop supporting Windows 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7640.462s">And</a>  now we're here doing that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7643.224s">My</a>  question is what's left in terms of what other equipment is unreplaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7649.669s">Because</a>  I think each time we do this, people think we have solved this problem of our aging equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7655.753s">And</a>  if we have, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7657.875s">But</a>  if we haven't, I want to be able to talk about that as well.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7661.177s">We</a>  haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7661.797s">And</a>  the number of devices is substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7665.138s">Is</a>  it 100, 1,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7668.12s">Your</a>  second number is probably more accurate based on conversations I've had with Molly Layden. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7673.905s">But</a>  as Christine has approached the podium.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7675.626s">Thank</a>  you, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7678.008s">So</a>  the last free cash was 200,000 for the purpose of Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7683.352s">That</a>  is only 200 devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7685.994s">If</a>  we're looking at the students in Medford, that's 4,500 that we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7690.973s">replaced</a>  for not only student use and carts and rooms, classrooms, but teachers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7696.996s">The</a>  last major purchase was in 2012, which the city went out to bond for major units. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7703.739s">And</a>  I believe the final payment is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7707.181s">So</a>  our goal is to move forward and fund more of a true 20% replacement of the entire fleet in subsequent budgeting years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7717.526s">But</a>  we cannot do a full replacement <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7720.997s">in</a>  one year because that would be, again, significant bond-related purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7727.542s">We're</a>  talking $1.2 to $2 million in replacing all of the devices district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7734.507s">So</a>  we are trying to target the most critical areas and identify those that are most needed if we are able to repair <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7745.587s">certain</a>  device pieces and maintain equipment, then we are trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7749.949s">But</a>  the goal is to truly get a funding mechanism in place through the budget to have 20% replacement each year so that we're not in a position where we have to go to capital funding or free cash requests, unless it is something that is outside of the regular routine and need. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7769.616s">But</a>  that's what our goal has been, to try to deliberately <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7773.667s">increase</a>  the media tech budget in that category, but we just could not do it in one year.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7780.71s">Yeah,</a>  and I would not advocate for us to do it in one year, because then we have to do it in one year again in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7786.633s">So</a>  I definitely want to move away from that kind of a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7790.634s">But</a>  what I want to make sure that we do in this upcoming budget cycle is be really transparent about what's in the budget, what's not in the budget, so that <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7799.66s">our</a>  colleagues on the city council understand that if they say yes to $100,000 of free cash or $200,000 of free cash, that that hasn't solved the totality of our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7811.804s">I</a>  think to do that, we need to be able to say, this is the goal, this is where we want to be, and this is where we are, and this is how long it's going to take for us to sort of get out of the position that we're in and get to this place where we're replacing our technology every year, 20%, 20%, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7829.761s">But</a>  I think in order to do that, there needs to be a clear description of where we're at, and are we even at the place where we can start 20%, 20%, 20%, or are we in a hole, so to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7842.488s">And</a>  I think we need to be really clear and transparent about that in the budget process, so that when the city council feels like they've solved a problem, we can say, yes, you have, in fact, solved this problem, or no, we have not solved that problem, and we have more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7856.735s">So</a>  I just want the folks who, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7860.033s">ultimately</a>  have to approve our budget, but also the community to understand exactly where we are and exactly what we do and don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7867.716s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7868.096s">So</a>  is that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7870.657s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7871.257s">I</a>  mean, it can be, but with all due respect, we do have that information within the description of our FY 19 and 20 budgets as we are developing and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7882.461s">So</a>  there is wording along with each of our program areas that delineates and identifies exactly what <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7889.299s">the</a>  budget request is covering and what would be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7892.24s">So</a>  it is within the language of our budget as we went through this process last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7899.741s">When</a>  you look at the verbatim information that the department heads have provided as descriptors, a lot of that information is already provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7907.483s">So</a>  I just want to be clear that we have been transparent in that need and identifying that we recognize we don't have enough in our budget appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7919.067s">but</a>  that we have these urgent needs and the item was identified that as of January 1, 2020, all of the Microsoft items would not be supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7930.311s">So</a>  we do have that in place and I just want to, again, reiterate that our process was very open and clear in terms of what we were asking for and where we were at in terms of the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7944.556s">So</a>  we did identify and we did make note that this was <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7948.21s">This</a>  was a problem and we've identified that the 1.2 bonding was not the best solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7954.916s">It</a>  was the only solution at that time to get them updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7958.84s">But</a>  we are working hard and we have worked with our department heads to identify the priority needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7966.106s">So</a>  I just would ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7968.398s">to</a>  reference our budget that we have in place currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7972.019s">And</a>  then we, again, will address it going forward for the fiscal 2021 requests as we meet with each of our department heads.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7981.243s">I</a>  will take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7982.303s">I</a>  was pretty plugged into the budget process during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7985.125s">And</a>  I don't recall anything that resonated to me in quite that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7989.186s">So</a>  perhaps it's a matter of being more clear about what those things need to look like so that the picture is <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=7996.883s">clear</a>  to people outside of the school department, because I think that's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8000.806s">But</a>  I will go back and take a look at that again, and we can talk about it in the upcoming budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8006.269s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8008.291s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8009.752s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8010.412s">Thank</a>  you to Member Graham for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8013.954s">Because</a>  I've only been through two budgets, but I know I've had conversations with other members where it feels like we come in, we do the budgets, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8026.246s">It's</a>  an already agreed upon, like, we pretty much have everything we need, but we wouldn't mind another 3 or 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8033.152s">But</a>  I feel like if we got everybody in a room or one-on-one, the number would be we need another 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8042.159s">If</a>  we never have the conversation that we really need another 30% in our budget, then how does anybody ever know? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8047.881s">I</a>  mean, Somerville spends $586,000 on computer replacement in their school system every year, year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8056.445s">And</a>  that's every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8060.926s">And</a>  they're not that much bigger than us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8064.748s">They're</a>  like, I think, 1,000 students more. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8068.409s">Their</a>  students don't have different computer needs than us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8071.313s">and</a>  our teachers don't either. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8074.236s">Our</a>  increase year over year isn't even that amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8078.02s">I</a>  mean, once you take away the salary portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8080.703s">So,</a>  I mean, if we're not telling the community that, in fact, our budget is painfully anemic, and this is how it's anemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8088.599s">then</a>  at some point in the future when we ask the community to step up and say, okay, I guess we do want our kids to have computers that turn on within 20 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8099.222s">Um,</a>  because an eight year old computer running windows 10, nobody's going to turn it on cause nobody's going to sit there that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8108.584s">Um,</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8110.11s">We</a>  have to have a budget that says, you know, the city thinks they can give us, I don't know, whatever the number will be, 60 million maybe, or whatever the, I don't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8120.542s">But</a>  we also have to have the conversation in the public that says, but if we could get 80, this is what we could do for Medford's public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8131.064s">We</a>  won't get 80, but if we never even tell anybody that what we really need is 80, then when we say to the residents, you know what, this is why we want more money from you from your taxes, you can't just start there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8143.97s">You</a>  have to start with what is it that's such a huge deficit? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8147.372s">And</a>  our budget, I think we had $10,000 in the line item for 2020 for computers.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8153.615s">No,</a>  it was closer to $175,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8158.9s">Don't</a>  remember that number, but I believe you because I trust you but Agreed that the line item is low and your Somerville example is what would a true 20% be once we get to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8175.371s">to</a>  that area so again, we're trying to be cognizant of all all departments within the city structure and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8182.645s">and</a>  trying to maintain the resources needed for student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8186.888s">So</a>  again, that's part of our conversation that we will go through again for fiscal 2021.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8192.573s">But</a>  there is no conversation where under Prop 2.5 we ever get to a half a million dollars in computer replacement before I'm so old that I don't even remember how to use a computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8204.722s">Like,</a>  that future is decades away at 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8212.337s">And</a>  we're not telling anybody that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8215.079s">So</a>  that's why I just wanted to agree with Member Graham that 20% sounds great, but it's a fantasy right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8225.865s">And</a>  it's going to remain a fantasy unless we can get a redistricting to Assembly Row and to Medford.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8232.789s">Yes,</a>  I was going to say commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8234.43s">We're</a>  going to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8236.891s">School</a>  Committeewoman Grimm.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8238.512s">Yeah,</a>  I think when we talk about the technology conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8241.902s">I</a>  think we need to be really clear that there's two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8245.484s">There's,</a>  do we have at our disposal the amount that we need, yes or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8252.487s">And</a>  then, do we have the means to maintain that base? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8256.728s">And</a>  I think the answer to both of those questions right now is no, no and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8262.031s">At</a>  least that's my opinion, and we can talk about that during the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8266.473s">But</a>  I think it's important to be clear about having two real needs with two <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8272.196s">particular</a>  amounts of money, both which are bigger than we have the budget for. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8277.999s">And</a>  I want to make sure that we're just being honest about that and the ways that our district is receiving technology right now through PTOs, filing grant requests, all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8292.187s">So</a>  there's technology flowing in that we're not paying for and we're really lucky about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8296.849s">But</a>  at the same time, that equipment has to be maintained as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8300.391s">So</a>  we have to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8302.487s">both</a>  are we where we need to be in terms of do we have enough equipment to do all the things that we need to do to provide a quality education. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8309.172s">And</a>  then do we have the money to maintain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8311.374s">And</a>  I want to make sure that in the budget conversation that we really clearly have both of those conversations so that the community understands truly where we are and what we cannot do in the confines of this budget because we are required by law to submit a balanced budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8328.166s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8328.387s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8329.467s">that</a>  there's no magic that makes all of that happen at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8332.728s">And</a>  I want us to be really transparent about that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8337.529s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8341.01s">Motion</a>  to accept the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8342.07s">Motion</a>  to accept the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8343.11s">Seconded</a>  by? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8345.231s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8345.411s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8345.491s">McLaughlin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8346.011s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8346.751s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=8347.471s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>
