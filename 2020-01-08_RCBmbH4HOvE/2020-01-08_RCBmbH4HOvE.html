    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2616.706s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2618.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2619.453s">In</a>  the meantime, while we wait, I just want to thank Joey for coming forward and for making this statement and being proactive about what he's seeing at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2628.375s">We</a>  are only as good as our information we received, Joey, so thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2636.917s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2638.158s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2639.778s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2641.058s">Council,</a>  student committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2643.679s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2645.878s">I</a>  did, Peter will have something to add as well to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2651.022s">So</a>  upon social media, I took, Mr. Falco did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2663.273s">We</a>  went out and I went out and personally inspected all the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2666.696s">I</a>  went out and <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2670.428s">made</a>  sure that they're old, the bathrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2674.631s">You</a>  cannot take that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2676.572s">But</a>  let me just run through the report real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2684.338s">So</a>  I went through the bathrooms and some of my findings was some of the fin tube radiator covers are in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2691.503s">So</a>  at this time we have started the replacement of the radiator covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2695.309s">We're</a>  waiting for some parts to come in from Granger to finish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2701.011s">I</a>  didn't find any signs of rodent activity or insect activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2705.553s">I</a>  encourage people to report it because we do have an integrated pest management plan in all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2712.296s">And</a>  we need to know immediately if there's anything like that happening because we can call in our contractor and take care of it right off the bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2726.63s">So</a>  the restrooms are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2728.132s">They're</a>  not aesthetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2730.214s">There's</a>  been many years of repainting and painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2733.317s">The</a>  tile's old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2734.258s">It's</a>  outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2735.92s">The</a>  fixtures and the sinks are all running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2738.823s">We</a>  went through this past vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2743.645s">I</a>  had the contract cleaners do a heavy cleaning of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2748.947s">We</a>  went in and did some sealant tile replacements, replaced locks that needed to be replaced on stall doors, made sure everything was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2760.332s">Besides</a>  being old, we're trying to do what we can for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2766.895s">They</a>  clean, they don't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2771.768s">So</a>  over the past few years, they used to have Bradley sinks in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2776.211s">We</a>  replaced them with regular sinks and put Formica countertops on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2780.414s">And</a>  the Formica's wearing out, it's 15 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2783.336s">So</a>  I mean, we do have some work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2786.978s">I</a>  think at this point, and I know Pete is gonna allude to it, that we do have some available cash to possibly do at least two of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2801.272s">over,</a>  we just have to make decisions on which ones that we'd like to do and then go through the process of hiring a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2811.594s">And</a>  I also work with Paul DeLaval, which was a big thing, is we got together and we decided that in the mornings, when they open up the cafeteria side for breakfast, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2824.139s">When</a>  they close them, when the kids pass to the hallways, the custodians are going in, cleaning them, making sure they're all clean, and then they don't get open till lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2833.888s">On</a>  the other side, on the guidance side that's been open all morning, we are cleaning them at noontime when they lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2840.674s">So</a>  we're going in there and freshening them up, trying to keep them as fresh as possible as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2846.459s">Obviously,</a>  if there's any issues during the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2850.382s">the</a>  assistant principals will contact us and we'll do what we need to do to freshen them up as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2859.987s">And</a>  I think, yeah, so over the holiday break, like I said, we did the heavy duty cleaning in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2868.632s">They're</a>  better, but they're old. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2870.012s">They</a>  just don't show anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2873.174s">They've</a>  been painted over and over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2880.723s">Vice</a>  Chair Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2885.485s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2886.885s">I</a>  had a question about how students and staff can quickly report things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2897.579s">well-known</a>  process that if you ask students and staff, they would have an answer.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2900.801s">You</a>  know what, to that, I can't answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2902.442s">I</a>  would assume that they would go through the assistant principals, or a teacher, or anybody that can get in touch with Headmaster DeLave or whomever. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2911.688s">Normally,</a>  if something goes on in a bathroom, we'll get a report, mainly by the assistant principal, that'll say, hey, we need a clean up here in bathroom two in C building, and then over the radio, and then we'll send somebody right up.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2927.873s">And</a>  how often are custodians actually checking each bathroom throughout the day?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2933.997s">So</a>  with the schedule that Mr. McLaughlin talked about, we've been trying to kind of clean, shut down, open, clean, shut down, open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2946.023s">I</a>  think that's happening twice a day, which is more than what we were doing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2952.187s">The</a>  frequency of the cleaning also helps us with reporting as well because being an assistant principal and being a male as well or being a headmaster, I can't get into every single bathroom or I have to wait for somebody to come and look at another bathroom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2971.71s">So</a>  again, what's been helping is that schedule of cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2976.793s">Because</a>  sort of what we've utilized at the Andrews when I was there as well is that when you're constantly updating the bathrooms, we're getting more reports regarding graffiti, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2989.139s">For</a>  the other stuff, I've always asked, too, if anybody has any concerns or complaints, to just please see me so I can address it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2998.984s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3002.68s">School</a>  Committeewoman Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.261s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.622s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3004.882s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3007.484s">I</a>  just had a question, because I know Mr. Falco mentioned that he noticed some black mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3012.608s">So</a>  I was just concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3013.568s">I</a>  didn't hear that, and I didn't read that in the report that was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3016.651s">Did</a>  you, when you were doing the deep cleaning, was there any sign of any black mold?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3021.234s">I'm</a>  afraid I didn't get any reports to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3025.938s">I</a>  mean, if there's something going on, yeah, we'll go back in there immediately for sure.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3033.072s">And</a>  then were the soap dispensers, were they cleaned out? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3036.753s">Or</a>  were they, do you think maybe it was like particles in the soap dispenser? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3040.354s">Or</a>  was it, you know, maybe just a change of soap?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3042.914s">The</a>  soap dispensers are a closed item, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3045.495s">I</a>  know that we've had some instances in the last month where we had to replace six of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3052.236s">So</a>  I don't, you know, I don't know how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3056.677s">I</a>  wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3057.437s">I</a>  wish I had more information so that I could've <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3061.794s">been</a>  conclusive on what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3064.637s">And</a>  just for the fact that, like I said, if there was insect activity, if there was rodent activity, if there was any kind of activities in there, to get in there as fast as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3079.053s">would</a>  be the most appropriate thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3083.295s">So</a>  I think that we know now that we're going to probably get some kind of a reporting system going where the kids know exactly who to either call me, either call headmaster, assistant principal, so that we can respond in a manner that's prudent and fast.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3104.304s">Would</a>  it be helpful if the students <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3107.015s">let</a>  us know exactly what location the bathroom is, like C building. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3110.357s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3112.018s">Any</a>  information that we can get is going to help the solution to the problem, and as fast as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3122.603s">I</a>  just want to reiterate that these are old bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3126.025s">These</a>  are bathrooms that we can do the facelift part of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3132.229s">But</a>  I think where the concern is that we're talking 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3138.019s">of</a>  a change, and if anything, cars, anything like that need to be updated in that sort of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3145.683s">And</a>  like I said, with the reporting process, if we know right away, we do have enough bathrooms at the high school where if we do end up shutting one down, we can notify people which one would be open as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3158.629s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3159.909s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3161.45s">I</a>  just had a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3162.851s">Would</a>  we be able to put just a little <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3166.802s">note</a>  on the website, the Medford High School Medford Vocational website, just with the brief note that, you know, to inform students and parents if there's an issue to please contact and then provide like the names, you know, if there's an issue in the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3182.716s">if</a>  that's something that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3184.217s">I</a>  think a lot of what might help us, too, is we are working on the see something, say something app, which is going to be rolling out at some point, which is definitely going to be another way to get reporting in as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3200.822s">And</a>  that'll be really good, but for now, the assistant principals, even buildings and grounds, the door's always open. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3208.046s">Come</a>  on down, we'll go right up there, take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3210.888s">I</a>  mean, everybody's willing to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3213.31s">Nobody</a>  wants what we feel or what the students feel is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3220.894s">We</a>  don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3222.215s">We</a>  want it as good as we can get it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3225.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3226.397s">School</a>  Committee, Woman McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3229.842s">Thank</a>  you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3232.363s">I</a>  also wanted to ask, following up on the black mold issue, clearly we have a student that was good enough to bring us in some photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3241.445s">So</a>  there is black mold somewhere in some of the bathrooms that is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3246.906s">So</a>  one of the questions that I would have is what is the process for removing black mold in those situations? <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3252.467s">Do</a>  you know or what do we do?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3256.426s">We</a>  can hit it with the cleaners that we use are sufficient and the green cleaning that can clean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3262.39s">Now,</a>  I don't know where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3265.132s">I</a>  didn't see the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3267.053s">Was</a>  it like a ceiling tile?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3275.779s">And</a>  I wanted to add, the pictures are very, very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3279.361s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3281.663s">The</a>  ceiling tiles, we went in there and we tried to replace a bunch of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3286.142s">We</a>  replaced a bunch of the stained ceiling tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3289.764s">And</a>  we're replacing a bunch of the heat registers. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3292.746s">Yeah,</a>  that looks like it's inside of a bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3294.607s">I</a>  don't know where that could be coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3297.489s">Sink?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3298.469s">Joey,</a>  sink?</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3301.011s">C3,</a>  the countertop.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3302.352s">Oh,</a>  okay, all right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3305.574s">Yeah,</a>  we might have to take it out and replace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3308.836s">I</a>  didn't notice it during my tour either.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3313.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3314.092s">I</a>  know that there's going to be a discussion of some funds to at least address, you were saying, perhaps a few of the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3320.675s">And</a>  I'm wondering, I'd like to make a motion that we have maybe a report of how and where those funds are used and what they're being applied to for those bathrooms, maybe within the next 30 days or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3333.42s">Well,</a>  I think.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3335.021s">actually</a>  have that right well the thing what I'm looking at is gutting the bathroom out gone brand-new two of them and that's what the City Council is <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3348.854s">was</a>  expecting and that's I think what Peter's reports can allude to.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3353.396s">So</a>  in the free cash report that comes later on, we requested in advance of the November 26th City Council report from the Medford City Council, $300,000 of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3364.501s">Of</a>  that $100,000 is going to be used to gut to the studs two bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3370.424s">There</a>  are 16 bathrooms in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3373.466s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin did a very good job in getting a cost estimate simply to retile. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3377.83s">So</a>  no plumbing, no other things, no demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3382.315s">Retiling</a>  over what is already there was going to be over $400,000 for those 16 bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3388.02s">All</a>  right, so hopefully we'll be able to do annual gut and rebuild as free cash or other funds become available to really start a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3398.611s">There</a>  have been conversations about this since I got here in July about the fact that the bathrooms are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3407.12s">The</a>  vice principals, the headmaster, the maintenance and facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3410.343s">I</a>  myself go through the bathrooms and pick up litter left behind and different things like that as I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3418.252s">And</a>  really would like to implore our students to make sure that they're taking care of their house as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3423.898s">And</a>  make sure that when we rebuild these bathrooms that they become a source of pride and a source of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3431.763s">because</a>  it's a substantial cash investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3434.104s">And</a>  so this will be ripping out to the studs, replacing ventilation, lighting, the entire thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3441.605s">So</a>  it is essentially a new bathroom from the studs out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3444.085s">That</a>  cost right now is estimated at $50,000 per bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3447.966s">We'll</a>  be having some of our students in our vocational technical side of the school to be able to assist with that as necessary and as they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3458.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3462.153s">Just</a>  as a follow-up, so to the reporting process and policies and procedures, so there was a, I'm not sure how this process goes, bear with me, I'm first time, but for the motion that I had on the floor, do we make a vote on that or?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3477.161s">You</a>  could ask which ones will be done within the next 30 days.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3480.323s">Yes,</a>  a motion for which ones will be done in the next 30 days with a report and maybe some <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3485.225s">photo</a>  evidence, you know, when it's done to show us how nice they look so we can celebrate that as well.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3489.527s">We'll</a>  have photo evidence, we'll be having toys, we'll be having everything.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3492.287s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that'd be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3493.908s">No,</a>  really, so we can see sort of the process would be really helpful and to be able to share and celebrate sort of it moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3500.17s">So</a>  I have a motion on the floor for an update on that, where and when this will be done.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.112s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3506.712s">Yep,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3507.492s">As</a>  soon as we, as soon as, I know that we're gonna have a <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3510.651s">a</a>  session and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3512.332s">I</a>  know that Dr. Maurice had an idea of which one she may want to do, and I have an idea of what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3521.077s">So</a>  we're going to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3523.238s">We'll</a>  tell you ahead of time which ones we're actually going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3527.581s">And</a>  we'll keep you updated during the process, obviously, as much as you need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3534.284s">And</a>  like I said, afterwards, we'll have a ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3537.146s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3538.207s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3539.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3540.635s">School</a>  committee woman Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3544.436s">Can</a>  you give us a better understanding of when see click fix or whatever it's called will be a reality because I'm concerned about the reporting process for lots of reasons and I think one of the main reasons I'm concerned is because I think our principals and our assistant principals and you all have pressing things that happen every single day and for <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3567.716s">for</a>  those folks to be responsible for that kind of reporting and problem solving feels like the wrong use of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3577.204s">That</a>  application could go a long way to helping those issues be reported in a more timely fashion so that they can be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3585.171s">So</a>  I'm just curious what your timeline is there and whether that's imminent or there's work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3592.698s">Because</a>  I think that whole process of clarity would be really helpful.</p>
