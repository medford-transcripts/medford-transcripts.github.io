Hi, my name is Danielle. I'm a queer mom of two kids and resident of Medford, Massachusetts. By day, I'm a social worker doing anti-sexual violence work in the Boston area. I'd like to introduce you to a new podcast, Medford Bites. This podcast is made using the input of the Medford community for the Medford community. In each episode, we will focus on local issues, updates in city government, and happenings around the city.

I'll also discuss some of folks' favorite spots in the city to get a drink or a bite to eat. If there are topics you want to be included on the podcast, businesses you want to promote, or just questions or feedback you have for us, please follow the link in the show notes to send us a message. Thank you for listening, and I hope you enjoy.
