1
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:18,777
[SPEAKER_30]: We'll call the roll.

2
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,080
[SPEAKER_31]: President, seven present, none absent.

3
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,521
[SPEAKER_31]: All please rise and salute our flag.

4
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:36,970
[SPEAKER_31]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

5
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,367
[SPEAKER_31]: Approval of the minutes of May 6, 2019.

6
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,592
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion for approval, Mr. Russo.

7
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,075
[SPEAKER_31]: Is there a second by Ms.

8
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,058
[SPEAKER_31]: Kreatz?

9
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,060
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

10
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,621
[SPEAKER_31]: DiBenedetto.

11
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,046
[SPEAKER_32]: Question of a report being presented.

12
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:57,948
[SPEAKER_32]: Could we just add it to the outstanding reports list?

13
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:02,429
[SPEAKER_32]: It was the cost analysis for the dyslexia screening.

14
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,251
[SPEAKER_32]: Could we just add it to the list of reports due to us?

15
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:07,911
[SPEAKER_32]: Will do.

16
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:08,972
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

17
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,693
[SPEAKER_32]: On the motion for approval of the minutes.

18
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:11,573
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

19
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:12,213
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

20
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,093
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

21
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:14,414
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

22
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:18,816
[SPEAKER_31]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds, and approval of payrolls.

23
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:19,896
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion.

24
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:21,417
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion for approval, Ms.

25
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,978
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot, Mr. Benedetto.

26
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:26,239
[SPEAKER_32]: Mayor Burke, I have a question.

27
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,621
[SPEAKER_32]: There was, sorry, I'm saying hi to all our students.

28
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:41,743
[SPEAKER_32]: On page three or four, I had a question under trustees of Boston College.

29
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:45,784
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that outside special education tuition, or what type of tuition is that?

30
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:46,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

31
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:46,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I've asked you that before.

32
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,265
[SPEAKER_18]: That's outside special education.

33
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:48,995
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

34
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:49,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I just needed clarity.

35
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:50,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

36
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:51,557
[SPEAKER_31]: Very good.

37
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,279
[SPEAKER_31]: This motion for approval on the floor by Ms.

38
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,360
[SPEAKER_31]: Handifuld is there a second?

39
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,680
[SPEAKER_31]: Second.

40
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,241
[SPEAKER_31]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

41
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,042
[SPEAKER_31]: Roll call vote please.

42
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:58,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

43
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:04,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

44
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:05,408
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

45
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:05,648
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

46
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:06,909
[SPEAKER_31]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

47
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,670
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

48
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,271
[SPEAKER_31]: Report of Secretary.

49
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:09,932
[SPEAKER_31]: None.

50
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Report of Committees.

51
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:12,874
[SPEAKER_31]: None.

52
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,356
[SPEAKER_31]: Community Participation.

53
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,558
[SPEAKER_31]: Jennifer Swain, Styrofoam Trays.

54
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:28,215
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

55
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,557
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you name and address, please, for the record?

56
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:29,977
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

57
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:30,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

58
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:39,308
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Jennifer Larson-Solwin, and my husband's going to try and hook up the projector here while I'm beginning.

59
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,631
[SPEAKER_28]: There are a few images I'd like to share with you.

60
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,111
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm delighted to be speaking tonight.

61
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,972
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a resident in Fulton Heights.

62
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:54,158
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a lover of the fells, a swimmer in Wright's Pond, and a mother of two kids at Roberts Elementary, Zane and Lila.

63
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,241
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's for them and their peers that I'm here this evening.

64
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:09,609
[SPEAKER_28]: I was asked to speak on the topic of styrofoam trays being used at elementary schools and other district schools for lunches and other meals.

65
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:15,461
[SPEAKER_28]: In respect of things that are green going on already in Medford, there's plenty.

66
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:22,927
[SPEAKER_28]: There is a designated green community that we've been honored to join.

67
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:27,170
[SPEAKER_28]: There is a Go Green Medford initiative housed right here at City Hall.

68
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,690
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a Harvest Your Energy Festival.

69
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,151
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a new plastic bag ban going on this summer.

70
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:38,312
[SPEAKER_28]: I've heard from a friend that herrings and bald eagles have returned to our waters.

71
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:49,034
[SPEAKER_28]: And at our schools, we're upgrading to LED lighting, according to Alicia Hunt, community gardens, and my kids chatter about Earth Day observations at the school.

72
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,075
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm here for one major reason today.

73
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:17,937
[SPEAKER_28]: And that is because every week our kids see thousands of styrofoam trays, like these, carted off to the landfill after one meal is eaten on them.

74
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:32,950
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's an alarming trend, really, how many of them are accumulated over time.

75
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:39,896
[SPEAKER_28]: Why are Styrofoam trays used here in city schools?

76
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, primarily, they're very cost-effective.

77
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:53,545
[SPEAKER_28]: Instead of having to wash them, you can buy them very cheaply, one-off.

78
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,987
[SPEAKER_28]: It's lightweight and they don't shatter when you drop them.

79
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,949
[SPEAKER_28]: They go right into the bin rather than being washed.

80
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:14,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Nobody recycles them because it's not cost effective in the least, and I've heard one study that it composes about 30% of landfills in our country.

81
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:25,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Scientists don't really know for sure, but the best guess is that it takes about 500 years for a styrofoam tray to decompose or break down, and it actually doesn't go away.

82
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:30,577
[SPEAKER_28]: It basically breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces as you see in that image there.

83
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,939
[SPEAKER_28]: And they become sort of prone to wildlife consumption.

84
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,382
[SPEAKER_28]: Microplastic ends up in the seafood that we eat, the water we drink, and in the air that we breathe.

85
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:50,826
[SPEAKER_28]: Styrofoam also contains a substance called styrene, which is on the NIH's list of human carcinogens.

86
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:54,927
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're serving food to our children on it every day in the city.

87
00:09:55,608 --> 00:10:00,510
[SPEAKER_28]: Styrofoam is also a petroleum product, which is a non-renewable energy.

88
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,411
[SPEAKER_28]: The plastics industry is a huge contributor to climate change.

89
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:11,753
[SPEAKER_28]: So there are many trends in response to this threat to eliminate styrofoam.

90
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:20,395
[SPEAKER_28]: Our much loved Commonwealth tradition of stopping by Dunkin' is going to be a new experience because they're phasing out styrofoam cups.

91
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:27,517
[SPEAKER_28]: McDonald's has already eliminated cups in January of last year, and they're going to phase out styrofoam from their

92
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,780
[SPEAKER_28]: products entirely by 2025.

93
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:35,570
[SPEAKER_28]: States and cities around our country are also eliminating them.

94
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,820
[SPEAKER_28]: And just a few days ago, the state of Maine created a ban on styrofoam throughout the state.

95
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:50,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year, my daughter Lila in kindergarten, she was lucky enough to have Ms.

96
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:51,555
[SPEAKER_28]: Gas as a teacher.

97
00:10:52,936 --> 00:11:02,039
[SPEAKER_28]: She and the rest of her classmates took on this research project of measuring the consumption of styrofoam trays and plastic straws at the Roberts.

98
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:05,840
[SPEAKER_28]: So here's a picture of some of her classmates measuring a stack of them.

99
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:17,605
[SPEAKER_28]: To get a visual, it's not represented here, we don't have an image unfortunately, but they apparently had to stack the 255 daily used trays at the Roberts.

100
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:23,568
[SPEAKER_28]: They stacked it in a stairwell because it was too high to get a visual in the classroom.

101
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,670
[SPEAKER_28]: And it reached beyond the ceiling.

102
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,291
[SPEAKER_28]: So here's a little back of the envelope math.

103
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:52,146
[SPEAKER_28]: If we consider the 10-foot ceiling to be sort of the average height, and we multiply that by 180 days in a school year times the six years that it might take a child to go through kindergarten all the way through fifth grade, it would reach the height of 10,800 feet, which is two miles high.

104
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:57,587
[SPEAKER_28]: So over the six years that Leila in her kindergarten class attends the Roberts,

105
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,773
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be 14 and a half prudential centers high.

106
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:09,879
[SPEAKER_28]: So the Prue is 750 feet tall, one, two, all the way up to 14.

107
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:18,427
[SPEAKER_28]: That's how many styrofoam trays would get used in just one school over six years, and that's 549 kids.

108
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:19,808
[SPEAKER_28]: How many kids are in the district?

109
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:20,889
[SPEAKER_28]: 4,352, according to one study.

110
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,255
[SPEAKER_28]: a data point that I found earlier today.

111
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:36,732
[SPEAKER_28]: I've also footnoted in some of the material that is at the disposal of the school committee on some other consumption of styrofoam trays that Retta kindly shared with me.

112
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:45,910
[SPEAKER_28]: So I believe it's up to us that phasing out the use of Styrofoam in our public schools is not only possible, but it's also a moral imperative.

113
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:51,472
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll hear from kids in a moment, but I fancy that these kids are our local Greta Thunbergs.

114
00:12:52,113 --> 00:13:00,856
[SPEAKER_28]: Greta is a 17-year-old Swedish girl who launched a worldwide youth movement to call attention to the need for radical policy changes to address climate change.

115
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,858
[SPEAKER_28]: Greta has said, we need to wake up and change everything.

116
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,799
[SPEAKER_28]: and she's shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize.

117
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,722
[SPEAKER_28]: Kids are asking us in this moment, the adults, to listen to them and to make changes.

118
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:17,604
[SPEAKER_28]: I know there will be challenges in making the switch at the Roberts and in the entire district.

119
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,825
[SPEAKER_28]: Surely it will take funds in the short term.

120
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:29,550
[SPEAKER_28]: We took a quick look at issues that would involve reusable trays, places to dry them, aprons, goggles, perhaps additional staff to manage the washing and drying routine.

121
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:40,336
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm confident that we have both the smarts in this room and the resources to figure out a way forward that shows our kids that we care for and are planning for their future.

122
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:47,040
[SPEAKER_28]: As the proverb says, we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.

123
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,842
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to invite my son, Zane, to come up and speak briefly.

124
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,202
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, my name is Zane Sullen.

125
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,263
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm in fourth grade at the Roberts.

126
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,584
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm here to talk to you about the styrofoam trays.

127
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,164
[SPEAKER_33]: When I walk into the cafeteria, here's what I see.

128
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,245
[SPEAKER_33]: I see 20 tables almost completely filled with kids.

129
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:16,546
[SPEAKER_33]: The big tables have seven kids that go into the lunch line.

130
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:19,287
[SPEAKER_33]: The little tables have four kids that go there.

131
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:24,815
[SPEAKER_33]: Kids through the line get their meals, putting food on styrofoam trays.

132
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:30,898
[SPEAKER_33]: When they're done eating, the kids walk over to one of the four trash barrels and throw away what's left.

133
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,020
[SPEAKER_33]: This scene gets repeated five times every week.

134
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:39,883
[SPEAKER_33]: People think it's gone, but it goes into landfills and spills into the sea.

135
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:43,868
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not on the school committee now, but I may be one day.

136
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:51,516
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm asking you to help us make a change and phase out Styrofoam from the Roberts and all public schools in our district.

137
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:53,258
[SPEAKER_33]: This earth is my home.

138
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,499
[SPEAKER_33]: There's only one.

139
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,901
[SPEAKER_33]: We have to take care of it.

140
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:10,845
[SPEAKER_28]: How about I start for you, okay?

141
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,466
[SPEAKER_28]: So my name is Lila Sawin.

142
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,187
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm in first grade at the Roberts.

143
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:22,710
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year, when we worked on a project called Plastic Pollution, we were surprised at how high the styrofoam tray tower got.

144
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:30,414
[SPEAKER_28]: Now when I see my friends in the cafeteria throwing styrofoam trays away, I feel sad because I know it ends up in oceans and landfills.

145
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:37,157
[SPEAKER_28]: At the end of the year, we invited parents and grandparents to a presentation on our work, and we sang a song called

146
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:40,173
[SPEAKER_28]: with my own two hands.

147
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,554
[SPEAKER_28]: And here's a little bit of that.

148
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,777
[SPEAKER_28]: I can change the world with my own two hands.

149
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,518
[SPEAKER_28]: I can make it a better place.

150
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,519
[SPEAKER_28]: I can make it a kinder place.

151
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,642
[SPEAKER_28]: I can clean up the earth with my own two hands.

152
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:54,664
[SPEAKER_28]: I can reach out to you with my own two hands.

153
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:57,866
[SPEAKER_28]: You and we have the power to make this important change.

154
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:06,513
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

155
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:15,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

156
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:23,610
[SPEAKER_26]: Paul, could you put the lights on?

157
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:28,071
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

158
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:28,932
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot is blinking.

159
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:34,260
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you so much for your presentation, Jennifer, Zane, and Lila.

160
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,161
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to tell you that this is actually not the first time it's come before the committee.

161
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:48,183
[SPEAKER_25]: It came many years ago, I'm guessing 10, 15, and at the time we actually had trays but used Styrofoam plates.

162
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:54,925
[SPEAKER_25]: And at that point in time we did a cost analysis and it was determined that it was too expensive.

163
00:16:55,705 --> 00:17:03,850
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, now lots of years have passed and I am so happy you're bringing this to us again because it's not too expensive to save our earth.

164
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,692
[SPEAKER_25]: And I really appreciate you speaking up on this issue.

165
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:16,858
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to need to ask for that we do a study in terms of what the cost of, what our options are.

166
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:25,685
[SPEAKER_25]: It may be an option to go back to reusable trays and water, but that, of course, also means expenditures using water.

167
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,985
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's many factors that we have to look at.

168
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:29,945
[SPEAKER_25]: But we're at a prime place now.

169
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:33,726
[SPEAKER_25]: We appreciate the work of our very young activists.

170
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:42,368
[SPEAKER_25]: There's nothing that can bring it home like seeing that stack of trays and then understanding how that adds up over the course of a year.

171
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:45,389
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you again for your presentation.

172
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:55,372
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll make a motion that we send this question to committee and that we do a study and we report back by the end of the year.

173
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:59,513
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a motion on the floor to send this paper to committee for study.

174
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,033
[SPEAKER_31]: Second.

175
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:00,133
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

176
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,914
[SPEAKER_31]: DiBenedetto, second on the floor as well.

177
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:04,254
[SPEAKER_32]: I second Ms.

178
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,495
[SPEAKER_32]: Van der Kloot's motion and I agree.

179
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,315
[SPEAKER_32]: that time has changed, awareness has changed, and we need to look at other resources.

180
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,357
[SPEAKER_32]: So I second Ms.

181
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:19,439
[SPEAKER_32]: Van der Kloot's motion and ask for a roll call vote.

182
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,220
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Ruggiero.

183
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention.

184
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Serving issues like this is why I ran for school committee.

185
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

186
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:42,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to suggest that once we move forward and remove or find a better option for our community that we all can agree on, that you find something else that you think should be improved and you keep doing it.

187
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is one of the most exciting things about serving on this board.

188
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So please keep speaking up.

189
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Your voice is welcome here.

190
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:51,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

191
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:52,912
[SPEAKER_31]: Great job.

192
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:54,714
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Russo.

193
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you for that presentation.

194
00:18:57,881 --> 00:19:04,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if we might consider amending this to include all single-use plastics in our entire school system.

195
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,610
[SPEAKER_31]: We're also looking at the breakfast bags.

196
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:14,035
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's another item that's being looked at right now, removing them.

197
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:15,917
[SPEAKER_31]: Very good.

198
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:22,623
[SPEAKER_31]: On the motion that a report be done, a study be performed, advising us of the options available,

199
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:28,445
[SPEAKER_31]: And hopefully we can have that back in the next three weeks or so so that we can make some budget decisions.

200
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:30,426
[SPEAKER_30]: Roll call vote, please.

201
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:31,727
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

202
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:34,828
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

203
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:36,349
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

204
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:37,629
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

205
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,590
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

206
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,231
[SPEAKER_31]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

207
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,091
[SPEAKER_31]: The motion passes.

208
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,292
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Zane, for that information.

209
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,312
[SPEAKER_31]: It was very helpful.

210
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:45,553
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

211
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:46,333
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Zane.

212
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:56,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

213
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,050
[SPEAKER_31]: Millstone, a motion for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

214
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,690
[SPEAKER_31]: Is there a second by Ms.

215
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,690
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot?

216
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,291
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor of suspension of the rules?

217
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:06,232
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

218
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,492
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyone against?

219
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:14,415
[SPEAKER_31]: Hearing that, we'll take item number two, recognition of Medford Middle School String Ensemble.

220
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:14,835
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

221
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:15,355
[SPEAKER_31]: Dizigny.

222
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:21,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you.

223
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:23,058
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 10th year in a row

224
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:36,935
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Medford Middle School String Ensemble, under the direction of Sophia Chang, has brought back a Medal of Excellence for their participation in the prestigious MICA, which is the Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association Music Festival.

225
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:45,558
[SPEAKER_00]: On Saturday, April 6th, they competed at Foxboro, which is one of eight sites across Massachusetts, along with more than 200 other ensembles,

226
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:52,241
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of a panel of distinguished judges, and they were awarded a silver medal for their fine performance.

227
00:20:53,122 --> 00:21:00,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Chang founded this group in 2009, and since that time, the ensemble has earned seven gold medals and three silver medals.

228
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:10,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The students practice not only during the school day, but rehearse for many hours before and after school in order to achieve the superior level of success that you are about to hear.

229
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:15,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll turn it over to Mrs. Chang and the string ensemble.

230
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:50,603
you

231
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:23,248
CCoSp4 3.50

232
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:43,613
[SPEAKER_31]: That is so impressive.

233
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:44,773
[SPEAKER_31]: Unbelievable.

234
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:45,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Awesome job.

235
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:46,894
[SPEAKER_31]: Awesome job.

236
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,435
[SPEAKER_31]: It's hard to believe you're middle schoolers.

237
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,036
[SPEAKER_31]: Fabulous.

238
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:51,596
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm awestruck.

239
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:52,637
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

240
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:53,377
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot?

241
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:55,378
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Ms.

242
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:57,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Cheng and students,

243
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:03,239
[SPEAKER_25]: And Mr. Zigny, a lot of people ask me a lot of the time why I want to be on the school committee.

244
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,242
[SPEAKER_25]: And I say to them, you know, it can be really rewarding.

245
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:07,583
[SPEAKER_25]: And they look at me.

246
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:10,385
[SPEAKER_25]: But I want to tell you, it's really rewarding.

247
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,527
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you so very, very much.

248
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:23,645
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

249
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:24,306
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

250
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:29,008
[SPEAKER_32]: Many years ago, both my children were in the high school orchestra.

251
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,589
[SPEAKER_32]: And when Ms.

252
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:35,891
[SPEAKER_32]: Chang first came to the district, she taught my daughter how to hold a bow.

253
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:48,176
[SPEAKER_32]: And the beautiful way in which she looked at each and every detail with the students from day one leads to this beauty that we've all witnessed here this evening.

254
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,077
[SPEAKER_32]: So to Ms.

255
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:51,718
[SPEAKER_32]: Chang, thank you for your dedication to the students

256
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:08,405
[SPEAKER_32]: So since I've lived here, Mr. Zigney has been part of the orchestra, and there's over 100 children in our high school orchestra.

257
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:11,486
[SPEAKER_32]: And many of us in this room have had children go through it.

258
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:19,088
[SPEAKER_32]: And I also thank him for his dedication for all the years of service throughout our community, because this is brilliance.

259
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:20,428
[SPEAKER_32]: This is amazing.

260
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,128
[SPEAKER_32]: I had the

261
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,584
[SPEAKER_32]: I was invited by one of your students to come to their concert at the McGlynn last week.

262
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:36,070
[SPEAKER_32]: And my husband came with me, and he hasn't heard Medford's orchestra play in a few years.

263
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:43,977
[SPEAKER_32]: And he was blown away at the expertise of the students in this group and how they've developed over these 10 years.

264
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,298
[SPEAKER_32]: You make us proud.

265
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,099
[SPEAKER_32]: You make us all very proud.

266
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:47,520
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

267
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:56,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

268
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:56,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Krux.

269
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:56,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

270
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to say thank you.

271
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:06,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I attended, along with most of my colleagues, most of the spring concerts and the winter concerts, and they're just all, like, phenomenal.

272
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is just perfect.

273
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:09,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought my mother to one concert.

274
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:10,977
[SPEAKER_11]: She loves coming.

275
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,478
[SPEAKER_11]: She loves to hear the violins.

276
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:14,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Mrs. Zigney.

277
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

278
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Chain, and the entire finance department for everything.

279
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:18,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all.

280
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:50,667
[SPEAKER_25]: I failed to mention one other group that we want to express our appreciation and we didn't say thank you to the parents because the parents make sure that their kids are brought and picked up and from all the rehearsals and you know they're listening probably to the same piece of music many times sometimes and you know when you start in fourth grade it's a little rough at the beginning but my it's it's so worth it and thank you so very much for

281
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,011
[SPEAKER_25]: supporting your children in this endeavor, obviously it's so well worth it.

282
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:20,571
[SPEAKER_37]: I am a lover of the arts and last week I had the opportunity to not only hear the strings at the McGlynn and the week before that at the Andrews and I was bragging and saying that we have the Medford Pops.

283
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:23,312
[SPEAKER_37]: So we should be on the lookout.

284
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,095
[SPEAKER_37]: We have wonderful, talented musicians.

285
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:29,143
[SPEAKER_37]: in Medford Public Schools.

286
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:41,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, I want to thank all the students, thank the teachers, Mr. Zigney's direction and leadership, and again, a special thanks to the parents for supporting your children and encouraging them to be the best that they can possibly be.

287
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:42,722
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you again.

288
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,759
[SPEAKER_31]: We have certificates of achievement.

289
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:57,191
[SPEAKER_31]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Melissa Antoine for receiving the 2019 Micah Silva Medal.

290
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:57,592
[SPEAKER_31]: Melissa...

291
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:20,729
[SPEAKER_31]: Maram Bensabar.

292
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:37,964
[SPEAKER_31]: Ashtim Kapionkalofi.

293
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,571

00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:38,765
[SPEAKER_27]: Congratulations.

313
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:41,426
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you all so much for sharing that music with us tonight.

314
00:37:41,446 --> 00:37:51,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

315
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:51,269
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

316
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,750
[SPEAKER_31]: Chang, would you like to say a few words?

317
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:11,614
[SPEAKER_20]: for the administrators and all the panelists, for all the driving, and my students, whether they're using it as a classwork, and for preparing the teachers.

318
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:33,715
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a motion on the floor to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

319
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:35,475
[SPEAKER_31]: Mustone, seconded by Mr. Russo.

320
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,355
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

321
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:38,316
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

322
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,656
[SPEAKER_31]: We are now back on the agenda.

323
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:42,817
[SPEAKER_31]: Next up we have Ms.

324
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:46,237
[SPEAKER_31]: Sharon Hayes, ELA MCAS.

325
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:57,340
[SPEAKER_31]: I saw her come in.

326
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

327
00:38:58,875 --> 00:38:59,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

328
00:38:59,175 --> 00:38:59,395
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

329
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, my name is Sharon Hayes.

330
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:17,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I am a parent of one, soon to be two, students at the Roberts School, and I am here tonight to re-ask some questions that I've had about our performance on the 2018 MCAS, especially the third, fourth, and fifth grade English Language Arts Assessment.

331
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:25,704
[SPEAKER_24]: In October, I attended the Committee of the Whole meeting during which the 2018 MCAS results were presented.

332
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:38,072
[SPEAKER_24]: At that time, I spoke of my concern that although the scores and progress were presented in a very positive light, my interpretation as a parent and an educator was that the scores on the ELA test were disappointing.

333
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:44,917
[SPEAKER_24]: It was indicated that a more in-depth analysis of the MCAS results would be presented at a future school committee meeting.

334
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:50,992
[SPEAKER_24]: And in January, I sent an email to describe my concerns in further detail.

335
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:54,414
[SPEAKER_24]: The follow-up meeting was then held on March 18th.

336
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:59,918
[SPEAKER_24]: At that meeting, however, I was disappointed to find that many of my questions were still not addressed.

337
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:03,902
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I followed up with another, more detailed email on April 2nd.

338
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:10,787
[SPEAKER_24]: I will briefly summarize some of my concerns and questions from the email, focusing on the elementary ELA MCAS results.

339
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:18,071
[SPEAKER_24]: First, the March 18th meeting was described as a more in-depth analysis of the test scores.

340
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:32,367
[SPEAKER_24]: And a great deal of information was presented, but the analysis continued to be focused mainly on the average score of the district at each grade level, which obscures the fact that there are significant differences between the elementary schools and among some of the subgroups.

341
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:47,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Second, there was little to no discussion of the significant demographic differences between the student populations of the four elementary schools, differences that research has shown to have considerable impacts on academic performance.

342
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:54,137
[SPEAKER_24]: The Brooks School's demographics are significantly different from the other three schools across four subgroup categories.

343
00:40:54,756 --> 00:41:06,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Brooks has significantly lower percentage of economically disadvantaged students, of high-needs students, of students who are English language learners, and of students for whom English is not their first language.

344
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:10,550
[SPEAKER_24]: So one of my questions is, how are these differences being addressed?

345
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:21,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Third, across all three grade levels and all three test years shown on the Department of Ed website, despite changes in test design and administration,

346
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:26,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Brooks outperforms the three other elementary schools, often by a large margin.

347
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:32,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Overall, students at the Brooks also make more progress from one grade level to the next.

348
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:39,865
[SPEAKER_24]: So another question I have is, have any staffing, resources, materials, or programmatic changes been considered based on this data?

349
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:46,932
[SPEAKER_24]: Fourth, the data suggests that there are grade levels at individual schools in which fewer than half

350
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:51,953
[SPEAKER_24]: and in some cases even fewer than a third of the students are reading at grade level expectations.

351
00:41:52,793 --> 00:42:04,055
[SPEAKER_24]: This is very concerning not only for the students who are struggling to read, but also for the other students in those classrooms because the teachers will have to alter the pace and delivery of what they teach in order to meet the needs of the class.

352
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:06,095
[SPEAKER_24]: How is this being addressed?

353
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:13,897
[SPEAKER_24]: Finally, the ELA MCAS anchors standard analysis data that was provided at the March 18th meeting

354
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:19,338
[SPEAKER_24]: clearly suggested that the writing standard is the area of greatest need in K-8.

355
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:21,519
[SPEAKER_24]: How is this being addressed?

356
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,142
[SPEAKER_24]: Has Medford adopted a specific writing program for K-8 or even K-5?

357
00:42:28,823 --> 00:42:43,732
[SPEAKER_24]: These are some of the most urgent questions that I felt I asked in my email and I hope to receive a response or to hear about just kind of what your thoughts are about some of these issues and whether there are other assessments we have in the system that might refute some of these results.

358
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:47,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

359
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,515
[SPEAKER_31]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

360
00:42:49,315 --> 00:43:06,659
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, so to your first comment about the difference in outcomes between the Brooks School and some of the other schools, there are definitely differences, demographic differences between the different schools that we have.

361
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:15,762
[SPEAKER_37]: But with that information, there are a lot of factors that you would not be able to take into consideration.

362
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:19,146
[SPEAKER_37]: or that you wouldn't be aware of that we take into consideration.

363
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:32,762
[SPEAKER_37]: So, for example, with staffing, where you are asking what would be done in terms of a difference in outcomes, some schools have higher EL populations, some schools have higher students with disabilities.

364
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:38,190
[SPEAKER_37]: Some schools have higher students, a greater number of students of high needs.

365
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,636
[SPEAKER_37]: So depending on what those needs are of the students, the teachers have to make accommodations.

366
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:50,784
[SPEAKER_37]: When I look at the data and the progress of the students, I am looking at it holistically, the whole picture.

367
00:43:51,185 --> 00:43:53,988
[SPEAKER_37]: So I know that we cannot compare every school

368
00:43:55,678 --> 00:43:59,700
[SPEAKER_37]: one school to another school exactly because they're not the same.

369
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,721
[SPEAKER_37]: They don't have the same exact makeup.

370
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,803
[SPEAKER_37]: Although they're taking the same assessment, they are getting different results.

371
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:18,410
[SPEAKER_37]: As I look at data, I look at how are we doing with student growth as a district, how are we making gains, and I look at those gains.

372
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:21,972
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to look, for example, at the Columbus.

373
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:35,329
[SPEAKER_37]: When we look at the MCAS data, which is one assessment, in ELA, this is their aggregate data.

374
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:39,310
[SPEAKER_37]: At the Columbus School, they exceeded their target.

375
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,972
[SPEAKER_37]: So you have to understand that each school is given its own target.

376
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:51,135
[SPEAKER_37]: So we're not comparing one school against another school, but each school's being compared to itself.

377
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:56,177
[SPEAKER_37]: So in this assessment, looking at the accountability report,

378
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:07,312
[SPEAKER_37]: In 2017, the number was 492.3 for achievement, and the school moved to 494.9.

379
00:45:07,592 --> 00:45:11,713
[SPEAKER_37]: It exceeded the state target by a change of 2.6.

380
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:25,256
[SPEAKER_37]: Granted, it's not the same rate as some of the other schools, but I look at what Desi is saying, and in ELA, combined at the Columbus School, they exceeded their target.

381
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:26,656
[SPEAKER_37]: That's for all students.

382
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:33,658
[SPEAKER_37]: For African American and black students, they improved, but it was below target.

383
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:40,060
[SPEAKER_37]: So there was an improvement of, or a change of one point, but it was below the target.

384
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,921
[SPEAKER_37]: So the original achievement scores were 483.8 in 2017.

385
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:43,781
[SPEAKER_37]: It was 484.8 in 2018, a change of one point.

386
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:44,821
[SPEAKER_37]: The state's target was 485.4.

387
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:58,310
[SPEAKER_37]: So the school received two points.

388
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,172
[SPEAKER_37]: But it improved, but it was below the target.

389
00:46:01,612 --> 00:46:04,975
[SPEAKER_37]: So I look at each school to see where are they exceeding targets.

390
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:12,001
[SPEAKER_37]: At the Columbus School for students of Hispanic or Latino descent, they've exceeded the target.

391
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:16,345
[SPEAKER_37]: And there was a change of a 4.6 increase.

392
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:18,266
[SPEAKER_37]: And so I look at that.

393
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:19,347
[SPEAKER_37]: This is an ELA.

394
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:24,572
[SPEAKER_37]: If I look at the math, once again, at the Columbus, they exceeded the target.

395
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:26,371
[SPEAKER_37]: It was 483.6 in 2017, 489.7 in 2018.

396
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:27,412
[SPEAKER_37]: There was a change of 6.1.

397
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:31,034
[SPEAKER_37]: The target was 485.4, and we were talking about 168 students that were tested.

398
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,354
[SPEAKER_37]: They exceeded the target.

399
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:32,894
[SPEAKER_37]: In mathematics,

400
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:49,984
[SPEAKER_37]: They exceeded the target for African-American students and Latino students.

401
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:54,265
[SPEAKER_37]: In science, that was an area where we did see a drop.

402
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,846
[SPEAKER_37]: There was a change of 10 points.

403
00:46:57,386 --> 00:47:01,167
[SPEAKER_37]: The reason, the state declares that we declined in science.

404
00:47:01,247 --> 00:47:02,267
[SPEAKER_37]: We are aware of that.

405
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:07,508
[SPEAKER_37]: Economically disadvantaged, also there was a decline there.

406
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,370
[SPEAKER_37]: For student growth percentile, we were below target.

407
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:17,475
[SPEAKER_37]: in both ELA and in math there.

408
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:25,941
[SPEAKER_37]: For our English language proficiency, or our students who are English language learners, we exceeded the target.

409
00:47:26,362 --> 00:47:26,902
[SPEAKER_37]: In 2017, the rate was 38.3.

410
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:28,303
[SPEAKER_37]: In 2018, the rate was 62.3.

411
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:37,328
[SPEAKER_37]: It was a change of 24 points.

412
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:43,352
[SPEAKER_37]: The next target's going to be 70.2, and that's in regards to 53 students.

413
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:49,156
[SPEAKER_37]: For students that were formerly English language learners, the original rate in 2017 was 38.3.

414
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:49,536
[SPEAKER_37]: In 2018, it was 62.3.

415
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:50,957
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, it was another change of 24 points.

416
00:47:50,997 --> 00:47:52,518
[SPEAKER_37]: They exceeded the target.

417
00:48:00,957 --> 00:48:07,641
[SPEAKER_37]: In terms of absenteeism for all students, there was an improvement, but it was below target.

418
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:08,761
[SPEAKER_37]: So in 2017, the rate was 9.4%.

419
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:09,422
[SPEAKER_37]: In 2018, the rate was 8.2%.

420
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:11,102
[SPEAKER_37]: There was a change of 1.2%, the target being 7.5.

421
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:11,883
[SPEAKER_37]: That's regarding 330 students.

422
00:48:11,903 --> 00:48:14,144
[SPEAKER_37]: So I want to say, I know that you're asking about the 2018 data.

423
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:37,996
[SPEAKER_37]: Myself and my leadership team, we look at the data of our students, we look at the data of all of the schools, and we do make necessary accommodations.

424
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:47,220
[SPEAKER_37]: When you talk about moving staff, we do have teachers who are vested, who have committed to the buildings that they're working in.

425
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:55,024
[SPEAKER_37]: And just because you're not seeing identical outcomes does not mean that you're seeing a difference in the quality of the work or the teaching

426
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:57,165
[SPEAKER_37]: an instruction that is taking place.

427
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:20,318
[SPEAKER_37]: So I feel sometimes when there's an ask about why is one school doing better than another school, which may have higher needs or a different population, that may have more economically disadvantaged students, it sometimes feels like there's a judgment being made on a school that is lower performing.

428
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:35,864
[SPEAKER_37]: We are working collaboratively as a team to look at our data, but later today we are going to be talking about all of the assessments that take place, not just resting upon one assessment that is given by the state.

429
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:39,266
[SPEAKER_37]: We know it's important and we need to continue to see the needle move.

430
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:46,970
[SPEAKER_37]: We are committed to moving the needle in the right direction, but I do not want it to be something where we are trying to pit

431
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:52,533
[SPEAKER_37]: one school against another school when we're not comparing apples and apples.

432
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:59,958
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to make clear, I was not in any way suggesting that it had to do with teaching, the quality of teaching at any school.

433
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:12,447
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, one statistic that you stated is more my concern, that we know that research says that economics, the economically disadvantaged are the ones who struggle the most in school, that has the greatest impact.

434
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:16,830
[SPEAKER_24]: We also know that that number of students in this district is not

435
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:20,446
[SPEAKER_24]: disproportionately at certain schools.

436
00:50:20,886 --> 00:50:26,172
[SPEAKER_24]: And so those schools are going to have a more difficult time and may not do as well in the MCAS.

437
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:33,360
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was my question, was more looking at the demographics, not in any way suggesting that the teaching quality was different at different schools.

438
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,023
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's not my intention to pit schools against each other.

439
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,352
[SPEAKER_24]: But the demographics are what they are.

440
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:50,823
[SPEAKER_37]: Where the demographics are changes, we do have schools that have greater numbers of Title I staff, which again, that's part of the funding where those schools will be targeted to get additional supports.

441
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:55,728
[SPEAKER_37]: We have staff members who are in the process of pursuing grants.

442
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:06,480
[SPEAKER_37]: to see if we can get more social-emotional support for some of our schools that have students that have higher needs in the areas of social-emotional learning and wellness.

443
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,004
[SPEAKER_37]: So there are things that we are doing as a district to support those schools.

444
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,587
[SPEAKER_37]: But all schools are being supported.

445
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,308
[SPEAKER_37]: The principals are here.

446
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:17,731
[SPEAKER_37]: They work collaboratively with their staff.

447
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,013
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not able, again,

448
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:29,671
[SPEAKER_37]: When we think about the different schools and we think about the populations that are at schools, we also have neighborhood schools at the elementary level.

449
00:51:30,031 --> 00:51:47,724
[SPEAKER_37]: And so you cannot change some students that may not be in an area or they may receive assistance for housing so that those students may not be as economically disadvantaged as others.

450
00:51:48,225 --> 00:51:51,027
[SPEAKER_37]: But we are finding ways to support those schools.

451
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:52,667
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

452
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:53,508
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

453
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:55,170
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

454
00:51:56,511 --> 00:52:09,282
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto, you talked about the decrease in the science curriculum, and this year we have just adopted a new science curriculum, so we're hoping to see growth in the next few years.

455
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:18,090
[SPEAKER_32]: Usually when you adopt a program like our ELA or our math program, which we've gotten, which we got in the last few years,

456
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:34,229
[SPEAKER_32]: It takes an average of three years to see any progress on an MCAS or a standardized test because it takes years of instruction for the students to learn the new vocabulary and move forward in those areas.

457
00:52:34,709 --> 00:52:44,176
[SPEAKER_32]: So even though we got our programming early and we're starting a little early with training, we'll see that in the next few years with science.

458
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:54,263
[SPEAKER_32]: And we should be seeing that in the English language arts program, because we did invest about four years ago in a new ELA program.

459
00:52:54,583 --> 00:53:02,450
[SPEAKER_32]: And we should see that growth among all subgroups because of that programming, because students have had it for consecutive years.

460
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:08,194
[SPEAKER_32]: And as they grow up, and if we don't, then we have to realize that maybe that's not the right program.

461
00:53:09,095 --> 00:53:12,698
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's a good way to look at what our curriculum is and make

462
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:20,685
[SPEAKER_32]: good choices going forward, and I applaud you for coming forward and advocating for the students in your school.

463
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:26,029
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to see more of that here at school committee, and I appreciate it.

464
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:28,011
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not always easy to go there and speak.

465
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:29,132
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for your time.

466
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:38,128
[SPEAKER_31]: The next item under community participation, Ms.

467
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:47,433
[SPEAKER_31]: Charlene Douglas, president of the Medford Teachers Association, is with us, along with other teachers, in regards to a school committee meeting from, I believe, two weeks ago.

468
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:48,074
[SPEAKER_31]: May 6th.

469
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:52,796
[SPEAKER_31]: And as we spoke, Mr. Russo would like to say some words first.

470
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:53,756
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely.

471
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

472
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,341
[SPEAKER_03]: At our last meeting of the Medford School Committee,

473
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:07,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I made offensive comments about the teachers of our district, specifically the elementary teachers.

474
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:12,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I made comments that were both disrespectful and factually incorrect, as well as hurtful.

475
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:19,249
[SPEAKER_03]: My comments do not reflect my true feelings about the teachers of our district, including those my children have had through the years.

476
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:30,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I was upset by the presentation that was just given to us, in particular the information about the percentage of children with dyslexia that, if treated early enough with systemic instruction,

477
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:34,736
[SPEAKER_03]: could overcome their diagnosis altogether and become fluent readers.

478
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:36,037
[SPEAKER_03]: This was news to me.

479
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:45,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I strongly believe that our district needs to put the necessary resources into early identification and remediation before children have had a chance to fail.

480
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:57,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not blame teachers for the situation we are in, but rather this sits squarely on the shoulders of the school committee and our budgetary responsibility for professional development and funding appropriate curriculum.

481
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:06,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be clear that I have long held and continue to hold that the teachers of my children have been, without exception, incredible, talented, and caring professionals.

482
00:55:06,715 --> 00:55:11,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have no reason to not believe all of the teachers in Medford are similarly exceptional.

483
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:22,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I sincerely apologize for casting such inappropriate comments upon the very people that have invested their careers in caring for and teaching my children and all of the children of Medford.

484
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:27,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I am especially sorry for the hurt I have caused to my children's teachers.

485
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:37,441
[SPEAKER_03]: As I reflected on each of these amazing teachers that have played such an important role in my family's life, my comments became even more upsetting, and an apology seems inadequate.

486
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:41,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only say that I will do my best to do better in the future.

487
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do better by being more deliberate, but also by looking at root causes of why I have certain feelings and thoughts before using the position of a school committee member to speak.

488
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:54,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the parent perspective is an important one to have on the school committee.

489
00:55:55,442 --> 00:56:00,283
[SPEAKER_03]: but clearly I have room to grow in separating my roles whilst participating in official activities.

490
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:13,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I sincerely apologize for making these comments and hope that I can work with the teachers of Medford in the future to collaboratively improve our education system and do whatever I can to remove barriers and give teachers the space to teach.

491
00:56:14,106 --> 00:56:16,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

492
00:56:16,187 --> 00:56:17,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

493
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:18,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

494
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:18,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Douglas.

495
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:23,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Shalene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford, Mass., President of the Medford Teacher Association.

496
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So we accept your apology.

497
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:27,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did share it.

498
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:30,037
[SPEAKER_09]: When she sent it to me, I shared it with every staff member.

499
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:32,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So they had it prior to this meeting.

500
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:43,703
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, teachers were really deeply and emotionally upset by these statements.

501
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:55,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight, our goal here is to set the record straight, to inform the school committee as to what our elementary reading program looks like.

502
00:56:56,125 --> 00:57:00,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight you will hear from four teachers in regards to the reading program.

503
00:57:00,606 --> 00:57:00,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

504
00:57:00,806 --> 00:57:03,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Jane Mattuccio, a kindergarten teacher at the Brooks.

505
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:08,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Teresa Castagnetti, an ELL teacher at the McGlynn.

506
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:14,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Meredith Mason Crowley, an LD reading specialist from the McGlynn Middle School.

507
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:19,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And Julianne Anderson, an elementary moderate special needs teacher at the McGlynn.

508
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:25,073
[SPEAKER_09]: She is also a resident, a parent, and a proud former student and graduate.

509
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,348
[SPEAKER_09]: of the Medford Public Schools like myself.

510
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:32,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so proud to be here tonight, this evening.

511
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only did I teach for 32 years in this district, but I am a literacy professor at Lesley University for 17 years.

512
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:52,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And I teach phonics training, the foundations of literacy, content-based reading, and the theories of reading.

513
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:54,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the three courses I teach.

514
00:57:54,748 --> 00:58:02,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And I teach an average of four to five courses a semester, both on campus, off campus, and online.

515
00:58:03,632 --> 00:58:05,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been doing that for 17 years.

516
00:58:06,793 --> 00:58:21,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, I'm going to provide each and every one of you with a statement from the International Literacy Association that I provide to my students and to parents, explaining the position statement

517
00:58:22,028 --> 00:58:24,709
[SPEAKER_09]: of what phonics instruction looks like.

518
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:38,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I ask you to please read this and digest what phonics instruction is, because phonics isn't all about A, A, B, B, C, A, K. It's not all about that.

519
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:40,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's much more.

520
00:58:41,259 --> 00:58:46,241
[SPEAKER_09]: phonics instruction involves etymology, morphology.

521
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:49,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Phonics instruction is taught in all grades.

522
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:53,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the Common Core curriculum.

523
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a standard called the Reading Foundations.

524
00:58:57,065 --> 00:59:10,150
[SPEAKER_09]: If our teachers did not teach it, then it would be in their evaluation and they would be in the needs improvement category and unsatisfactory category in which you all know would have a 30-day

525
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:17,968
[SPEAKER_09]: plan that they could actually remove the teachers if they were not teaching phonics or doing their job.

526
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:21,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are the facts.

527
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:28,763
[SPEAKER_09]: The Reading Foundation's phonics, as I said, is in the Common Core and in the Mass Frameworks.

528
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:37,268
[SPEAKER_09]: The Journeys Program, adopted by you and the Medford Public Schools, is a phonics program embedded within the program.

529
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:47,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Irene Fountas, who worked on the Journeys Program, has her own phonics book that goes along with this program.

530
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:51,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that many of my teachers have purchased this book out of their own pocket.

531
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,301
[SPEAKER_09]: to ensure that phonics is taught.

532
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:12,365
[SPEAKER_09]: We have reading specialists on the special education staff that teach phonics to our special ed population using programs such as Wilson, Orton-Gillingham, and those are the programs for students who need that specialized services.

533
01:00:13,145 --> 01:00:16,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Those services are not for every student.

534
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:18,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I am OG trained.

535
01:00:19,107 --> 01:00:25,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I went through Mass General many years ago, and I also took it at Lesley when I was very, very young.

536
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:34,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And at 62, Orton-Gillingham has been around since 19... I believe it was 38 when it first came out.

537
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:40,431
[SPEAKER_09]: What else can I tell you about the phonics?

538
01:00:40,711 --> 01:00:45,233
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an RTI phonics targeted into venture groups at the elementary level.

539
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:47,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are teaching phonics.

540
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:53,135
[SPEAKER_09]: What we were upset with, Mr. Russo, is where did you get the facts that we don't teach phonics?

541
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:54,935
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what teachers were upset about.

542
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You stated that it was a boring subject.

543
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:04,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes not everything can be pomp and circumstance.

544
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:07,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it's rote in memory.

545
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:10,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes we just have to do that.

546
01:01:10,162 --> 01:01:14,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we're looking at OG and we're looking at Wilson, it is memorization.

547
01:01:14,663 --> 01:01:17,944
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to know the spelling rules, the 10 basic spelling rules.

548
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:19,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you all know that?

549
01:01:19,845 --> 01:01:20,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

550
01:01:21,205 --> 01:01:21,305
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

551
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:27,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever been in a classroom in our school and actually witnessed a phonics lesson?

552
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you reviewed the Journeys program?

553
01:01:32,544 --> 01:01:44,746
[SPEAKER_09]: These are our concerns, and I am going to let the teachers now speak to these other things that they do, since they are the experts and they are in the field.

554
01:01:45,146 --> 01:01:50,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to ask Jane Mattuccio, kindergarten teacher from the Glynn Elementary, to please come forward.

555
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

556
01:02:02,337 --> 01:02:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

557
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:03,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Jane Matucci.

558
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:06,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an 18-year-old Medford resident, first grade teacher.

559
01:02:10,122 --> 01:02:11,203
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do work as a team.

560
01:02:11,723 --> 01:02:13,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We follow the journeys program.

561
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:20,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the journeys program is letter sounds, recognition, digraphs, phonics every week.

562
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,990
[SPEAKER_07]: We follow that.

563
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We use words their way, which is another tool we use to assess, to group, to find where we need some remediation.

564
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:40,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know personally I've taken courses, Orton-Gillingham courses myself, so I bring that into the picture every week of the school year.

565
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:47,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Even at the end of the school year when the kids were playing games, we're doing letter sounds, we're reading every day.

566
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:57,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to bring up the fact that the elementary school teachers are certainly following journeys and using the tools that you've provided for us.

567
01:02:57,929 --> 01:02:58,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

568
01:03:06,635 --> 01:03:22,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I ask Teresa Castagnetti to come up, our ELL specialist, I just want to state something else that needs to be very, very clear, that as an eighth grade English teacher, we teach syllabication, we teach prefixes, suffixes, all of those, that's all phonics, that's all phonology.

569
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:33,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Our ELL teachers teach it a great deal, and our foreign language teachers, it is the basis of some of their main curriculum that they teach.

570
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:37,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So without further, Teresa Castagnetti, ELL.

571
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,191
[SPEAKER_38]: Teresa Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford.

572
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:52,073
[SPEAKER_38]: Graduate of all the Medford public schools.

573
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:55,374
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't want to tell you how long ago that was, because they are no longer there.

574
01:03:55,935 --> 01:04:00,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But my child was also a graduate of Medford High School, as was my husband.

575
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:10,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone for giving us this time to speak this evening and to accept Mr. Rousseau's apology to the Medford teachers.

576
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:13,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how difficult it must be for you to have done that.

577
01:04:14,939 --> 01:04:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all human.

578
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:25,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone says things from time to time that we wish we didn't say and can't take back, and especially when it evokes passion topics such as our children.

579
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:38,028
[SPEAKER_02]: As an elected representative of the community, you have a duty and an obligation to your constituency, and I'm quoting from your letter, to separate yourself from your roles while participating in official activities.

580
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:47,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So portraying teachers in a less than desirable light sends a very bad message to the community, to parents, students, and others in the community.

581
01:04:47,894 --> 01:04:51,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very proud to be a Medford resident and a Medford teacher.

582
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:53,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked in the district for 42 years,

583
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:57,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't quite bring myself to retiring because I love this job.

584
01:04:58,115 --> 01:04:59,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my colleagues.

585
01:04:59,636 --> 01:05:00,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my department head.

586
01:05:01,017 --> 01:05:01,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my principal.

587
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:05,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But most importantly, I love teaching the children of Medford.

588
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:11,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the diversity, the rich culture, and the enthusiasm that they bring to school with them every day.

589
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:13,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am not unique.

590
01:05:14,508 --> 01:05:18,711
[SPEAKER_02]: In this district, all of us, we all give of ourselves in our free time.

591
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: both before and after school, during summers when we offer extra help to students who may need it, or just to be an ear for some that we know may be going through a difficult time.

592
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: In this district, we have teachers who routinely supply their classrooms with materials purchased out of their own pockets.

593
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teachers who have brought in clothing, shoes, toys, food, and books for their students because we know that we are here to educate the whole child, and those things are things that they might not have otherwise.

594
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:53,518
[SPEAKER_02]: This district is very fortunate to count among our ranks people like Ms.

595
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Chang, who's just fabulous.

596
01:05:56,579 --> 01:06:03,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Elementary teachers with multiple advanced degrees and certifications, guided through professional development that they have paid for.

597
01:06:04,124 --> 01:06:05,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teachers who are mentors,

598
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:32,362
[SPEAKER_02]: coaches, trainers of teachers, supervising practitioners for colleges, area colleges such as Tufts and Lesley, teachers who have been sought out by the Department of Education for their expertise to sit on panels and advisory committees, teachers who write curriculum, teachers who volunteer for math teams, literacy teams, teacher assistance teams, a whole host of areas where our expertise as Medford teachers shines.

599
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:41,663
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of elementary teachers in Medford who have distinguished themselves at the local, state, and national level in just the past five years.

600
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a 2014 Millikan Foundation Award winner.

601
01:06:46,145 --> 01:06:50,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one teacher in the whole country wins that $25,000 award.

602
01:06:50,887 --> 01:07:01,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am proud and fortunate to call this distinguished teacher

603
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:07,774
[SPEAKER_02]: my colleague, Ethel McGlynn, most adored grade 5 teacher, Mr. Anthony Petralas.

604
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:16,684
[SPEAKER_02]: This district can also count among its ranks two MatSol Teachers of the Year, one in 2015 and the other in 2019.

605
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:21,349
[SPEAKER_02]: This award is only given out to one teacher in the state each year.

606
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I am also proud to call my colleague,

607
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:37,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine Hengston at the Roberts School, the 2019 Maxwell Teacher of the Year, who was congratulated by this very committee two weeks ago in this very room.

608
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:44,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, Ms.

609
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:50,320
[SPEAKER_02]: DeRusso, to quote your letter of apology, we are incredible, talented, and caring professionals.

610
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:53,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you for acknowledging that publicly this evening.

611
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:58,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assure you and all in this chamber, we do teach phonics.

612
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:04,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite any member of the school committee to visit my classroom at any time to watch me teach a phonics lesson.

613
01:08:05,162 --> 01:08:06,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach English as a second language.

614
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:08,404
[SPEAKER_02]: We also teach a lot of phonics.

615
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:12,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I have K1 and 2, second language learners, so we're very heavy on phonics.

616
01:08:13,387 --> 01:08:19,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to provide any of you with my evaluation binders for the cycles 2014 to 2019, if you would care to view them.

617
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:23,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to bring them here this evening, but they're quite heavy.

618
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:31,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But my teaching of phonics and other skills is evidenced by photographs and student work samples.

619
01:08:32,423 --> 01:08:40,030
[SPEAKER_02]: In closing, I again want to acknowledge Mr. Rousseau's apology and to thank the school committee for giving us the opportunity to speak this evening.

620
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:44,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your willingness, and I'm going to quote you again, to work collaboratively

621
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:56,432
[SPEAKER_02]: to improve our educational system and recognize the school committee's budgetary responsibility for professional development and funding appropriate curriculum.

622
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:57,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

623
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:10,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

624
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:11,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

625
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:15,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a special needs teacher at the McGlynn.

626
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:17,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been there since the school opened.

627
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:21,117
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been teaching direct instruction phonics.

628
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:24,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's been my life's work.

629
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:35,306
[SPEAKER_14]: When I began in Medford at the Brooks Elementary School in 1987 as an LD teacher, I had children assigned to me who could not read.

630
01:09:36,057 --> 01:09:40,938
[SPEAKER_14]: whole language replaced the more traditional method of reading instruction, including phonics instruction.

631
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:44,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Children with learning disabilities struggled with this approach.

632
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:48,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I went out in search of how to teach them.

633
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I found the Reading Disabilities Clinic at Mass General Hospital.

634
01:09:52,741 --> 01:09:56,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I spent a year learning the Wharton-Gillingham reading program and method.

635
01:09:57,702 --> 01:10:04,483
[SPEAKER_14]: OG is a direct instruction reading method widely recognized for dyslexics, and I paid for the training myself.

636
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:19,787
[SPEAKER_14]: In subsequent years, when it was clear that the reading laws were not working for our learning disabled students, Medford Special Education began in-house training of reading intervention programs.

637
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:25,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Project Read, Stevenson, and Wilson, all OG spin-offs.

638
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:34,597
[SPEAKER_14]: And at one point, our former assistant director said to me not long ago when I bumped into her, I thought you'd turn and run when you'd see me coming

639
01:10:35,055 --> 01:10:37,857
[SPEAKER_14]: because I always had another reading method for you to learn.

640
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:59,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Today, and over the last several years, emphasis on providing in-house professional development in reading methods and relevant topics related to modification of instruction for special needs children with reading disabilities in general education classrooms and with special needs teachers has fallen away.

641
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:06,292
[SPEAKER_14]: We've just recently seen an 18-minute video, and while it's a video, it's certainly not enough.

642
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:24,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Our high school has one Wilson teacher, and her job has been complicated by scheduling issues and over-reliance on her as the go-to evaluator and diagnostician.

643
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:30,380
[SPEAKER_14]: My middle school, when our new reading specialist was hired to develop the RTI program,

644
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:36,291
[SPEAKER_14]: requested funding for training in Wilson this year, she was told that there were no funds available.

645
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:40,092
[SPEAKER_14]: She has paid for her training and her materials herself.

646
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:44,473
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a school with 60% high-need students.

647
01:11:45,393 --> 01:11:51,975
[SPEAKER_14]: She should have this training, and her interest should be applauded and supported.

648
01:11:52,945 --> 01:12:05,274
[SPEAKER_14]: As for myself, when I requested funding to attend the Dyslexia Association Conference in 2017, at which the research was being presented that was the basis of this law, I was denied.

649
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:11,699
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to look at how we are providing services for children with reading disabilities in Medford.

650
01:12:12,419 --> 01:12:18,544
[SPEAKER_14]: In the OG community, early intervention has always been the recommended and maintained approach for years.

651
01:12:19,264 --> 01:12:20,405
[SPEAKER_14]: As Dr. Gobbs says,

652
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:27,245
[SPEAKER_14]: The same approach for teaching dyslexic children is appropriate for other learning disabled children too.

653
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:49,976
[SPEAKER_14]: At the elementary level, we should be looking at the models for delivering specialized reading instruction to our students with reading disabilities, not letting the push-in method for all reading instruction take over the district, the direct instruction method often delivered in individual and small groups for specialized reading.

654
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:57,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. Rousseau, I say to you, phonics has been here in Medford, but we need to do more.

655
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:06,487
[SPEAKER_14]: It has come to, and it has to come from the top down in a collaborative approach, in a working relationship with teachers.

656
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:15,792
[SPEAKER_14]: The trends to delay referrals, limiting intervention, and having no regular in-house professional development to discuss and address reading issues.

657
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:23,388
[SPEAKER_14]: has to come to an end, and I understand your frustration, and I hope that you use that to help make a change here.

658
01:13:24,628 --> 01:13:32,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your desire to make the right choice, and I appreciate your recognition, all of you, to take your time in choosing a screener.

659
01:13:33,855 --> 01:13:42,841
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, there are children who are struggling with reading problems in our classrooms, and they should be prioritized in your upcoming budget.

660
01:13:43,464 --> 01:13:52,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Providing our specialists, co-teachers, and classroom teachers with the needed materials and professional development is what needs to happen to get the job done.

661
01:13:53,606 --> 01:13:58,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I think in this way, you will have fulfilled your commitment to the children of Medford.

662
01:13:59,627 --> 01:14:00,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

663
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:10,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

664
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Meredith.

665
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:12,809
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, Julianne Anderson.

666
01:14:17,225 --> 01:14:18,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, thank you, and hello.

667
01:14:19,267 --> 01:14:22,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you giving me this opportunity to speak here tonight.

668
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:24,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, my name is Julianne Anderson.

669
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:28,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a special education teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School.

670
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:34,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a resident of Medford 220 Grove Street, as well as a former student of the Medford Public School System.

671
01:14:35,339 --> 01:14:39,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a parent of two children who have also attended the Medford Public School System.

672
01:14:41,864 --> 01:14:44,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, I work with students in grades one, two, and three.

673
01:14:45,632 --> 01:14:50,116
[SPEAKER_15]: providing specialized instruction for math, ELA, as well as reading.

674
01:14:51,878 --> 01:14:53,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I, too, am certified in Oyton-Gillingham.

675
01:14:54,541 --> 01:15:00,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I did attend Mass General Hospital Institute of Professional Learning and received a certificate for advanced degree in reading.

676
01:15:01,587 --> 01:15:06,292
[SPEAKER_15]: I am trained in Wisnia CAP reading program, as well as Wilson and Oyton-Gillingham.

677
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:09,295
[SPEAKER_15]: All of these trainings I have paid for myself

678
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:15,421
[SPEAKER_15]: to keep abreast of the current research and methods that would best support the students whom I work with.

679
01:15:17,422 --> 01:15:27,868
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the instruction and implementation of Orton, Gillingham, or Wilson, they are both a direct and explicit multisensory approach to reading that relies on scope and sequence.

680
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:36,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Spiraling back from the previous day, mastery of skills by creating a solid foundation before moving on

681
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:40,425
[SPEAKER_15]: to the demands of the next expectations in reading.

682
01:15:43,367 --> 01:15:59,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the years, the school system has come up short with the funding to provide all students the materials they need to successfully access the curriculum, as well as the professional development for all teachers to meet the needs of the current changes of the students in our district.

683
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:06,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, at the Columbus and the McGlynn Elementary, we still have part-time kindergarten powers.

684
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:14,080
[SPEAKER_15]: As a committee, you agreed two weeks ago that the intervention needs to happen as early as kindergarten.

685
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:33,589
[SPEAKER_15]: As the demands for DESE and the potential screening for dyslexia will impact how these teachers provide our instruction, the question I pose to all of you, will the school committee provide funding for the full-time powers required to provide the support to all kindergartens, not just at two, but at all four?

686
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:39,878
[SPEAKER_15]: We talk around and we throw these words, equality, collaboration, and achievement.

687
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:42,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Our elementary schools are not equal.

688
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:49,004
[SPEAKER_15]: As the demographics within Method change, so do the needs of all our learners.

689
01:16:49,624 --> 01:16:56,668
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to educate the families of the importance of education, of putting down the cell phones, turning off the video games and the TVs.

690
01:16:57,229 --> 01:17:02,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Pick up a book and spend the quality time reading with your children and having conversations about the stories they have read.

691
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:07,557
[SPEAKER_15]: We have acknowledged the concern for the social-emotional learning of all our students.

692
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:12,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have provided and started beginning with programs and community outreach.

693
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,942
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to step up and do this as well for the academic components.

694
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:27,887
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to, as a community, come forward and help these parents, educate them, and provide them with the tools necessary to educate them and support their own children at home.

695
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:37,572
[SPEAKER_15]: In the city of MedFed, teachers are mandated to teach the programs that this committee has adopted and approved that you felt were beneficial for all learners.

696
01:17:38,352 --> 01:17:40,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Phonics is embedded in the Journeys Reading Program.

697
01:17:41,394 --> 01:17:44,716
[SPEAKER_15]: As a teacher, we don't get to pick and choose what we teach.

698
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:49,398
[SPEAKER_15]: We are mandated not only by the district, but as well as by the state.

699
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:59,144
[SPEAKER_15]: In my career, I have never observed a teacher refuse to teach phonics or make a comment that phonics is boring.

700
01:18:01,004 --> 01:18:07,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Please come and speak with teachers before making comments that imply that we don't care, that we don't do this because it's boring.

701
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:14,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Please feel free, and I extend this invitation to all of you, come to my classroom.

702
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:18,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm on the second floor at the McGlynn Elementary, room 245, the end of the hallway.

703
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:20,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Show up.

704
01:18:21,506 --> 01:18:24,829
[SPEAKER_15]: observe how I teach phonics on a regular basis.

705
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't just show up during Read Across America.

706
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:38,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't just show up when we're doing an ice cream social or an academic award so you can get that photo opportunity because it's an election year.

707
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:43,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Show up, show us that you care, and provide us with the support, the funding that we need

708
01:18:44,227 --> 01:18:47,369
[SPEAKER_15]: to provide this opportunity for our children to be successful.

709
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:48,570
[SPEAKER_15]: They are the future.

710
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,811
[SPEAKER_15]: They are our leaders.

711
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,873
[SPEAKER_15]: They will be the ones that will be taking care of us down the line.

712
01:18:53,453 --> 01:19:03,300
[SPEAKER_15]: If we don't help them now, then, you know, it's... So I just thank you for your time, and I appreciate this opportunity.

713
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we asking?

714
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:31,466
[SPEAKER_09]: We are asking you, the school committee, to advocate for meaningful, fully funded PD.

715
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:37,670
[SPEAKER_09]: This year was the first year there was a $5,000 budget item.

716
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Previous years, it's been $1,000, $2,000.

717
01:19:39,611 --> 01:19:42,112
[SPEAKER_09]: $5,000 for a district of this size.

718
01:19:42,132 --> 01:19:43,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It's insulting.

719
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:43,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say no more.

720
01:19:50,863 --> 01:19:53,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a PD committee that meets.

721
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:55,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

722
01:19:55,546 --> 01:20:01,490
[SPEAKER_09]: We have all these wonderful ideas and we put all these wonderful things forward, but we have nothing to work with.

723
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing comes from nothing.

724
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:07,493
[SPEAKER_09]: King Lear, William Shakespeare.

725
01:20:11,036 --> 01:20:11,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

726
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:14,478
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it.

727
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:15,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We want it.

728
01:20:16,819 --> 01:20:17,540
[SPEAKER_09]: We will attend.

729
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:28,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Please attend our PD meeting this Thursday in the high school library.

730
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:31,900
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the center it's in?

731
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: The CCSR Center from 3.15 to 4.15.

732
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:37,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Hear what we have to say.

733
01:20:38,343 --> 01:20:39,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Hear what we want.

734
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:48,909
[SPEAKER_09]: To advocate for more funding, special ed, to meet the needs of our special needs students.

735
01:20:49,989 --> 01:20:51,050
[SPEAKER_09]: The Fund Me campaign.

736
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:52,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out there.

737
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: We need funding.

738
01:20:56,301 --> 01:20:58,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell your legislators.

739
01:20:58,763 --> 01:21:04,187
[SPEAKER_09]: We were there, marching, Thursday, Thursday night, marching.

740
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:05,288
[SPEAKER_09]: We want funding.

741
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:11,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Method stands to gain $4.2 million if you get out there.

742
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:12,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Join me.

743
01:21:13,114 --> 01:21:14,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Join our crusade.

744
01:21:14,796 --> 01:21:15,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Be a part.

745
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:16,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Be a part of us.

746
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:21,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Criticize us if we do something wrong, absolutely.

747
01:21:22,475 --> 01:21:28,879
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't criticize us when we're fighting every day for the wealth, healthy, and safety of our children.

748
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:36,044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we did a wonderful school safety committee.

749
01:21:36,584 --> 01:21:38,525
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened to that committee?

750
01:21:40,206 --> 01:21:41,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone want to talk about that?

751
01:21:43,062 --> 01:21:51,043
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened to the AIP school climate survey conducted at the McGlynn Middle and Elementary School?

752
01:21:51,644 --> 01:21:53,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to beg to get it.

753
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:56,144
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on there?

754
01:21:58,005 --> 01:22:00,585
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be drafting a letter to you regarding that.

755
01:22:01,885 --> 01:22:07,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And we encourage you, the school committee, to come and talk to us.

756
01:22:08,627 --> 01:22:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to the teachers.

757
01:22:11,624 --> 01:22:11,884
[SPEAKER_09]: As Ms.

758
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:20,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Anderson so eloquently put it, the only time I ever saw any of you, many of you, during my 32 years was at a social event.

759
01:22:21,397 --> 01:22:27,265
[SPEAKER_09]: No one, not one school committee in 32 years entered my classroom.

760
01:22:29,703 --> 01:22:31,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I encourage you and ask you.

761
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:33,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can reach out to me.

762
01:22:33,904 --> 01:22:41,125
[SPEAKER_09]: My cell phone number is 781-771-1098 personally.

763
01:22:41,825 --> 01:22:44,306
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to talk to teachers, reach out to me.

764
01:22:44,766 --> 01:22:45,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm available.

765
01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:46,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm retired.

766
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:47,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm available.

767
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:50,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And consequently, I do not live in Maine.

768
01:22:50,647 --> 01:22:51,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in Medford.

769
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to the weekends in Maine.

770
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have a lovely home in Maine.

771
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:58,769
[SPEAKER_09]: But I am with my niece and my sister

772
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:00,450
[SPEAKER_09]: working with them.

773
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:05,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And my nephew and my niece will be attending the Method Public Schools.

774
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:08,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to be proud.

775
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am proud.

776
01:23:09,856 --> 01:23:11,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I am proud of the teachers in this district.

777
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have met numerous teachers, 17 years teaching in Lesley.

778
01:23:16,381 --> 01:23:21,705
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't think I know what good teaching is, I challenge you to come to me.

779
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:26,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fired up.

780
01:23:27,449 --> 01:23:28,490
[SPEAKER_09]: As you well can see.

781
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:30,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm passionate.

782
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I have always been passionate.

783
01:23:35,154 --> 01:23:42,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So I retired from the 8th grade classroom, but I didn't retire from what I love, and that is teaching our youth.

784
01:23:42,878 --> 01:23:46,360
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a 50% attrition rate of new teachers.

785
01:23:47,301 --> 01:23:48,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at our mentoring program.

786
01:23:49,982 --> 01:23:52,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make sure they stay.

787
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:59,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Diane has a few things to say, so I'll let Diane speak.

788
01:24:00,857 --> 01:24:03,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can talk about morale, but I'll wait.

789
01:24:17,569 --> 01:24:20,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm starting out by saying I don't have her passion right now.

790
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:28,273
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want you to know that Julianne Anderson was a student when I was at the Dames School.

791
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Julianne were I?

792
01:24:33,174 --> 01:24:35,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to talk from an administrative point of view.

793
01:24:35,835 --> 01:24:39,676
[SPEAKER_08]: We, too, were very surprised by the comments that were made.

794
01:24:40,436 --> 01:24:45,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, Mr. Russo and I had an in-depth conversation about it a few days afterwards.

795
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:48,196
[SPEAKER_08]: and he apologized then as well.

796
01:24:49,678 --> 01:25:07,836
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want you to know, I want teachers to know, it is our sincere hope that you know that you're supported by the administrators, that we try to listen to the needs that you have in your classroom, and that we want to work with you on a regular basis.

797
01:25:09,315 --> 01:25:13,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Teachers in Medford worked tirelessly, coming in early and staying late.

798
01:25:14,117 --> 01:25:22,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And beyond the end of the day, teachers have also been in our schools on weekends and arrived way before the year began to set up their classrooms.

799
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I know because I've been in the classrooms, and I see them there during the summer.

800
01:25:28,762 --> 01:25:31,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a Medford teacher long before I was an administrator.

801
01:25:32,283 --> 01:25:35,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I was an elementary teacher at the Dames School, no longer here.

802
01:25:36,004 --> 01:25:38,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was a high school teacher at the Curtis Tufts.

803
01:25:39,085 --> 01:25:42,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So I walked 30 years in the teachers' shoes.

804
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:46,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I know and understood their frustration.

805
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:51,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford teachers are the backbone of the education, of our education.

806
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:57,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Their dedication, perseverance, day in and day out, make Medford great.

807
01:25:58,332 --> 01:25:58,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

808
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:12,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank you all for listening.

809
01:26:14,074 --> 01:26:16,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I mentioned the word morale.

810
01:26:17,675 --> 01:26:25,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to say that it is important for teachers to feel that they are appreciated and that they make a difference.

811
01:26:25,459 --> 01:26:26,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know they do.

812
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:28,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what out-of-pocket expenditures are.

813
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, we can only deduct $250 of it right on taxes, as you all know.

814
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're impassioned.

815
01:26:37,912 --> 01:26:40,133
[SPEAKER_09]: My teachers that spoke tonight obviously were impassioned.

816
01:26:40,273 --> 01:26:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: There were many who wanted to speak, but we limited it to four, and we tried to get a variety within that.

817
01:26:47,357 --> 01:26:48,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Morale is very important.

818
01:26:50,139 --> 01:27:00,084
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent and I have worked together on some issues concerning teacher morale.

819
01:27:01,445 --> 01:27:06,848
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some concerns that you will be hearing about regarding teacher morale through the grievance process.

820
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:15,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, there are things that, there are ways that you treat people, and how we treat them is extremely important.

821
01:27:16,616 --> 01:27:23,418
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sometimes when teachers are sick or ill, and that sickness is caused by anxiety or stress.

822
01:27:24,878 --> 01:27:33,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are times in this district where those teachers have been looked upon as not having a disability, but rather as having a weakness.

823
01:27:34,141 --> 01:27:36,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope that is resolved.

824
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:46,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that when someone loses a loved one and they take a bereavement day, that we remember that day.

825
01:27:47,284 --> 01:27:50,024
[SPEAKER_09]: You lose that loved one and you're putting in for that day.

826
01:27:50,564 --> 01:27:54,765
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you don't know, and I speak from experience, you don't know which end is up.

827
01:27:55,885 --> 01:27:59,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't ask me eight months later who died.

828
01:28:00,306 --> 01:28:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hot enough to do this.

829
01:28:04,187 --> 01:28:06,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And our payroll office is asking for that information.

830
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:16,227
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask you to treat my teachers with respect, and the same respect they give every single one of you.

831
01:28:17,129 --> 01:28:17,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

832
01:28:50,357 --> 01:28:51,258
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Ruggiero.

833
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

834
01:28:54,079 --> 01:29:00,503
[SPEAKER_04]: One issue I heard come up reputedly in your state, Charlene, was the professional development funds being rejected.

835
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you give me a sense of how often this happens?

836
01:29:04,045 --> 01:29:06,827
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time.

837
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:07,087
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

838
01:29:07,387 --> 01:29:16,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to know that most conferences I went to as a teacher, I think they were paid for maybe three in my 30, maybe five, all right, maybe six.

839
01:29:16,452 --> 01:29:17,493
[SPEAKER_09]: But no more than that.

840
01:29:17,773 --> 01:29:18,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid for my own.

841
01:29:19,294 --> 01:29:24,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid for all my own professional development, all my training, all of that.

842
01:29:25,237 --> 01:29:34,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say that this committee did approve in negotiations, you know, funding for college graduate credit, and that is being used like you can't believe.

843
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:35,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, Ms.

844
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:39,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Riccardelli, how many people did we have to turn away because we don't have enough funding?

845
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in the summer semester there probably

846
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,819
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 or 13 teachers that we couldn't even provide them with that.

847
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:52,462
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much every dime is being used and we need more.

848
01:29:53,283 --> 01:29:56,625
[SPEAKER_09]: These teachers want to... And the summer is when we do it.

849
01:29:57,326 --> 01:29:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be honest.

850
01:29:59,467 --> 01:30:01,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm teaching two online courses.

851
01:30:01,108 --> 01:30:02,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know who's in those courses?

852
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers.

853
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when they're doing it, during the summer months.

854
01:30:08,452 --> 01:30:14,256
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when they're learning about the theories of reading or the fundamentals of reading or the content-based reading.

855
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:15,897
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when they're doing it, the summer.

856
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:20,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So on a regular basis, it has been a struggle in Medford.

857
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:24,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not blaming the current administration, but it definitely has been a struggle within our district.

858
01:30:25,284 --> 01:30:26,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've asked for funding.

859
01:30:27,106 --> 01:30:29,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can ask the people on that PD committee.

860
01:30:29,527 --> 01:30:31,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to put you on the spot, Ms.

861
01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:32,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Audra Cashin, but I know you're here.

862
01:30:35,265 --> 01:30:40,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Audra, how much professional development would you say that we asked for and what was one of the main things that happened?

863
01:30:40,807 --> 01:30:45,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't sustain it.

864
01:30:54,952 --> 01:30:55,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did it.

865
01:30:55,572 --> 01:30:58,793
[SPEAKER_09]: The PD committee did the PD development.

866
01:30:58,833 --> 01:30:59,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not our job.

867
01:31:00,053 --> 01:31:00,853
[SPEAKER_09]: We're advisory.

868
01:31:01,433 --> 01:31:02,033
[SPEAKER_09]: We did it.

869
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:06,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Mitzi Galanti, myself, Liz, I can't remember who else.

870
01:31:06,154 --> 01:31:07,054
[SPEAKER_09]: There were so many of us.

871
01:31:07,434 --> 01:31:08,694
[SPEAKER_09]: We did that PD.

872
01:31:09,015 --> 01:31:09,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers came.

873
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:16,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Seventy-two teachers came and were excited and wanted more.

874
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:17,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And we presented it.

875
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:19,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't sustain it.

876
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:20,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer your question?

877
01:31:20,957 --> 01:31:21,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

878
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:22,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

879
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that we have a report on the percentage of professional development funds that are requested from us and what percentage we actually give to teachers.

880
01:31:35,905 --> 01:31:40,026
[SPEAKER_04]: As a former educator myself, I know how valuable professional development time is.

881
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:43,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to see that in writing as a report, please.

882
01:31:43,907 --> 01:31:47,388
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a motion on the floor for a report on people that have applied.

883
01:31:47,688 --> 01:31:51,549
[SPEAKER_04]: The percentage of teachers that have applied for professional development monies

884
01:31:52,998 --> 01:31:54,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I'd be able to pull that together.

885
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I really personally, I don't think you can pull that information.

886
01:31:58,281 --> 01:32:01,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Because once they apply, it's denied, it just goes away.

887
01:32:01,743 --> 01:32:02,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I'm saying?

888
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:15,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be more advantageous for us to determine how much money and what are we doing to make sure that the money is being provided to the teachers to get that professional development.

889
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:19,570
[SPEAKER_09]: We did that, and I think that's more realistic.

890
01:32:21,091 --> 01:32:22,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's more realistic.

891
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:24,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Do an analysis?

892
01:32:24,312 --> 01:32:25,992
[SPEAKER_31]: Superintendent will do an analysis.

893
01:32:26,652 --> 01:32:31,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, so if a teacher places, thank you, I mean I appreciate it, I just want to get a sense of what's happening.

894
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So if a teacher makes a request for a conference or a class in the summer, that teacher's application must still be on file somewhere, correct?

895
01:32:41,637 --> 01:32:43,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's rejected, or not?

896
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:59,461
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we may be talking about a couple of different things.

897
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:07,626
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is a tuition reimbursement program that began with the contract negotiations, I believe, two years ago.

898
01:33:07,646 --> 01:33:09,448
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're in the third or fourth year of that.

899
01:33:10,432 --> 01:33:11,674
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the fourth year of that.

900
01:33:11,914 --> 01:33:14,717
[SPEAKER_17]: And Charlene and I go through the applications together.

901
01:33:15,498 --> 01:33:18,242
[SPEAKER_17]: The amount is dictated by what is in the contract.

902
01:33:18,282 --> 01:33:23,768
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's $14,000 that's allocated for the summer semester, $13,000 for the fall semester, and $13,000 for the spring semester.

903
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:42,260
[SPEAKER_17]: So when someone does not get approved for that tuition reimbursement, it's either because the course doesn't qualify, because it's not a graduate level course, and or perhaps because it's first come, first serve.

904
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:52,287
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the case of it was either 12 or 13 who did not get tuition reimbursement for the summer semester, it was because of the date that their application came in.

905
01:33:53,414 --> 01:33:57,244
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe all of them had the qualifications.

906
01:33:57,488 --> 01:34:00,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that they passed the expiration date of the application.

907
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just they weren't the first in the door.

908
01:34:02,091 --> 01:34:02,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're saying?

909
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:03,732
[SPEAKER_17]: That is correct.

910
01:34:03,812 --> 01:34:05,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So the teachers applied properly.

911
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:07,915
[SPEAKER_17]: They applied properly.

912
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,356
[SPEAKER_17]: The deadline was May 1st.

913
01:34:10,036 --> 01:34:15,300
[SPEAKER_17]: In this case, we had some people apply as early as, I believe, it was the first week in February.

914
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:27,068
[SPEAKER_17]: So an application that came in, I believe, on April 23rd, even though it was in the window, was long in the line and they did not get approved for the funding.

915
01:34:27,624 --> 01:34:31,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's not an infinite amount of money, it's $14,000.

916
01:34:32,576 --> 01:34:36,526
[SPEAKER_17]: So we spend until we hit the limit that is in the contract.

917
01:34:37,357 --> 01:34:45,540
[SPEAKER_17]: What I think Charlene and I can say from the perspective of the PD committee, we are asking for more money.

918
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,221
[SPEAKER_17]: I've shared this with the administration.

919
01:34:47,701 --> 01:34:59,405
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking for more money to deliver PD to the teachers on PD days and on the days that we have conferences on the early release days and other in-district generated events.

920
01:35:01,233 --> 01:35:05,955
[SPEAKER_17]: That is different from the outside courses that teachers take at universities.

921
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:18,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want that to be clear, that when we talk about someone being rejected, it may be within the context of the tuition reimbursement program.

922
01:35:19,162 --> 01:35:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone, let's say they went to Mass General Hospital and they wanted to receive special training to help our dyslexic students, that wouldn't necessarily be covered.

923
01:35:28,192 --> 01:35:34,437
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mass General has its own college, which has a great reputation.

924
01:35:35,037 --> 01:35:36,859
[SPEAKER_17]: They offer graduate level courses.

925
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:53,432
[SPEAKER_17]: So if someone applies through tuition reimbursement, and we have approved that, and they apply and the money has not been exhausted because there haven't been so many people applying in front of them, then they'll get funded.

926
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:55,573
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a maximum of $1,000 per year per teacher.

927
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:02,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be very helpful to me just to, and thank you very much for this information.

928
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for sharing your concerns.

929
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:10,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that we can see something physical so we can actually move forward with an educated decision.

930
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:16,347
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have 100 teachers applying for 10 spots, that's unacceptable in my opinion.

931
01:36:19,389 --> 01:36:23,071
[SPEAKER_31]: Could you please come to the podium just so people can hear you?

932
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:25,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I think my voice is always strong enough.

933
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:25,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, I know it is.

934
01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:35,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think one of the things too, the teachers are speaking to is like conferences, for example, like the reading conference or the math conference and various conferences.

935
01:36:35,908 --> 01:36:38,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of us have put in for that and we don't even ask to be reimbursed.

936
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,731
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll pay for it ourselves.

937
01:36:39,771 --> 01:36:42,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We just want the day and they're denying us that professional day.

938
01:36:43,393 --> 01:36:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's happened with Liz, you spoke to the AP and Meredith, you know, yeah.

939
01:36:52,385 --> 01:36:56,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We end up going, many of us take personal days to do that.

940
01:36:56,869 --> 01:36:59,831
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't take sick days, but we do take personal days to do that.

941
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:01,232
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have been denied.

942
01:37:01,672 --> 01:37:03,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I'll let her just speak to you.

943
01:37:03,894 --> 01:37:04,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Liz Deneu.

944
01:37:04,975 --> 01:37:06,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I teach social studies at the high school.

945
01:37:06,616 --> 01:37:10,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really heard from the high school level yet, so I just thought I want to chime in for a minute.

946
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the content areas can be particularly challenging to get professional development.

947
01:37:15,582 --> 01:37:16,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a social studies teacher.

948
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:24,508
[SPEAKER_06]: It's frequently lumped in with literacy, but there are some very distinct issues coming up, specifically with civics and 21st century learning.

949
01:37:25,228 --> 01:37:35,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And my own experience has been as a teacher of advanced placement, and as someone who recently developed a new advanced placement course, I wanted to attend an advanced placement training.

950
01:37:36,354 --> 01:37:37,214
[SPEAKER_06]: They're costly.

951
01:37:37,795 --> 01:37:40,156
[SPEAKER_06]: They're typically held in faraway places.

952
01:37:40,216 --> 01:37:43,097
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I wanted to attend was in Las Vegas, and I thought, you know what?

953
01:37:43,678 --> 01:37:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: The district doesn't have the money and the resources to do that.

954
01:37:46,419 --> 01:37:51,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So one way that I tried to do a workaround was to actually apply to become an AP reader.

955
01:37:52,002 --> 01:37:54,683
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a reader, all of your expenses are paid.

956
01:37:55,578 --> 01:38:00,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go and you read exams and you also receive complimentary training from the AP board.

957
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:03,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can come back and sort of be a train the trainer, right?

958
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:09,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would have gone and I would have done the reader thing for human geography, which is a new course I'm teaching.

959
01:38:09,504 --> 01:38:16,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would have come back and provided professional development and resources to my own staff of, I think, 14 or 15 at the high school.

960
01:38:17,588 --> 01:38:24,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And then obviously gotten the opportunity to see exams written by students nationwide, which would have helped me prepare for my own students here in Medford.

961
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:36,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And regrettably, despite the fact that the conference would have been paid for, the expenses would have been paid for, there was a per diem for food, it was going to be held, I think, in Cincinnati this summer, it was denied.

962
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:44,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that I got from my building-based principal was, well, he just couldn't afford to have me out of the building for three days in June.

963
01:38:45,591 --> 01:38:48,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, we're talking about a conference day.

964
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:50,734
[SPEAKER_06]: There are permanent substitutes in the high school.

965
01:38:51,596 --> 01:38:55,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like the opportunity to get this information, and it's at no cost to the district.

966
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:02,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was at a time of year when, because I'm a teacher of mostly seniors, it would have been two periods that would have had to be covered.

967
01:39:03,066 --> 01:39:04,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just was an unfortunate thing.

968
01:39:04,668 --> 01:39:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand why it was done.

969
01:39:06,369 --> 01:39:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It was done because there was a policy in place where no one was going to be approved, and it was sort of a, you can't cherry pick, right?

970
01:39:11,574 --> 01:39:13,055
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to make it fair for everybody.

971
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:17,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel that the loss was greater than

972
01:39:18,957 --> 01:39:20,637
[SPEAKER_06]: the loss would have been for the two periods a day.

973
01:39:20,697 --> 01:39:23,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that's happening at least systemically in my building.

974
01:39:24,938 --> 01:39:38,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've taught AP Calculus, so I know it's not so much always just the mathematics, but it's also the ability and getting the educational instruction to teach at a high level to high school kids who are sort of in between being at college ready.

975
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:40,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know those classes are particularly challenging.

976
01:39:41,887 --> 01:39:47,191
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms, I would like to also, in addition to the report, I'd like to suggest that we review the policy in place.

977
01:39:47,672 --> 01:39:55,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, your particular case, it seems like we should be allowed a little bit of discernment, you know, especially for seniors in June.

978
01:39:55,137 --> 01:40:03,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking the benefit would have been pretty big to the system as a whole, and just to have that experience, to read the AP exams, see what they're looking for, go back and tell.

979
01:40:04,044 --> 01:40:06,626
[SPEAKER_04]: On our teacher, we have a huge AP offering in my school.

980
01:40:06,646 --> 01:40:07,927
It's one of the biggest in the Boston area.

981
01:40:08,488 --> 01:40:09,568
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's a lot of kids.

982
01:40:10,763 --> 01:40:11,123
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

983
01:40:11,763 --> 01:40:11,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

984
01:40:11,984 --> 01:40:12,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Kurtz.

985
01:40:12,724 --> 01:40:15,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, most of the questions were answered about the professional development.

986
01:40:15,985 --> 01:40:21,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I was curious as to why it was turned down when teachers had submitted for it.

987
01:40:21,528 --> 01:40:37,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there any type of grants that can be written to get additional funding for professional development that maybe that money could be pooled and accessed by the teachers for special conferences that they might want to go to

988
01:40:39,123 --> 01:40:43,888
[SPEAKER_11]: single-day events or evening events, or is that something that's already being done?

989
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:47,612
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we can always try to pursue grants.

990
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:58,403
[SPEAKER_37]: Off the top of my head, I couldn't say which particular grant funding would be able to support additional professional development, but I'm definitely not opposed to it.

991
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:06,381
[SPEAKER_31]: There is a motion on the floor by Mr. Ruggiero that a study come back on that topic.

992
01:41:06,921 --> 01:41:08,322
[SPEAKER_31]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

993
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:09,182
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

994
01:41:09,202 --> 01:41:09,762
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

995
01:41:09,942 --> 01:41:10,703
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

996
01:41:11,223 --> 01:41:11,903
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

997
01:41:12,363 --> 01:41:12,743
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

998
01:41:13,764 --> 01:41:15,805
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you all for being here this evening.

999
01:41:15,825 --> 01:41:16,425
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1000
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:17,625
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1001
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:18,206
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1002
01:41:18,246 --> 01:41:26,089
[SPEAKER_31]: You've got to keep moving.

1003
01:41:31,499 --> 01:41:32,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1004
01:41:36,081 --> 01:41:37,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Updates and comments.

1005
01:41:37,902 --> 01:41:39,603
We're doing PTOs now.

1006
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,250
[SPEAKER_31]: motion for suspension you want you want to say that Mia?

1007
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:05,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1008
01:42:05,733 --> 01:42:13,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Krentz is making a motion to move the Medford PTO and PTG's annual update out of order.

1009
01:42:13,078 --> 01:42:18,901
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a motion on the floor for suspension of the rules to take paper number seven out of order.

1010
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:20,662
[SPEAKER_31]: This is seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

1011
01:42:21,283 --> 01:42:22,163
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

1012
01:42:22,183 --> 01:42:22,984
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

1013
01:42:23,144 --> 01:42:23,944
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

1014
01:42:24,164 --> 01:42:25,025
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

1015
01:42:25,565 --> 01:42:29,708
[SPEAKER_31]: Item seven, report on Medford PTO PTG's annual update.

1016
01:42:56,095 --> 01:42:56,877
[SPEAKER_31]: We have to fix the thing.

1017
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:33,835
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

1018
01:43:33,856 --> 01:43:35,978
[SPEAKER_31]: Your name and address for our record please.

1019
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,060
[SPEAKER_31]: Whoever is speaking.

1020
01:43:55,724 --> 01:43:57,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Amber, is the podium microphone on?

1021
01:43:57,326 --> 01:43:57,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1022
01:44:00,228 --> 01:44:01,930
[SPEAKER_38]: Kathy's still on.

1023
01:44:06,975 --> 01:44:08,797
[SPEAKER_19]: The display to cast.

1024
01:44:22,845 --> 01:44:24,093
Is this what I should have done?

1025
01:45:25,516 --> 01:45:27,096
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, everyone, I think we're all set.

1026
01:45:27,136 --> 01:45:34,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent for inviting the four elementary school PTOs and PTGs to come and present tonight.

1027
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:37,778
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mayor Burke and members of the school committee for having us.

1028
01:45:38,438 --> 01:45:42,799
[SPEAKER_26]: We're here to present the annual reports for each of the four elementary school PTOs.

1029
01:45:43,459 --> 01:45:53,781
[SPEAKER_26]: As you may recall, the four PTOs began a fundraising collaboration in 2018, which became known as the Citywide Elementary PTO.

1030
01:45:54,443 --> 01:46:00,427
[SPEAKER_26]: At that time, and that relationship has gone so well, we decided to be efficient and present to you jointly tonight.

1031
01:46:01,507 --> 01:46:09,312
[SPEAKER_26]: We met for the first time in Jenny Graham's dining room last summer to talk about the ways that we could work together to support our four schools.

1032
01:46:09,552 --> 01:46:22,720
[SPEAKER_26]: And some of our goals that we talked about at that time were sort of developing relationships across the city and also developing ways that we could collaborate together to fundraise to support

1033
01:46:23,325 --> 01:46:26,567
[SPEAKER_26]: our PTOs and the sort of very important work that we're doing.

1034
01:46:26,928 --> 01:46:30,890
[SPEAKER_26]: We're having some trouble sliding over, so Rocco's helping me out here.

1035
01:46:32,491 --> 01:46:41,497
[SPEAKER_26]: But what I will tell you is that we have had several very successful fundraisers that I'll recap.

1036
01:46:41,778 --> 01:46:52,825
[SPEAKER_26]: And the goal really here was to both develop a relationship and also to fundraise to amplify the support that the PTOs are already providing and have historically provided

1037
01:46:53,246 --> 01:46:54,347
[SPEAKER_26]: to each of the schools.

1038
01:46:54,407 --> 01:47:03,911
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll be hearing a little bit more about what each PTO has done at their schools this year, but first let's recap the fundraising effort.

1039
01:47:04,311 --> 01:47:06,772
[SPEAKER_26]: This year we put on two fundraisers.

1040
01:47:07,753 --> 01:47:11,235
[SPEAKER_26]: In October we launched the Win a Disney Vacation Raffle.

1041
01:47:12,215 --> 01:47:19,178
[SPEAKER_26]: We offered a grand prize of a Disney vacation worth $5,000 cash, and there was a second place prize as well.

1042
01:47:19,579 --> 01:47:20,399
[SPEAKER_26]: Over the course of the

1043
01:47:20,772 --> 01:47:29,419
[SPEAKER_26]: two months, the group raised over $20,000, and each school received over $4,200 from the net proceeds.

1044
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:39,287
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a really great way to kick off the working relationship between the schools, across parent organizations, teachers, and working with the principals.

1045
01:47:39,907 --> 01:47:43,250
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much to all of the parents and student volunteers.

1046
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:49,255
[SPEAKER_26]: We had dozens and dozens of them helping us promote this raffle across the city throughout the fall.

1047
01:47:49,732 --> 01:47:52,375
[SPEAKER_26]: They put in hundreds of hours of work to make this a success.

1048
01:47:52,735 --> 01:47:57,660
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you also to Jenny Graham for serving as the co-chair of the event for me.

1049
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:03,246
[SPEAKER_26]: Our second fundraiser that we put off was the Harlem Wizards game in March.

1050
01:48:03,366 --> 01:48:11,334
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you to Cheryl Rodriguez, who I think is still here, for serving as the event chair and for all of your work, Cheryl, to kick off this event.

1051
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:15,683
[SPEAKER_26]: It was truly an event for kids and parents to remember alike.

1052
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:24,389
[SPEAKER_26]: On the day of the event, each of the four elementary schools had an in-school assembly with a visit from the Harlem Wizards basketball players.

1053
01:48:24,409 --> 01:48:28,451
[SPEAKER_26]: That was super exciting and we were thrilled that all of the students were able to participate.

1054
01:48:29,152 --> 01:48:34,715
[SPEAKER_26]: That evening, we had over 900 people attend the event, which was in the Medford High Gym.

1055
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:37,057
[SPEAKER_26]: They watched some fantastic basketball.

1056
01:48:37,657 --> 01:48:39,218
[SPEAKER_26]: They had a dance party at the end.

1057
01:48:39,298 --> 01:48:44,242
[SPEAKER_26]: We had parents and students there selling concessions and souvenirs and tickets and so forth.

1058
01:48:44,742 --> 01:48:47,465
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think the event was a tremendous success.

1059
01:48:47,805 --> 01:48:53,990
[SPEAKER_26]: Each school raised over $2,600 in net proceeds from that particular event.

1060
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:58,413
[SPEAKER_26]: As you can see on our slide presentation, there were many, many organizations.

1061
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:08,156
[SPEAKER_26]: and people who were involved, local businesses, we're not going to name all of them, but this was really, I think, truly an excellent first year collaboration.

1062
01:49:09,017 --> 01:49:14,199
[SPEAKER_26]: We've already been working on our plans for next year based on how successful this year has been.

1063
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:25,386
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to be sure that this collaboration can keep moving forward with a clear scope, one that best manages our goals and our potential growth based on the volunteer capacity that we have.

1064
01:49:25,406 --> 01:49:27,707
[SPEAKER_26]: We're all parent volunteers, teacher volunteers,

1065
01:49:28,397 --> 01:49:34,002
[SPEAKER_26]: who are really thrilled to put in this time to grow this collaboration.

1066
01:49:34,883 --> 01:49:47,253
[SPEAKER_26]: We've met a few times to discuss how this year went, how to talk about the operating norms that we have and what we would like to put into place for next year to make sure that we can continue to grow

1067
01:49:48,137 --> 01:49:50,098
[SPEAKER_26]: and manage our fundraisers successfully.

1068
01:49:50,758 --> 01:49:59,820
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the exciting things that each of the four PTOs is currently reviewing a memorandum of understanding between the four elementary schools.

1069
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:11,342
[SPEAKER_26]: That's currently in draft form, but one of the really exciting things is that we proposed a name that we think more officially suits who we are, the Citywide Elementary Alliance.

1070
01:50:12,302 --> 01:50:16,103
[SPEAKER_26]: And so now I'm going to turn it over to the representatives from each PTO

1071
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:20,504
[SPEAKER_26]: in the Alliance to talk about their school's efforts this year.

1072
01:50:20,564 --> 01:50:20,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1073
01:50:27,973 --> 01:50:28,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi again.

1074
01:50:28,733 --> 01:50:36,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to talk about some of the activity that we've done this year at the Brooks, and I want to start by saying a huge thank you to this committee.

1075
01:50:36,941 --> 01:50:37,822
[SPEAKER_22]: for their support.

1076
01:50:38,262 --> 01:50:40,444
[SPEAKER_22]: This is our second year presenting to you guys.

1077
01:50:41,044 --> 01:50:47,890
[SPEAKER_22]: And last year we talked at length about the state of the grounds at the Brooks specifically and also across the city.

1078
01:50:49,311 --> 01:50:56,117
[SPEAKER_22]: And that picture on the lower right is a picture of our new field, which we were able to break in just in time for field day.

1079
01:50:56,217 --> 01:50:58,479
[SPEAKER_22]: And it has truly been a game changer.

1080
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:06,005
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you to this committee for all the support that you provided and to the mayor for helping make this happen in collaboration with the PTO.

1081
01:51:07,735 --> 01:51:08,755
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're back this year.

1082
01:51:10,196 --> 01:51:25,979
[SPEAKER_22]: And what we decided to do as a collaborative group is talk a little bit about what has been going on in our buildings this year, but also try to be efficient in the things that we want to talk to you about for consideration, because they truly are shared concerns.

1083
01:51:26,099 --> 01:51:37,181
[SPEAKER_22]: So we sort of decided to divvy things up, but I want to say that from a perspective of what happens in the Brooks building, we 100% support what you'll hear from all the rest of the schools in terms

1084
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:43,618
[SPEAKER_22]: what their priorities and concerns are for you guys to consider, and I think that goes kind of all around the four elementary schools.

1085
01:51:43,658 --> 01:51:46,140
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all very lined in sort of what the opportunities are.

1086
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:55,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Our leadership team changes every year, and so this year we welcomed Mitzi Galante to the co-chair position, and Mike Allen will be cycling off for a bit.

1087
01:51:56,786 --> 01:52:04,911
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have a new monitor because our monitor only serves for one year at a time, and the rest of the committee stays in place for next year through an election process.

1088
01:52:07,313 --> 01:52:11,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Our spending recap looks a lot like what it has looked like in past years.

1089
01:52:12,177 --> 01:52:13,838
[SPEAKER_22]: On the left side, you see the recurring costs.

1090
01:52:13,878 --> 01:52:15,500
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's things like in-school enrichment.

1091
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:20,343
[SPEAKER_22]: And we divvy up the enrichment budget across all of the grades.

1092
01:52:20,403 --> 01:52:28,670
[SPEAKER_22]: So there is the same amount of money being spent, albeit perhaps different amounts of things happening in the different school grades.

1093
01:52:29,711 --> 01:52:32,493
[SPEAKER_22]: We support field trips and teacher supplies, which are

1094
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:41,770
[SPEAKER_22]: sort of the next significant component of our budget, field day, library resources quite specifically, and then sort of a hodgepodge of additional items.

1095
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:49,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Last year we talked to you about establishing our version of a grants committee process, which is really a process for the community to talk to us about.

1096
01:52:49,764 --> 01:52:56,288
[SPEAKER_22]: what they think is important and how we might spend money when we are able to raise in excess of our operating budget.

1097
01:52:57,028 --> 01:53:12,077
[SPEAKER_22]: This year we authorized $5,000 in spending, and that money will be spent across Chromebooks, reading intervention and teacher resources, coding mice for the technology classes, phys ed equipment, and stage and performance equipment.

1098
01:53:12,818 --> 01:53:18,181
[SPEAKER_22]: The field remediation contribution also happened in this fiscal year, so it's on there, but that's sort of

1099
01:53:19,133 --> 01:53:21,294
[SPEAKER_22]: happened in the middle of the summer, so it doesn't have a great home.

1100
01:53:24,476 --> 01:53:27,238
[SPEAKER_22]: So far this year, we've raised about $45,000.

1101
01:53:27,578 --> 01:53:42,268
[SPEAKER_22]: About 10% of those funds are generated from corporate sponsors, and the remaining 90% is raised across a variety of events that happen in our community, particularly with event attendance and activity participation.

1102
01:53:43,303 --> 01:53:45,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Fall Fest is one of our biggest fundraisers.

1103
01:53:45,732 --> 01:53:48,702
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already set the date for next year on October 20th.

1104
01:53:49,988 --> 01:53:56,514
[SPEAKER_22]: And the read-a-thon trivia night and our annual talent show are the biggest sources of fundraising for our community.

1105
01:53:57,675 --> 01:54:06,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Other than that, we do talk about favorites like our ice cream social, our open mic nights, which are really amazing.

1106
01:54:06,202 --> 01:54:10,165
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm always so shocked at how fearless little kids are in front of a microphone.

1107
01:54:12,006 --> 01:54:18,552
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's lots of other things that we do across the year, but we really try to create a balance of events from a fundraising standpoint so there is truly something for everybody.

1108
01:54:20,518 --> 01:54:36,733
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things that I wanted to talk about tonight from a consideration perspective is that, especially hearing a lot of the conversation already this evening about English language arts reading support, the libraries at the elementary level are woefully understaffed.

1109
01:54:37,594 --> 01:54:45,762
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a part-time librarian that supports four elementary schools, and it is near impossible for her to make any forward progress.

1110
01:54:46,627 --> 01:54:51,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I think there are three issues in the library as I see them and as we have discussed sort of as a PTO.

1111
01:54:52,530 --> 01:55:01,575
[SPEAKER_22]: One is that a part-time person cannot possibly support four elementary schools, that an identifiable library curriculum does not exist at all grade levels.

1112
01:55:02,475 --> 01:55:12,040
[SPEAKER_22]: And frankly, it's unfair to think that our part-time resource is going to ever have the capacity to build a meaningful curriculum for the library given

1113
01:55:12,813 --> 01:55:17,455
[SPEAKER_22]: the huge administrative burden that she carries in her part-time capacity across four schools.

1114
01:55:18,156 --> 01:55:28,581
[SPEAKER_22]: And the third thing, and I would say sort of this is in order of importance, but the third thing is that there is no meaningful budget from the district to purchase new library books.

1115
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:38,066
[SPEAKER_22]: So when the science curriculum rolls out, how is the library being sourced with books that are relevant and appropriate to that activity?

1116
01:55:38,187 --> 01:55:40,908
[SPEAKER_22]: And what does happen in practice is that

1117
01:55:41,312 --> 01:55:46,757
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, PTOs like ourselves and I think all the other elementary school PTOs provide lots of support in that area.

1118
01:55:47,777 --> 01:55:53,282
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's sort of a parent-driven approach versus an educator curriculum-driven approach.

1119
01:55:53,422 --> 01:55:55,544
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think there's a lot of opportunity in the library.

1120
01:55:57,165 --> 01:56:06,213
[SPEAKER_22]: Even if we could get to two headcounts so that each librarian could focus on two buildings, it would be a light year of difference from what happens today.

1121
01:56:06,273 --> 01:56:09,195
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the poor librarian, Ms.

1122
01:56:09,235 --> 01:56:10,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Lannan, is just

1123
01:56:10,850 --> 01:56:16,771
[SPEAKER_22]: driving all over the city, covering people who are out, trying to handle all the administrative activity in each of the buildings.

1124
01:56:16,851 --> 01:56:28,953
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think when we talk about English language performance, a real meaningful library experience in a building can really be a game changer for kids who are struggling.

1125
01:56:29,433 --> 01:56:38,415
[SPEAKER_22]: And somebody who can help them learn to love to read on their own and for pleasure can be a really important aspect of what needs to happen to kind of bring those kids along.

1126
01:56:39,872 --> 01:56:42,754
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to turn it over to the Columbus now for their report.

1127
01:56:48,178 --> 01:56:48,519
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello.

1128
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,800
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Ingrid Moncada.

1129
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:52,362
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a resident.

1130
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:53,723
[SPEAKER_35]: I have three kids in the Columbus School.

1131
01:56:53,903 --> 01:56:55,124
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a part of the PTO board.

1132
01:56:55,304 --> 01:56:56,385
[SPEAKER_35]: This is Christina.

1133
01:56:57,145 --> 01:56:58,466
[SPEAKER_35]: She's also part of the PTO board.

1134
01:56:58,526 --> 01:57:01,709
[SPEAKER_35]: We both do enrichment in the PTO board.

1135
01:57:04,471 --> 01:57:04,731
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

1136
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:11,617
[SPEAKER_35]: Basically we have different committees, fundraising, enrichment, grants, writing, and events.

1137
01:57:12,278 --> 01:57:14,981
[SPEAKER_35]: And right now our board is eight people.

1138
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:23,190
[SPEAKER_35]: They usually stay for at least two years, and then we vote for new members of the board at the end of the year.

1139
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:25,333
[SPEAKER_35]: So this week we'll vote for new members.

1140
01:57:31,732 --> 01:57:40,340
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, so the focus of our spending is enrichment, also supporting the teacher staff, and also doing community events.

1141
01:57:41,381 --> 01:57:44,785
[SPEAKER_35]: So most of the spending is in school enrichment.

1142
01:57:45,706 --> 01:57:50,711
[SPEAKER_35]: We have activities per grade, and then we also have assemblies for the whole school.

1143
01:57:51,772 --> 01:57:52,933
[SPEAKER_35]: We also do field trips.

1144
01:57:53,093 --> 01:57:54,835
[SPEAKER_35]: We try to do two field trips per grade.

1145
01:57:56,544 --> 01:57:58,526
[SPEAKER_35]: We do a fun day in June coming up.

1146
01:57:58,706 --> 01:58:03,230
[SPEAKER_35]: It's an all-day event when we have a performance and then outdoor activities for the whole school.

1147
01:58:04,371 --> 01:58:05,972
[SPEAKER_35]: We spend some money on teacher supplies.

1148
01:58:06,092 --> 01:58:12,637
[SPEAKER_35]: We do some school events and then other administration expenses.

1149
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:26,526
[SPEAKER_16]: For this year, this is a recap of the grants we were awarded.

1150
01:58:27,287 --> 01:58:37,202
[SPEAKER_16]: To supplement what we fundraise, the grant writing committee reaches out to get outside grant funding so we don't always have to burden our school community.

1151
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:45,495
[SPEAKER_16]: So for this school year, we received two Medford Art Council grants, both were for cultural enrichments.

1152
01:58:46,676 --> 01:58:57,803
[SPEAKER_16]: We also received the Arts Alive Medford grant for a third grade songwriting project, which is with local musicians who have done this project at other schools and were able to bring it to our school this year.

1153
01:58:58,383 --> 01:59:05,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we also got the Tufts Neighborhood Fund grant, which we're using to enrich our science night.

1154
01:59:05,107 --> 01:59:07,529
[SPEAKER_16]: We were able to use the money to offer free food

1155
01:59:08,263 --> 01:59:09,504
[SPEAKER_16]: for the event, which is nice.

1156
01:59:10,905 --> 01:59:17,250
[SPEAKER_16]: And also we were able to give the teachers some money to use for their class presentations.

1157
01:59:21,334 --> 01:59:25,557
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, so this year we fundraised about $38,000.

1158
01:59:25,997 --> 01:59:32,763
[SPEAKER_35]: This includes all the contributions from the citywide events that they talked about before.

1159
01:59:34,143 --> 01:59:34,983
[SPEAKER_35]: There's different sources.

1160
01:59:35,064 --> 01:59:37,305
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have community events.

1161
01:59:37,345 --> 01:59:38,745
[SPEAKER_35]: We also have direct donations.

1162
01:59:39,766 --> 01:59:44,228
[SPEAKER_35]: And we did the read-a-thon, just like the other schools did.

1163
01:59:44,748 --> 01:59:45,888
[SPEAKER_35]: We have book fairs.

1164
01:59:45,988 --> 01:59:47,989
[SPEAKER_35]: We have the election day bake sale.

1165
01:59:48,029 --> 01:59:58,854
[SPEAKER_35]: We have restaurant nights and a few other things to try to do different fundraiser things so then every parent can pick whatever they want to do instead of doing everything.

1166
02:00:01,295 --> 02:00:02,536
[SPEAKER_35]: We also have community events.

1167
02:00:09,022 --> 02:00:10,042
[SPEAKER_35]: We have an asking social.

1168
02:00:10,062 --> 02:00:13,904
[SPEAKER_35]: We have about maybe four movie nights a year.

1169
02:00:13,924 --> 02:00:20,527
[SPEAKER_35]: We do, at the beginning of the year, we do a welcome play date and we do back to school scavenger hunt.

1170
02:00:20,967 --> 02:00:25,910
[SPEAKER_35]: We have a giving thanks event in November that is really, really successful.

1171
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:26,510
[SPEAKER_35]: It's really fun.

1172
02:00:34,994 --> 02:00:36,594
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, I'm just going to go in different order.

1173
02:00:37,935 --> 02:00:40,116
[SPEAKER_35]: Because the other thing that I want to talk about is the clubs.

1174
02:00:40,236 --> 02:00:41,517
[SPEAKER_35]: So we do after school clubs.

1175
02:00:43,498 --> 02:00:44,639
[SPEAKER_35]: We call them enrichment clubs.

1176
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:47,240
[SPEAKER_35]: And we have four sessions a year.

1177
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:51,062
[SPEAKER_35]: We have in the fall, then the winter, and we have two sessions in the spring.

1178
02:00:51,922 --> 02:00:55,044
[SPEAKER_35]: And in this year, we did about 40 different clubs.

1179
02:00:55,844 --> 02:01:02,908
[SPEAKER_35]: And our focus is so we want as many students as possible to join these clubs.

1180
02:01:03,516 --> 02:01:08,699
[SPEAKER_35]: So we try to do the modest price, and we also have a flexible fee.

1181
02:01:08,859 --> 02:01:11,760
[SPEAKER_35]: So we offer scholarships for the kids who cannot afford clubs.

1182
02:01:13,221 --> 02:01:14,702
[SPEAKER_35]: The clubs are also self-funded.

1183
02:01:14,782 --> 02:01:28,469
[SPEAKER_35]: So we accept donations specifically for clubs, and we ask for the fees such that all the other fundraising events in the PTO, they don't have to fund the clubs, because we can fund them just by fees and donations.

1184
02:01:32,521 --> 02:01:40,608
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh yeah, we have under 40 clubs, that means each club runs with one or two volunteers per club.

1185
02:01:40,668 --> 02:01:45,372
[SPEAKER_35]: There's a lot of parent involvement and a lot of volunteers that make these clubs possible.

1186
02:01:47,153 --> 02:01:50,877
[SPEAKER_35]: We do grant writing, like Cristina was talking about, for enrichment activities.

1187
02:01:50,957 --> 02:01:54,660
[SPEAKER_35]: It's mostly for assemblies and for big things.

1188
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,619
[SPEAKER_35]: We do enrichment for field trips.

1189
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:03,182
[SPEAKER_35]: And we also do major support for school library resources.

1190
02:02:03,623 --> 02:02:07,045
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have a lot of parent volunteers in the library that help at the library.

1191
02:02:07,185 --> 02:02:08,706
[SPEAKER_35]: And we do two book fairs a year.

1192
02:02:09,347 --> 02:02:16,592
[SPEAKER_35]: And this year, we were able to purchase 200 books for teachers and library, which I

1193
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:19,282
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it's a great accomplishment.

1194
02:02:19,963 --> 02:02:29,764
[SPEAKER_35]: And also, this is our first year as a 501c3 organization, so that was a transition process because we needed to learn a lot of things to make it possible.

1195
02:02:29,804 --> 02:02:33,885
[SPEAKER_35]: I think all the other elementary schools already had that, and this is just a new thing for us.

1196
02:02:35,946 --> 02:02:36,566
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, that's it.

1197
02:02:37,946 --> 02:02:43,327
[SPEAKER_35]: We didn't have a slide to talk about the issues that we wanted to bring out to the school committee.

1198
02:02:44,085 --> 02:02:54,173
[SPEAKER_35]: time to do it, but we do think that the building grounds and the playground need some work.

1199
02:02:55,094 --> 02:03:08,965
[SPEAKER_35]: I didn't have a picture of it, but our playground is really not usable right now, not only the surface, but the playground equipment and the structures are just broken, and it's sometimes dangerous for the kids to play, and it really, really needs work.

1200
02:03:12,384 --> 02:03:21,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I just was going to say that in the last few years, what I noticed is things will break, and they'll either just stay broken, or they'll just be taken away.

1201
02:03:21,746 --> 02:03:23,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's sometimes after someone gets hurt.

1202
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:28,068
[SPEAKER_16]: So there was a glider, and it was just a broken glider.

1203
02:03:28,588 --> 02:03:33,889
[SPEAKER_16]: And then someone got hurt, and then the metal got taken away, but nothing was replaced for it.

1204
02:03:33,969 --> 02:03:38,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Same thing with another structure that was a wobbly climbing structure.

1205
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:41,391
[SPEAKER_16]: It got so wobbly, a parent hurt herself,

1206
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:43,911
[SPEAKER_16]: then that structure just like disappeared.

1207
02:03:44,331 --> 02:03:56,055
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would just be nice to see, you know, that there were people responsible for like checking the grounds and so things could, and actually fixing things also.

1208
02:03:57,136 --> 02:04:08,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And in a timely manner, because we've had, like we had a whole winter, or I should say like a fall through winter without a slide, because there was a crack in the slide and we appreciated that it was getting fixed,

1209
02:04:09,937 --> 02:04:16,362
[SPEAKER_16]: it was just unusable and slightly dangerous because there was like a cinder block propping up plastic.

1210
02:04:17,764 --> 02:04:19,665
[SPEAKER_16]: That's probably one of the issues.

1211
02:04:19,705 --> 02:04:21,767
[SPEAKER_35]: That's one of our big concerns, yes.

1212
02:04:21,847 --> 02:04:24,950
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, turn it over to Maglene.

1213
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:25,370
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1214
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:26,351
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you so much.

1215
02:04:31,815 --> 02:04:38,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, my name is Bailey Shindell and I'm excited to be here tonight as a representative of the McGlynn Elementary PTG.

1216
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:43,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, our organization went through a huge overhaul.

1217
02:04:43,932 --> 02:04:50,355
[SPEAKER_12]: We rewrote our bylaws to bring back a committee structure and restructured our executive board.

1218
02:04:50,895 --> 02:04:57,678
[SPEAKER_12]: This year has been about building a foundation for a strong parent-teacher organization for the McGlynn community.

1219
02:04:58,418 --> 02:05:00,139
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a lot of help in this venture.

1220
02:05:00,789 --> 02:05:07,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank all the volunteers who have worked tirelessly to make this year a success for our students and community.

1221
02:05:08,034 --> 02:05:14,919
[SPEAKER_12]: This includes our executive board, committee leadership, the teachers, and everybody who's just been willing to show up for us.

1222
02:05:15,559 --> 02:05:22,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to specifically thank Renee Hanley, who has basically lived at the McGlynn doing the good work at the PTG this year.

1223
02:05:24,065 --> 02:05:28,848
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to take a moment to recognize the efforts of the Citywide Elementary Alliance.

1224
02:05:29,449 --> 02:05:40,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only did working with this group help us to meet our financial goals for the year, but the members of this group were an invaluable source of information and support for the PTG.

1225
02:05:41,476 --> 02:05:46,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I am so proud to be part of this group who is working to add value for all Medford students.

1226
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:53,164
[SPEAKER_12]: The PTG is committed to bringing enrichment opportunities to the community

1227
02:05:53,826 --> 02:05:54,467
[SPEAKER_12]: at the McGlynn.

1228
02:05:55,027 --> 02:06:05,298
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, 78% of our spending was on student enrichment, which includes field trips, in-school presentations, fun day, and after-school programs.

1229
02:06:05,959 --> 02:06:12,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Another 13% of our spending has gone to community outreach, which includes our teacher-driven projects program.

1230
02:06:13,206 --> 02:06:20,408
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we started giving small grants of $200 to promote innovation and engage teachers in the community.

1231
02:06:21,049 --> 02:06:25,170
[SPEAKER_12]: This program has been successful in bringing many of our teachers' ideas to life.

1232
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:28,631
[SPEAKER_12]: We supported flexible seating in classrooms, Ms.

1233
02:06:28,711 --> 02:06:30,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Lasky's hydroponics garden, Ms.

1234
02:06:31,012 --> 02:06:32,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Smock's 3D printing project,

1235
02:06:33,873 --> 02:06:40,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Grants have also been used to add math games to the kindergarten classrooms and games for students to play during lunch.

1236
02:06:40,781 --> 02:06:46,768
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope to continue this program next year and bring more of our teachers' creativity into the classrooms.

1237
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:55,035
[SPEAKER_12]: At the beginning of the year, the PTT decided to raise the field trip budget from $10 to $15 per student.

1238
02:06:55,696 --> 02:07:00,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Our hope was this would help to create more opportunities for out-of-building student enrichment.

1239
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:10,489
[SPEAKER_12]: We set the goal of raising an additional $5,000 this year so that we could get the field trip budget up to $20 per student for the 2019-2020 school year.

1240
02:07:13,376 --> 02:07:16,761
[SPEAKER_12]: With the help of the Citywide Alliance, we have reached this goal.

1241
02:07:17,622 --> 02:07:25,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Other notable McGlynn fundraisers are our family fund nights, which have the dual purpose of raising money and bringing together our community.

1242
02:07:26,494 --> 02:07:30,380
[SPEAKER_12]: The McGlynn has also had its first read-a-thon this year.

1243
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:36,988
[SPEAKER_12]: We were pleased to have 114 students participate, which was higher than we expected for our first time out.

1244
02:07:37,589 --> 02:07:37,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr.

1245
02:07:37,949 --> 02:07:38,510
[SPEAKER_12]: G.S.'

1246
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:43,617
[SPEAKER_12]: 's class read 7,238 minutes to win a pizza party.

1247
02:07:44,498 --> 02:07:49,084
[SPEAKER_12]: These are just a few of the many events and fundraisers our organization has sponsored.

1248
02:07:51,052 --> 02:07:53,915
[SPEAKER_12]: There are many things for us to be proud of this year.

1249
02:07:54,115 --> 02:08:01,262
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already mentioned the raise in the field trip budget, the read-a-thon, and the teacher-driven projects program.

1250
02:08:01,942 --> 02:08:06,827
[SPEAKER_12]: We have also launched a website to keep our community informed by giving them weekly updates.

1251
02:08:07,287 --> 02:08:13,273
[SPEAKER_12]: We ensured that each grade went on at least one field trip and had at least one in-school presentation.

1252
02:08:13,753 --> 02:08:20,739
[SPEAKER_12]: We recruited room parents for every classroom, and we started bringing after-school enrichment to the McGlynn students.

1253
02:08:21,279 --> 02:08:25,042
[SPEAKER_12]: We piloted the Escape the Classroom Math program with Michael's help.

1254
02:08:25,622 --> 02:08:29,245
[SPEAKER_12]: And we brought in Playwell for a Lego club.

1255
02:08:29,806 --> 02:08:36,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing teachers and parents pool together to make all this possible gives me optimism for the PTG's future.

1256
02:08:38,678 --> 02:08:44,061
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the challenges we have faced this year is the raising prices of school buses for field trips.

1257
02:08:44,561 --> 02:08:50,844
[SPEAKER_12]: In September, the first graders were able to go to Smollick Farms for the cost of $800.

1258
02:08:51,124 --> 02:08:55,626
[SPEAKER_12]: This month, the first graders went to the Children's Museum for $1,005.

1259
02:08:58,625 --> 02:09:00,206
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just the bus cost.

1260
02:09:00,906 --> 02:09:06,910
[SPEAKER_12]: When talking to teachers, we have noticed that the base rate for the bus has increased at least $10 a year.

1261
02:09:07,370 --> 02:09:15,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally, it seems that there is inconsistent pricing for buses accessible for people with disabilities and extended hours.

1262
02:09:16,095 --> 02:09:18,416
[SPEAKER_12]: There are also complaints about the bus service.

1263
02:09:18,696 --> 02:09:26,061
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, the September trip to Small Oak Farms, one of the buses left with the student lunches on it.

1264
02:09:27,195 --> 02:09:32,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Those students had to wait over a half hour to have their lunches when we were already on a tight schedule.

1265
02:09:33,523 --> 02:09:44,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Over 50% of our field trip budget this year has gone to pay for buses, and this does not take into account that some grades have received grants to help defer bus costs.

1266
02:09:44,912 --> 02:09:51,817
[SPEAKER_12]: My question to you, the school committee, is what can we do about the monopoly Eastern Buses has on our field trip travel?

1267
02:09:52,438 --> 02:09:54,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there other transportation options?

1268
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:57,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we negotiate some kind of reduced rate?

1269
02:09:57,982 --> 02:10:03,646
[SPEAKER_12]: How can we spend more of our fundraised money on student enrichment and not just transportation?

1270
02:10:04,866 --> 02:10:10,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank the school committee for taking the time to listen and being a huge support for the McGlynn community.

1271
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:15,413
[SPEAKER_12]: The McGlynn Elementary looks forward to working closely with the school for the years to come.

1272
02:10:15,453 --> 02:10:15,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1273
02:10:24,298 --> 02:10:26,820
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I'm Melissa Maywell and this is Melissa DeMeo.

1274
02:10:28,157 --> 02:10:30,559
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, and we're both from the Roberts.

1275
02:10:34,201 --> 02:10:38,564
[SPEAKER_34]: First thing, we just wanted to show a nice slide of our new playground surface.

1276
02:10:39,224 --> 02:10:44,147
[SPEAKER_34]: And again, thanks to Cheryl and the CPA for the transformation.

1277
02:10:44,187 --> 02:10:46,369
[SPEAKER_34]: If you haven't seen it, come on down and check it out.

1278
02:10:46,389 --> 02:10:48,470
[SPEAKER_34]: It's nice, it's bouncy, it's clean.

1279
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:50,611
[SPEAKER_34]: The kids love it, it's safe.

1280
02:10:51,852 --> 02:10:57,316
[SPEAKER_34]: So we're very excited about that and we hope that all the other elementary schools will also get the same

1281
02:10:58,875 --> 02:11:05,040
[SPEAKER_34]: surface redone and for safety mainly, and also just to make sure we have equity among the schools.

1282
02:11:07,741 --> 02:11:11,364
[SPEAKER_34]: The first, so this is our leadership team.

1283
02:11:11,404 --> 02:11:13,446
[SPEAKER_34]: We have seven people on the executive board.

1284
02:11:14,306 --> 02:11:14,506
[SPEAKER_34]: Ms.

1285
02:11:14,546 --> 02:11:17,749
[SPEAKER_34]: McKay is our teacher liaison, and we have some event chairs.

1286
02:11:18,109 --> 02:11:23,573
[SPEAKER_34]: And we have lots and lots and lots of volunteers, so it can't happen without all of our volunteers.

1287
02:11:24,934 --> 02:11:25,774
[SPEAKER_34]: Anything else on this?

1288
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:33,344
[SPEAKER_34]: So for our spending recap, in-school enrichment, we have about 16%.

1289
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:38,670
[SPEAKER_34]: If you want to know the numbers, I can always send that to you.

1290
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:39,250
[SPEAKER_34]: It was over $3,000.

1291
02:11:44,841 --> 02:12:09,633
[SPEAKER_34]: We got anything from the Museum of Science to come, author visits, Curious Creatures, Zoo New England, the Hands on History presentation regarding the American Revolutionary War, Mass Horticultural Society, plant mobile program, a puppet theater, just to kind of give you an idea of what enrichment that ties into the school curriculum that comes into our schools.

1292
02:12:10,153 --> 02:12:15,414
[SPEAKER_34]: The field trips, the transportation, we estimate over $6,000 for buses.

1293
02:12:16,654 --> 02:12:18,095
[SPEAKER_34]: Teachers, staff, supplies.

1294
02:12:19,295 --> 02:12:26,176
[SPEAKER_34]: We've bought many supplies, and we actually may have to look into expanding that, unless there's room in the budget, hopefully.

1295
02:12:26,956 --> 02:12:30,917
[SPEAKER_34]: Because a lot of times, the teachers will put out and ask parents to bring in things.

1296
02:12:31,337 --> 02:12:35,058
[SPEAKER_34]: So that typically is what... Well, they won't ask them to bring in things.

1297
02:12:36,699 --> 02:12:46,502
[SPEAKER_34]: Notice that there's certain things needed and the parents will bring it in like tissues or anything like toilet paper rolls, simple things like that.

1298
02:12:49,277 --> 02:13:09,482
[SPEAKER_34]: And for books, we actually do really well in our book fair, and we used $6,878 in scholastic dollars to buy books for our library, classrooms, a birthday book for every child in the school, and some books for the fifth graders on their reading list.

1299
02:13:10,822 --> 02:13:15,125
[SPEAKER_34]: And also, you know, teacher-staff appreciation and lots of other little things that happen.

1300
02:13:16,566 --> 02:13:29,173
[SPEAKER_34]: We also bought iPads this year, and primarily they're for any supplement that the kindergarten teachers may want for their activities.

1301
02:13:30,854 --> 02:13:31,714
[SPEAKER_34]: And we have rugs.

1302
02:13:31,994 --> 02:13:35,836
[SPEAKER_34]: We actually bought seven rugs, and that cost was over $3,000.

1303
02:13:35,876 --> 02:13:38,178
[SPEAKER_34]: No, no, no, it was over, like,

1304
02:13:39,832 --> 02:13:46,998
[SPEAKER_34]: 2,600.

1305
02:13:41,293 --> 02:13:46,998
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think we discussed this a little bit, but these rugs had never been changed.

1306
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:49,401
[SPEAKER_34]: And teachers will buy their own rugs.

1307
02:13:49,701 --> 02:13:50,762
[SPEAKER_34]: And they're just disgusting.

1308
02:13:50,782 --> 02:13:56,707
[SPEAKER_34]: And these are kindergarten kids that they spend 90% of their time on these rugs.

1309
02:13:56,948 --> 02:13:59,170
[SPEAKER_34]: And cleaning was not going to change them.

1310
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:01,191
[SPEAKER_34]: And actually,

1311
02:14:02,753 --> 02:14:08,519
[SPEAKER_34]: I think Cheryl started a GoFund for it and then we decided to chip in and get rugs.

1312
02:14:09,259 --> 02:14:10,601
[SPEAKER_34]: And then the other teachers want them too.

1313
02:14:11,201 --> 02:14:14,825
[SPEAKER_34]: So we have to see, look at our budget and see if we can do that.

1314
02:14:14,865 --> 02:14:22,793
[SPEAKER_34]: But also if that's something maintenance can do or I'm not sure what really the school committee could do for that.

1315
02:14:23,869 --> 02:14:36,055
[SPEAKER_34]: We've gotten a bunch of grants, Medford Arts Council for trombones for $700, for Art Night for $650, for a songwriting workshop for $1,000.

1316
02:14:36,515 --> 02:14:44,980
[SPEAKER_34]: And we've also got Tufts Neighborhood Service Project, $250 for Field Day, and Science Night in the fall, we got $500.

1317
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:49,222
[SPEAKER_34]: Let me see, I'll go next.

1318
02:14:51,802 --> 02:14:55,363
[SPEAKER_34]: So our fundraisers, we actually did amazing at Jingle Bell.

1319
02:14:55,503 --> 02:14:56,984
[SPEAKER_34]: We got close to $10,000.

1320
02:14:57,464 --> 02:15:02,746
[SPEAKER_34]: So besides the Wizard and the raffles, that's our highest fundraiser and big community event.

1321
02:15:03,206 --> 02:15:05,367
[SPEAKER_34]: Readathon, we got over $4,000.

1322
02:15:05,407 --> 02:15:08,308
[SPEAKER_34]: We actually went online this year, which was really good.

1323
02:15:09,127 --> 02:15:22,965
[SPEAKER_34]: Charleston wrap we did well over 3,000 we have a lot of community Roberts community You know ice cream socials movie night trivia night, and then we also do a lot of free activities because we're I

1324
02:15:24,356 --> 02:15:30,940
[SPEAKER_34]: We want to make sure that there's kids can come, and not even if it's $2 for movie night, we want something completely free.

1325
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,202
[SPEAKER_34]: So we had a free science night, which was teacher-led.

1326
02:15:34,722 --> 02:15:39,825
[SPEAKER_34]: And again, PTO is a parent-teacher organization, and they're definitely a part of it.

1327
02:15:41,426 --> 02:15:45,969
[SPEAKER_34]: They're there making up all these science experiments.

1328
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:48,411
[SPEAKER_34]: They're at night doing all this work.

1329
02:15:48,911 --> 02:15:52,233
[SPEAKER_34]: A free family game night, a free family fun night,

1330
02:15:52,613 --> 02:16:02,879
[SPEAKER_34]: a free art night with the grant, walking Wednesdays with walking school buses and incoming play dates, just trying to make it more of a community within the Roberts.

1331
02:16:06,601 --> 02:16:08,882
[SPEAKER_34]: We do have a Facebook page if any of you want to go on it.

1332
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:11,963
[SPEAKER_34]: It's public Rockin' Roberts PTO.

1333
02:16:12,283 --> 02:16:15,407
[SPEAKER_34]: We have an email distribution list for our parents.

1334
02:16:15,427 --> 02:16:16,268
[SPEAKER_34]: We send information.

1335
02:16:16,689 --> 02:16:19,051
[SPEAKER_34]: We also have a website and we send flyers.

1336
02:16:19,932 --> 02:16:22,956
[SPEAKER_34]: And there's still people that don't know about an event.

1337
02:16:23,396 --> 02:16:25,359
[SPEAKER_34]: But I think that's always the case.

1338
02:16:26,379 --> 02:16:30,261
[SPEAKER_34]: So the last slide is we have technology in schools.

1339
02:16:30,301 --> 02:16:35,723
[SPEAKER_34]: It was just good to try to get some numbers on some Chromebooks, because as we know, that's very important.

1340
02:16:36,123 --> 02:16:41,565
[SPEAKER_34]: The Roberts has 563 students in the fall, so that may not be completely accurate.

1341
02:16:42,705 --> 02:16:49,268
[SPEAKER_34]: 100 Chromebooks, which we have 25 per cart, and the district bought 50, and the PTO bought 50.

1342
02:16:50,848 --> 02:16:54,109
[SPEAKER_34]: 25 of those were funded by a Lowell's two-box grant.

1343
02:16:54,929 --> 02:17:02,971
[SPEAKER_34]: And I just want to add, it's important to look at the schools and how they use them, because in our school, the first floor is K and 1, so there's no carts.

1344
02:17:03,231 --> 02:17:08,112
[SPEAKER_34]: But then there's a cart on the second, a cart on the third, a cart on the fourth, and an extra cart.

1345
02:17:08,592 --> 02:17:11,392
[SPEAKER_34]: But we have five fourth grade classes.

1346
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:16,682
[SPEAKER_34]: and five fifth grade classes.

1347
02:17:16,722 --> 02:17:23,610
[SPEAKER_34]: So we do have a large number of older students who are using these Chromebooks for MCAST and learning and such.

1348
02:17:24,147 --> 02:17:25,408
[SPEAKER_34]: So the need is definitely there.

1349
02:17:26,088 --> 02:17:29,171
[SPEAKER_34]: Columbus, we didn't get those numbers yet, but hopefully we'll get those.

1350
02:17:30,011 --> 02:17:35,495
[SPEAKER_34]: McGlynn, they had 90, which is 30 per cart, and the district purchased all of those.

1351
02:17:36,196 --> 02:17:41,439
[SPEAKER_34]: And the Brooks has 118 Chromebooks, and the district purchased 50 of those.

1352
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:49,925
[SPEAKER_34]: So I think it's just important, again, to have equity among the schools and make sure we all have the technology that we need in our school system.

1353
02:17:51,226 --> 02:17:52,267
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that's it.

1354
02:17:52,287 --> 02:17:53,167
[SPEAKER_34]: Did you have anything else?

1355
02:17:54,538 --> 02:17:54,918
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1356
02:18:04,961 --> 02:18:17,105
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just wanted to say thank you to all the parents who have been in the room since 7 tonight to be here to show you guys that we all do really believe in the things that we're telling you and there's

1357
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:24,733
[SPEAKER_22]: a whole bunch of folks in the room from all the elementary schools across the city here tonight for this purpose.

1358
02:18:26,053 --> 02:18:26,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1359
02:18:26,413 --> 02:18:26,913
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1360
02:18:38,598 --> 02:18:39,538
[SPEAKER_31]: Do we need it again?

1361
02:18:40,699 --> 02:18:41,199
[SPEAKER_31]: No?

1362
02:18:41,219 --> 02:18:42,099
[SPEAKER_31]: We do have one other.

1363
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:43,980
[SPEAKER_31]: The next one.

1364
02:18:46,081 --> 02:18:46,421
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1365
02:18:46,481 --> 02:18:47,102
[SPEAKER_25]: Van der Kloot.

1366
02:18:47,943 --> 02:18:58,172
[SPEAKER_25]: So first I want to thank the parents for being here this evening, and I also want to thank them for all the work and time they've invested into their schools.

1367
02:18:59,032 --> 02:19:09,662
[SPEAKER_25]: Overall, I edited up, it was $143,000 worth of different activities, events, books, Chromebooks, things that were funded.

1368
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:15,807
[SPEAKER_25]: by the PTOs or PTJ for their students and their schools.

1369
02:19:16,288 --> 02:19:17,669
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's truly fantastic.

1370
02:19:18,390 --> 02:19:23,074
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to mention the transportation issue.

1371
02:19:23,634 --> 02:19:31,522
[SPEAKER_25]: The field trips are part of our negotiations with the bus company, which happens every three years.

1372
02:19:32,402 --> 02:19:35,685
[SPEAKER_25]: And it is disheartening because that number always just goes up.

1373
02:19:36,066 --> 02:19:37,307
[SPEAKER_25]: It's one of the reasons why

1374
02:19:37,786 --> 02:19:45,329
[SPEAKER_25]: In some cases, it's better if an outside resource can come into your school rather than you busing the kids out.

1375
02:19:45,409 --> 02:19:50,431
[SPEAKER_25]: But we all know, of course, that it's really great to give kids different perspectives and bus them out.

1376
02:19:51,272 --> 02:19:56,094
[SPEAKER_25]: So that one, we'll look again when we talk about our transportation.

1377
02:19:56,834 --> 02:19:58,775
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, I think we've got one more year.

1378
02:19:59,135 --> 02:19:59,595
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that right?

1379
02:20:00,035 --> 02:20:01,036
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we have one more year.

1380
02:20:01,116 --> 02:20:04,417
[SPEAKER_25]: So that contract will come up in the next year.

1381
02:20:05,305 --> 02:20:21,713
[SPEAKER_25]: If you do have a problem, and I trust that anybody who did would immediately report it, because I'm disheartened to hear about the issue like with Smolluck Farms, but that should immediately be brought to the attention of Christine Patterson, who will then follow it up for you.

1382
02:20:23,954 --> 02:20:26,975
[SPEAKER_25]: So again, thank you so much for all of your work.

1383
02:20:27,475 --> 02:20:30,557
[SPEAKER_25]: I do see some equity issues that were raised, and I think we need to

1384
02:20:31,291 --> 02:20:40,818
[SPEAKER_25]: talk about them a little bit more in terms of the number of Chromebooks that the district has supplied versus the PTO has bought.

1385
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Because in some ways that seems like, gee, I think that's a district responsibility.

1386
02:20:46,842 --> 02:20:54,426
[SPEAKER_25]: There is one thing I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled that the elementary schools are working together and that you've formed this alliance.

1387
02:20:54,846 --> 02:21:08,693
[SPEAKER_25]: However, as the former head of the Medford Home and School Association, which lasted four years, and I'm a little concerned about the exclusivity only to elementary schools.

1388
02:21:11,209 --> 02:21:13,490
[SPEAKER_25]: years go on quickly.

1389
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:23,833
[SPEAKER_25]: And I fear that by just containing it to just the elementary schools, that you're really writing off some of the most involved parents that have been part of you.

1390
02:21:24,033 --> 02:21:31,195
[SPEAKER_25]: And you might not think about it right now because maybe your child's only in third grade, but before you know it, they're going to be in sixth grade.

1391
02:21:31,835 --> 02:21:33,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Why would you

1392
02:21:34,396 --> 02:21:42,025
[SPEAKER_25]: seek to exclude those parents who are very active or who might be very active or who have been very active.

1393
02:21:42,705 --> 02:21:47,310
[SPEAKER_25]: Rather than limit it, I would prefer to see it grow.

1394
02:21:47,551 --> 02:21:54,999
[SPEAKER_25]: And I realize that for the different projects there might be different ways that maybe it's not equitable for the middle schools

1395
02:21:55,385 --> 02:21:58,529
[SPEAKER_25]: if they're part of it to receive as high an amount of money.

1396
02:21:59,009 --> 02:22:01,672
[SPEAKER_25]: But maybe on some other projects, they would be equal partners.

1397
02:22:02,092 --> 02:22:06,537
[SPEAKER_25]: I really think you need to give that some consideration and take a look at that.

1398
02:22:06,898 --> 02:22:08,640
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's probably a lengthy discussion.

1399
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,681
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't do it all here.

1400
02:22:10,081 --> 02:22:12,884
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm throwing out my two cents and saying, please don't limit.

1401
02:22:13,485 --> 02:22:16,008
[SPEAKER_25]: Please increase, become more inclusive,

1402
02:22:16,408 --> 02:22:16,888
[SPEAKER_25]: not less.

1403
02:22:17,268 --> 02:22:19,269
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a wonderful, wonderful resource.

1404
02:22:19,589 --> 02:22:22,669
[SPEAKER_25]: You have people talking to each other, which is just so great.

1405
02:22:23,529 --> 02:22:27,390
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, schools finding out which things worked at your school, which doesn't.

1406
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:32,471
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, the combined resources, that Disney project alone, what a great, great thing.

1407
02:22:32,971 --> 02:22:37,632
[SPEAKER_25]: So those are my two cents, and I hope to talk to you more about that at some other time.

1408
02:22:38,532 --> 02:22:38,852
Thank you.

1409
02:22:39,172 --> 02:22:39,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1410
02:22:39,492 --> 02:22:39,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Kritz.

1411
02:22:40,232 --> 02:22:40,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1412
02:22:41,053 --> 02:22:42,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank everybody.

1413
02:22:43,138 --> 02:22:51,861
[SPEAKER_11]: the PTO, the PTG, the teachers, the administrators, for all the great fundraising and efforts and enrichment that you do for all of our schools.

1414
02:22:52,281 --> 02:22:54,062
[SPEAKER_11]: The presentation was incredible.

1415
02:22:54,082 --> 02:23:04,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all of us have been to many of the events at each and every one of the schools, and they're all just incredible, amazing, and you do so many great things, and thank you.

1416
02:23:04,926 --> 02:23:10,188
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't thank you enough, and I enjoy going to each and every one of the events, and I know everybody here does.

1417
02:23:10,248 --> 02:23:11,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1418
02:23:13,054 --> 02:23:13,774
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

1419
02:23:14,275 --> 02:23:15,595
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1420
02:23:16,315 --> 02:23:18,856
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, I want to thank everybody for waiting so long.

1421
02:23:18,876 --> 02:23:21,498
[SPEAKER_32]: It's been a long night already, and we have a ways to go.

1422
02:23:22,038 --> 02:23:26,680
[SPEAKER_32]: But I want to talk about enrichment and the opportunities you provide our children.

1423
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:33,423
[SPEAKER_32]: Some children learn new things because you're taking time raising money.

1424
02:23:34,143 --> 02:23:38,485
[SPEAKER_32]: They experience things that they wouldn't necessarily experience.

1425
02:23:39,565 --> 02:23:42,766
[SPEAKER_32]: They get new books and get to read about faraway lands.

1426
02:23:42,866 --> 02:23:45,607
[SPEAKER_32]: The things that you do matter to people's lives.

1427
02:23:45,667 --> 02:23:55,291
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to really tell you how much, as a school committee member, when you buy books for a library, that touches my heart, because our budget only goes so far.

1428
02:23:55,751 --> 02:24:07,635
[SPEAKER_32]: So the work you do enriches not only the children's heart, but also helps us as school committee members when we run out of dollars and we wish we could buy those brand new books that everybody's talking about.

1429
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:13,142
[SPEAKER_32]: or send kids to a museum that the school budget just doesn't have the funding for.

1430
02:24:13,442 --> 02:24:15,783
[SPEAKER_32]: So as a member, I thank you for that.

1431
02:24:17,544 --> 02:24:29,889
[SPEAKER_32]: Playgrounds, we saw great work with one of our playgrounds, and that was parent-driven, and that was Cheryl, and well, actually, two playgrounds got improvements this year.

1432
02:24:30,149 --> 02:24:34,191
[SPEAKER_32]: And we need to move forward with that, and this committee has made that a priority.

1433
02:24:34,511 --> 02:24:37,312
[SPEAKER_32]: Just so you all know, that is on our master plan

1434
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:49,112
[SPEAKER_32]: our capital improvement plans, and we do take that seriously, both for safety, both for physical ability for kids, and we want kids to get outside and have time to play.

1435
02:24:49,472 --> 02:24:52,132
[SPEAKER_32]: It helps the rest of their day, and it helps their learning environment.

1436
02:24:52,673 --> 02:24:57,333
[SPEAKER_32]: So just to follow up on that, that that is a committee thing.

1437
02:24:58,253 --> 02:25:05,095
[SPEAKER_32]: I also wanted to make sure that all of our PTOs, PTGs, are now 5013Cs.

1438
02:25:05,335 --> 02:25:07,055
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if most of you know me,

1439
02:25:07,517 --> 02:25:12,879
[SPEAKER_32]: but I want everything to be, go through the district.

1440
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:33,888
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's transparent, I think everybody's on the same page, everybody's following the same rules, all the offices are listed, all the bank accounts are there, there's checks and balances, so that's a question I have for this evening to make sure that they're all registered with Medford Public Schools, and when you're raising money, oh, all the,

1441
02:25:36,082 --> 02:25:38,965
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, all the ones, and the city-wide one as well.

1442
02:25:39,426 --> 02:25:40,767
[SPEAKER_32]: We are not a wide one.

1443
02:25:40,787 --> 02:25:46,634
[SPEAKER_32]: We are just a group of people meeting and fundraising and going back to our schools.

1444
02:25:46,674 --> 02:25:49,857
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, could you come to the, okay.

1445
02:25:50,338 --> 02:25:54,462
[SPEAKER_31]: Does one PTO collect city-wide money and then distribute?

1446
02:25:54,722 --> 02:25:56,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly, so we're very new.

1447
02:25:57,288 --> 02:26:00,170
[SPEAKER_22]: And part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we don't flame out.

1448
02:26:01,191 --> 02:26:11,539
[SPEAKER_22]: So what we decided to do at the beginning of this year is that for each event, one of the PTOs who is a registered 501c3 assumes the role as the reporting PTO.

1449
02:26:11,639 --> 02:26:17,203
[SPEAKER_22]: That means they assume insurance risk, tax reporting liability,

1450
02:26:17,676 --> 02:26:22,580
[SPEAKER_22]: and a requirement to honestly handle all the money that flows in through that.

1451
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:24,501
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's actually not a small task.

1452
02:26:25,062 --> 02:26:32,187
[SPEAKER_22]: We had to buy additional insurance for the Disney raffle because the money coming in was in excess of what we normally do.

1453
02:26:32,307 --> 02:26:37,971
[SPEAKER_22]: So what happens is each year we sit down and say, what events are we going to do and who's going to report?

1454
02:26:38,492 --> 02:26:43,555
[SPEAKER_22]: So all of that money is reporting under a registered 501c3 amongst the elementary schools.

1455
02:26:44,216 --> 02:26:46,778
[SPEAKER_22]: So we are not a 501c3 independent organization.

1456
02:26:47,488 --> 02:26:54,314
[SPEAKER_22]: because we are really just there to fundraise and push the money back to the schools where the PTOs can decide how best to spend it.

1457
02:26:55,055 --> 02:26:58,618
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, more or less tax filing, payments to the state, the IRS.

1458
02:26:58,718 --> 02:27:01,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Thousands of dollars, less insurance, et cetera.

1459
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:01,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, yep.

1460
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:03,042
[SPEAKER_31]: How do you see the volunteers?

1461
02:27:04,583 --> 02:27:10,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, because we would have to form a different board, which is challenging because we're already

1462
02:27:11,285 --> 02:27:14,087
[SPEAKER_22]: the same group of folks that show up to every last thing.

1463
02:27:14,987 --> 02:27:16,448
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're not there yet.

1464
02:27:17,229 --> 02:27:23,073
[SPEAKER_22]: We have acknowledged that we need to continue to talk about it because we could get there quickly, but we're not there yet.

1465
02:27:23,793 --> 02:27:24,414
[SPEAKER_32]: OK.

1466
02:27:24,574 --> 02:27:33,320
[SPEAKER_32]: As long as that's looked at and there's rules and bylaws and things followed for that grouping that's similar to the other grouping.

1467
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,422
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to finish off by saying I agree.

1468
02:27:38,892 --> 02:27:53,195
[SPEAKER_32]: When your children transition into middle school, you step back as a parent, and we are losing an opportunity to keep those parents involved in our district and in our children's lives.

1469
02:27:53,655 --> 02:28:03,337
[SPEAKER_32]: And they're feeling already that their children are more independent, so they have more time to give as their children get bigger and older.

1470
02:28:03,457 --> 02:28:07,698
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would just suggest that we

1471
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:23,887
[SPEAKER_32]: well, that you include the middle school PTOs, especially because it would add value to those students' lives and you have an opportunity to gain help with the citywide program.

1472
02:28:24,328 --> 02:28:25,848
[SPEAKER_22]: So that again, I agree.

1473
02:28:25,868 --> 02:28:30,511
[SPEAKER_22]: So let me give you three comments about that topic because I know it continues to come up.

1474
02:28:31,651 --> 02:28:35,173
[SPEAKER_22]: The first comment is that the two middle school PTOs

1475
02:28:35,798 --> 02:28:41,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Neither one of them has officially reached out to us to say they want to be part of an alliance with us.

1476
02:28:42,282 --> 02:28:46,965
[SPEAKER_22]: And if, in fact, they did, we would definitely want to talk to them about what that means.

1477
02:28:47,546 --> 02:28:53,170
[SPEAKER_22]: What happens and what plays well from a fundraising perspective at an elementary school level could be quite different.

1478
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:55,271
[SPEAKER_22]: And we want to think carefully about that.

1479
02:28:56,212 --> 02:29:02,236
[SPEAKER_22]: If anyone wants to understand the rules in more detail, we would be happy to talk about the details of those rules that are being considered.

1480
02:29:02,296 --> 02:29:04,177
[SPEAKER_22]: But frankly, they are being considered

1481
02:29:04,718 --> 02:29:21,561
[SPEAKER_22]: and run through the boards of the respective PTOs, because those PTOs are assuming all the risk in these operations, and they do need to be okay with what those requirements are, because they are the holders of the risk, the reporting requirements, the compliance, and all that good stuff.

1482
02:29:22,501 --> 02:29:31,463
[SPEAKER_22]: And the third thing is that I believe that we have already agreed that we are totally open to collaborating with the Middle Schools on the Wizards game next year, which was a huge hit.

1483
02:29:32,168 --> 02:29:37,110
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to figure out exactly how we will do that and exactly how the middle schools want to be involved.

1484
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:41,252
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's sort of a conversation that I anticipate we won't have until the fall.

1485
02:29:42,192 --> 02:29:46,874
[SPEAKER_22]: As I think those two boards are also going through a number of transitions and a number of other things going on.

1486
02:29:46,934 --> 02:29:56,378
[SPEAKER_22]: So if anyone wants some additional detail about the facts of the memorandum of understanding that we're working on across the schools, we're happy to reach out and talk to that.

1487
02:29:57,418 --> 02:30:01,540
[SPEAKER_22]: But to be perfectly clear, the two middle school PTOs,

1488
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:05,302
[SPEAKER_22]: have not yet reached out to us in an official capacity to talk about that.

1489
02:30:06,062 --> 02:30:10,665
[SPEAKER_32]: Just as a follow-up, sorry, and then I'll yield to my colleague.

1490
02:30:12,246 --> 02:30:25,733
[SPEAKER_32]: A few years ago, you actually helped us develop the online program, so you understand the intent I have for it, be it anybody fundraising, using Method's name, be registered with that.

1491
02:30:26,211 --> 02:30:38,247
[SPEAKER_32]: So in some way, shape, or form, I would like this group registered, even if it's not as a 5013C, just so that we have it through the superintendent's office.

1492
02:30:38,427 --> 02:30:38,667
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1493
02:30:38,967 --> 02:30:40,509
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my only concern.

1494
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:41,010
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1495
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:42,752
[SPEAKER_31]: Would you like to step up and address?

1496
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:48,271
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Susan Powers.

1497
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:54,832
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm at 956 Highland Avenue, and I'm actually on the Andrews Middle School PTO.

1498
02:30:56,053 --> 02:31:04,075
[SPEAKER_36]: As far as trying to combine efforts, I think that people are very open to it.

1499
02:31:04,695 --> 02:31:10,517
[SPEAKER_36]: I think part of the problem is as middle school parents, we don't have the same engagement

1500
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,922
[SPEAKER_36]: as some of the elementary school parents have.

1501
02:31:14,903 --> 02:31:25,011
[SPEAKER_36]: And ultimately, one of the things I did want to mention, one of the things that we were able to do with our fundraising this year was we were able to buy 25 Chromebooks with a

1502
02:31:32,631 --> 02:31:33,511
[SPEAKER_36]: charging cart.

1503
02:31:34,012 --> 02:31:39,114
[SPEAKER_36]: So at this point right now, every... And that was from fundraising from the middle school.

1504
02:31:39,774 --> 02:31:46,917
[SPEAKER_36]: One of the things is at this point, every grade when they have to take MCAS has a Chromebook.

1505
02:31:47,337 --> 02:31:48,638
[SPEAKER_36]: But that's not nearly enough.

1506
02:31:49,798 --> 02:31:53,060
[SPEAKER_36]: And we're always looking for opportunities to raise funds.

1507
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:57,882
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, we're a socioeconomically diverse community as well.

1508
02:31:58,393 --> 02:32:01,075
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's a little bit harder to raise funds when you're in a middle school.

1509
02:32:01,676 --> 02:32:11,524
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I guess, Jenny, I think that we would, I mean, I'm sadly an eighth grade parent, so I'm going to be moving on.

1510
02:32:12,005 --> 02:32:14,787
[SPEAKER_36]: But with that being said, I think that we've talked about that.

1511
02:32:14,827 --> 02:32:21,093
[SPEAKER_36]: And some of the things we've talked about in our PTO meetings is how can we get more engaged, how can we raise some more funds.

1512
02:32:21,553 --> 02:32:25,877
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, and the other thing I would like to say, too, that was what was great about what we were able to do at the Andrews,

1513
02:32:26,428 --> 02:32:32,172
[SPEAKER_36]: is we also raised money so that we could have scholarships for kids to go to the New York trip, because that's a huge thing.

1514
02:32:32,733 --> 02:32:39,778
[SPEAKER_36]: And again, I'm not so sure the McGlynn has the same ability to raise funds, and that's so unfair.

1515
02:32:40,578 --> 02:32:44,521
[SPEAKER_36]: So we talk about discrepancies in the elementary school.

1516
02:32:44,561 --> 02:32:46,503
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, it's there at the middle school as well.

1517
02:32:46,943 --> 02:32:55,089
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I think if we can do things where we can raise some funds together, the McGlynn can get those Chromebooks, and the McGlynn can have

1518
02:32:55,605 --> 02:33:05,211
[SPEAKER_36]: scholarships as well, because it's so important that every kid deserves the same opportunities, whether they're in elementary school, whether they're in middle school, and whether they're in high school.

1519
02:33:05,751 --> 02:33:08,793
[SPEAKER_36]: And education is the great equalizer to everyone.

1520
02:33:08,953 --> 02:33:13,436
[SPEAKER_36]: So as I said, I'm the lone middle school PTO person here.

1521
02:33:13,536 --> 02:33:18,519
[SPEAKER_36]: But with that being said, I just want to let you know, I think we're all very interested in doing all this.

1522
02:33:19,459 --> 02:33:20,099
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for your time.

1523
02:33:20,119 --> 02:33:20,800
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for coming.

1524
02:33:27,364 --> 02:33:29,265
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street.

1525
02:33:29,365 --> 02:33:32,405
[SPEAKER_23]: And first I want to say thank you to the Citywide PTO.

1526
02:33:32,445 --> 02:33:33,406
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this is amazing, $142,000.

1527
02:33:33,866 --> 02:33:35,806
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that's incredible.

1528
02:33:36,246 --> 02:33:37,947
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you all for all the hard work you've done.

1529
02:33:38,927 --> 02:33:39,427
[SPEAKER_23]: All together.

1530
02:33:39,607 --> 02:33:41,908
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, all together with the Citywide PTO help as well.

1531
02:33:41,948 --> 02:33:43,008
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's just amazing.

1532
02:33:43,808 --> 02:33:44,748
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that's great.

1533
02:33:44,868 --> 02:33:50,930
[SPEAKER_23]: And speaking on behalf of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council as well, oftentimes I feel like

1534
02:33:52,208 --> 02:33:57,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we're not necessarily included in some of the conversations and we want to make sure that we're able to help out as well.

1535
02:33:58,370 --> 02:34:10,714
[SPEAKER_23]: So we would love to be a part of this and especially when we're thinking about the, I think it was the, was it Columbus School you guys were talking about for the buses and some of the concerns around accessibility for students with disabilities.

1536
02:34:11,634 --> 02:34:16,275
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's really our role as a CPAC to help advise the district and help family members as well.

1537
02:34:16,375 --> 02:34:18,696
[SPEAKER_23]: And we want to make sure that every child gets to go on a field trip.

1538
02:34:19,238 --> 02:34:21,840
[SPEAKER_23]: And we want to roll up our sleeves and get in there and help folks as well.

1539
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:24,401
[SPEAKER_23]: So in any way that we can, we would like to be included.

1540
02:34:24,582 --> 02:34:24,942
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1541
02:34:25,402 --> 02:34:33,427
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1542
02:34:33,667 --> 02:34:41,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say briefly that it's been a real honor seeing you guys work with your energy.

1543
02:34:41,473 --> 02:34:42,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a real pleasure.

1544
02:34:42,733 --> 02:34:44,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have a lot going on tonight.

1545
02:34:44,154 --> 02:34:45,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ramble on.

1546
02:34:45,695 --> 02:34:47,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you so much for coming down and making this presentation.

1547
02:34:48,442 --> 02:34:49,162
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much.

1548
02:34:49,402 --> 02:34:49,763
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1549
02:34:49,903 --> 02:34:50,623
[SPEAKER_31]: Very informative.

1550
02:34:50,643 --> 02:34:51,023
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1551
02:34:53,124 --> 02:35:01,448
[SPEAKER_31]: We have item number eight, report on Massachusetts General Hospital Research Initiative to Understand and Reduce Cannabis Use in Adolescents.

1552
02:35:01,928 --> 02:35:04,209
[SPEAKER_31]: Is Dr. Randy Schuster still in the room?

1553
02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:07,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

1554
02:35:12,553 --> 02:35:16,375
[SPEAKER_31]: And we have Penny Fanioli from Team Medford here as well.

1555
02:35:20,026 --> 02:35:20,326
[SPEAKER_31]: Give me a kiss.

1556
02:35:20,346 --> 02:35:20,567
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1557
02:35:27,374 --> 02:35:28,315
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, wow, Mia.

1558
02:35:52,814 --> 02:35:53,734
Can you help her?

1559
02:36:01,018 --> 02:36:01,459
Thank you.

1560
02:36:01,639 --> 02:36:03,420
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, let's see.

1561
02:36:05,841 --> 02:36:08,362
I know.

1562
02:36:08,823 --> 02:36:10,664
See?

1563
02:36:11,164 --> 02:36:12,324
[SPEAKER_31]: It said three minutes.

1564
02:36:12,585 --> 02:36:14,446
Thank you.

1565
02:36:15,646 --> 02:36:17,007
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm really happy.

1566
02:36:17,047 --> 02:36:20,609
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1567
02:36:23,222 --> 02:36:26,724
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you have any idea how to do it?

1568
02:36:26,744 --> 02:36:27,745
[SPEAKER_31]: We've gone back to this.

1569
02:36:28,025 --> 02:36:29,686
[SPEAKER_31]: Is that okay?

1570
02:36:39,791 --> 02:36:42,613
We did this one.

1571
02:36:44,574 --> 02:36:45,935
The donation.

1572
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:50,492
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a motion on the floor for acceptance.

1573
02:37:50,592 --> 02:37:52,173
[SPEAKER_31]: Dr. Maurice, would you like to say a few words?

1574
02:37:55,496 --> 02:37:55,876
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, great.

1575
02:37:55,916 --> 02:37:56,237
[SPEAKER_31]: That's it.

1576
02:37:56,537 --> 02:37:56,717
[SPEAKER_31]: Great.

1577
02:37:57,017 --> 02:38:00,600
[SPEAKER_37]: Just very excited to have Joan be part of the team.

1578

02:39:06,357 --> 02:39:06,477

02:39:47,047 --> 02:39:53,950
[SPEAKER_32]: I came out very impressed with her through the evening, and she was the clear choice for our district.

[SPEAKER_31]: Math, what about, the math curriculum, we did go, Ms.

1631
02:41:01,531 --> 02:41:02,271
[SPEAKER_31]: Fazekhan?

1632
02:41:04,113 --> 02:41:04,293
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

1633
02:41:04,313 --> 02:41:08,014
[SPEAKER_31]: Kahn, we reviewed the math curriculum.

1634
02:41:08,274 --> 02:41:10,595
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you have an estimate on how much time it would take you to present?

1635
02:41:10,615 --> 02:41:13,995
[SPEAKER_31]: How much?

1636
02:41:15,896 --> 02:41:17,456
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1637
02:41:22,158 --> 02:41:23,838
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, report on Project Bread.

1638
02:41:24,018 --> 02:41:27,579
[SPEAKER_31]: Sarah Klugisch, Rosemary Coward, and Holly Grace.

1639
02:41:27,659 --> 02:41:31,800
[SPEAKER_31]: You might want to put the lights back on.

1640
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:38,291
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

1641
02:41:38,691 --> 02:41:39,091
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

1642
02:41:39,191 --> 02:41:40,232
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm Sarah Cluggish.

1643
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:41,992
[SPEAKER_29]: I live on 6th Street here in Medford.

1644
02:41:42,052 --> 02:41:45,353
[SPEAKER_29]: And in full disclosure, I have a 10th grader at the high school.

1645
02:41:45,453 --> 02:41:51,175
[SPEAKER_29]: I did the treasurer's report for the PTO, just an interest, right before I came here.

1646
02:41:51,415 --> 02:41:54,776
[SPEAKER_29]: I also have a 5th grader and a 3rd grader at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1647
02:41:55,377 --> 02:42:02,079
[SPEAKER_29]: And I just want to thank you, Mayor and Superintendent, for having us here this evening, as well as the school committee and the administration for staying here.

1648
02:42:03,819 --> 02:42:06,400
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition to my role as a Medford parent,

1649
02:42:06,881 --> 02:42:14,785
[SPEAKER_29]: I also serve as the Vice President of Programs and Policy Work at Project Bread, which is a statewide anti-hunger organization.

1650
02:42:15,446 --> 02:42:20,368
[SPEAKER_29]: And I am joined here tonight by my colleague, Rosemarie Kayward and Holly Grace.

1651
02:42:21,069 --> 02:42:25,011
[SPEAKER_29]: And they are part of Project Bread's Child Nutrition Outreach Program.

1652
02:42:25,391 --> 02:42:33,155
[SPEAKER_29]: And this team is a partnership between Project Bread and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, DESE.

1653
02:42:34,333 --> 02:42:43,991
[SPEAKER_29]: Our goal is to work with school food service programs and community partners across Massachusetts to increase participation in school breakfast and the summer meals program.

1654
02:42:45,144 --> 02:43:08,049
[SPEAKER_29]: We have worked with Medford for the last several years supporting Jewel Bradley, the district's school food service director, and her staff as they have introduced the universal free school breakfast program models at the Columbus Elementary and the McGlynn Elementary schools, as well as a breakfast in the classroom program at the Columbus.

1655
02:43:09,189 --> 02:43:12,970
[SPEAKER_29]: This past February, our team met with Christine Patterson,

1656
02:43:13,757 --> 02:43:22,362
[SPEAKER_29]: and with Jewel Bradley to talk about introducing breakfast after the bell models in additional Medford schools that have significant needs.

1657
02:43:23,242 --> 02:43:28,005
[SPEAKER_29]: But instead, and rightfully so, they wanted to tackle two major issues.

1658
02:43:28,886 --> 02:43:34,909
[SPEAKER_29]: One was to make sure that anything else that's going to be introduced into the district would be offered at every school.

1659
02:43:35,569 --> 02:43:42,093
[SPEAKER_29]: And the second was to work on improving the quality of the food that's being offered, particularly breakfast.

1660
02:43:43,282 --> 02:43:56,107
[SPEAKER_29]: So as I said, currently the Columbus and McGlynn offer universal free breakfast because they have the highest rates of students who are eligible for free and reduced price school meals in the district, and it hovers around 60%.

1661
02:43:56,787 --> 02:44:04,050
[SPEAKER_29]: And of course, as you know, the McGlynn Middle School also offers universally free school breakfast, but that will change next year.

1662
02:44:04,090 --> 02:44:07,512
[SPEAKER_29]: As you know, the demographics will change because of the fifth grade lottery.

1663
02:44:09,126 --> 02:44:17,507
[SPEAKER_29]: We were told that this has been sort of perceived as unfair by some of the schools because it's not offered across the district.

1664
02:44:18,938 --> 02:44:25,722
[SPEAKER_29]: So tonight we're going to talk about provision two, which my colleague Rosemary will explain in a minute.

1665
02:44:26,182 --> 02:44:32,706
[SPEAKER_29]: And that will allow the district to offer free breakfast to all schools in all of our buildings each morning.

1666
02:44:33,126 --> 02:44:44,232
[SPEAKER_29]: And that will still bring in enough revenue to offset the school meal debt that the district's now incurring each month, and invest it back into the department to improve the quality of breakfast.

1667
02:44:45,345 --> 02:44:55,733
[SPEAKER_29]: To further bolster the quality of breakfast, we are pleased to report that Medford has taken steps to reduce sugar in its yogurt and cereal options in the morning.

1668
02:44:56,633 --> 02:45:09,163
[SPEAKER_29]: And earlier this year, Project Bread brought in Chef Ryan Eccles to the high school and to the McGlynn Middle School to begin to assess operations and to introduce new foods to the students.

1669
02:45:10,255 --> 02:45:16,557
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, while his focus has been on lunch, we would like him to focus on breakfast in the new school year.

1670
02:45:17,578 --> 02:45:25,521
[SPEAKER_29]: This service is provided at no cost to the district, and he is here at the request of the School Food Service Department.

1671
02:45:26,421 --> 02:45:29,862
[SPEAKER_29]: So now I'm going to turn the presentation over to my colleague, Rosemary.

1672
02:45:30,142 --> 02:45:37,205
[SPEAKER_29]: She'll just quickly walk you through the tables that are in your packet tonight, and she'll just talk about what it would take to implement Provision 2,

1673
02:45:38,565 --> 02:45:56,987
[SPEAKER_29]: The estimated financial data that's in your packet is based on data that was provided by the school food services department, the cost of food and the labor that's in aggregate, and on current participation that's provided by DESE and then sort of if participation is to increase.

1674
02:45:57,809 --> 02:46:03,854
[SPEAKER_29]: Now this just represents one possible model for strengthening Medford's school food service program.

1675
02:46:04,375 --> 02:46:14,144
[SPEAKER_29]: And Project Bread and our child nutrition program is here, and we look forward to continuing to serve as a resource for all of you and for all of the schools moving forward.

1676
02:46:16,506 --> 02:46:16,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1677
02:46:17,507 --> 02:46:18,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Sarah.

1678
02:46:18,467 --> 02:46:19,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1679
02:46:19,268 --> 02:46:23,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Superintendent Lord Vinson and school committee members for the opportunity to speak tonight.

1680
02:46:24,073 --> 02:46:28,094
[SPEAKER_21]: As Sarah mentioned, my job is to break down Provision 2 for all of you.

1681
02:46:29,035 --> 02:46:38,438
[SPEAKER_21]: And our team did a financial analysis of Provision 2 as one option the district could offer breakfast free to all students at every school.

1682
02:46:39,018 --> 02:46:50,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Provision 2 is one federal program available to schools with no minimum free and reduced percentage, which makes every school in Medford eligible to transition to it.

1683
02:46:51,269 --> 02:47:06,841
[SPEAKER_21]: How it works briefly is that schools will continue to receive federal reimbursements under the free, paid, and reduced percentage at a set participation percentage, but they will discontinue receiving student payments.

1684
02:47:09,723 --> 02:47:15,487
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the biggest barriers, the number one benefit for transitioning to Provision 2 is that

1685
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:24,704
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll eliminate the financial barrier and allow every student in the district to start off school with a nutritious breakfast and ready to learn.

1686
02:47:25,324 --> 02:47:36,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Other benefits of provision two is to streamline paperwork and operations for the food service department, bringing up time of staff to invest more into the program.

1687
02:47:37,509 --> 02:47:45,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Another benefit is to eliminate unpaid meal debt just for school breakfast, so it would not include lunch.

1688
02:47:47,598 --> 02:47:58,287
[SPEAKER_21]: We estimate that schools could increase participation, double potentially, and potentially 35% participation or above.

1689
02:47:58,848 --> 02:48:04,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Currently, schools range from 6% participation in school breakfast at Brooks,

1690
02:48:05,269 --> 02:48:11,332
[SPEAKER_21]: to 23 to 26% at McGlynn Elementary and McGlynn Middle.

1691
02:48:11,793 --> 02:48:22,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Columbus Elementary is currently an outlier right now because it is offering universal breakfast and provision two, and it is seeing 93% participation and above.

1692
02:48:23,079 --> 02:48:23,439
[SPEAKER_21]: You said 93?

1693
02:48:23,959 --> 02:48:27,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1694
02:48:27,922 --> 02:48:34,105
[SPEAKER_21]: So in your packet, there's a lot of numbers to look at, but I want to just break down one school with you

1695
02:48:34,820 --> 02:48:38,662
[SPEAKER_21]: If you'll turn to page two, Andrews Middle School.

1696
02:48:41,083 --> 02:48:42,803
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is looking at the current situation.

1697
02:48:42,863 --> 02:48:48,926
[SPEAKER_21]: We are aware that there's going to be a transition for the middle schools, so this is looking at the current situation at Andrews.

1698
02:48:50,026 --> 02:48:59,130
[SPEAKER_21]: So currently, the current participation is 6%, bringing in roughly $1,800 from federal reimbursements.

1699
02:48:59,330 --> 02:49:03,032
[SPEAKER_21]: And the current labor costs and food costs is roughly $1,700.

1700
02:49:04,787 --> 02:49:10,612
[SPEAKER_21]: So currently, the school is seeing about $150 profit per month.

1701
02:49:11,413 --> 02:49:28,589
[SPEAKER_21]: With an increased participation and with Provision 2 at roughly 35% participation, the revenue, and this would be profit that the school can invest back into the school, into the program, to the school breakfast program, would be roughly $1,480.

1702
02:49:31,321 --> 02:49:32,562
[SPEAKER_21]: as profit per a month.

1703
02:49:33,402 --> 02:49:35,763
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just one example, one school.

1704
02:49:37,084 --> 02:49:49,510
[SPEAKER_21]: This would be true for all schools, roughly going from a profit margin of $200 to $300 per month to roughly $1,500 to $2,000 per month, except for Brooks.

1705
02:49:50,411 --> 02:49:54,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Brooks is kind of an exception and a challenge with provision 2.

1706
02:49:55,203 --> 02:49:58,245
[SPEAKER_21]: because it has the lowest free and reduced percentage of roughly 22%.

1707
02:50:00,446 --> 02:50:07,030
[SPEAKER_21]: So it would not see as high a participation as the other schools and therefore would not bring in as much revenue.

1708
02:50:07,410 --> 02:50:15,375
[SPEAKER_21]: However, with the increase in revenue at the other schools, that revenue would cover the deficit at Brooks.

1709
02:50:16,116 --> 02:50:22,560
[SPEAKER_21]: So the school district would still be able to offer free breakfast to all schools across the districts.

1710
02:50:24,654 --> 02:50:27,416
[SPEAKER_21]: So a little bit more about how provision two works.

1711
02:50:28,256 --> 02:50:37,363
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a federal program, so the school district would work with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to implement it, and it would run for four years.

1712
02:50:37,983 --> 02:50:52,454
[SPEAKER_21]: The first year would be a base year in which the school district, the Food Service Department, would continue to collect free and reduced applications as well as do direct certs to set a percentage

1713
02:50:53,034 --> 02:50:59,356
[SPEAKER_21]: participation percentage that would set the reimbursement percentage for the free, reduced, and paid.

1714
02:50:59,836 --> 02:51:07,819
[SPEAKER_21]: After that first year, they would discontinue collecting that information and offer breakfast free for all students for the next four years.

1715
02:51:08,419 --> 02:51:20,923
[SPEAKER_21]: At the end of those four years, they would have to do a renewal process to update that reimbursement percentage, but they could still, of course, continue to offer and run provision two.

1716
02:51:22,587 --> 02:51:36,476
[SPEAKER_21]: We highly recommend that the district looks at an alternative models, whether it's grab-and-go, second chance, or Bucks in the Classroom, to increase access at the schools and help increase the participation.

1717
02:51:36,797 --> 02:51:50,766
[SPEAKER_21]: And CNAP, Child Nutrition Outreach Program, Project RED, is available to assist and evaluate with the principal and school administration, school staff, to see what model will work best for the school, and of course, study further how provision two

1718
02:51:51,273 --> 02:51:52,533
[SPEAKER_21]: could benefit the district.

1719
02:51:52,934 --> 02:51:54,074
[SPEAKER_31]: Can I ask you just one question?

1720
02:51:54,274 --> 02:51:54,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1721
02:51:55,054 --> 02:52:00,776
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you keep the data for one year while you're implementing this, and then that applies to the next three?

1722
02:52:01,016 --> 02:52:05,718
[SPEAKER_31]: Or do you use your current data for free and reduced lunch?

1723
02:52:06,038 --> 02:52:07,578
[SPEAKER_31]: How does the reimbursement work?

1724
02:52:07,618 --> 02:52:11,739
[SPEAKER_31]: How do they know how many students are actually getting free breakfast or free lunch?

1725
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:12,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, sure.

1726
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:19,642
[SPEAKER_21]: So within the base year, the school district would still collect the applications and do

1727
02:52:21,636 --> 02:52:32,700
[SPEAKER_21]: and based on the number of students who are participating in the program for the free, paid, and reduced, based on those participation patterns.

1728
02:52:33,621 --> 02:52:44,405
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's say 30% of eligible paid students under the paid rate are participating, and 20% of the reduced, and then 50% of the free,

1729
02:52:48,637 --> 02:52:50,119
[SPEAKER_21]: students are participating.

1730
02:52:50,539 --> 02:52:56,887
[SPEAKER_21]: That would set up the reimbursement percentages for the base year and then the following three years.

1731
02:52:57,467 --> 02:52:58,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that make sense?

1732
02:52:59,269 --> 02:53:02,173
[SPEAKER_21]: So for every meal served, it would break down.

1733
02:53:02,473 --> 02:53:05,997
[SPEAKER_21]: So 30% would be reimbursed under the paid rate.

1734
02:53:06,702 --> 02:53:14,290
[SPEAKER_31]: 20% would be reimbursed under the reduced rate, and 50%... So we get reimbursed for the children that do not even apply for free and reduced, is that correct?

1735
02:53:14,330 --> 02:53:15,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, exactly.

1736
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:23,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So every meal the school is serving would be reimbursed, yeah, under one of those rates.

1737
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:27,524
[SPEAKER_29]: So under that first year, you want to get as many applications in as possible?

1738
02:53:28,792 --> 02:53:31,533
[SPEAKER_29]: to participate or that meet free and reduced?

1739
02:53:31,773 --> 02:53:39,854
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, to be able to build, make sure you're capturing everyone who's eligible for a free and reduced price scale, so that you're capturing the highest reimbursement rate you can.

1740
02:53:41,255 --> 02:53:45,936
[SPEAKER_29]: And those who are eligible for direct certification, like if you're receiving from stamps and the like.

1741
02:53:46,216 --> 02:53:47,156
[SPEAKER_32]: Right, thank you.

1742
02:53:49,516 --> 02:53:49,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1743
02:53:49,697 --> 02:53:51,177
[SPEAKER_25]: Van der Kloot.

1744
02:53:51,797 --> 02:53:55,058
[SPEAKER_25]: So, do students who would normally pay for their

1745
02:53:56,935 --> 02:54:00,336
[SPEAKER_25]: breakfast or lunch, would they be paying for their breakfast and lunch?

1746
02:54:01,596 --> 02:54:06,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Not with lunch, yes, but it would just be for breakfast.

1747
02:54:06,117 --> 02:54:10,838
[SPEAKER_21]: So once your base year starts, they would not be collecting student payments for breakfast only.

1748
02:54:11,058 --> 02:54:12,739
[SPEAKER_25]: So how do we pay for that breakfast?

1749
02:54:14,139 --> 02:54:15,459
[SPEAKER_21]: By the federal reimbursements.

1750
02:54:15,859 --> 02:54:18,900
[SPEAKER_25]: And will the federal reimbursements cover all of our costs?

1751
02:54:19,877 --> 02:54:32,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, our estimates with the increased participation, it would bring in enough reimbursements to cover the income, the revenue that would be brought in by student payments.

1752
02:54:33,104 --> 02:54:34,885
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's the downside?

1753
02:54:36,645 --> 02:54:44,990
[SPEAKER_21]: From our point of view, nothing, except for the challenge of Brooks, who would not see an increase, a high enough increase in...

1754
02:54:46,107 --> 02:54:51,830
[SPEAKER_21]: participation to make up for the deficit of student payments.

1755
02:54:52,230 --> 02:54:54,431
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that it would be appropriate.

1756
02:54:54,451 --> 02:55:08,078
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, obviously, this sounds like it's great, but I think that it makes sense for you to sit down with our administrative people, one of whom, Christine, is standing behind you, unless you want to give us a recommendation right now or...

1757
02:55:09,414 --> 02:55:11,755
[SPEAKER_25]: We said it would be short, that's my only concern here.

1758
02:55:13,495 --> 02:55:14,416
[SPEAKER_31]: Is there more research?

1759
02:55:14,476 --> 02:55:16,916
[SPEAKER_31]: Christine, is there more research?

1760
02:55:16,976 --> 02:55:17,136
[SPEAKER_31]: No?

1761
02:55:17,737 --> 02:55:18,497
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds great.

1762
02:55:19,437 --> 02:55:19,837
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1763
02:55:20,377 --> 02:55:20,818
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1764
02:55:22,158 --> 02:55:22,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1765
02:55:24,019 --> 02:55:28,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I'd like to thank and commend our representatives from Project Bread.

1766
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:32,001
[SPEAKER_18]: They are a continued partner for many projects, grant-based and other.

1767
02:55:32,821 --> 02:55:38,523
[SPEAKER_18]: We did sit down with them to review this potential in February, along with other potentials.

1768
02:55:39,122 --> 02:55:45,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, being a proponent of school nutrition, I am an advocate for breakfast, for breakfast in the classroom.

1769
02:55:45,546 --> 02:55:48,648
[SPEAKER_18]: There are certain parameters that follow that.

1770
02:55:49,489 --> 02:55:56,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this is one snapshot of one month that we need to really look at the program itself.

1771
02:55:56,753 --> 02:55:59,095
[SPEAKER_18]: The food service program is self-funded.

1772
02:55:59,495 --> 02:56:07,300
[SPEAKER_18]: We've heard a lot of initiatives implemented or recommended for implementing within the food service program.

1773
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:14,883
[SPEAKER_18]: that we really need to do a full-scale review of the feasibility of some of these initiatives.

1774
02:56:15,043 --> 02:56:21,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this one being very important and certainly beneficial to the students to have.

1775
02:56:22,367 --> 02:56:27,409
[SPEAKER_18]: We are under some additional state mandates that we need to review.

1776
02:56:27,529 --> 02:56:36,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And with that, we have engaged with a school nutrition leader to come in and do site visits at our other elementary and other

1777
02:56:37,459 --> 02:56:43,220
[SPEAKER_18]: schools in order to look at what could be the best method for delivery of breakfast.

1778
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:45,341
[SPEAKER_18]: There are other potentials.

1779
02:56:45,381 --> 02:56:46,621
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a kiosk base.

1780
02:56:46,661 --> 02:56:48,882
[SPEAKER_18]: There's, again, breakfast in the classroom base.

1781
02:56:48,902 --> 02:57:04,345
[SPEAKER_18]: There's other components that we can look at and really to address all of the needs in terms of being able to offer that, but also doing a full year's review of the potential for

1782
02:57:05,154 --> 02:57:06,635
[SPEAKER_18]: reimbursement and that funding.

1783
02:57:06,835 --> 02:57:20,180
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, you know, understanding that, yes, we would have to make a significant push on our free and reduced applications, and then we do lose sight of some of that going forward once we do engage in that program.

1784
02:57:20,580 --> 02:57:23,061
[SPEAKER_31]: What are the next steps for your department?

1785
02:57:24,001 --> 02:57:34,445
[SPEAKER_18]: So in terms of the Food Service Department, we would need to, again, get the locations of each of the

1786
02:57:35,093 --> 02:57:41,478
[SPEAKER_18]: school buildings and having the ability to provide lunch on a large scale, I'm sorry, breakfast at the large scale.

1787
02:57:41,859 --> 02:57:47,744
[SPEAKER_18]: So some of the staffing is right now not engaged because of the current numbers.

1788
02:57:48,084 --> 02:57:58,993
[SPEAKER_18]: So we would have to look at additional staffing in some of these buildings in order to provide a full participation level expected for free breakfast.

1789
02:57:59,333 --> 02:58:02,115
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are some of the cost factors that we'd have to review.

1790
02:58:02,456 --> 02:58:04,077
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's important that we look at

1791
02:58:04,517 --> 02:58:31,917
[SPEAKER_18]: all of the information that we get from a full year or at least the broader scope of the year, rather than just one October one count snapshot to look at the potential and possibility of the reimbursement component and what that means for the schools themselves and engage in having the principals understand that there would be a change within their buildings related to the delivery of breakfast.

1792
02:58:33,142 --> 02:58:33,522
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1793
02:58:33,682 --> 02:58:34,342
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you all set, Ms.

1794
02:58:34,362 --> 02:58:34,803
[SPEAKER_31]: Vandekloot?

1795
02:58:35,723 --> 02:58:35,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1796
02:58:36,423 --> 02:58:36,823
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1797
02:58:37,383 --> 02:58:38,004
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Rousseau.

1798
02:58:38,384 --> 02:58:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1799
02:58:39,224 --> 02:58:47,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm only in my second year, my first term, but I'm already bored talking about whether after-the-bell breakfast is the best option or not.

1800
02:58:49,608 --> 02:58:54,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to make a motion that we will implement provision two by October 1st of this year.

1801
02:58:54,129 --> 02:58:57,550
[SPEAKER_31]: I think there's research that has to be done.

1802
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:59,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there isn't.

1803
02:58:59,151 --> 02:58:59,991
[SPEAKER_03]: My motion stands.

1804
02:59:01,772 --> 02:59:02,392
[SPEAKER_31]: Second on the floor.

1805
02:59:06,742 --> 02:59:12,005
[SPEAKER_37]: I just feel that this is... We've been down this path before.

1806
02:59:12,025 --> 02:59:18,447
[SPEAKER_37]: We need to do research and look at what's feasible.

1807
02:59:18,808 --> 02:59:26,211
[SPEAKER_37]: To say that we're going to implement something in October without even knowing what's actually feasible just doesn't seem like a sound decision to me.

1808
02:59:26,951 --> 02:59:27,952
[SPEAKER_03]: May I respond?

1809
02:59:28,012 --> 02:59:28,632
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Russo.

1810
02:59:28,932 --> 02:59:35,675
[SPEAKER_03]: What's not a sound decision is that we don't have after the bell breakfast at three of the four elementary schools.

1811
02:59:36,868 --> 02:59:38,809
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not an undoable thing.

1812
02:59:38,829 --> 02:59:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: The Columbus is not some special school.

1813
02:59:43,490 --> 02:59:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not done at the other schools for reasons that are not acceptable reasons.

1814
02:59:48,831 --> 02:59:51,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And their participation rates are pathetic.

1815
02:59:53,372 --> 02:59:59,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think 93% of the kids getting to eat at Columbus is enough reason to make it that we just do it anyways.

1816
03:00:01,353 --> 03:00:03,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you think that we should go another couple of years and not feed the kids.

1817
03:00:03,435 --> 03:00:04,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I would want to get the numbers.

1818
03:00:04,736 --> 03:00:07,398
[SPEAKER_37]: I would have to get the numbers for the other elementary schools.

1819
03:00:07,558 --> 03:00:10,980
[SPEAKER_37]: I would speak to the principals to find out what is happening.

1820
03:00:11,020 --> 03:00:19,827
[SPEAKER_37]: I know that Columbus has a different setup than the other schools, but some students may be eating breakfast at home and not eating at school.

1821
03:00:20,207 --> 03:00:21,188
[SPEAKER_37]: That is also an option.

1822
03:00:21,288 --> 03:00:22,769
[SPEAKER_37]: Or they may not like what's being offered.

1823
03:00:26,230 --> 03:00:31,452
[SPEAKER_37]: So I can't say you're going to get the numbers of 93% at the remaining other three schools.

1824
03:00:31,492 --> 03:00:33,092
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not convinced that that is the case.

1825
03:00:36,193 --> 03:00:36,973
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Benedetto.

1826
03:00:37,353 --> 03:00:37,753
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1827
03:00:38,954 --> 03:00:46,676
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm a proponent for breakfast before, after, during, whenever the bell rings.

1828
03:00:46,696 --> 03:00:48,017
[SPEAKER_32]: We all are.

1829
03:00:49,177 --> 03:00:55,859
[SPEAKER_32]: No student should, no student can focus on reading, math,

1830
03:00:56,423 --> 03:00:57,703
[SPEAKER_32]: anything if they're hungry.

1831
03:00:58,644 --> 03:00:59,064
[SPEAKER_32]: They can't.

1832
03:00:59,604 --> 03:01:09,327
[SPEAKER_32]: So my question is, how long and how quickly could we do the research necessary so we can begin this for the beginning of next year?

1833
03:01:09,687 --> 03:01:11,327
[SPEAKER_32]: Just answer some of the questions.

1834
03:01:11,527 --> 03:01:25,211
[SPEAKER_32]: And I have one question, is I know that if we're not collecting free and reduced lunch paperwork, that also affects our high school students when they're applying for SAT exams, because they get them

1835
03:01:25,870 --> 03:01:26,691
[SPEAKER_32]: for less money.

1836
03:01:27,271 --> 03:01:31,995
[SPEAKER_32]: When they apply for colleges, they get reduced rates for their college applications.

1837
03:01:32,335 --> 03:01:34,797
[SPEAKER_32]: So year one, we're doing the applications.

1838
03:01:35,258 --> 03:01:43,884
[SPEAKER_32]: On year two, we still, as a district, have to collect those forms so that way our high school students still receive those benefits.

1839
03:01:44,225 --> 03:01:54,653
[SPEAKER_32]: And I don't want it to be done less important, because it is very important for those kids in order to apply for their colleges and take their

1840
03:01:54,970 --> 03:01:56,331
[SPEAKER_32]: PSATs and SATs.

1841
03:01:56,391 --> 03:01:57,932
[SPEAKER_32]: I know we pay for PSATs now.

1842
03:01:58,393 --> 03:02:05,058
[SPEAKER_32]: But those are other issues that we need to see how it affects by not doing that paperwork on an annual basis.

1843
03:02:05,618 --> 03:02:07,419
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm all for it.

1844
03:02:07,439 --> 03:02:10,101
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because you don't have to doesn't mean you can't.

1845
03:02:11,562 --> 03:02:15,746
[SPEAKER_31]: Because their program is once every four years doesn't mean you can't continue to... No, no.

1846
03:02:15,806 --> 03:02:20,629
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to stress the importance that there are reasons to still collect those papers.

1847
03:02:22,172 --> 03:02:34,398
[SPEAKER_32]: There's things that people don't see in these programs that it also, it continues not just free lunch, free and reduced lunch, it also affects other programming that our students apply for.

1848
03:02:34,818 --> 03:02:41,561
[SPEAKER_32]: So even though this program says we wouldn't have to collect it, I would still want that data for the district as well.

1849
03:02:43,802 --> 03:02:49,025
[SPEAKER_31]: Just the question was, how much time would it take you to do your research to implement for September?

1850
03:02:49,955 --> 03:03:10,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I believe that we're already in motion to do some of this work, so I think that that's what is a positive, that we are working with agencies as well as other entities to look at the feasibility and really be able to provide a better confirmation of what the actual numbers would look like.

1851
03:03:10,911 --> 03:03:18,997
[SPEAKER_18]: To your point, Mr. Benedetto, is that we do lose some structure in terms of the free and reduced accounts.

1852
03:03:20,353 --> 03:03:27,575
[SPEAKER_18]: If we're offering free breakfast, there's an inclination not to fill out a form because they might feel that lunch is automatic.

1853
03:03:27,675 --> 03:03:35,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's some give and take in terms of what we would actually be communicating with our families.

1854
03:03:35,818 --> 03:03:47,881
[SPEAKER_18]: And that we certainly advocate and want to provide as many families as possible with their potential of a free and or reduced meal in breakfast and lunch.

1855
03:03:48,001 --> 03:03:50,022
[SPEAKER_18]: And we want to encourage that participation

1856
03:03:50,505 --> 03:03:54,848
[SPEAKER_18]: across all of those areas in all of our school buildings.

1857
03:03:54,928 --> 03:04:03,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Because again, you need to be nourished and fed in order to focus and be attentive within your school.

1858
03:04:04,334 --> 03:04:07,496
[SPEAKER_32]: So would you be able to provide that report by our next meeting?

1859
03:04:07,536 --> 03:04:08,456
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely not.

1860
03:04:08,837 --> 03:04:09,177
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1861
03:04:09,217 --> 03:04:10,538
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's the time frame.

1862
03:04:10,598 --> 03:04:16,762
[SPEAKER_32]: I need to know when would you be able to provide this body with the information so we can move forward for next year.

1863
03:04:17,102 --> 03:04:17,422
[SPEAKER_32]: That's all.

1864
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:38,489
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to know before we vote on that, if you say, I need till the end of June and before we disperse for the summer, that's great, but if we're going to, I just want to make sure something's in place, that we have all the information, but we still move forward, as my colleague motioned, to make sure our students are fed as well.

1865
03:04:38,589 --> 03:04:41,871
[SPEAKER_18]: The last committee meeting in June is the 17th.

1866
03:04:42,111 --> 03:04:46,333
[SPEAKER_18]: That is pressing it, that's condensing it significantly.

1867
03:04:47,297 --> 03:04:52,038
[SPEAKER_18]: As I mentioned, I'm having a representative from SNA come out before the end of this month.

1868
03:04:52,559 --> 03:04:59,220
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a lot of consolidation of information as well as trying to finalize the general budget.

1869
03:04:59,961 --> 03:05:09,263
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will make every effort to compile that information as well as the additional staffing requirements and conversations with the principals on impact within their building.

1870
03:05:10,543 --> 03:05:15,385
[SPEAKER_18]: But in terms of turning this around within two weeks, I cannot provide that.

1871
03:05:15,405 --> 03:05:16,205
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not feasible.

1872
03:05:16,812 --> 03:05:18,593
[SPEAKER_37]: This was a report to inform.

1873
03:05:18,653 --> 03:05:20,553
[SPEAKER_37]: This was not a recommendation to approve.

1874
03:05:20,573 --> 03:05:25,715
[SPEAKER_37]: This was a report to inform everyone about the Project Bread initiatives.

1875
03:05:25,815 --> 03:05:28,416
[SPEAKER_37]: This was not a recommendation to approve.

1876
03:05:30,096 --> 03:05:32,037
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to just make one comment.

1877
03:05:32,137 --> 03:05:35,578
[SPEAKER_31]: We're well aware of the food insecurity issues that the city of Medford faces.

1878
03:05:35,978 --> 03:05:37,299
[SPEAKER_31]: Quite alarming, actually.

1879
03:05:37,919 --> 03:05:44,201
[SPEAKER_31]: In speaking with the Greater Boston Food Bank, statistics are much higher than I think any one of us would think.

1880
03:05:44,749 --> 03:05:47,230
[SPEAKER_31]: in our city, so it's really important that we do something.

1881
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:55,052
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm not gonna repeat everybody, but nourishment for the soul and the mind goes a very long way, so we need to do something.

1882
03:05:56,292 --> 03:06:00,633
[SPEAKER_31]: But I think that due respect be given to the office that they can do their proper research.

1883
03:06:01,494 --> 03:06:01,874
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all.

1884
03:06:04,334 --> 03:06:05,875
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Giroux's next in.

1885
03:06:06,595 --> 03:06:13,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So as an educator, former educator, I can tell you that there are students in Medford that the only time they have a real meal

1886
03:06:14,227 --> 03:06:14,788
[SPEAKER_04]: is at school.

1887
03:06:15,608 --> 03:06:16,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that for a fact.

1888
03:06:18,511 --> 03:06:25,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I share member Ruseau's energy in making sure we get this done.

1889
03:06:25,318 --> 03:06:29,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Our job as a school committee member is to make sure that we're devoting the right time in the right places.

1890
03:06:30,582 --> 03:06:34,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely understand that we can't get the research done in two weeks.

1891
03:06:35,404 --> 03:06:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I don't need to see the research, because I know that there is a significant portion of students that the only time they eat is at lunch regularly.

1892
03:06:44,409 --> 03:06:46,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, they're just grabbing a snack maybe every so often.

1893
03:06:47,571 --> 03:06:49,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to make this a priority.

1894
03:06:49,351 --> 03:06:51,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the effect it has on children.

1895
03:06:51,212 --> 03:06:56,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taught in both kinds of schools, schools where they have a lunch in homeroom and schools without it.

1896
03:06:56,795 --> 03:06:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you there's a marked difference.

1897
03:07:01,078 --> 03:07:03,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else doesn't have anything else to say on this issue?

1898
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:04,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can move the question.

1899
03:07:05,182 --> 03:07:09,326
[SPEAKER_31]: Are there others who want to speak?

1900
03:07:09,346 --> 03:07:09,426
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

1901
03:07:09,446 --> 03:07:09,846
[SPEAKER_31]: Vander Ploot.

1902
03:07:10,547 --> 03:07:20,276
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm sort of caught here because I think that it's so clear, the message that this committee is sending is clear.

1903
03:07:20,736 --> 03:07:25,801
[SPEAKER_25]: The members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students free

1904
03:07:27,635 --> 03:07:37,002
[SPEAKER_25]: to adopting provision 2, so to enable our students, the possibility of, all of our students, the possibility of free breakfast.

1905
03:07:38,243 --> 03:07:44,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm reluctant to vote on it without having a report back.

1906
03:07:44,808 --> 03:07:46,930
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's a courtesy to our administration.

1907
03:07:47,467 --> 03:07:52,910
[SPEAKER_25]: I hear from Sarah that they wanted to report to us tonight.

1908
03:07:53,410 --> 03:08:08,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that we could make the resolution, if my colleague was willing to withdraw his, to say that the members of the Medford School Committee are committed to providing our students with nutritious breakfast options.

1909
03:08:08,678 --> 03:08:10,319
[SPEAKER_25]: And to that end, they want to support

1910
03:08:14,010 --> 03:08:29,728
[SPEAKER_25]: uh, project, uh, sorry, provision two, uh, breakfast model, um, uh, that we, and further that we are asking, uh, for a, a follow-up from administration at the meeting of June 17th.

1911
03:08:33,407 --> 03:08:35,148
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Russo, you're the maker of the motion.

1912
03:08:35,488 --> 03:08:36,489
[SPEAKER_31]: Would you accept Ms.

1913
03:08:36,529 --> 03:08:37,449
[SPEAKER_31]: Vander Kloof's motion?

1914
03:08:37,469 --> 03:08:41,531
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a little long, so I'm not sure.

1915
03:08:41,611 --> 03:08:42,111
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know.

1916
03:08:42,231 --> 03:08:44,172
[SPEAKER_25]: I said June 17th, that meeting.

1917
03:08:44,192 --> 03:08:48,494
[SPEAKER_31]: June 17th, get a report back that the school committee goes on record in support of provision two.

1918
03:08:48,514 --> 03:08:51,076
[SPEAKER_31]: That's basically it.

1919
03:08:51,096 --> 03:08:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, exactly.

1920
03:08:51,716 --> 03:08:59,360
[SPEAKER_03]: If this were going to be on the agenda for the 17th, and we would be voting for it or not, depending on what we hear, I would be OK with that.

1921
03:09:01,032 --> 03:09:01,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So you withdraw.

1922
03:09:01,833 --> 03:09:06,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be another report where we can take a decision when we're deciding.

1923
03:09:06,215 --> 03:09:09,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be information to make a decision.

1924
03:09:09,197 --> 03:09:12,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't just teach kids who were hungry.

1925
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I was one of those kids who didn't eat breakfast ever.

1926
03:09:16,342 --> 03:09:18,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I went to school, there wasn't a breakfast program.

1927
03:09:20,024 --> 03:09:25,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I hear a lot about how hard it's going to be, maybe how much it's going to cost or not cost.

1928
03:09:26,329 --> 03:09:27,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't hear anything about these kids.

1929
03:09:29,676 --> 03:09:31,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually the only reason I ran for office.

1930
03:09:31,798 --> 03:09:33,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about that part.

1931
03:09:33,058 --> 03:09:36,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the other way around.

1932
03:09:36,621 --> 03:09:43,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not okay with going into another September where only 11% of the kids at the Roberts are eating breakfast.

1933
03:09:44,687 --> 03:09:49,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think that they're not the Brooks, they're much more like Columbus with 93%.

1934
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:52,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say, what is that?

1935
03:09:52,352 --> 03:09:55,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 85%, 82% of these kids are not eating breakfast.

1936
03:09:56,195 --> 03:09:56,635
[SPEAKER_03]: That would.

1937
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:02,260
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's not a, if we have to move mountains, then we move mountains.

1938
03:10:02,940 --> 03:10:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be fine with changing the motion till the 17th, we'll be able to decide whether to do it.

1939
03:10:11,302 --> 03:10:11,642
[SPEAKER_31]: Second.

1940
03:10:12,002 --> 03:10:13,462
[SPEAKER_31]: We have a motion now on the floor.

1941
03:10:14,143 --> 03:10:15,443
[SPEAKER_31]: A different amendment.

1942
03:10:16,203 --> 03:10:18,484
[SPEAKER_31]: Hold on, we have Kathy that's in the queue.

1943
03:10:19,544 --> 03:10:19,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1944
03:10:19,764 --> 03:10:19,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1945
03:10:20,004 --> 03:10:20,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Kurtz.

1946
03:10:20,604 --> 03:10:28,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I wanted to just share that I really agree with all of my colleagues that nutrition for breakfast is so important,

1947
03:10:29,852 --> 03:10:34,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I feel like we do need a little bit more information.

1948
03:10:35,396 --> 03:10:40,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So, are we going to have more information by the June 17th regarding the fees?

1949
03:10:40,599 --> 03:10:40,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1950
03:10:40,699 --> 03:10:41,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we are.

1951
03:10:41,200 --> 03:10:41,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1952
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:44,282
[SPEAKER_31]: It will be an agenda item June 17th on the specific topic.

1953
03:10:44,522 --> 03:10:47,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And what about capturing all the free and reduced applications?

1954
03:10:48,045 --> 03:10:50,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think I heard that we have to have that.

1955
03:10:52,187 --> 03:10:58,069
[SPEAKER_11]: for the first year, we want to get all that information for the first year, so that... Sarah, is that this first year being September of 19?

1956
03:10:58,109 --> 03:10:58,329
[SPEAKER_31]: Right.

1957
03:10:58,349 --> 03:11:02,131
[SPEAKER_29]: So, just again, again, this was a recommendation.

1958
03:11:02,291 --> 03:11:09,954
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, based on financial, as I said, estimations, so again, of course, Christine needs time to go back and really provide a much more detailed report.

1959
03:11:10,674 --> 03:11:21,078
[SPEAKER_29]: And so, if the administration and together with the school committee decide to pursue this, then you would launch into a year where you collected this information and it needs approval by the state.

1960
03:11:22,100 --> 03:11:24,786
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not something that you just jump into quickly.

1961
03:11:25,688 --> 03:11:34,814
[SPEAKER_29]: The other thing that I want to emphasize, because I think there's been some confusion, is there's two different issues here with breakfast.

1962
03:11:35,014 --> 03:11:36,615
[SPEAKER_29]: One is around provision two.

1963
03:11:36,795 --> 03:11:42,518
[SPEAKER_29]: There are different financial models to run a breakfast program to create sort of a free model.

1964
03:11:42,538 --> 03:11:43,819
[SPEAKER_29]: There's provision two.

1965
03:11:43,839 --> 03:11:45,500
[SPEAKER_29]: There's community eligibility provision.

1966
03:11:45,740 --> 03:11:49,763
[SPEAKER_29]: We will not discuss that tonight or possibly ever.

1967
03:11:50,063 --> 03:11:51,964
[SPEAKER_29]: But then there's the actual breakfast model.

1968
03:11:52,484 --> 03:11:54,946
[SPEAKER_29]: And as the superintendent's very aware of,

1969
03:11:55,506 --> 03:11:57,728
[SPEAKER_29]: There's just the traditional cafeteria model.

1970
03:11:57,748 --> 03:11:59,589
[SPEAKER_29]: There's breakfast in the classroom, grab and go.

1971
03:11:59,949 --> 03:12:07,374
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's a whole operational component that involves teachers and principals and how do you actually make sure kids are being fed.

1972
03:12:07,454 --> 03:12:11,937
[SPEAKER_29]: And that is a separate conversation after you sort of figure out the financial piece.

1973
03:12:12,277 --> 03:12:17,720
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's a conversation that wouldn't be had until like next year is well underway.

1974
03:12:18,621 --> 03:12:21,783
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just wanted to clarify that so you're not having to just

1975
03:12:22,402 --> 03:12:25,184
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, eat the entire apple at once.

1976
03:12:25,585 --> 03:12:34,853
[SPEAKER_29]: But this is like sort of the first few steps to just begin to consider what is right for Medford and sort of right for all of the schools because they're all in different places and have different needs.

1977
03:12:35,433 --> 03:12:42,480
[SPEAKER_29]: And not every elementary school is actually going to be served correctly by the same model.

1978
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:51,988
[SPEAKER_29]: I think in the end, but could be served like globally, possibly by provision to at least financially, but then by a different specific model.

1979
03:12:52,008 --> 03:12:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1980
03:12:53,009 --> 03:12:54,150
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1981
03:12:54,170 --> 03:12:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Ruggiero, did you have one last comment?

1982
03:12:55,531 --> 03:12:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I withdraw my comment.

1983
03:12:56,792 --> 03:12:57,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1984
03:12:57,072 --> 03:12:57,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz, you're all set.

1985
03:12:58,954 --> 03:13:02,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I wanted to know, would the motion have to be reworded?

1986
03:13:03,982 --> 03:13:07,725
[SPEAKER_11]: where it might adopt a different model for each elementary school.

1987
03:13:08,145 --> 03:13:18,593
[SPEAKER_31]: It seems like it's not gonna be the- I think that on the 17th, we will get information back from the financial office that will make a recommendation on a plan.

1988
03:13:18,613 --> 03:13:18,913
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1989
03:13:18,953 --> 03:13:19,073
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1990
03:13:22,155 --> 03:13:25,037
[SPEAKER_31]: On the motion by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1991
03:13:25,177 --> 03:13:25,818
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot.

1992
03:13:27,719 --> 03:13:28,460
[SPEAKER_31]: Roll call or?

1993
03:13:29,568 --> 03:13:30,208
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

1994
03:13:30,689 --> 03:13:30,749
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

1995
03:13:30,969 --> 03:13:31,669
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

1996
03:13:31,890 --> 03:13:32,570
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

1997
03:13:33,170 --> 03:13:33,571
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1998
03:13:34,531 --> 03:13:35,052
[SPEAKER_31]: Doctor.

1999
03:13:35,852 --> 03:13:36,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Doctor, doctor.

2000
03:13:37,994 --> 03:13:48,020
[SPEAKER_31]: This is a report on Massachusetts General Hospital Research Initiative to Understand and Reduce Cannabis Use in Adolescents by Dr. Randy Schuster.

2001
03:13:50,362 --> 03:13:50,562
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

2002
03:13:51,843 --> 03:13:52,343
[SPEAKER_27]: You studied?

2003
03:13:52,863 --> 03:13:53,224
[SPEAKER_27]: You're good?

2004
03:13:53,364 --> 03:13:53,664
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2005
03:13:56,102 --> 03:13:59,424
[SPEAKER_27]: Your endurance is impressive.

2006
03:14:01,205 --> 03:14:03,727
[SPEAKER_27]: This is no joke.

2007
03:14:04,687 --> 03:14:06,528
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for sticking with this.

2008
03:14:07,829 --> 03:14:09,010
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for having me back.

2009
03:14:09,891 --> 03:14:12,072
[SPEAKER_27]: I was here a few months ago to talk about

2010
03:14:12,990 --> 03:14:13,611
[SPEAKER_27]: the science.

2011
03:14:14,211 --> 03:14:20,036
[SPEAKER_27]: Can I ask for permission to skip everything where I try to convince you that marijuana is a problem in kids?

2012
03:14:20,096 --> 03:14:22,638
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and we have Penny's in the room there.

2013
03:14:22,699 --> 03:14:24,200
[SPEAKER_31]: Penny, yes, we know.

2014
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:26,702
[SPEAKER_27]: And Dr. Tony.

2015
03:14:27,703 --> 03:14:29,104
[SPEAKER_27]: We're all on the same page about that.

2016
03:14:29,184 --> 03:14:29,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, good.

2017
03:14:29,925 --> 03:14:36,430
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd rather spend, you have a copy of the slides where, again, where I'm just trying to tell you that

2018
03:14:38,793 --> 03:14:39,873
[SPEAKER_27]: Use has not gone down.

2019
03:14:39,893 --> 03:14:47,380
[SPEAKER_27]: This will become a, if it is not already a real issue in Medford, it will be very soon.

2020
03:14:49,001 --> 03:14:58,189
[SPEAKER_27]: 479 Broadway Street is looking like a potential place for first of probably three dispensaries in Medford.

2021
03:15:00,991 --> 03:15:03,993
[SPEAKER_27]: The way kids are using is very different than the way

2022
03:15:07,190 --> 03:15:12,993
[SPEAKER_27]: My parents used marijuana potentially 10, 20 years ago.

2023
03:15:13,053 --> 03:15:14,854
[SPEAKER_27]: The product's much more potent than ever.

2024
03:15:14,894 --> 03:15:15,974
[SPEAKER_27]: It's difficult to detect.

2025
03:15:16,354 --> 03:15:21,457
[SPEAKER_27]: Kids are using at school, and we're having a really hard time determining who's using and who's not.

2026
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:42,173
[SPEAKER_27]: So what I want to just spend our time talking about, and feel free to give me the, okay, wrap it up motion, is I just want to answer your questions and tell you a little bit about the work that I do, the studies that I'm running right now.

2027
03:15:43,113 --> 03:15:46,954
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure there are a lot of questions about what this actually looks like in a school-based setting.

2028
03:15:47,594 --> 03:15:54,635
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been running this project since 2015 in schools across the Commonwealth, so we have a lot of experience doing that.

2029
03:15:55,715 --> 03:15:56,796
[SPEAKER_27]: I am a Medford resident.

2030
03:15:56,836 --> 03:15:58,697
[SPEAKER_27]: I would love nothing more to bring this home.

2031
03:15:59,677 --> 03:16:01,758
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me just tell you a little bit about the mission.

2032
03:16:01,798 --> 03:16:03,039
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm a neuropsychologist.

2033
03:16:03,999 --> 03:16:11,523
[SPEAKER_27]: My work is really aimed at understanding the impact of early drug use on the developing brain, and particularly how that interfaces in the classroom.

2034
03:16:11,923 --> 03:16:20,808
[SPEAKER_27]: So I really want to know how using marijuana during adolescence might keep kids from achieving at their best potential.

2035
03:16:22,420 --> 03:16:29,482
[SPEAKER_27]: So the studies that we are running right now, I'm going to refer to this really as one study because one's just a logical extension of the next.

2036
03:16:29,882 --> 03:16:31,783
[SPEAKER_27]: These are an abstinence-based protocol.

2037
03:16:32,263 --> 03:16:38,865
[SPEAKER_27]: So essentially the goal is to understand what is the benefit that kids experience when they stop using marijuana.

2038
03:16:39,285 --> 03:16:45,267
[SPEAKER_27]: So the first myth to debunk about this work is that we are encouraging use, that we are giving marijuana to anybody.

2039
03:16:45,307 --> 03:16:46,207
[SPEAKER_27]: We are not doing that.

2040
03:16:46,547 --> 03:16:49,228
[SPEAKER_27]: We are actually incentivizing kids to stop using.

2041
03:16:50,384 --> 03:16:53,646
[SPEAKER_27]: So we recruit marijuana users and non-users.

2042
03:16:53,706 --> 03:16:59,869
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now our age range is 10 to 19, because 10-year-olds, this is still an issue, right?

2043
03:16:59,929 --> 03:17:02,530
[SPEAKER_27]: This is an issue as early as middle school.

2044
03:17:04,635 --> 03:17:10,058
[SPEAKER_27]: And if they're identified as a marijuana user, they're randomized to stop using marijuana.

2045
03:17:10,078 --> 03:17:14,621
[SPEAKER_27]: And we incentivize them with a payment structure that has been found to be effective.

2046
03:17:14,641 --> 03:17:20,505
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have about 90% of our kids that were able to confirm that they stopped using for

2047
03:17:22,679 --> 03:17:23,801
[SPEAKER_27]: the period of the study.

2048
03:17:23,861 --> 03:17:39,639
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have a 30-day study, 30-day abstinence study, and are about to launch a six-month abstinence study, where we'll pay kids to stop using for a full six months, which is really incredible because in that project we'll be able to look at the impact of

2049
03:17:40,603 --> 03:17:49,405
[SPEAKER_27]: really long-term abstinence on peer networks, and how they're spending time after school, and how really this interfaces in the classroom.

2050
03:17:50,925 --> 03:17:55,086
[SPEAKER_27]: So the way that we do, just kind of the nuts and bolts about how we do this study.

2051
03:17:55,486 --> 03:17:59,987
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm gonna tell you the way that we've been doing it in other schools.

2052
03:18:00,527 --> 03:18:02,867
[SPEAKER_27]: So all of my work has been community-based.

2053
03:18:03,087 --> 03:18:06,668
[SPEAKER_27]: So to the extent to which any of these actual methods

2054
03:18:07,965 --> 03:18:10,926
[SPEAKER_27]: don't feel quite right, they can all be negotiated.

2055
03:18:12,066 --> 03:18:19,968
[SPEAKER_27]: So the way that we found this to be effective is that we screen the student body at the beginning of the year.

2056
03:18:20,468 --> 03:18:24,989
[SPEAKER_27]: And essentially the way that we do this is we do it through a passive consent process.

2057
03:18:25,069 --> 03:18:32,591
[SPEAKER_27]: So we send a letter home to all of the parents, and we have the letters translated in whatever languages are necessary for the student body.

2058
03:18:33,671 --> 03:18:37,332
[SPEAKER_27]: And we say, MGH is going to be coming to the school on

2059
03:18:38,073 --> 03:18:38,493
[SPEAKER_27]: this day.

2060
03:18:39,094 --> 03:18:43,337
[SPEAKER_27]: If you don't want your child completing this screening, let us know.

2061
03:18:43,778 --> 03:18:45,679
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll opt you out of screening.

2062
03:18:46,140 --> 03:18:51,284
[SPEAKER_27]: Certainly if, and historically we have about 1% of parents opt out of screening.

2063
03:18:51,404 --> 03:18:56,888
[SPEAKER_27]: So it is not a large number of parents who have a concern with asking these questionnaires.

2064
03:18:57,349 --> 03:18:58,830
[SPEAKER_27]: It's about a two minute questionnaire.

2065
03:18:59,290 --> 03:19:01,612
[SPEAKER_27]: So we ask questions about basic demographics,

2066
03:19:02,267 --> 03:19:08,133
[SPEAKER_27]: rates of alcohol use, marijuana use, as well as nicotine and electronic cigarette use.

2067
03:19:09,554 --> 03:19:14,679
[SPEAKER_27]: On the last page of the screening, so kids can answer this, assuming they haven't been withdrawn by their parents.

2068
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:21,025
[SPEAKER_27]: Kids can answer the questionnaire completely anonymously.

2069
03:19:21,045 --> 03:19:24,809
[SPEAKER_27]: So they don't have to provide any information if they choose to actually complete the questionnaire.

2070
03:19:26,367 --> 03:19:42,341
[SPEAKER_27]: If they are interested in even hearing about the study, they provide us some basic contact information where we can then reach out to them, talk to their parents about the active study, and seek written parental consent to enroll in the study.

2071
03:19:42,682 --> 03:19:42,922
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay?

2072
03:19:43,603 --> 03:19:45,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, please.

2073
03:19:51,072 --> 03:19:54,194
I'm going to ask if you're familiar with this.

2074
03:19:54,554 --> 03:19:59,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Would this survey be at the same time that the ESSPRT screening is?

2075
03:20:00,056 --> 03:20:00,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2076
03:20:00,837 --> 03:20:03,538
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this would start early in the school year.

2077
03:20:03,558 --> 03:20:08,620
[SPEAKER_13]: ESSPRT is typically conducted between January and March.

2078
03:20:08,821 --> 03:20:13,783
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and I'm sorry if I said it earlier, I think we missed the beginning.

2079
03:20:14,223 --> 03:20:18,065
[SPEAKER_27]: When did you have this and which grade and what time of the class time?

2080
03:20:19,360 --> 03:20:22,627
[SPEAKER_27]: This is all a point of discussion.

2081
03:20:22,727 --> 03:20:27,617
[SPEAKER_27]: So the way that this has worked in other schools, so I'll tell you two different models that we're doing right now.

2082
03:20:29,016 --> 03:20:34,940
[SPEAKER_27]: My preference is that we reach out to kids at the beginning of the academic year so that we can enroll throughout the year.

2083
03:20:36,401 --> 03:20:43,625
[SPEAKER_27]: So in one school, we send a letter home probably around the second or third week of school, and we come in to lunch.

2084
03:20:43,966 --> 03:20:47,268
[SPEAKER_27]: And we screen the entire school in about a four-hour period.

2085
03:20:48,548 --> 03:20:50,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I bring my whole team, about 25 people.

2086
03:20:51,070 --> 03:20:52,611
[SPEAKER_27]: We come in, pass out questionnaires.

2087
03:20:52,651 --> 03:20:55,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Whoever's interested in doing that, we collect it, take it back to the lab.

2088
03:20:56,113 --> 03:20:58,894
[SPEAKER_27]: and then reach out to parents of kids who are potentially eligible.

2089
03:20:59,514 --> 03:21:03,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Another school, we do a similar opt-out consent, same time of year.

2090
03:21:04,395 --> 03:21:09,476
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't have a closed campus for lunch, so we can't do that same model, but they have homerooms.

2091
03:21:09,956 --> 03:21:12,677
[SPEAKER_27]: So we do, and that we do all of the surveys electronically.

2092
03:21:12,757 --> 03:21:22,999
[SPEAKER_27]: All of the kids in this district have laptops during the academic day, so we've sent home a secure survey link that they filled out during this 15-minute homeroom period.

2093
03:21:24,228 --> 03:21:32,852
[SPEAKER_27]: So the short answer is my preference is that we do it at the beginning of the year because it is a labor-intensive study on our part, so we have the full academic year to enroll.

2094
03:21:34,212 --> 03:21:41,716
[SPEAKER_27]: But exactly how that looks like is dependent on what the school day looks like for Medford.

2095
03:21:42,196 --> 03:21:47,518
[SPEAKER_27]: In the letter that we send home to parents, we make it very, very clear because we do want to distinguish

2096
03:21:47,985 --> 03:21:51,866
[SPEAKER_27]: this from SBIRT or the YRBS, which is a program of the school.

2097
03:21:51,926 --> 03:21:55,886
[SPEAKER_27]: We make it very clear this is not a program of Medford Public Schools.

2098
03:21:56,286 --> 03:21:58,267
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a program of MGH.

2099
03:21:58,647 --> 03:22:00,567
[SPEAKER_27]: You do not have to participate in this.

2100
03:22:01,007 --> 03:22:07,648
[SPEAKER_27]: No teachers or administrators would have any knowledge of, yes or no, whether or not your child filled this out.

2101
03:22:07,968 --> 03:22:12,289
[SPEAKER_27]: So it is completely independent of all other substance use screening that may be happening in the school.

2102
03:22:12,609 --> 03:22:16,010
[SPEAKER_15]: So does any of the work fall under the statutes of yours?

2103
03:22:16,150 --> 03:22:16,270
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2104
03:22:18,363 --> 03:22:18,503
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2105
03:22:19,043 --> 03:22:23,525
[SPEAKER_27]: So the one thing that I need help with is just that initial distribution of the letter.

2106
03:22:24,085 --> 03:22:35,409
[SPEAKER_27]: I can mail that letter home, or at one school we have, there's a principal blast that goes out, or a blog where we can post the letter.

2107
03:22:36,509 --> 03:22:41,391
[SPEAKER_27]: But just some, I just need help figuring out what's the best way to make this letter known to parents.

2108
03:22:43,172 --> 03:22:46,012
[SPEAKER_27]: But aside from that, all on us.

2109
03:22:49,609 --> 03:22:52,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So on this question, so the children pulled out the

2110
03:22:52,889 --> 03:23:04,156
[SPEAKER_04]: the questionnaire, if they are screened as heavy users, or would it also be students that aren't screened as heavy users also be included in?

2111
03:23:04,377 --> 03:23:11,001
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's a core component of the study, is that we want marijuana users and non-users as part of the study.

2112
03:23:11,361 --> 03:23:21,428
[SPEAKER_27]: So one of the things that I need to be able to look a child in the eye and say is if superintendent sees you with me, that's not telling her anything about what you do or what you don't do.

2113
03:23:21,808 --> 03:23:24,010
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're recruiting an equal number of non-users.

2114
03:23:24,030 --> 03:23:25,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so it's going to be an equal number of non-users.

2115
03:23:26,071 --> 03:23:31,514
[SPEAKER_04]: If a child's selected, he never has to fear that he's going, because I would wonder if that would affect the methodology.

2116
03:23:31,534 --> 03:23:32,155
[SPEAKER_27]: Exactly.

2117
03:23:32,355 --> 03:23:42,822
[SPEAKER_27]: So, and the consent form that we send home to parents also states that as well, that we are asking your child, we're asking you to allow your child to enroll in this study.

2118
03:23:43,753 --> 03:23:45,294
[SPEAKER_27]: It is about marijuana use.

2119
03:23:45,734 --> 03:23:48,796
[SPEAKER_27]: This does not mean that your child uses marijuana.

2120
03:23:49,116 --> 03:23:55,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Understanding the impact of marijuana use in the developing brain requires knowing what non-users look like.

2121
03:23:56,460 --> 03:23:58,961
[SPEAKER_04]: How many students do you intend on sampling?

2122
03:23:59,121 --> 03:24:03,503
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have about 250 students enrolled so far.

2123
03:24:04,063 --> 03:24:06,925
[SPEAKER_27]: We have another two and a half.

2124
03:24:07,780 --> 03:24:10,722
[SPEAKER_27]: My guess is we're going to be at about 500.

2125
03:24:11,042 --> 03:24:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you anticipate something like you take 125 students that are not marijuana users, 125 students that are, and that's your sample pool?

2126
03:24:20,328 --> 03:24:21,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2127
03:24:22,830 --> 03:24:25,992
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2128
03:24:26,112 --> 03:24:29,414
[SPEAKER_25]: What is the incentive for students to participate?

2129
03:24:33,575 --> 03:24:35,536
[SPEAKER_27]: So the science, right?

2130
03:24:35,556 --> 03:24:36,396
[SPEAKER_27]: I've tried that cell.

2131
03:24:36,476 --> 03:24:37,696
[SPEAKER_27]: It doesn't work so well.

2132
03:24:38,576 --> 03:24:40,877
[SPEAKER_27]: So for the screening, there is no incentive.

2133
03:24:40,897 --> 03:24:42,917
[SPEAKER_27]: There is no direct incentive for the screening.

2134
03:24:42,937 --> 03:24:55,019
[SPEAKER_27]: So the screening is simply, and this has been, I wish I could, I'll show you this in a second, is really valuable information to give back to you guys right away because we get this information at the beginning of the year.

2135
03:24:55,039 --> 03:24:58,880
[SPEAKER_27]: I can add whatever questions you are interested in seeing about the school.

2136
03:25:00,245 --> 03:25:12,775
[SPEAKER_27]: that, and I can share, in the binder there's a copy of our most current screener questionnaire, so we have a lot of information about nicotine use, marijuana use, alcohol use, that there is no financial incentive for participating.

2137
03:25:13,715 --> 03:25:22,002
[SPEAKER_27]: If a child enrolls in the active study, so either the one month or the six month abstinence study, and we have written parental consent to do that,

2138
03:25:22,322 --> 03:25:24,804
[SPEAKER_27]: then they're paid to participate in this.

2139
03:25:25,144 --> 03:25:25,484
[SPEAKER_27]: How much?

2140
03:25:26,144 --> 03:25:26,665
[SPEAKER_27]: So it is $270 or $420.

2141
03:25:26,825 --> 03:25:29,567
[SPEAKER_27]: So the individuals, the non-users, and those who do not stop using marijuana get $270.

2142
03:25:29,607 --> 03:25:31,888
[SPEAKER_27]: If they stop using for 30 days, it's $420.

2143
03:25:41,993 --> 03:25:44,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you should clarify that that's a gift card.

2144
03:25:44,334 --> 03:25:45,034
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I'm sorry.

2145
03:25:45,534 --> 03:25:47,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Clarify that's a gift card, not cash.

2146
03:25:47,815 --> 03:25:49,035
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we do not give cash.

2147
03:25:49,095 --> 03:25:52,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Ethics will prohibit me from giving cash to identified marijuana users.

2148
03:25:54,417 --> 03:25:54,957
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sorry.

2149
03:25:55,577 --> 03:25:59,378
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have these cards that allow us to load money onto it remotely.

2150
03:25:59,418 --> 03:26:04,539
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can go onto my computer and I have a subject ID and I say, okay, they're confirmed to be abstinent.

2151
03:26:04,579 --> 03:26:06,240
[SPEAKER_27]: I load this much money onto the card.

2152
03:26:07,581 --> 03:26:08,782
[SPEAKER_25]: confirmed to be abstinent.

2153
03:26:09,162 --> 03:26:11,124
[SPEAKER_25]: I read it by urine test.

2154
03:26:11,204 --> 03:26:16,310
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, so we do urine drug tests for all individuals regardless of whether or not they even use marijuana.

2155
03:26:16,330 --> 03:26:18,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so month one, abstinent.

2156
03:26:19,153 --> 03:26:20,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Month two, abstinent.

2157
03:26:20,874 --> 03:26:23,457
[SPEAKER_25]: Month three, failed the urine test.

2158
03:26:23,898 --> 03:26:24,438
[SPEAKER_25]: What happens?

2159
03:26:25,679 --> 03:26:26,240
[SPEAKER_25]: No payment?

2160
03:26:26,981 --> 03:26:28,943
[SPEAKER_27]: So they would be, they pay for it based on

2161
03:26:31,303 --> 03:26:33,164
[SPEAKER_27]: not for their abstinence payment.

2162
03:26:33,184 --> 03:26:34,625
[SPEAKER_27]: So we pay them on a two-track incentive schedule.

2163
03:26:35,045 --> 03:26:37,706
[SPEAKER_27]: So they're paid for attendance as well as for demonstrated abstinence.

2164
03:26:39,127 --> 03:26:39,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2165
03:26:39,807 --> 03:26:45,790
[SPEAKER_25]: So the incentive for a child... So what if a child has used marijuana once?

2166
03:26:46,777 --> 03:26:47,817
[SPEAKER_25]: So it was a one-time thing?

2167
03:26:48,058 --> 03:26:51,059
[SPEAKER_27]: They would likely be eligible depending on when they used.

2168
03:26:51,979 --> 03:27:00,402
[SPEAKER_27]: So for our non-user eligibility criteria, they need to have used less than 10 times in their life, and no use before the age of 60, and no use in the last year.

2169
03:27:00,422 --> 03:27:08,705
[SPEAKER_27]: So if they've used one time, but it was remote and not only in adolescence, they would still be eligible to participate in the non-user group.

2170
03:27:09,606 --> 03:27:15,328
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds like there's a fair amount of interaction with the students who participate.

2171
03:27:17,377 --> 03:27:17,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2172
03:27:17,657 --> 03:27:19,999
[SPEAKER_25]: So when are they doing that interaction?

2173
03:27:20,579 --> 03:27:25,423
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, this is a point of I need to understand what the academic day looks like.

2174
03:27:25,563 --> 03:27:30,646
[SPEAKER_27]: We do not remove students from classrooms ever, ever.

2175
03:27:30,766 --> 03:27:37,831
[SPEAKER_27]: So the majority of the study visits that I conduct now in the high school setting are after school.

2176
03:27:38,852 --> 03:27:40,513
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll meet with students as

2177
03:27:41,874 --> 03:27:46,097
[SPEAKER_27]: as late as is permissible by the school.

2178
03:27:46,197 --> 03:27:49,619
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll meet with some students before school if that's their preference as well.

2179
03:27:50,339 --> 03:27:58,704
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the schools that I work in have free periods, and so that's an option if that is something that the school has.

2180
03:27:58,724 --> 03:27:59,685
[SPEAKER_27]: If the school doesn't have it,

2181
03:28:00,045 --> 03:28:01,566
[SPEAKER_27]: then it's non-negotiable.

2182
03:28:01,726 --> 03:28:03,288
[SPEAKER_27]: It will always be after school.

2183
03:28:03,348 --> 03:28:05,289
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's based on the individual student's schedule.

2184
03:28:05,689 --> 03:28:08,431
[SPEAKER_27]: So our schedule is flexible based off of what the student's available for.

2185
03:28:08,451 --> 03:28:17,438
[SPEAKER_25]: For the purposes of this study, can we say, yes, we're interested in having our students participate, but we want to limit it to 9th to 12th grade?

2186
03:28:18,732 --> 03:28:20,993
[SPEAKER_25]: so we don't necessarily have to include the younger kids?

2187
03:28:21,313 --> 03:28:22,093
[SPEAKER_27]: You do not have to.

2188
03:28:22,494 --> 03:28:22,634
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2189
03:28:22,854 --> 03:28:23,094
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2190
03:28:23,134 --> 03:28:40,561
[SPEAKER_27]: So right now we are in the process of launching in our first middle school, and that has been in response to the fact that kids are using younger and younger, and I presented at McGlynn not too long ago, and that concern was raised.

2191
03:28:42,768 --> 03:28:45,090
[SPEAKER_27]: in terms of logistics, whatever you guys want.

2192
03:28:45,610 --> 03:28:45,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

2193
03:28:45,831 --> 03:28:53,537
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just wondering in terms of, say, rolling it out, whether you might start at one age group and then, you know, say, this is how it worked or something like that.

2194
03:28:56,799 --> 03:29:07,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I just ask for this evening, what is... I don't think we're at the point of final approval.

2195
03:29:08,795 --> 03:29:11,636
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems like there's a lot of details that need to be worked out.

2196
03:29:14,296 --> 03:29:21,497
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Superintendent, could you give us an idea what you would suggest would be the way to move forward?

2197
03:29:21,517 --> 03:29:24,578
[SPEAKER_37]: June 17th?

2198
03:29:25,478 --> 03:29:28,819
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, that's going to be a busy night.

2199
03:29:29,479 --> 03:29:36,960
[SPEAKER_37]: I would like to have Toni Wray, our Director of Nursing as well, continue to work in

2200
03:29:37,900 --> 03:29:45,807
[SPEAKER_37]: probably consult with Penny as well, about how we feel the work aligns with what we're doing.

2201
03:29:47,068 --> 03:29:58,918
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a lot of conversations with Dr. Schuster about, I mean first she came to school committee to educate us on the marijuana landscape and some legislation.

2202
03:29:59,898 --> 03:30:04,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've had a lot of conversations and we've been also involved recently with

2203
03:30:05,946 --> 03:30:20,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Penny Funioli from the city side about putting together a social marketing campaign looking at reducing marijuana use and involving teens as focus group members to help us get messages out.

2204
03:30:22,126 --> 03:30:24,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the time is ripe to

2205
03:30:25,223 --> 03:30:26,604
[SPEAKER_13]: to approach a study like this.

2206
03:30:27,164 --> 03:30:31,468
[SPEAKER_13]: We are seeing increased use at our high school and middle school levels.

2207
03:30:32,488 --> 03:30:38,052
[SPEAKER_13]: It's getting easier to use because of the vaping devices and it's easily hidden.

2208
03:30:38,513 --> 03:30:39,593
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no smell.

2209
03:30:39,613 --> 03:30:43,396
[SPEAKER_13]: The time is really ripe for this.

2210
03:30:47,702 --> 03:30:48,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

2211
03:30:49,603 --> 03:30:50,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

2212
03:30:50,124 --> 03:30:57,330
[SPEAKER_13]: And for some students who may, you know, we look at, as in the academic side, you look at tiered interventions.

2213
03:30:57,410 --> 03:31:00,813
[SPEAKER_13]: In the health and wellness side, we also look at tiered interventions.

2214
03:31:02,014 --> 03:31:05,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And for some students, this will be a level 2 or a level 3 type of support.

2215
03:31:09,492 --> 03:31:23,995
[SPEAKER_13]: students need referral to counseling agencies or substance abuse counseling agencies specifically, Dr. Schuster, I mean, she can do that.

2216
03:31:24,315 --> 03:31:26,935
[SPEAKER_13]: She can also work with the school staff to do that.

2217
03:31:27,456 --> 03:31:34,737
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just an added layer of support, in my opinion, that our students can benefit from.

2218
03:31:35,353 --> 03:31:37,894
[SPEAKER_27]: May I draw your attention to just three quick things?

2219
03:31:38,114 --> 03:31:42,295
[SPEAKER_27]: So one, if you were to flip through to slide three.

2220
03:31:43,096 --> 03:31:50,258
[SPEAKER_27]: So these are just to highlight that Tony's point that really, I believe the time is now.

2221
03:31:50,358 --> 03:31:53,839
[SPEAKER_27]: So these are data collected just from, it's really small.

2222
03:31:53,939 --> 03:31:55,840
[SPEAKER_27]: It would have been very big up here, so you can trust me on this one.

2223
03:31:57,060 --> 03:32:02,143
[SPEAKER_27]: This is data over time in one of the high schools that we're doing a school-wide screening in.

2224
03:32:02,564 --> 03:32:17,374
[SPEAKER_27]: And what you see in these data here is that not only do you see a 100% increase in the number of kids over time who are experimenting with marijuana use, we see a 400% increase in the number of kids who are reporting use daily.

2225
03:32:18,454 --> 03:32:22,237
[SPEAKER_27]: And this jump happened around the point of legalization.

2226
03:32:22,257 --> 03:32:24,819
[SPEAKER_27]: This trajectory is continuing to move up.

2227
03:32:25,890 --> 03:32:33,296
[SPEAKER_27]: The second thing that I want to point out is, as Tony had mentioned in terms of tiered interventions, we don't pitch this study as a treatment study.

2228
03:32:33,777 --> 03:32:40,703
[SPEAKER_27]: So I try to come at the kids from a very non-judgmental standpoint of, tell us what you're doing.

2229
03:32:40,843 --> 03:32:45,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's be an unbiased observer of your behavior.

2230
03:32:45,687 --> 03:32:48,489
[SPEAKER_27]: And let's take the automaticity out of this.

2231
03:32:48,890 --> 03:32:52,473
[SPEAKER_27]: And at the end of the month or the six months, you make the decision for what's right for you.

2232
03:32:53,392 --> 03:33:02,644
[SPEAKER_27]: What we're seeing is that at the end of the one month study, even though this isn't a treatment study, we ask the kids, what do you want your level of marijuana use to be moving forward?

2233
03:33:02,804 --> 03:33:07,831
[SPEAKER_27]: You have the opportunity to set a goal, because a lot of the kids are saying, it's just like brushing their teeth now, right?

2234
03:33:07,871 --> 03:33:09,192
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a habit, okay?

2235
03:33:11,090 --> 03:33:16,973
[SPEAKER_27]: 65% of the kids say that they want to resume using, but at a level less than they did when they started the study.

2236
03:33:17,434 --> 03:33:29,120
[SPEAKER_27]: And when we follow them at one month later, we're seeing that across all metrics, both in terms of the number of days per week, the number of times per week, and the number of grams of marijuana they're using per week, they've cut their level use in half.

2237
03:33:30,560 --> 03:33:35,543
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a prime example of a public health risk reduction methodology.

2238
03:33:37,812 --> 03:33:38,252
[SPEAKER_31]: Very good.

2239
03:33:39,172 --> 03:33:39,813
[SPEAKER_31]: We have Ms.

2240
03:33:39,833 --> 03:33:40,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz up next.

2241
03:33:41,033 --> 03:33:41,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

2242
03:33:41,813 --> 03:33:43,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you might have answered my question.

2243
03:33:43,254 --> 03:33:52,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to know, will participation in the study, like student participation, encourage students to use marijuana, maybe to get gift cards or

2244
03:33:53,984 --> 03:33:55,484
[SPEAKER_11]: have you experienced any of that?

2245
03:33:55,504 --> 03:33:56,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely not.

2246
03:33:56,785 --> 03:34:19,872
[SPEAKER_27]: So even if they're not randomized to our stop smoking group, we meet with them nine times over the course of a one-month period, two-month period, and have so many opportunities to provide psychoeducation and help, essentially letting them know that we don't believe that this is a smart behavior at this point in their life.

2247
03:34:20,343 --> 03:34:28,725
[SPEAKER_27]: And if they choose to stop using or express any concern about their level of use and want our help to do that, we're going to do that.

2248
03:34:28,805 --> 03:34:36,927
[SPEAKER_27]: This gives us an opportunity to interface with kids who are not reaching the radar of teachers or administrators.

2249
03:34:37,928 --> 03:34:41,329
[SPEAKER_27]: So it doesn't matter to us.

2250
03:34:41,649 --> 03:34:44,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2251
03:34:45,150 --> 03:34:45,790
[SPEAKER_13]: You all set, Ms.

2252
03:34:45,830 --> 03:34:46,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Fritz?

2253
03:34:46,350 --> 03:34:46,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2254
03:34:47,608 --> 03:35:00,213
[SPEAKER_13]: It's even a support on the health education that is being done by our health educators at the high school level because these students are getting additional reinforcement of healthy behaviors and good decision making.

2255
03:35:00,954 --> 03:35:01,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

2256
03:35:01,834 --> 03:35:01,974
[SPEAKER_32]: Ms.

2257
03:35:02,014 --> 03:35:02,614
[SPEAKER_32]: DiBenedetto.

2258
03:35:03,035 --> 03:35:03,415
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2259
03:35:04,415 --> 03:35:05,756
[SPEAKER_32]: I only have two concerns.

2260
03:35:06,336 --> 03:35:15,840
[SPEAKER_32]: I wholeheartedly believe in research and the data that it can provide both for future treatments of generations of kids

2261
03:35:16,334 --> 03:35:19,635
[SPEAKER_32]: I also absolutely hate vaping.

2262
03:35:20,275 --> 03:35:27,177
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that we're going to have major health issues with our 40-year-olds that have started vaping now.

2263
03:35:27,337 --> 03:35:35,479
[SPEAKER_32]: And it makes my skin crawl because I'm so worried for this generation of people that are choosing to do that.

2264
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:41,341
[SPEAKER_32]: So I wholeheartedly want to see anything that helps our students succeed.

2265
03:35:41,921 --> 03:35:44,642
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to make sure it doesn't interfere with the academic day.

2266
03:35:45,160 --> 03:35:51,461
[SPEAKER_32]: of our children, because we're here to educate children first, as well as keep them safe.

2267
03:35:52,481 --> 03:35:53,522
[SPEAKER_32]: But I have two concerns.

2268
03:35:53,962 --> 03:35:55,942
[SPEAKER_32]: One, I don't like passive consent.

2269
03:35:56,542 --> 03:36:00,943
[SPEAKER_32]: I think there's too many areas of people not seeing that one paper.

2270
03:36:01,363 --> 03:36:03,083
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to see signed consent.

2271
03:36:03,503 --> 03:36:06,704
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like parents to know what their child is in for.

2272
03:36:07,224 --> 03:36:08,744
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's my first concern.

2273
03:36:09,045 --> 03:36:11,345
[SPEAKER_32]: And I would also like to see student consent.

2274
03:36:12,525 --> 03:36:15,526
[SPEAKER_32]: because I don't want, I want the students to buy in.

2275
03:36:16,426 --> 03:36:22,327
[SPEAKER_32]: Just from what I heard, that I was taking notes as it was, and we talked about passive consent.

2276
03:36:22,767 --> 03:36:27,788
[SPEAKER_32]: I had said that in our initial, I mean, our things as well before I came here.

2277
03:36:28,928 --> 03:36:29,968
[SPEAKER_32]: I just don't believe in that.

2278
03:36:30,088 --> 03:36:38,010
[SPEAKER_32]: I think there's too many ways that we can lose communication and trust with parents when you do that, and I think that we should have signed consent

2279
03:36:38,383 --> 03:36:39,964
[SPEAKER_32]: in this type of a situation.

2280
03:36:40,304 --> 03:36:51,871
[SPEAKER_32]: And really boast what we're trying to do as a community is to change behaviors in our youth and protect them.

2281
03:36:52,451 --> 03:37:00,076
[SPEAKER_32]: So it has to be like a big campaign that we get by and people are aware of what they're buying in.

2282
03:37:00,156 --> 03:37:02,057
[SPEAKER_32]: So those are my only two concerns.

2283
03:37:02,137 --> 03:37:06,740
[SPEAKER_32]: And when the superintendent's ready to tell us that it won't interfere,

2284
03:37:07,523 --> 03:37:14,517
[SPEAKER_32]: with programming and she feels that it's the right time to move forward with the vote on this, I respectfully wait for that.

2285
03:37:15,238 --> 03:37:18,625
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will motion at that time to move forward.

2286
03:37:19,144 --> 03:37:20,626
[SPEAKER_27]: Can I, may I clarify just one thing?

2287
03:37:20,646 --> 03:37:21,206
[SPEAKER_27]: Certainly.

2288
03:37:21,907 --> 03:37:25,611
[SPEAKER_27]: I hear your concern, and that's a point very well taken.

2289
03:37:25,671 --> 03:37:29,816
[SPEAKER_27]: I do want to clarify, we absolutely, absolutely have written parental consent.

2290
03:37:30,136 --> 03:37:32,739
[SPEAKER_27]: No student is asked... But even for the screening?

2291
03:37:32,859 --> 03:37:33,520
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yep.

2292
03:37:33,720 --> 03:37:34,702
[SPEAKER_27]: So, okay.

2293
03:37:34,822 --> 03:37:36,524
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is an option.

2294
03:37:36,604 --> 03:37:37,104
[SPEAKER_27]: So we do...

2295
03:37:39,951 --> 03:37:44,014
[SPEAKER_27]: The first PASS proposal is pass a consent for screen.

2296
03:37:44,074 --> 03:37:54,321
[SPEAKER_27]: The reason why we, our preference is to do this is we're able to essentially make this known to the students first and we're able to see who's interested in doing this.

2297
03:37:55,602 --> 03:37:58,985
[SPEAKER_27]: If that is something, and then we would approach written parental consent.

2298
03:37:59,385 --> 03:38:03,448
[SPEAKER_27]: If that's something that is just not going to apply, we do written parental consent for screen.

2299
03:38:05,203 --> 03:38:08,024
[SPEAKER_27]: It's, we have to have, that's what's approved in Wal-Mart.

2300
03:38:08,425 --> 03:38:13,667
[SPEAKER_27]: It is not, in Cambridge and Westford, we have passive consent for screening, written consent for enrollment.

2301
03:38:13,927 --> 03:38:18,269
[SPEAKER_27]: And absolutely, we have written student consent.

2302
03:38:18,369 --> 03:38:18,269
100%.

2303
03:38:18,529 --> 03:38:27,333
[SPEAKER_27]: So even if a parent says, I want my child to do this, if the child has no interest in doing this, we never meet with them.

2304
03:38:27,353 --> 03:38:27,333
100%.

2305
03:38:27,754 --> 03:38:28,534
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2306
03:38:28,574 --> 03:38:28,874
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Ojiro.

2307
03:38:28,894 --> 03:38:29,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, just,

2308
03:38:33,117 --> 03:38:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, you mentioned that on your questionnaire you can include other activities that are unhealthy.

2309
03:38:38,202 --> 03:38:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like you to expand that net as wide as you possibly can without affecting your research significantly, including questions such as obesity, perhaps TV screen time use.

2310
03:38:47,811 --> 03:38:49,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible you can include those items in your survey?

2311
03:38:50,153 --> 03:38:55,738
[SPEAKER_27]: I think so long as we are mindful of the period of time in which we're allocated to do the screening.

2312
03:38:55,778 --> 03:38:56,038
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course.

2313
03:38:57,673 --> 03:39:00,494
[SPEAKER_27]: whatever you are interested in knowing about, we can ask about.

2314
03:39:00,774 --> 03:39:07,495
[SPEAKER_27]: The reason why we cast the net narrow is because I'm mindful of the fact that we were doing passive consent for screening.

2315
03:39:07,795 --> 03:39:15,057
[SPEAKER_27]: So I didn't want to ask, I wanted to ask the bare minimum number of questions so as to not be invasive.

2316
03:39:16,457 --> 03:39:22,319
[SPEAKER_27]: To the extent to which, you know, it doesn't interfere with the research at all to ask additional questions.

2317
03:39:22,379 --> 03:39:23,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just being mindful of.

2318
03:39:23,835 --> 03:39:30,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, if we do move away from the passive consent model, will that affect the demographics of your participation?

2319
03:39:30,299 --> 03:39:30,279
100%.

2320
03:39:31,800 --> 03:39:36,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are certain communities that won't respond because their parents won't sign.

2321
03:39:36,443 --> 03:39:38,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that we have to recognize as a community.

2322
03:39:38,564 --> 03:39:43,708
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to do a truly, a true survey, perhaps passive content is the best option.

2323
03:39:44,818 --> 03:39:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate your concerns.

2324
03:39:45,800 --> 03:39:54,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no doubt that the doctor will maintain the confidentiality of all the information that the students... And we can talk about their...

2325
03:39:55,565 --> 03:39:58,708
[SPEAKER_27]: multiple models of doing a passive consent for screening.

2326
03:39:58,868 --> 03:40:09,718
[SPEAKER_27]: We can reach out to parents multiple times in multiple different modalities, making sure that we can do email, we can do mailer, we can do reverse 911 calls, whatever makes sense.

2327
03:40:10,058 --> 03:40:13,161
[SPEAKER_27]: So it doesn't have to be a one-shot deal where we make this known.

2328
03:40:13,181 --> 03:40:20,147
[SPEAKER_27]: We can give them multiple opportunities, and we can give them a month, two-month lead time to opt out of doing screening.

2329
03:40:23,193 --> 03:40:31,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I would prefer we go down that line to address Mayor DiMendito's concerns, but that's where I am.

2330
03:40:31,816 --> 03:40:32,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2331
03:40:32,236 --> 03:40:32,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2332
03:40:32,996 --> 03:40:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Rizzo.

2333
03:40:34,056 --> 03:40:38,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'd just like to second Mayor Ruggiero's comment.

2334
03:40:38,958 --> 03:40:43,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually explicitly oppose to explicit consent.

2335
03:40:44,420 --> 03:40:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's considered good enough for the community, then if it is, then we should vote to do it.

2336
03:40:50,990 --> 03:40:52,411
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not, we shouldn't be doing it.

2337
03:40:53,832 --> 03:40:59,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm very much opposed to requiring active consent to even screen.

2338
03:41:00,557 --> 03:41:03,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know I'm pretty extreme in that regard.

2339
03:41:05,982 --> 03:41:10,365
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we will await a recommendation and a vote.

2340
03:41:11,486 --> 03:41:14,128
[SPEAKER_31]: See you in June.

2341
03:41:14,148 --> 03:41:15,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very, very much.

2342
03:41:15,669 --> 03:41:17,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny, did you want to say anything?

2343
03:41:17,331 --> 03:41:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say one thing.

2344
03:41:21,107 --> 03:41:24,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what is really important about this study is that the landscape is completely changed, as was said.

2345
03:41:34,702 --> 03:41:38,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Prevention prior to legalization will not work ever again.

2346
03:41:39,466 --> 03:41:49,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have to really build up an entire program around prevention, understanding the harms, and dispelling myths that aren't true about marijuana.

2347
03:41:49,493 --> 03:41:50,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to be honest with our kids.

2348
03:41:50,834 --> 03:41:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to be honest with our families.

2349
03:41:52,714 --> 03:41:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that that's one huge benefit here is talking about harm reduction.

2350
03:41:56,758 --> 03:42:04,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I also want us to remember is this is a study that's going to go towards research that will help our kids in the long term in the future.

2351
03:42:04,507 --> 03:42:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not what's going to be for Medford to do those interventions, right?

2352
03:42:09,112 --> 03:42:11,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a long-term trajectory with our families.

2353
03:42:12,295 --> 03:42:20,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we should also utilize our expertise to help support us to come up with the best interventions for our students for the long term.

2354
03:42:21,207 --> 03:42:28,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe some of them are what the research is, those methods and those modalities within that research that we can then hopefully use and share with our families.

2355
03:42:29,583 --> 03:42:42,037
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of the treatment programs that's directly coming from this research that we're hoping actually will be ready to launch in the fall is a resiliency training.

2356
03:42:42,077 --> 03:42:44,820
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is a direct result of this work.

2357
03:42:45,341 --> 03:42:55,550
[SPEAKER_27]: which is where we're going to be identifying kids who are exhibiting early risk factors for psychiatric concerns and substance use, but before they're actually fully syndromal.

2358
03:42:55,930 --> 03:43:04,637
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have an intervention that we've already put together that's ready to be rolled out that would involve parents, that would involve kids.

2359
03:43:04,878 --> 03:43:06,199
[SPEAKER_27]: This is treatment.

2360
03:43:06,299 --> 03:43:13,065
[SPEAKER_27]: These are treatment programs that we would not, that wouldn't require kids presenting to a clinic to get access to.

2361
03:43:13,758 --> 03:43:22,140
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is really, what I'm pitching to you now is one study that is the tip of the iceberg of a program of work.

2362
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:23,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting.

2363
03:43:23,340 --> 03:43:27,261
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at the bottom level so she can build up.

2364
03:43:28,361 --> 03:43:31,041
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file, and Ms.

2365
03:43:31,081 --> 03:43:32,382
[SPEAKER_31]: Kress, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

2366
03:43:32,442 --> 03:43:33,222
[SPEAKER_31]: All those in favor?

2367
03:43:33,242 --> 03:43:33,622
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

2368
03:43:33,682 --> 03:43:34,382
[SPEAKER_31]: All those opposed?

2369
03:43:34,462 --> 03:43:35,482
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion passes.

2370
03:43:35,502 --> 03:43:37,303
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2371
03:43:38,823 --> 03:43:40,063
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much, Doctor.

2372
03:43:41,124 --> 03:43:41,204
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

2373
03:43:45,405 --> 03:43:50,752
[SPEAKER_31]: recommendation to approve the new math curriculum, Illustrated Math, by Ms.

2374
03:43:51,233 --> 03:43:52,114
[SPEAKER_31]: Faiza Khan.

2375
03:43:55,839 --> 03:43:56,440
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

2376
03:43:56,600 --> 03:43:58,062
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for your endurance.

2377
03:43:58,883 --> 03:43:59,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2378
03:44:00,605 --> 03:44:01,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2379
03:44:01,266 --> 03:44:01,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I the last?

2380
03:44:09,245 --> 03:44:09,926
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.

2381
03:44:10,386 --> 03:44:10,927
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

2382
03:44:11,527 --> 03:44:19,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe you have a handout from me, a report from me, a recommendation.

2383
03:44:21,976 --> 03:44:30,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything that I know – I know a little more, but most of the facts I have here.

2384
03:44:31,123 --> 03:44:33,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.

2385
03:44:34,206 --> 03:44:35,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just – I'm here to

2386
03:44:36,432 --> 03:44:45,277
[SPEAKER_01]: get it approved, and I would like $6,500 for the teachers to, you know, receive PD.

2387
03:44:46,138 --> 03:44:48,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you have any questions, please ask Ms.

2388
03:44:48,780 --> 03:44:49,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Kreatz.

2389
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:49,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2390
03:44:49,920 --> 03:44:51,281
[SPEAKER_31]: Doctor, did you wish to speak?

2391
03:44:52,042 --> 03:45:03,749
[SPEAKER_37]: I was just going to say that similar to what happened with FOSS as a district, we did not have a unified math curriculum at the middle school level.

2392
03:45:04,289 --> 03:45:04,729
[SPEAKER_37]: And so,

2393
03:45:05,947 --> 03:45:11,551
[SPEAKER_37]: charged with knowing that math was one of the areas as a district that that was our weak side.

2394
03:45:12,812 --> 03:45:18,917
[SPEAKER_37]: We had the two math coaches under the leadership of Ms.

2395
03:45:18,957 --> 03:45:23,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Kahn working with our elementary schools in illustrative math.

2396
03:45:24,322 --> 03:45:34,910
[SPEAKER_37]: They have gone, they've looked at math in other districts, and this was the math curriculum that has kind of risen to the top as one of the stronger math curriculums out there.

2397
03:45:35,461 --> 03:45:37,542
[SPEAKER_37]: to address the needs of our students.

2398
03:45:38,122 --> 03:45:46,205
[SPEAKER_37]: And so today's presentation is a recommendation to approve the illustrative math curriculum.

2399
03:45:46,665 --> 03:45:56,548
[SPEAKER_37]: And we have done some footwork to find out what the professional development costs would take in order for us to launch it successfully.

2400
03:45:57,148 --> 03:46:04,291
[SPEAKER_37]: And there is a cost involved, but we're prepared to do that in order to give everyone the same

2401
03:46:05,417 --> 03:46:12,022
[SPEAKER_37]: mathematical foundational base with this new curriculum so that we can have a coherent curriculum at the middle school level.

2402
03:46:12,462 --> 03:46:12,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2403
03:46:13,523 --> 03:46:13,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

2404
03:46:13,743 --> 03:46:14,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

2405
03:46:14,464 --> 03:46:14,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2406
03:46:14,964 --> 03:46:15,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

2407
03:46:15,384 --> 03:46:15,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Plaza.

2408
03:46:15,985 --> 03:46:21,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the report and actually for responding to my email inquiries so, you know, very quick.

2409
03:46:21,649 --> 03:46:22,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2410
03:46:23,050 --> 03:46:30,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess one of, you know, the concerns that I had was about printing the papers and when the materials

2411
03:46:30,665 --> 03:46:33,828
[SPEAKER_11]: if somebody doesn't have a computer at home or a printer.

2412
03:46:34,728 --> 03:46:42,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand what you explained was that the teachers are currently printing the curriculum right now and handing it out.

2413
03:46:43,195 --> 03:46:49,400
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think my concern would be, and I think we received an email from one of the teachers.

2414
03:46:49,980 --> 03:46:50,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2415
03:46:50,320 --> 03:46:50,621
[SPEAKER_11]: She's here.

2416
03:46:50,661 --> 03:46:51,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, okay.

2417
03:46:51,761 --> 03:46:58,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not having the book, the actual hard copy book for some students to take home.

2418
03:46:58,627 --> 03:46:58,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2419
03:47:00,508 --> 03:47:02,189
[SPEAKER_11]: very difficult for a lot of students.

2420
03:47:02,530 --> 03:47:02,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

2421
03:47:02,790 --> 03:47:03,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2422
03:47:03,110 --> 03:47:05,452
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to be the teachers here.

2423
03:47:05,492 --> 03:47:06,133
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, great.

2424
03:47:06,633 --> 03:47:07,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2425
03:47:08,234 --> 03:47:10,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share a fun fact about me and Ms.

2426
03:47:10,797 --> 03:47:11,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving.

2427
03:47:11,477 --> 03:47:12,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We share the same birthday.

2428
03:47:13,018 --> 03:47:13,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

2429
03:47:14,099 --> 03:47:14,640
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

2430
03:47:15,180 --> 03:47:19,744
[SPEAKER_30]: And Pfizer knew that I was going to either speak or suggest a letter.

2431
03:47:20,124 --> 03:47:22,146
[SPEAKER_30]: So this was not done behind anybody's back.

2432
03:47:22,206 --> 03:47:22,406
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

2433
03:47:22,446 --> 03:47:23,327
[SPEAKER_30]: Good.

2434
03:47:23,487 --> 03:47:26,510
[SPEAKER_30]: We have utmost respect for each other.

2435
03:47:26,570 --> 03:47:26,910
[SPEAKER_30]: We do.

2436
03:47:26,950 --> 03:47:28,832
[SPEAKER_30]: We don't agree on this point at all.

2437
03:47:29,412 --> 03:47:30,493
[SPEAKER_30]: But I love working with her.

2438
03:47:30,613 --> 03:47:31,474
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2439
03:47:31,714 --> 03:47:39,919
[SPEAKER_30]: Many years ago, when the school committee adopted CMP, the vital component of the program was not purchased.

2440
03:47:40,940 --> 03:47:43,421
[SPEAKER_30]: And to you, it would be a math textbook.

2441
03:47:44,142 --> 03:47:53,628
[SPEAKER_30]: So she's going to purchase a set of classroom instruction materials, but it doesn't show the students how to do the program.

2442
03:47:54,509 --> 03:47:57,591
[SPEAKER_30]: And the problem with CMP, it's very much like this program,

2443
03:47:58,032 --> 03:48:04,336
[SPEAKER_30]: Where at the Discovery Program, well, my EL students have difficulty with vocabulary.

2444
03:48:04,436 --> 03:48:10,581
[SPEAKER_30]: If they don't understand the vocabulary, when they get home, they have nothing to reference.

2445
03:48:11,441 --> 03:48:13,723
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's a huge issue with the CMP.

2446
03:48:14,343 --> 03:48:19,867
[SPEAKER_30]: And as new teachers came in, the reason we don't have a unified program is because there was no training offered.

2447
03:48:20,487 --> 03:48:25,631
[SPEAKER_30]: So if you read my letter carefully, I did go to University of Massachusetts Medical School.

2448
03:48:26,367 --> 03:48:29,408
[SPEAKER_30]: And the course I took there was the CMP training.

2449
03:48:30,088 --> 03:48:33,490
[SPEAKER_30]: Five teachers, middle school teachers, possibly more.

2450
03:48:34,050 --> 03:48:44,274
[SPEAKER_30]: I drove five people out to Worcester every day, five days in the summer to get the professional development for the CMP program.

2451
03:48:44,314 --> 03:48:47,315
[SPEAKER_30]: But as new teachers came in, they didn't get the professional development.

2452
03:48:47,735 --> 03:48:49,396
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's how the program fell apart.

2453
03:48:50,176 --> 03:48:53,257
[SPEAKER_30]: Since then, I have served on two textbook selection committees.

2454
03:48:54,077 --> 03:48:55,638
[SPEAKER_30]: This program never came up.

2455
03:48:56,861 --> 03:49:03,643
[SPEAKER_30]: And the big problem with this program is there's no math textbook slash reference book.

2456
03:49:04,403 --> 03:49:10,025
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you're going to get a program like this, if you don't have the reference book, it's useless.

2457
03:49:11,766 --> 03:49:12,766
[SPEAKER_30]: I do teach at the McGlynn.

2458
03:49:12,786 --> 03:49:16,307
[SPEAKER_30]: A lot of my children cannot access a computer at home.

2459
03:49:16,905 --> 03:49:17,926
[SPEAKER_30]: They do work on the phone.

2460
03:49:19,066 --> 03:49:20,667
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Rousseau, you didn't get the pictures.

2461
03:49:21,548 --> 03:49:22,889
[SPEAKER_30]: You replied to me this afternoon.

2462
03:49:23,489 --> 03:49:24,790
[SPEAKER_30]: I saw that you didn't get the pictures.

2463
03:49:25,250 --> 03:49:27,332
[SPEAKER_30]: You're on the same email as Ms.

2464
03:49:27,372 --> 03:49:27,712
[SPEAKER_30]: Kreatz.

2465
03:49:28,272 --> 03:49:29,013
[SPEAKER_30]: She got the pictures.

2466
03:49:29,033 --> 03:49:29,953
[SPEAKER_30]: I got the pictures.

2467
03:49:30,754 --> 03:49:32,855
[SPEAKER_30]: When you replied to me, they disappeared.

2468
03:49:32,915 --> 03:49:34,356
[SPEAKER_30]: It just came up as IMG.

2469
03:49:34,756 --> 03:49:43,922
[SPEAKER_30]: So if I'm supposed to be using technology to help teach this program, and I can't even email six people, that's a problem.

2470
03:49:45,228 --> 03:49:50,632
[SPEAKER_30]: And actually, I had somebody in my classroom today because my classroom computer does not work correctly.

2471
03:49:51,673 --> 03:49:53,314
[SPEAKER_30]: I have a 20-year-old projector.

2472
03:49:53,675 --> 03:49:54,976
[SPEAKER_30]: It makes it difficult to teach.

2473
03:49:55,596 --> 03:50:01,201
[SPEAKER_30]: It means you have to have two lessons every day if the computer works, if the computer doesn't work.

2474
03:50:04,918 --> 03:50:05,058
[SPEAKER_30]: Ms.

2475
03:50:05,138 --> 03:50:06,419
[SPEAKER_31]: Kahn, would you like to reply?

2476
03:50:06,619 --> 03:50:06,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2477
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:10,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2478
03:50:10,941 --> 03:50:19,166
[SPEAKER_30]: We have had this discussion for several weeks.

2479
03:50:19,786 --> 03:50:23,828
[SPEAKER_30]: I've taught middle school a few years longer than she has.

2480
03:50:24,809 --> 03:50:26,410
[SPEAKER_30]: I've been through many programs.

2481
03:50:26,940 --> 03:50:41,926
[SPEAKER_30]: I've been through other bad programs other than the CMP, and because it was at least a reference book, I could manipulate the book so that the kids did have the reference, but they got the practice they needed.

2482
03:50:42,747 --> 03:50:55,792
[SPEAKER_30]: And if they don't have a reference book and the kids don't know how to do it, we have kids go home to other countries for a week at a time, and when they miss a program a week of school, how do they make it up?

2483
03:50:57,163 --> 03:50:58,807
[SPEAKER_30]: We do have the Yale population.

2484
03:50:58,827 --> 03:51:02,635
[SPEAKER_30]: They're great to work with, but I have to give them something they can work with.

2485
03:51:05,362 --> 03:51:08,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we order books for the EL students?

2486
03:51:08,703 --> 03:51:10,843
[SPEAKER_30]: But all my students, I have special ed students.

2487
03:51:10,923 --> 03:51:11,603
[SPEAKER_30]: I have kids.

2488
03:51:11,743 --> 03:51:18,544
[SPEAKER_31]: Could you reply based on whatever research you've done just so we can get a point-to-point here?

2489
03:51:18,764 --> 03:51:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

2490
03:51:20,005 --> 03:51:33,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way this program works is that when we call it an online program, what we mean is that all student material, all teacher material, and all family material, family resources,

2491
03:51:34,331 --> 03:51:35,952
[SPEAKER_01]: are all available online.

2492
03:51:36,572 --> 03:51:49,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is true that we are planning on having a classroom set and that teachers will be, shall be sending, should be sending paper copies of that material home.

2493
03:51:50,396 --> 03:51:57,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I have talked to the surrounding districts who have adopted it and I wanted to find out how did they go about this hurdle.

2494
03:51:58,539 --> 03:52:01,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And both Somerville and Cambridge said that

2495
03:52:02,268 --> 03:52:09,733
[SPEAKER_01]: with PD from Lesley University that they don't have much material.

2496
03:52:10,053 --> 03:52:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not send textbooks home as well.

2497
03:52:14,275 --> 03:52:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: They also make photocopies and send it home.

2498
03:52:16,897 --> 03:52:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that brings us to the problem of making photocopies and then students losing photocopies.

2499
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:25,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it as a combined problem.

2500
03:52:26,300 --> 03:52:29,102
[SPEAKER_01]: with executive functioning and organizational skills.

2501
03:52:29,743 --> 03:52:50,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is very important to note is that keeping all of these things in mind, keeping all of these questions in mind, the company that we are planning to go by has actually sent a survey out to all the teachers to tell them what problems do they foresee.

2502
03:52:51,162 --> 03:52:53,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will cater their professional development

2503
03:52:54,222 --> 03:53:01,308
[SPEAKER_01]: to discuss how do you do the lesson in 40 minutes or 45 minutes?

2504
03:53:01,649 --> 03:53:05,852
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you deal with these kind of paper and organizational skills?

2505
03:53:06,433 --> 03:53:17,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if we go with the company that has been recommended to us by the publisher, they have customized the professional development to what our needs are.

2506
03:53:17,343 --> 03:53:18,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been in touch with them.

2507
03:53:19,084 --> 03:53:19,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I have discussed

2508
03:53:20,313 --> 03:53:21,634
[SPEAKER_01]: many issues that Ms.

2509
03:53:21,834 --> 03:53:24,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving and other teachers have brought to me.

2510
03:53:24,635 --> 03:53:26,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have foreseen them, too.

2511
03:53:26,136 --> 03:53:32,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have come up in talking to the Cambridge coordinator and Somerville coordinator and Brookline and Newton and Acton.

2512
03:53:33,580 --> 03:53:36,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have mentioned it to her.

2513
03:53:36,221 --> 03:53:43,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, they all said that there will be aches and pains with all new programs, that there will be aches and pains.

2514
03:53:43,504 --> 03:53:46,426
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the only program to go with.

2515
03:53:48,898 --> 03:53:50,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I recall Ms.

2516
03:53:50,359 --> 03:53:53,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Van der Kloot was actually at one of the things.

2517
03:53:53,322 --> 03:53:54,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at elementary school.

2518
03:53:55,443 --> 03:53:59,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Hilary Kreisberg from Lesley University was sitting there.

2519
03:53:59,687 --> 03:54:08,754
[SPEAKER_01]: We were discussing that in one year, envisions will be up in elementary schools and what programs to look at while I had her there.

2520
03:54:08,974 --> 03:54:12,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, wait, and so what is your middle school program?

2521
03:54:12,236 --> 03:54:14,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, we are still exploring.

2522
03:54:14,378 --> 03:54:15,379
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three.

2523
03:54:15,751 --> 03:54:18,912
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones going on, four different ones even possibly going on.

2524
03:54:18,952 --> 03:54:22,134
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, don't even look further than illustrative math.

2525
03:54:22,634 --> 03:54:27,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I have done my due research.

2526
03:54:27,276 --> 03:54:32,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the program is written by Bill McCollum, who did the common core, so he has covered everything.

2527
03:54:33,358 --> 03:54:43,062
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideology, as far as I was trained in BTR and the way I see the work going, is that it's more explorations-based rather than

2528
03:54:43,763 --> 03:54:45,364
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, teacher teaching it.

2529
03:54:45,644 --> 03:54:51,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with all due respect to experience, I have always been a big believer in that nothing beats experience.

2530
03:54:51,527 --> 03:54:56,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no double thoughts in my mind that Ms.

2531
03:54:56,129 --> 03:54:59,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving has the best interest of her students at her mind.

2532
03:55:00,231 --> 03:55:09,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel that the newer way of teaching mathematics that's being adopted around us,

2533
03:55:10,653 --> 03:55:22,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we do not adopt an explorations-based program and deal with its aches and pains, we'll be dealing with bigger aches and pains where we will be left behind.

2534
03:55:22,776 --> 03:55:25,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do not want us to be in that situation.

2535
03:55:25,656 --> 03:55:28,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, there are going to be photocopying issues.

2536
03:55:28,557 --> 03:55:35,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have to look into what are our photocopying problems, how much can our photocopier handle.

2537
03:55:36,913 --> 03:55:45,839
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with students' executive functioning skills, it will definitely put a little bit more load on general ed teachers and EL and special education.

2538
03:55:45,919 --> 03:55:55,545
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel that our educators are up there, and I'm very confident in their capabilities and their well-wishes towards their students.

2539
03:55:55,985 --> 03:55:58,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why this is a two-day professional development.

2540
03:55:58,806 --> 03:56:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be another one in November that will be offered.

2541
03:56:01,946 --> 03:56:05,227
[SPEAKER_01]: They are coaching me throughout the year with every two-week session.

2542
03:56:05,467 --> 03:56:10,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is special training for our EL teacher.

2543
03:56:10,168 --> 03:56:20,809
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I have gotten a lot of coaching hours shifted from my own coaching to her coaching and to the special education teacher's coaching, because I'm already on board with this pedagogy.

2544
03:56:21,269 --> 03:56:23,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to know what to do with the materials.

2545
03:56:24,568 --> 03:56:37,815
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, I mean, we, I have proposed the best package that the professional development organization has proposed for us, and I hope I get your approval for that.

2546
03:56:37,915 --> 03:56:40,897
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of now, the two-day PD will cost us $6,500.

2547
03:56:41,237 --> 03:56:47,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with utmost respect for experience and with so much, you know, respect for Ms.

2548
03:56:47,520 --> 03:56:52,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving's, you know, she really means so well for her student.

2549
03:56:54,118 --> 03:57:03,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I cannot suggest another program to you when everybody else around, including Arlington, is going towards this.

2550
03:57:04,867 --> 03:57:05,127
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

2551
03:57:05,167 --> 03:57:06,748
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot.

2552
03:57:06,868 --> 03:57:07,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2553
03:57:07,869 --> 03:57:19,218
[SPEAKER_25]: So the first question is in terms of the two-day PD, are there two days in June scheduled for PD that are available, and this would be all middle school math teachers?

2554
03:57:19,719 --> 03:57:24,302
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, all middle school math teachers, EL teachers, and special education teachers.

2555
03:57:24,802 --> 03:57:31,087
[SPEAKER_37]: So we were making sure to be inclusive of all teachers working with students around mathematics.

2556
03:57:31,267 --> 03:57:36,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, what will the other teachers be doing for PD during that time?

2557
03:57:37,130 --> 03:57:44,375
[SPEAKER_37]: Like the science teachers or the... So for this math training, we wanted to do it before the school year ended.

2558
03:57:44,695 --> 03:57:48,418
[SPEAKER_37]: So this would actually be during a school day where the math teachers

2559
03:57:48,899 --> 03:58:00,882
[SPEAKER_37]: would be pulled and we would have either coverage or substitutes covering the class so that the teachers can get two-day intensive training before the academic year ends.

2560
03:58:01,963 --> 03:58:02,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2561
03:58:02,383 --> 03:58:06,304
[SPEAKER_25]: So, boy, I mean, that's just a lot of organization that needs to be done very quickly.

2562
03:58:06,324 --> 03:58:06,844
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, it is.

2563
03:58:07,004 --> 03:58:07,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2564
03:58:07,164 --> 03:58:13,846
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I recall when we discussed this, one of the things that I had thought as I was concerned

2565
03:58:14,242 --> 03:58:21,786
[SPEAKER_25]: with the issues is that we should buy some sets of classroom editions.

2566
03:58:21,826 --> 03:58:28,309
[SPEAKER_25]: And I see the cost for books, one classroom set of student edition per teacher, and one teacher edition is $12,962.

2567
03:58:29,049 --> 03:58:33,051
[SPEAKER_25]: And that would be multiplied by what?

2568
03:58:33,231 --> 03:58:34,332
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is it.

2569
03:58:34,912 --> 03:58:40,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, one classroom set per teacher is, so for example, Ms.

2570
03:58:40,114 --> 03:58:43,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Hsu's class at Andrews,

2571
03:58:44,150 --> 03:58:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: she teaches sixth grade, so she will get a classroom set so that students can take a look at that, but they will also, they'll have their own book, but they hopefully will not write in the book.

2572
03:58:54,854 --> 03:58:57,015
[SPEAKER_01]: We are hoping that it'll last two to three years.

2573
03:58:57,355 --> 03:59:01,977
[SPEAKER_01]: She will also give them photocopies, but for reference, they will have the student book with them.

2574
03:59:02,337 --> 03:59:07,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we are happy to invest and buy one for each student, but it will just cost more.

2575
03:59:10,229 --> 03:59:11,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Ms.

2576
03:59:11,530 --> 03:59:14,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving, when Ms.

2577
03:59:14,092 --> 03:59:23,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving mentions about the reference book, she means the examples that are done, are they done for the students or not, because Ms.

2578
03:59:23,539 --> 03:59:31,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Irving is a big believer in students need to be shown with example, the modeling needs to be done for each problem type.

2579
03:59:32,970 --> 03:59:35,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I am there with her and I'm not there with her.

2580
03:59:35,552 --> 03:59:52,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that when you let students explore and things come out of it and teachers facilitate and also advance that idea that after solving one or two problems along with the students, they shall be able to get there.

2581
03:59:52,665 --> 03:59:57,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, if not, there are examples in family resources.

2582
03:59:58,109 --> 04:00:01,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are examples that they can always

2583
04:00:02,002 --> 04:00:08,487
[SPEAKER_01]: look at, again, using, they will have to use online technology.

2584
04:00:10,368 --> 04:00:16,112
[SPEAKER_25]: So just to continue, the student editions are paperback, is that correct?

2585
04:00:16,192 --> 04:00:19,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they're consumables, they're not a hardcover.

2586
04:00:19,514 --> 04:00:19,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2587
04:00:20,074 --> 04:00:21,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's it, yes.

2588
04:00:31,058 --> 04:00:54,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, so I guess what my my question was Is the district planning to purchase the the consumable textbooks for you know Somebody that might need them for their classroom, you know because it does seem like there are going to be some students that are going to need to take them home and

2589
04:00:55,307 --> 04:00:59,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just don't know who those students are and how many there are going to be.

2590
04:01:00,871 --> 04:01:03,232
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only concern that I have.

2591
04:01:03,312 --> 04:01:08,515
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because I know, you know, I know not everybody has a computer at home.

2592
04:01:08,816 --> 04:01:09,556
[SPEAKER_11]: It might not be working.

2593
04:01:09,636 --> 04:01:11,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they might have a Google pad.

2594
04:01:13,939 --> 04:01:16,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It might not be the computer based.

2595
04:01:18,602 --> 04:01:21,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I don't have a laptop, but I have a computer.

2596
04:01:21,323 --> 04:01:22,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, exactly.

2597
04:01:23,803 --> 04:01:25,424
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my only concern, you know.

2598
04:01:27,206 --> 04:01:34,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but I do want to have, like, I definitely want to have one math program and I want it to be instructional math.

2599
04:01:35,053 --> 04:01:35,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

2600
04:01:35,773 --> 04:01:38,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really trust your judgment and expertise.

2601
04:01:38,756 --> 04:01:42,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went in and I did go online myself and, you know, it was great.

2602
04:01:42,940 --> 04:01:45,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, I tried to print from my

2603
04:01:46,094 --> 04:01:47,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a black and white printer.

2604
04:01:48,515 --> 04:01:54,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I just have in front of me here today is just what I got from the teacher, but it didn't quite come out.

2605
04:01:54,238 --> 04:01:57,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just all pieces of the picture.

2606
04:01:57,940 --> 04:02:01,262
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wasn't something that I would be able to work with.

2607
04:02:01,442 --> 04:02:08,206
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know I talked to me and she said, if you print it right out from the program, it would come out okay.

2608
04:02:08,306 --> 04:02:09,166
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

2609
04:02:09,186 --> 04:02:11,007
[SPEAKER_30]: I tried to print from school.

2610
04:02:11,087 --> 04:02:11,648
[SPEAKER_30]: I could not.

2611
04:02:11,728 --> 04:02:13,669
[SPEAKER_30]: I had to call her to get it printed out for me.

2612
04:02:13,689 --> 04:02:14,949
[SPEAKER_30]: She wanted me to try a unit.

2613
04:02:16,759 --> 04:02:20,503
[SPEAKER_30]: So if I can't print from school, then what are my students going to do?

2614
04:02:20,723 --> 04:02:24,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember that Josephine Pauly was able to do it for you also.

2615
04:02:25,287 --> 04:02:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that the main thing is that they give you two.

2616
04:02:28,650 --> 04:02:30,933
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a Word document, two versions.

2617
04:02:31,013 --> 04:02:34,896
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a Word version and they give you a PDF version.

2618
04:02:35,277 --> 04:02:37,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that depending on the

2619
04:02:38,318 --> 04:02:50,074
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you are using Safari or whether you are using Google Chrome or whatever, depending on the browser, the printing can shift off a little bit as well.

2620
04:02:50,475 --> 04:02:51,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just need to be

2621
04:02:52,554 --> 04:02:56,636
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more vigilant about which browser to stick with.

2622
04:02:57,016 --> 04:03:01,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I have been printing, they have been coming out okay, but I do trust you.

2623
04:03:02,118 --> 04:03:03,939
[SPEAKER_30]: They give you better stuff than they give me.

2624
04:03:04,379 --> 04:03:07,601
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm so glad you saved the best for last.

2625
04:03:07,641 --> 04:03:11,282
[SPEAKER_30]: Wait, I don't even have an audience.

2626
04:03:11,422 --> 04:03:15,284
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so upset.

2627
04:03:15,965 --> 04:03:17,945
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Benedetto, your turn.

2628
04:03:17,965 --> 04:03:19,346
[SPEAKER_01]: So have we piloted this program?

2629
04:03:21,827 --> 04:03:26,790
[SPEAKER_01]: So two teachers have been piloting it before I even started for two years now.

2630
04:03:29,632 --> 04:03:31,833
[SPEAKER_01]: One in sixth grade, one in eighth grade.

2631
04:03:31,933 --> 04:03:33,054
[SPEAKER_01]: They both like it.

2632
04:03:33,314 --> 04:03:34,655
[SPEAKER_01]: They both really like it.

2633
04:03:34,715 --> 04:03:35,435
[SPEAKER_01]: They use it.

2634
04:03:35,515 --> 04:03:37,436
[SPEAKER_01]: They do say they make photocopies.

2635
04:03:37,756 --> 04:03:43,480
[SPEAKER_01]: They have once in a while problems with the color version versus the black and white version.

2636
04:03:43,860 --> 04:03:49,003
[SPEAKER_01]: The main issue happens actually in geometry unit because each

2637
04:03:49,972 --> 04:03:51,854
[SPEAKER_01]: 6th grade, 7th grade, and 8th grade.

2638
04:03:51,914 --> 04:03:53,616
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have nine units each.

2639
04:03:53,916 --> 04:03:56,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very first unit is based on geometry.

2640
04:03:56,759 --> 04:04:00,603
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the coloring can throw you off a little bit.

2641
04:04:01,184 --> 04:04:12,636
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, when I discussed it with the Cambridge coordinator and the Acton one, they both said that once you are over this hump and the teachers just

2642
04:04:13,241 --> 04:04:19,864
[SPEAKER_01]: take it with the flow, and they learn it the first year, second and third year become easy.

2643
04:04:19,904 --> 04:04:25,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And like all programs, things will smooth out, but it's going to take two to three years.

2644
04:04:25,346 --> 04:04:31,629
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I have been hearing from everybody, that it's not going to be a smooth ride the first time with no program, it will be.

2645
04:04:32,189 --> 04:04:32,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?

2646
04:04:33,729 --> 04:04:41,753
[SPEAKER_32]: So through the mayor to our superintendent, were there any other programs piloted that

2647
04:04:42,992 --> 04:04:46,853
[SPEAKER_32]: caught in a different way that we didn't have to bump over some bumps the first year.

2648
04:04:47,573 --> 04:04:49,693
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we haven't had a program in so long.

2649
04:04:50,213 --> 04:04:52,694
[SPEAKER_32]: To hear concerns is concerning.

2650
04:04:53,394 --> 04:04:58,355
[SPEAKER_32]: And to invest money into a program that has bumps is concerning to me.

2651
04:04:58,675 --> 04:05:07,757
[SPEAKER_32]: I want all students that's computers aren't working for a week at home to still be able to go home and keep up with the class.

2652
04:05:09,091 --> 04:05:15,573
[SPEAKER_32]: hate to have someone's computer break down and them not to be accessing homework for an evening in middle school and fall behind.

2653
04:05:15,953 --> 04:05:18,234
[SPEAKER_32]: Because math basics build on each other.

2654
04:05:18,694 --> 04:05:20,755
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's my only concern.

2655
04:05:20,875 --> 04:05:25,756
[SPEAKER_32]: I trust that you think that this is the best program, but I'm not sure it's the best for our population.

2656
04:05:26,116 --> 04:05:35,459
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, one of the pieces I do want to say, though, what is most concerning to me is that at the middle school level, there was no uniform curriculum for mathematics.

2657
04:05:35,839 --> 04:05:38,640
[SPEAKER_37]: How can you measure your growth or your progress

2658
04:05:39,235 --> 04:05:50,761
[SPEAKER_37]: if you have seven or eight different, one person's using CMP, another person is using illustrative math, and I don't even know what all of the other programs they were using.

2659
04:05:51,161 --> 04:05:57,024
[SPEAKER_37]: So we had no uniform way of saying, let's look at an assessment.

2660
04:05:57,144 --> 04:05:59,686
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, the last report is our assessment inventory.

2661
04:06:00,166 --> 04:06:03,368
[SPEAKER_37]: We did not have one at the middle school level for mathematics.

2662
04:06:03,928 --> 04:06:07,510
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think first and foremost, we definitely need to have

2663
04:06:08,924 --> 04:06:13,205
[SPEAKER_37]: something in place where it can be measured and it can be closely monitored.

2664
04:06:15,006 --> 04:06:29,850
[SPEAKER_37]: Illustrative math right now is being used by many of our surrounding districts that are competitive with Medford or possibly even outperforming us in some areas.

2665
04:06:30,270 --> 04:06:32,031
[SPEAKER_37]: Math is an area of weakness for us.

2666
04:06:32,431 --> 04:06:35,132
[SPEAKER_37]: It's an area where we do need to focus.

2667
04:06:35,172 --> 04:06:36,192
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think we're going to get

2668
04:06:37,950 --> 04:07:06,490
[SPEAKER_37]: the perfect solution, but I feel like from the feedback of the research where FISA has gone out and this kind has gone out to surrounding communities to actually go and observe where they're further ahead than where we are, I am definitely in support of illustrative math versus just saying we're going to do something and not having it be uniform.

2669
04:07:06,854 --> 04:07:16,676
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would like to know what the whole financial cost is for us, and I would also like to know if those other districts have the same demographics as ours.

2670
04:07:17,217 --> 04:07:19,357
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it Arlington, Lexington?

2671
04:07:19,537 --> 04:07:21,258
[SPEAKER_37]: Cambridge has greater diversity.

2672
04:07:22,038 --> 04:07:26,079
[SPEAKER_32]: Somerville has... It does, but they also have more money than most districts have.

2673
04:07:26,119 --> 04:07:26,719
[SPEAKER_32]: Somerville as well.

2674
04:07:26,739 --> 04:07:29,380
[SPEAKER_32]: So they give their students... Yes, Somerville.

2675
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:30,680
[SPEAKER_37]: Somerville as well.

2676
04:07:32,193 --> 04:07:34,134
[SPEAKER_37]: Waltham is comparable.

2677
04:07:34,374 --> 04:07:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and some of the Boston schools are also using illustrative math.

2678
04:07:38,875 --> 04:07:47,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we are teachers, we are educators, we will have to... What's the total dollar amount for us to move forward with this?

2679
04:07:47,717 --> 04:07:54,339
[SPEAKER_32]: And if it doesn't work in two years, are we going to reassess and provide another alternative?

2680
04:07:56,020 --> 04:07:59,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say allow three years, please, because that's what most of them are saying.

2681
04:08:00,247 --> 04:08:01,347
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three years.

2682
04:08:01,788 --> 04:08:09,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should allow maximum time so that teachers can comfortably, without any pressure, learn and execute it.

2683
04:08:09,311 --> 04:08:10,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can reassess.

2684
04:08:10,911 --> 04:08:11,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2685
04:08:12,732 --> 04:08:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just worried.

2686
04:08:15,213 --> 04:08:16,073
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Regiro.

2687
04:08:16,693 --> 04:08:17,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mary Brooke.

2688
04:08:18,794 --> 04:08:20,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So a number of things.

2689
04:08:20,275 --> 04:08:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: First off,

2690
04:08:22,154 --> 04:08:23,615
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, I'm a math teacher myself.

2691
04:08:24,936 --> 04:08:27,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my concern is echoed.

2692
04:08:29,120 --> 04:08:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm concerned that we're going to have students that don't have access to technology.

2693
04:08:33,423 --> 04:08:34,844
[SPEAKER_04]: The printers aren't going to be working.

2694
04:08:34,924 --> 04:08:39,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So out of those 6th and 8th grade classes, how many students did not have a computer at home?

2695
04:08:41,429 --> 04:08:47,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, well, when I asked the 8th grade teacher, Ms.

2696
04:08:47,134 --> 04:08:51,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Chen, she says students had access to some kind of technology.

2697
04:08:52,008 --> 04:08:59,789
[SPEAKER_01]: at some point in time during the day so that they could take a look at it, either on the phone or through the computer.

2698
04:09:00,210 --> 04:09:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I said, so how is it?

2699
04:09:02,390 --> 04:09:07,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's the one who is teaching illustrative math and making photocopies and giving it.

2700
04:09:08,371 --> 04:09:09,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I asked Ms.

2701
04:09:09,731 --> 04:09:11,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremble, she said the same thing.

2702
04:09:11,552 --> 04:09:17,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, I really actually haven't ran into any problems so far, both of them.

2703
04:09:17,113 --> 04:09:19,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So does the program take

2704
04:09:19,981 --> 04:09:23,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So it monitors the students how long they are on the website, is that right?

2705
04:09:23,262 --> 04:09:24,222
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.

2706
04:09:24,442 --> 04:09:26,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just giving you everything online.

2707
04:09:27,323 --> 04:09:29,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you have a student who's online, accessing to it.

2708
04:09:30,024 --> 04:09:30,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not know.

2709
04:09:31,244 --> 04:09:32,084
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not know.

2710
04:09:33,384 --> 04:09:38,506
[SPEAKER_01]: They are only accessing it to take a look at the colors or take a look at the student resources.

2711
04:09:38,866 --> 04:09:43,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is given to them on a paper.

2712
04:09:43,067 --> 04:09:46,448
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have a worksheet to work on.

2713
04:09:48,185 --> 04:09:49,946
[SPEAKER_01]: warm-up on the paper as well.

2714
04:09:50,106 --> 04:10:00,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is paper-based, but it's all available online for the teacher to print, for the student to print in case they have access and they lost the paper that the teacher gave them.

2715
04:10:00,792 --> 04:10:02,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's customizable.

2716
04:10:02,413 --> 04:10:06,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the teachers think that I do not like the warm-up in this program,

2717
04:10:06,809 --> 04:10:08,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to create my own lesson plan.

2718
04:10:08,489 --> 04:10:09,610
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you lesson plans.

2719
04:10:10,270 --> 04:10:14,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And then warm-up and everything is part of it, even exit ticket.

2720
04:10:14,171 --> 04:10:20,713
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a teacher, if I feel like this warm-up is not working for me, so I'm going to create my own warm-up.

2721
04:10:20,873 --> 04:10:21,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put it there.

2722
04:10:22,413 --> 04:10:25,314
[SPEAKER_31]: Point of information, or is it a new item?

2723
04:10:26,834 --> 04:10:34,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to know, did you have a chance to make an informal poll of how teachers and middle school teachers feel about the adoption of this new program?

2724
04:10:34,807 --> 04:10:35,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

2725
04:10:35,327 --> 04:10:49,814
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started in the beginning, most of the teachers said we are happy with what we are doing, but we'll go along with whatever you choose.

2726
04:10:49,874 --> 04:10:50,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been too long.

2727
04:10:51,295 --> 04:10:52,395
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I heard.

2728
04:10:55,917 --> 04:10:56,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said most.

2729
04:10:57,518 --> 04:11:02,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the teachers said that, that they'll be happy to go along with whatever we choose.

2730
04:11:03,438 --> 04:11:04,218
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they said.

2731
04:11:04,238 --> 04:11:08,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So you feel in terms of questions of morale, they're willing to follow you down?

2732
04:11:09,441 --> 04:11:10,121
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.

2733
04:11:10,701 --> 04:11:11,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd follow.

2734
04:11:11,521 --> 04:11:12,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably follow that too.

2735
04:11:12,662 --> 04:11:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd follow that.

2736
04:11:13,922 --> 04:11:13,962
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

2737
04:11:13,982 --> 04:11:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, shucks, I have one last question.

2738
04:11:17,484 --> 04:11:23,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So how much do each individual workbook, how much does each one cost?

2739
04:11:24,307 --> 04:11:23,927
$26.

2740
04:11:25,387 --> 04:11:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: $26.

2741
04:11:25,467 --> 04:11:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you already said that.

2742
04:11:26,228 --> 04:11:27,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just getting a little foggy inside.

2743
04:11:27,668 --> 04:11:27,648
$26. $26.

2744
04:11:29,803 --> 04:11:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so for us to get three copies per class is not unbelievably expensive.

2745
04:11:37,285 --> 04:11:38,445
[SPEAKER_11]: It's impossible.

2746
04:11:38,805 --> 04:11:42,406
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I think we could order 100 textbooks.

2747
04:11:42,606 --> 04:11:48,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You seem to be of the opinion that let's just go with the binder method, see how it goes.

2748
04:11:48,607 --> 04:11:51,207
[SPEAKER_04]: If we need the notebooks, later we get the notebooks.

2749
04:11:51,307 --> 04:11:53,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, we tweak it a bit.

2750
04:11:55,403 --> 04:11:56,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting the money.

2751
04:11:56,524 --> 04:12:00,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to take it.

2752
04:12:00,928 --> 04:12:03,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all for the kids, right?

2753
04:12:03,831 --> 04:12:05,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And just one last thing.

2754
04:12:05,092 --> 04:12:07,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do appreciate your collegial disagreement.

2755
04:12:07,594 --> 04:12:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's heartwarming at 11 o'clock at night that you have an academic disagreement, but it's always for the kids.

2756
04:12:14,740 --> 04:12:17,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's very heartwarming to me to see that.

2757
04:12:17,203 --> 04:12:17,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2758
04:12:17,563 --> 04:12:17,983
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2759
04:12:18,043 --> 04:12:18,364
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2760
04:12:20,158 --> 04:12:21,699
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I remember.

2761
04:12:21,759 --> 04:12:22,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

2762
04:12:22,420 --> 04:12:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on it.

2763
04:12:24,722 --> 04:12:25,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Ms.

2764
04:12:25,382 --> 04:12:27,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Krebs, I did get a chance to.

2765
04:12:27,624 --> 04:12:30,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having trouble with my technology, so not everybody got on.

2766
04:12:30,386 --> 04:12:30,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

2767
04:12:30,486 --> 04:12:31,006
[SPEAKER_31]: Van der Kloot.

2768
04:12:32,287 --> 04:12:37,952
[SPEAKER_25]: I did not receive your letter, probably because you sent it to the school, and it never forwards to me.

2769
04:12:37,992 --> 04:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_25]: Pvanderkloot at gmail.com.

2770
04:12:40,033 --> 04:12:40,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Works every time.

2771
04:12:41,574 --> 04:12:47,579
[SPEAKER_25]: So look, if we do the extensive PD, and we talked about the need for PD, it's $15,350.

2772
04:12:51,180 --> 04:12:52,241
[SPEAKER_25]: 12,962 buys us one set.

2773
04:12:52,881 --> 04:12:59,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, it seems to me that there's huge arguments in favor of doing a comprehensive middle school program.

2774
04:13:00,603 --> 04:13:02,643
[SPEAKER_25]: We hear Ms.

2775
04:13:02,723 --> 04:13:11,045
[SPEAKER_25]: Irving's concerns and we respect her very much from years, if not decades,

2776
04:13:11,883 --> 04:13:12,583
[SPEAKER_25]: working together.

2777
04:13:14,364 --> 04:13:15,545
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay, I didn't even read it.

2778
04:13:16,245 --> 04:13:30,272
[SPEAKER_25]: So the question is, one of the things that we haven't really quite understood overall is where we are in the comprehensive budget final number, because ultimately this comes down to a budget number.

2779
04:13:30,292 --> 04:13:35,395
[SPEAKER_25]: So one set of books and a teacher's edition comes to $12,962, but we're saying maybe we want more than

2780
04:13:41,398 --> 04:13:42,939
[SPEAKER_25]: a teacher to have more than one set.

2781
04:13:44,120 --> 04:13:52,547
[SPEAKER_25]: So let's say we were willing to, if we had the money and we wanted to put, we're saying, look, this is so important, we're going to spend $75,000 on it this year.

2782
04:13:53,267 --> 04:13:55,089
[SPEAKER_25]: How many books does that get us?

2783
04:13:55,329 --> 04:14:00,293
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we have that money in our, is that possible for us?

2784
04:14:00,373 --> 04:14:01,174
[SPEAKER_25]: What is the limit?

2785
04:14:01,214 --> 04:14:03,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I don't think we've answered that question yet.

2786
04:14:03,676 --> 04:14:07,318
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know in our budget where we are.

2787
04:14:09,812 --> 04:14:10,892
[SPEAKER_25]: it becomes very difficult.

2788
04:14:11,132 --> 04:14:24,497
[SPEAKER_25]: I personally believe that we should go forward, okay, but we should go forward with the maximum amount of professional development, that we should go forward with the maximum amount of resources for students that we can afford.

2789
04:14:25,219 --> 04:14:25,559
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2790
04:14:26,899 --> 04:14:32,360
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, that we don't want to set people up for failure.

2791
04:14:32,681 --> 04:14:33,621
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

2792
04:14:34,021 --> 04:14:36,921
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to say two things.

2793
04:14:37,301 --> 04:14:48,384
[SPEAKER_01]: First is that the two-day PD will cost $6,500, and then on top of it, we'll need additional $15,350 for the year-round PD.

2794
04:14:48,464 --> 04:14:49,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's plus.

2795
04:14:49,504 --> 04:14:50,204
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a plus.

2796
04:14:50,384 --> 04:14:51,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a $21,000, over $21,000 cost.

2797
04:14:55,312 --> 04:15:08,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cost for the books, I mean, I can calculate it and resent, but right now, if we move forward, we'll need $6,500 within this school year to pay for that.

2798
04:15:19,083 --> 04:15:19,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2799
04:15:19,883 --> 04:15:23,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to explain why June 3rd and 4th were chosen.

2800
04:15:24,765 --> 04:15:29,567
[SPEAKER_01]: After that is the last week of the school, and there are many activities taking place.

2801
04:15:29,807 --> 04:15:40,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Even those two days were such a struggle, I contacted both the principals, and among them, McGlynn's principal, Mr. Tucci, said... He's my favorite.

2802
04:15:40,231 --> 04:15:40,611
[SPEAKER_01]: He is.

2803
04:15:40,671 --> 04:15:41,952
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very thorough.

2804
04:15:42,332 --> 04:15:43,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mr. Tucci said...

2805
04:15:46,478 --> 04:15:49,340
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that FISA, please don't take 6th and 7th.

2806
04:15:49,400 --> 04:15:53,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they're going on a field trip somewhere for those of you who have middle school kids there.

2807
04:15:53,842 --> 04:15:57,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we had to go to 3rd and 4th.

2808
04:15:58,125 --> 04:16:05,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I just want to, again, just let everybody know that I believe this is the best program.

2809
04:16:06,070 --> 04:16:08,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I wholeheartedly feel that way.

2810
04:16:08,531 --> 04:16:11,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else that I have talked to feel the same way.

2811
04:16:12,053 --> 04:16:14,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And to reiterate, it's going to take time.

2812
04:16:15,925 --> 04:16:17,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

2813
04:16:17,487 --> 04:16:18,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

2814
04:16:18,207 --> 04:16:20,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make a motion to approve this entire.

2815
04:16:20,529 --> 04:16:25,134
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a motion on the floor by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

2816
04:16:25,194 --> 04:16:26,795
[SPEAKER_31]: Mustone, I believe.

2817
04:16:27,636 --> 04:16:28,637
[SPEAKER_31]: Roll call vote, please.

2818
04:16:28,677 --> 04:16:28,777
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

2819
04:16:42,248 --> 04:16:47,250
[SPEAKER_31]: This is to approve the curriculum and then they'll purchase what needs to be purchased.

2820
04:16:47,350 --> 04:16:50,911
[SPEAKER_31]: It's right there.

2821
04:16:50,971 --> 04:16:53,952
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

2822
04:16:54,452 --> 04:16:55,052
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you both.

2823
04:16:55,373 --> 04:16:56,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2824
04:16:56,833 --> 04:16:59,074
[SPEAKER_31]: She's going to have to print for you forever.

2825
04:16:59,094 --> 04:17:00,294
[SPEAKER_31]: Excuse me?

2826
04:17:00,374 --> 04:17:02,155
[SPEAKER_31]: She's going to have to print for you forever.

2827
04:17:02,175 --> 04:17:04,076
[SPEAKER_31]: She will.

2828
04:17:04,136 --> 04:17:05,316
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything for you, though.

2829
04:17:06,157 --> 04:17:06,677
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2830
04:17:10,790 --> 04:17:13,071
[SPEAKER_31]: We do have two items that were under suspension.

2831
04:17:13,551 --> 04:17:14,211
[SPEAKER_31]: One is from Ms.

2832
04:17:14,231 --> 04:17:17,692
[SPEAKER_31]: McLaughlin, who asked if she could speak for three minutes or less.

2833
04:17:18,172 --> 04:17:18,612
[SPEAKER_31]: You're good?

2834
04:17:18,632 --> 04:17:20,252
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm all, I'm ready to speak.

2835
04:17:20,492 --> 04:17:22,353
[SPEAKER_31]: And you're still here, okay.

2836
04:17:24,033 --> 04:17:26,234
[SPEAKER_32]: I do, I've never seen that.

2837
04:17:26,394 --> 04:17:29,775
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, the other, we have two resolutions.

2838
04:17:30,575 --> 04:17:35,776
[SPEAKER_31]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Salvatore Caraviello.

2839
04:17:36,416 --> 04:17:39,997
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Caraviello was the uncle of Medford City Councilor Richard Caraviello.

2840
04:17:41,593 --> 04:17:46,516
[SPEAKER_31]: Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Elizabeth Irving.

2841
04:17:47,076 --> 04:17:47,256
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

2842
04:17:47,316 --> 04:17:50,858
[SPEAKER_31]: Irving was the mother of McGlynn Middle School math teacher Robin Irving.

2843
04:17:51,218 --> 04:17:55,340
[SPEAKER_31]: She passed away June 22 at the age of 93 years old.

2844
04:17:55,920 --> 04:18:00,723
[SPEAKER_31]: A lifelong resident of West Medford, she was the mother of six girls who all graduated from Medford High School.

2845
04:18:01,343 --> 04:18:06,126
[SPEAKER_31]: Robin Irving, the father of Robin, passed away January 4, 2016 at the age of 88 years old.

2846
04:18:08,989 --> 04:18:21,272
[SPEAKER_31]: Could we please all rise for a moment of silence on the passing of... Thank you.

2847
04:18:23,532 --> 04:18:27,493
[SPEAKER_31]: Also, we have a long resolution.

2848
04:18:27,513 --> 04:18:29,814
[SPEAKER_31]: To hold harmless 2019 10th grade MCAS due to racist question.

2849
04:18:36,360 --> 04:18:44,143
[SPEAKER_31]: Whereas, the graduation requirement makes the 10th grade MCAS exam one of the highest stakes exams most Massachusetts students take.

2850
04:18:44,824 --> 04:18:50,786
[SPEAKER_31]: Whereas, teachers, families, schools, and tax payers all invest time and resources to give students the best possible chance at success on the exam.

2851
04:18:51,267 --> 04:18:59,150
[SPEAKER_31]: Whereas, the recent 10th grade MCAS English exam contained an essay that required students to write a journal entry from the perspective of an openly racist character.

2852
04:18:59,290 --> 04:19:00,291
[SPEAKER_31]: And whereas, the Mass Deci

2853
04:19:01,571 --> 04:19:05,115
[SPEAKER_31]: was unable to defend the question, quickly moving to not have it count.

2854
04:19:05,856 --> 04:19:12,382
[SPEAKER_31]: And whereas we only discovered this because students had the courage to violate the rules about discussing specific MCAS questions.

2855
04:19:13,163 --> 04:19:18,208
[SPEAKER_31]: And whereas research shows that exposure to negative stereotypes can have a negative impact on student performance.

2856
04:19:18,648 --> 04:19:22,232
[SPEAKER_31]: And whereas the impact of the racist question on performance cannot be quantified.

2857
04:19:23,684 --> 04:19:51,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee calls on DESE to exempt students who took the test with the rejected question from the graduation exam requirement, and further that the Medford School Committee calls for DESE to immediately implement a policy of releasing old MCAS questions so that there can be transparency to prevent such egregious errors in the future, and further resolved that a copy of this resolution be delivered to DESE, the governor, and the Medford state and local legislative delegations, and otherwise widely distributed.

2858
04:19:52,847 --> 04:19:54,768
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. Russo, on the motion?

2859
04:19:55,029 --> 04:19:55,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2860
04:19:55,429 --> 04:19:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve, please.

2861
04:19:56,390 --> 04:19:57,250
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to approve.

2862
04:19:57,310 --> 04:19:58,551
[SPEAKER_31]: Is there a second on the floor?

2863
04:19:58,691 --> 04:19:59,912
[SPEAKER_31]: Seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

2864
04:20:00,372 --> 04:20:01,493
[SPEAKER_31]: Roll call vote, please.

2865
04:20:01,513 --> 04:20:04,735
[SPEAKER_31]: Senator Stone?

2866
04:20:05,356 --> 04:20:05,536
Yes.

2867
04:20:05,556 --> 04:20:06,016
Senator Ruggiero?

2868
04:20:06,256 --> 04:20:06,436
Yes.

2869
04:20:07,777 --> 04:20:09,579
[SPEAKER_30]: Senator Russo?

2870
04:20:09,739 --> 04:20:10,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2871
04:20:10,039 --> 04:20:11,660
[SPEAKER_30]: Senator Vanden Heuvel?

2872
04:20:11,740 --> 04:20:11,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2873
04:20:11,900 --> 04:20:12,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor?

2874
04:20:12,681 --> 04:20:13,061
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

2875
04:20:13,722 --> 04:20:18,065
[SPEAKER_31]: And a vote of 5 in the affirmative, 2 absent, and the motion passes.

2876
04:20:19,365 --> 04:20:19,766
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2877
04:20:22,260 --> 04:20:23,720
[SPEAKER_31]: The only thing we have is your updates.

2878
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:24,201
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you want to?

2879
04:20:24,981 --> 04:20:26,361
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, we have one more report.

2880
04:20:26,401 --> 04:20:27,001
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry.

2881
04:20:29,542 --> 04:20:32,243
[SPEAKER_31]: There is a short report on K-12 assessments.

2882
04:20:33,123 --> 04:20:33,383
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

2883
04:20:33,964 --> 04:20:34,524
[SPEAKER_31]: Superintendent.

2884
04:20:35,364 --> 04:20:38,305
[SPEAKER_37]: I just... Oh, wonderful.

2885
04:20:38,605 --> 04:20:42,066
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, there's a motion on the floor to table it by Ms.

2886
04:20:42,166 --> 04:20:43,667
[SPEAKER_31]: DeRusso, seconded by Ms.
