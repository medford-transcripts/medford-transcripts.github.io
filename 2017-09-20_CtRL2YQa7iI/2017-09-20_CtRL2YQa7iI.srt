55
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:20,059
[SPEAKER_19]: Hearing and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Those who would like to speak in favor, please step forward now.

57
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that would be it.

58
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

59
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,464
[SPEAKER_32]: Anita Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.

60
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,165
[SPEAKER_19]: And you were the owner, correct?

61
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:38,565
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

62
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:41,106
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm the managing director of Ultimate Tango,

63
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:50,314
[SPEAKER_32]: We want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours.

64
00:03:50,854 --> 00:04:01,846
[SPEAKER_32]: So Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved.

65
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:11,591
[SPEAKER_32]: and also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman.

66
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:26,278
[SPEAKER_32]: So we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially.

67
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:33,362
[SPEAKER_32]: So those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios.

68
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:37,504
[SPEAKER_32]: And right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday.

69
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:49,911
[SPEAKER_32]: So our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of being open, business being open, would be Sunday to start.

70
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,633
[SPEAKER_32]: We will not initially use any other day.

71
00:04:53,533 --> 00:05:02,700
[SPEAKER_32]: so it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance.

72
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:18,472
[SPEAKER_32]: Those milongas have special settings, it's the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other, they usually come as a couple, husband and wife or people who are together or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together

73
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:27,515
[SPEAKER_32]: There is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance, there is a special code how many dances then dance together.

74
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:32,716
[SPEAKER_32]: There is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it.

75
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:38,898
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like.

76
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:44,980
[SPEAKER_32]: So there is no kind of like a wild party settings.

77
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,381
[SPEAKER_32]: The music is very mild.

78
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:49,064
[SPEAKER_32]: People behave actually very, very politely.

79
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,326
[SPEAKER_32]: They care for the ladies, they care for the partners.

80
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:54,849
[SPEAKER_32]: They walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe.

81
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:03,437
[SPEAKER_32]: I explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding.

82
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:09,940
[SPEAKER_32]: how it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too.

83
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,681
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's pretty much it.

84
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you very much.

85
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:24,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons also we have the event at 9 p.m., because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week.

86
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:30,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this Sunday, there are another two studios who organize two more practices in different hours.

87
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,532
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't want a conflict with another business,

88
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,614
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to respect the hour.

89
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:38,015
[SPEAKER_00]: The only hour we can start it would be like at 9 p.m.

90
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:51,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and for different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party.

91
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:59,745
[SPEAKER_00]: For they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour and be in the studio just for two hours practicing or maybe

92
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:04,644
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in Argentina, the milongas went for hours, so people just keep dancing.

93
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:05,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of ritual.

94
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,746
[SPEAKER_00]: In Argentina, we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m.

95
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:08,106
[SPEAKER_00]: until...

96
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:41,148
[SPEAKER_32]: We also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hears it outside.

97
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:54,413
[SPEAKER_32]: And since most people drive, and there's plenty of parking here, and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.

98
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:58,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

99
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:00,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Dajew.

100
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,028
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

101
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,991
[SPEAKER_30]: I've reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order.

102
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:12,294
[SPEAKER_30]: I've noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made.

103
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:15,917
[SPEAKER_30]: Initially, the request was to stay open until 4 a.m.

104
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:16,797
[SPEAKER_30]: Sunday evenings.

105
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:23,922
[SPEAKER_30]: Chief Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation until 1 a.m.

106
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,884
[SPEAKER_30]: That's something that he feels as though he's comfortable with.

107
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:31,047
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m.

108
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:43,263
[SPEAKER_30]: And no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street.

109
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,006
[SPEAKER_30]: I do have a question for the petitioners.

110
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,348
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there going to be any live music?

111
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:56,266
[SPEAKER_32]: No, there is only going to be recorded music.

112
00:08:56,306 --> 00:09:01,868
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like.

113
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,089
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.

114
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,089
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

115
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:17,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my first question you answer the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.

116
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,602
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound of the tango is very mild music.

117
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,584
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get out.

118
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:31,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the rest of us, we did a check sound with them and they don't hear nothing.

119
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

120
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:52,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And my second question, if you are going to be open till one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing?

121
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,445
[SPEAKER_07]: What will there be for food and beverage?

122
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:05,099
[SPEAKER_32]: During regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water.

123
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:16,471
[SPEAKER_32]: So no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.

124
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:19,918
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

125
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:38,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Development Committee, which takes care of signs.

126
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:53,719
[SPEAKER_28]: We've worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people.

127
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,721
[SPEAKER_28]: They've been compliant to any of our requests.

128
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:12,210
[SPEAKER_28]: They've certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us, and so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people.

129
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:23,872
[SPEAKER_28]: As a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community.

130
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:35,961
[SPEAKER_28]: They'll bring something new and diverse to us, something positive and energetic, and so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.

131
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

132
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone else would like to speak in fairness?

133
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,048
[SPEAKER_10]: name and address of the record, please.

134
00:11:43,068 --> 00:12:00,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, Dominic Camara, the Chamber of Commerce of the Governmental Affairs Committees, and I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbon symbolically, if nothing else.

135
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was very, very enthralled.

136
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very happy to see the operation.

137
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:06,017
[SPEAKER_10]: It's beautiful.

138
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:14,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It's downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the geographic position of the place, and that's where the old Channel 3 thing used to be.

139
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:19,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very, very nice, very professional and so on.

140
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:22,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And I gotta tell you, with all the tango that was playing and so on, and these two can dance.

141
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:24,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, can they dance?

142
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:37,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one.

143
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:40,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything.

144
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:42,678
[SPEAKER_10]: So disturbance is not an issue.

145
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:43,579
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the bottom line.

146
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:50,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Any life that you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for.

147
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope that another studio like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock.

148
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to, you know, when the time comes.

149
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty much what I have to say.

150
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And I welcome them in the city of Medford.

151
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're wonderful professional people and they're so talented.

152
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,071
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have nothing but happiness for them.

153
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:05,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

154
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:06,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

155
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,206
[SPEAKER_19]: And I for one can say I was there that night that they opened.

156
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,627
[SPEAKER_19]: I was very impressed.

157
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:11,328
[SPEAKER_19]: The men were dressed.

158
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:12,108
[SPEAKER_19]: The women were dressed.

159
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,270
[SPEAKER_19]: The dancing was outstanding.

160
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:21,256
[SPEAKER_19]: And like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway.

161
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:27,261
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango, and anybody can do that.

162
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:34,627
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, I welcome them, and I think the studio was very, very nice, and it's very impressive what I saw that night.

163
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,148
[SPEAKER_19]: If they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble.

164
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:36,688
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

165
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,970
[SPEAKER_19]: We wouldn't give up hope.

166
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Move approval.

167
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,456
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

168
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:45,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

169
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:47,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

170
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:48,378
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

171
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:48,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

172
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

173
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

174
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:54,091
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll hopefully be done.

175
00:13:54,151 --> 00:14:04,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be down for those dance lessons.

176
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:04,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

177
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:04,934
[SPEAKER_19]: 717-617.

178
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Location of poles, attachment of fixtures, underground conduits.

179
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:19,427
[SPEAKER_19]: You are hereby notified that by an order of the Medford City Council, public hearing will be given at the Caron Theater at Medford High School, 489 Winterstreet, Medford, Madison, 7 p.m.

180
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:33,792
[SPEAKER_19]: on Tuesday, September 19th, under petition by Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, for permission to lay and maintain underground conduits, manholes, handholes, vaults, and ladders with wires and cables,

181
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:38,055
[SPEAKER_19]: to be placed therein under the surface of the following public way.

182
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:46,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Several occasions to be placed in accordance with the plan titles proposed, Ashland and Salem Street, dated July 20th, 2017.

183
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Ashland Street.

184
00:14:50,672 --> 00:15:09,132
[SPEAKER_19]: Starting at existing utility pole number 5143 on Asher Street, excavating in the roadway and placing two 4-inch PVC conduits 105 feet give or take to a proposed 24-inch by 36-inch vault located in the sidewalk on Salem Street.

185
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:25,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Salem Street, from proposed vault number one, continuing with two four-inch PVC conduits, 160 feet, give or take, in the street to a proposed 24 by 36 vault located in the sidewalk.

186
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:26,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Approved.

187
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:38,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Chief Engineer with a provision that, prior to obtaining a trench permit from the city, Comcast shall submit a detailed traffic management plan

188
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Night work may be required.

189
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:50,669
[SPEAKER_19]: The impacted handicap access parking space will need to be relocated.

190
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:57,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Any work on Ashland Street will require grinding and inlay of the trench from center line to curb.

191
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:02,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Trench paving of Salem Street will be asphalt-based coarse material.

192
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:07,336
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition, pavement will be made to the city in lieu of Comcast final pavement.

193
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:13,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Sidewalk will be replaced in kind with curb removed and reset if necessary.

194
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:18,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Test pits, well in advance of the work, will be required at the crossing of Salem Street.

195
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:29,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Comcast's plan shows that in electrical duct bank with no terminus minus, this must be corrected prior to conducting test pits.

196
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,141
[SPEAKER_19]: All city-owned sewer drain and water laterals must be shown as well.

197
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:37,002
[SPEAKER_19]: No city-owned or private utilities will be damaged.

198
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:49,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Water and sewer mains and services, for example, being crossed by the proposed conduit will be investigated by Comcast and the city in advance of the receipt of street opening permit.

199
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:55,599
[SPEAKER_19]: The city will determine which need to be replaced, and Comcast will either replace or file the replacement.

200
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Proper vertical and horizontal clearances will be maintained.

201
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:02,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Overall, the contract shall utilize the City of Medford standards,

202
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,950
[SPEAKER_19]: in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices as appropriate.

203
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Approved, Superintendent of Wires.

204
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodation.

205
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,751
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a public hearing.

206
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Those in favor of this, please step forward.

207
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

208
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:29,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Jermaine Acostas, 25 Salem Street, owner of Metro Electronics.

209
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely in favor of this,

210
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,940
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, Mr. Congressman.

211
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Dean Forwell and Comcast, moving Massachusetts.

212
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,481
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in favor of the project.

213
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:41,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

214
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:41,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

215
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,301
[SPEAKER_22]: To be able to provide service.

216
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone else in favor of this project?

217
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:51,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the meeting.

218
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:56,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone that is not in favor of this project, please step forward.

219
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the meeting.

220
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:04,606
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Comcast, if you could step forward.

221
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:11,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record base?

222
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Dave, the Walling Comcast.

223
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, could you please explain your project then?

224
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:20,520
[SPEAKER_22]: For this project we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service

225
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:26,971
[SPEAKER_22]: We're basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street.

226
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:41,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Originally the Century Bank is the customer but in doing this project we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank.

227
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:51,352
[SPEAKER_22]: I did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review.

228
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:58,697
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed.

229
00:18:58,717 --> 00:18:59,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Those maps.

230
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,159
[SPEAKER_27]: Those full maps.

231
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,481
[SPEAKER_27]: I think everybody has their maps with them.

232
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:10,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

233
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:13,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

234
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few questions about just the project in general.

235
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:33,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?

236
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,195
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved.

237
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,437
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that's a heavy congested area.

238
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:54,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Depending upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of.

239
00:19:54,965 --> 00:20:02,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.

240
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?

241
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:14,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, it all depends on what the city engineer believe when they issue the permit, if it's going to be

242
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,557
[SPEAKER_22]: to do it at night and we may be able to get more work done.

243
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.

244
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And could you tell us, let's see, basically with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks.

245
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up?

246
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,273
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be replacing them with cements?

247
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:44,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

248
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:50,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?

249
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:53,599
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there.

250
00:20:53,619 --> 00:21:02,065
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault location is.

251
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:06,287
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.

252
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:08,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be replaced with concrete?

253
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:09,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

254
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:20,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you tell us with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways?

255
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:23,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?

256
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:24,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Not at all.

257
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:31,343
[SPEAKER_22]: The first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street, so there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from

258
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:39,005
[SPEAKER_22]: the first utility pulled down to Salem Street that would be impacted, and that work there is probably only going to take a day or so.

259
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:44,407
[SPEAKER_22]: They would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.

260
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:55,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work.

261
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,519
[SPEAKER_04]: needs to be paid once you're done opening up the street and whatnot.

262
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:09,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is, over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot.

263
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:15,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed that you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment.

264
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:18,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that payment going to be

265
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: reimbursement from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the sections that you cut open?

266
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,607
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving.

267
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:37,231
[SPEAKER_22]: I just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around.

268
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:45,435
[SPEAKER_22]: But I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb.

269
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:50,318
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in.

270
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:55,561
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.

271
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:04,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving.

272
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess my question is basically,

273
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:10,384
[SPEAKER_04]: are you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb?

274
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:11,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like enough.

275
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:15,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.

276
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:29,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Based off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season.

277
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:35,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.

278
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:41,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that might be a little bit of a point of contention.

279
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:48,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads.

280
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: The last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us.

281
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And they basically promised that they would pave curb to curb.

282
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we're almost setting precedent by doing this now.

283
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come

284
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,054
[SPEAKER_04]: My colleagues may have a further comment on that, but I just think that we need to.

285
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,800
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that the street is repaired.

286
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And I may like to see curb-to-curb repaving.

287
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:26,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street.

288
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt.

289
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:33,585
[SPEAKER_04]: But I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street on a daily basis.

290
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:42,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time.

291
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a big cut through the street methods.

292
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Big cut through community.

293
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:56,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, sorry, I think curb to curb paving would be something that we should look at.

294
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:58,737
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

295
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:11,390
[SPEAKER_24]: And first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern.

296
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:22,438
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area.

297
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:32,467
[SPEAKER_24]: We also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old Armory building.

298
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:41,155
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi.

299
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:44,378
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm glad to see this finally moving forward.

300
00:25:45,056 --> 00:26:00,411
[SPEAKER_24]: The question I had, and I think Councilor Falco touched upon it, is of recent, the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb.

301
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,052
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's been

302
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,874
[SPEAKER_24]: an issue of contention among this council.

303
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:20,409
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb to curb knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it.

304
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,853
[SPEAKER_24]: And the question I have on this particular proposal

305
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:33,976
[SPEAKER_24]: It does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb.

306
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:39,578
[SPEAKER_24]: And right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that.

307
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:51,482
[SPEAKER_24]: And it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement.

308
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:54,305
[SPEAKER_24]: What exactly does that language mean?

309
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,147
[SPEAKER_24]: That doesn't really say much to me.

310
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:58,608
[SPEAKER_22]: That's something that the city engineer wrote in.

311
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:02,271
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself.

312
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Typically, we do all our own paving.

313
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:09,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Typically, we repave the trench.

314
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:13,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes if it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side.

315
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:17,682
[SPEAKER_22]: But in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road.

316
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:25,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Therefore, you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line.

317
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Or I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification.

318
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:35,353
[SPEAKER_22]: If we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.

319
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,646
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, and the way I read it is a little different.

320
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:54,117
[SPEAKER_24]: I read it is the city will determine how these streets will be put back and not just whether Comcast will do the work of the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb center line to curb in the city will make that determination.

321
00:27:54,792 --> 00:28:03,315
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this.

322
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:09,578
[SPEAKER_24]: And do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?

323
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:10,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

324
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,600
[SPEAKER_24]: And if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that?

325
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

326
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:27,104
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.

327
00:28:28,284 --> 00:28:29,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

328
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:30,285
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

329
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:32,186
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Dyke.

330
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,006
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President.

331
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:46,885
[SPEAKER_30]: Very difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place.

332
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:52,168
[SPEAKER_30]: And the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration.

333
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,950
[SPEAKER_30]: But the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met.

334
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:59,452
[SPEAKER_30]: But before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know.

335
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,854
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there.

336
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,275
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this.

337
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:11,260
[SPEAKER_30]: We've entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Medford, where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years.

338
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,182
[SPEAKER_30]: But we don't know what the construction schedule is.

339
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:16,724
[SPEAKER_30]: Now, it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed.

340
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:21,108
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Medford Square.

341
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,910
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district.

342
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:41,607
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Medford Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go.

343
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:49,053
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration.

344
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:51,695
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'd like to see it, Mr. President.

345
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:55,238
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track.

346
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,220
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, we want to see the curbs paved.

347
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,381
[SPEAKER_30]: We want to see it paved curb to curb.

348
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,383
[SPEAKER_30]: That's been something we've been hounding on for four years.

349
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:08,227
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighbourhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly.

350
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:21,334
[SPEAKER_30]: Sometimes it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighbourhoods.

351
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:23,875
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President.

352
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,617
[SPEAKER_30]: Certainly, I think it's a noble cause and I think it's a great

353
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:30,960
[SPEAKER_30]: and a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work.

354
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:44,832
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.

355
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:46,353
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

356
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,114
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Dello Russo.

357
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:51,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this.

358
00:30:52,020 --> 00:31:07,935
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade.

359
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:09,717
[SPEAKER_28]: First, let me say this.

360
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:18,351
[SPEAKER_28]: I think this is a good measure, we need it in the square, and Comcast needs to get this work done.

361
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:23,954
[SPEAKER_28]: They're the primary provider here in the city of Medford, and people need this service.

362
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:36,200
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking at the language in this petition, and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone, and she's doing something about it.

363
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:55,348
[SPEAKER_28]: is going to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets, and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer.

364
00:31:55,889 --> 00:32:01,812
[SPEAKER_28]: And if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide.

365
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:04,153
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think we need to have a motion

366
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:33,988
[SPEAKER_28]: an amendment to this paper that the city council understands that the language herein, this petition for this public hearing and to have this work done is saying that the city engineer of the city of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb that Comcast understands that and will fund

367
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:42,755
[SPEAKER_28]: the City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford.

368
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,598
[SPEAKER_28]: Traffic plans, traffic, digging up sales.

369
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:58,261
[SPEAKER_28]: 10 of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square.

370
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:09,689
[SPEAKER_28]: We had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented.

371
00:33:11,178 --> 00:33:23,124
[SPEAKER_28]: not engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development.

372
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,687
[SPEAKER_28]: We had several private contractors over the years advise the cities.

373
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:35,911
[SPEAKER_28]: The plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here.

374
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:39,993
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week

375
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:50,663
[SPEAKER_28]: from citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going.

376
00:33:51,363 --> 00:34:08,272
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using

377
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:13,432
[SPEAKER_28]: Salem Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway.

378
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:15,894
[SPEAKER_28]: And let them find another way.

379
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:22,819
[SPEAKER_28]: Let them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards.

380
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:33,927
[SPEAKER_28]: So if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them.

381
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,913
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's let's look at this.

382
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:42,426
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's let the engineering department and the community development department

383
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:52,446
[SPEAKER_28]: experiment with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it.

384
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,787
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think the citizens of Medford will benefit.

385
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:57,207
[SPEAKER_28]: They're going to benefit from getting this work done.

386
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:02,949
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully, they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need.

387
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,111
[SPEAKER_28]: And Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight.

388
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:07,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

389
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:08,852
[SPEAKER_28]: With that amendment.

390
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:09,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

391
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:12,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

392
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:13,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, my colleagues.

393
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:17,481
[SPEAKER_16]: I think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns.

394
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate Dave from Comcast.

395
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:24,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe Comcast has any issues.

396
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:25,809
[SPEAKER_16]: I have any issues with Comcast.

397
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:27,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you've done your due diligence.

398
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:33,617
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've made

399
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:53,572
[SPEAKER_16]: echo this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that

400
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:57,275
[SPEAKER_16]: you put forth as your company, I think that's been very receptive.

401
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:06,378
[SPEAKER_16]: But I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying, which is the biggest point is City Engineer.

402
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:18,382
[SPEAKER_16]: We can talk going back and forth about voting or not voting, but I think that my recommendation would be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the City Engineer

403
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:20,943
[SPEAKER_16]: to get these questions answered.

404
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:35,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Traffic plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Medford Square.

405
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:47,070
[SPEAKER_16]: But understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street.

406
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,398
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to delay this.

407
00:36:50,738 --> 00:36:51,719
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to push it forward.

408
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:59,428
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the same time, I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department.

409
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,693
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to move forward.

410
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:28,341
[SPEAKER_16]: for our businesses and our community, but at the same time, I think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified.

411
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:42,492
[SPEAKER_16]: making sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square.

412
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:53,299
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer?

413
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:03,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward.

414
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:06,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to delay it so it does fall into construction questions.

415
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:23,961
[SPEAKER_16]: but moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to

416
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:41,242
[SPEAKER_16]: with what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly.

417
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:42,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

418
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

419
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:43,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President?

420
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:47,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

421
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be clear.

422
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:54,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb to curb?

423
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:55,073
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

424
00:38:56,755 --> 00:39:00,138
[SPEAKER_22]: And if I if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night.

425
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:04,922
[SPEAKER_22]: We just need to know if we if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours?

426
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:08,446
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I would be able to give you a schedule, the point of information if I can.

427
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:11,488
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, this is the frustration frustrating part.

428
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:15,132
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that the engineer that we should have had from the engineer.

429
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,974
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that you as the contract of

430
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:22,000
[SPEAKER_16]: for Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that.

431
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:23,383
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my frustration.

432
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:24,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

433
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:39,191
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare and one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb.

434
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:46,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans for the week.

435
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:47,718
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a traffic plan.

436
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:51,281
[SPEAKER_22]: I did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time.

437
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,623
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy.

438
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this it, Dick?

439
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,786
[SPEAKER_24]: No, this isn't the traffic.

440
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:58,627
[SPEAKER_22]: This is what you said?

441
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,347
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the traffic.

442
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's the traffic.

443
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,198
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work.

444
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:11,681
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night.

445
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,224
[SPEAKER_22]: But I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed.

446
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:19,147
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.

447
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have it, too.

448
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at it.

449
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't look like the directions aren't on here.

450
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that.

451
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:33,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted.

452
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:42,739
[SPEAKER_07]: My last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be.

453
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:56,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curve-to-curve from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curve-to-curve.

454
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:58,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think we need to figure out a way that,

455
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:05,580
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out what we want as a group, collectively, of going forward for all utility companies.

456
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do it fairly, and we require the same thing from every single company.

457
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:20,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're on track with, obviously, making our streets be repaired much better than they have been, and where things are sinking and dipping.

458
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're on the right track.

459
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:24,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think we need to have a discussion in

460
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:30,808
[SPEAKER_07]: in committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.

461
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Layton.

462
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:36,091
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner.

463
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:39,613
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received.

464
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,754
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that we've held a public hearing.

465
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:45,717
[SPEAKER_30]: We've heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit.

466
00:41:46,837 --> 00:42:00,706
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule.

467
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:02,107
[SPEAKER_30]: to the Council for approval.

468
00:42:02,507 --> 00:42:13,056
[SPEAKER_30]: So we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval.

469
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:17,520
[SPEAKER_30]: So if the permit can be approved, provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those.

470
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,422
[SPEAKER_30]: Just an option, just a way for us to maybe

471
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:21,963
[SPEAKER_30]: move this along.

472
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:24,084
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast.

473
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:27,345
[SPEAKER_30]: As I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward.

474
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:35,048
[SPEAKER_30]: We could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval.

475
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:36,688
[SPEAKER_30]: And upon our approval, the permit will be issued.

476
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,529
[SPEAKER_30]: But we don't need to bring the gentleman back.

477
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:40,669
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter.

478
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:45,171
[SPEAKER_30]: We can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.

479
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:47,768
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Dello Russo.

480
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:58,754
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it.

481
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:02,015
[SPEAKER_28]: If we accept this amendment, we've clarified it.

482
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:07,358
[SPEAKER_28]: We want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our

483
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:23,725
[SPEAKER_28]: discussions over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable.

484
00:43:24,246 --> 00:43:27,149
[SPEAKER_28]: And it seems to me the way I read this language

485
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,891
[SPEAKER_28]: here in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that.

486
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:45,455
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done.

487
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:55,098
[SPEAKER_28]: So if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors.

488
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:56,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Quite frankly,

489
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:57,920
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not qualified.

490
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,282
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not an engineer.

491
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:01,265
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not a construction person.

492
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,007
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't shovel snow.

493
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,351
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm pretty good with leaves.

494
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:10,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Every morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office.

495
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:20,032
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the scope of my construction skills, but the engineer and her staff understand this.

496
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:29,638
[SPEAKER_28]: This is their profession, and it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked, and I think we should allow them.

497
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:36,182
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary.

498
00:44:37,663 --> 00:44:46,889
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that the construction people need to be aware that National Engineers had some serious problems historically in that area.

499
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:51,032
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there.

500
00:44:51,613 --> 00:45:00,819
[SPEAKER_28]: And as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of concern.

501
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

502
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:25,455
[SPEAKER_28]: As I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting.

503
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:29,959
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli has a motion on the table, if you want to present it.

504
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:31,320
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, I would present it.

505
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,983
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo's initiative.

506
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:40,566
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, again, my biggest concern is that the

507
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:48,737
[SPEAKER_16]: What we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that and move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction.

508
00:45:49,737 --> 00:46:15,879
[SPEAKER_16]: will, what's the timeline for the construction and whether making sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally, I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Method Square and to help our business owners and the,

509
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:25,545
[SPEAKER_16]: the neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.

510
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:26,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

511
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:28,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Layton.

512
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:44,115
[SPEAKER_30]: So as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be.

513
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:48,717
[SPEAKER_30]: And that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan.

514
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:59,600
[SPEAKER_30]: And the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.

515
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:06,223
[SPEAKER_16]: And the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know,

516
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:10,706
[SPEAKER_16]: the proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.

517
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:11,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Summarized perfectly.

518
00:47:11,948 --> 00:47:12,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

519
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:12,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

520
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:13,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

521
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

522
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:15,190
[SPEAKER_19]: I think somebody else would like to speak.

523
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address on the record, please.

524
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave McKillop, 94 Rockblind Road.

525
00:47:23,693 --> 00:47:27,617
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb.

526
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:34,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that Councilor Lungo-Koehn is 100% right as well as Councilor Marks and a few others.

527
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:39,668
[SPEAKER_08]: My recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up with a comprehensive

528
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:55,441
[SPEAKER_08]: engineer and, you know, project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street.

529
00:47:55,541 --> 00:48:08,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster.

530
00:48:09,048 --> 00:48:17,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of, I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from two and three patches to five and seven patches.

531
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:33,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curve based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go.

532
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:38,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project.

533
00:48:38,737 --> 00:48:44,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward.

534
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:54,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve.

535
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

536
00:48:55,992 --> 00:48:56,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

537
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:00,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

538
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:01,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

539
00:49:01,978 --> 00:49:03,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Geron Colostos, 25 Salem Street.

540
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:16,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards, and we have to hold somebody accountable for something.

541
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not gonna disregard as being not important.

542
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it's very important.

543
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Avenue, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this.

544
00:49:31,697 --> 00:49:34,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I went 30 years without anything but DSL.

545
00:49:36,615 --> 00:49:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great.

546
00:49:41,756 --> 00:49:44,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point, they're the only game in town for us.

547
00:49:45,397 --> 00:49:49,798
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon.

548
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:50,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have Verizon.

549
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Comcast has done their homework.

550
00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast.

551
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:01,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And the savings is great.

552
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:13,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I don't want to see happen is, as much as all these details are important, I don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like a tug of war.

553
00:50:13,418 --> 00:50:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly.

554
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for our expenditure to do what they need to do.

555
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:41,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval, and then if you're satisfied with what they submit, move forward and not come back to another public meeting.

556
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:45,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, let's move this along as quickly.

557
00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:46,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

558
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:46,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

559
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:48,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

560
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:51,819
[SPEAKER_30]: Move for approval as amended, Mr. President.

561
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:53,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scapelli has a motion to take.

562
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:58,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe I rescinded and move on to the recommendations of Councilor Knight.

563
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:00,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Move for approval as amended.

564
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:04,629
[SPEAKER_19]: A motion by Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

565
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:05,150
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk.

566
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:06,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Please call the roll.

567
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:15,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Before you call the roll, just as a B paper, if we could set up a meeting within the next month to discuss standards and guidelines, I think that is important.

568
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:18,515
[SPEAKER_07]: David hit it on the head.

569
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:21,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month.

570
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:22,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President?

571
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,779
[SPEAKER_30]: I do believe we had that meeting already.

572
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:30,103
[SPEAKER_30]: We posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth.

573
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:34,467
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.

574
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:38,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us.

575
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:41,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting.

576
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do.

577
00:51:49,632 --> 00:51:54,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do.

578
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:54,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk.

579
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

580
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:54,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

581
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:05,239
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

582
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:05,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

583
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:05,939
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

584
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

585
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,300
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

586
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:06,440
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

587
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:06,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

588
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,681
[SPEAKER_26]: 7 negative.

589
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:08,402
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

590
00:52:08,802 --> 00:52:09,102
[SPEAKER_26]: Suspension.

591
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:09,463
[SPEAKER_26]: If I can.

592
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:10,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

593
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:11,244
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that since we have

594
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:32,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have a paper that's been tabled 17-593.

595
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:44,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC, High Street, the position High Street and Hillside Ave for intersection.

596
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:50,552
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that we're waiting on a question that maybe could be answered to move this forward.

597
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:53,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the question was that we were asking for

598
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,214
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can't take it off the table.

599
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:02,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilman Scott Felde to take this up 17-593 off the table.

600
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:03,596
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

601
00:53:03,996 --> 00:53:04,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

602
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:05,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

603
00:53:05,677 --> 00:53:06,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilman Scott Felde.

604
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:07,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:11,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I apologize for jumping the gun, but I believe we're asking

606
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:23,198
[SPEAKER_16]: some clarification on this paper that we asked Comcast to report back to us to see if that job could be curb-to-curb also paving.

607
00:53:23,218 --> 00:53:25,781
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you haven't, can you respond to that?

608
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:29,124
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb.

609
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought it was half centerline.

610
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:44,147
[SPEAKER_16]: My recollection is curb to curb.

611
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,232
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a copy of the minutes, right?

612
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:49,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you, from the last meeting, can we get the copy?

613
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:20,799
[SPEAKER_27]: 1517-593 Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC August 15, 2017.

614
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:41,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, if I could.

615
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:46,024
[SPEAKER_30]: It was tabled based on a roll call vote for in the affirmative, three in the negative.

616
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:52,888
[SPEAKER_30]: I believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration.

617
00:54:52,928 --> 00:54:56,990
[SPEAKER_30]: But it doesn't say that, it just says upon motion to table a roll call vote.

618
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:59,651
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's not reflecting.

619
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:01,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, if I could.

620
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I happen to recall the discussion

621
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:12,479
[SPEAKER_24]: from three, four weeks ago, even though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night.

622
00:55:13,499 --> 00:55:15,201
[SPEAKER_24]: I do recall that discussion.

623
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:25,328
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so.

624
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:31,552
[SPEAKER_24]: So we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb.

625
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:42,921
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked another utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision.

626
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,543
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't know if this gentleman for the

627
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:48,524
[SPEAKER_24]: a high street project which is going into the armory.

628
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:55,086
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access.

629
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:58,647
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.

630
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:03,208
[SPEAKER_22]: For the record, Dave Walling, Comcast.

631
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:10,210
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going by the agenda from the trench to the curb.

632
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:14,152
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, if it's curb to curb, I can agree to curb to curb.

633
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:22,782
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll work with the same as the other petition on the schedule, whether it be at night or we'll work on the traffic management plan.

634
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:27,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I know this customer is looking for the service, so I'm looking.

635
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,031
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to slow it down.

636
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:39,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if we can on the motion that we move forward with the same stipulations, um, on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Russo.

637
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

638
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:42,623
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Clarity, Mr. President.

639
00:56:42,683 --> 00:56:45,425
[SPEAKER_30]: So PayPal 17593 is off the table.

640
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:47,427
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to vote on this evening to issue a permit.

641
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:55,771
[SPEAKER_30]: to dig a trench to access the armory building, and the same contingencies that we had just voted on for the prior paper would be in place?

642
00:56:55,811 --> 00:57:00,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Same contingencies that were on the other plan will be held to this standard also.

643
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:04,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And did we vote on the B paper last?

644
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:10,679
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought that was part of it.

645
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:17,123
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor De La Rosa, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

646
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:20,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Dello Russo?

647
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:21,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

648
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,470
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco?

649
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:22,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

650
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:23,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight?

651
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:24,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

652
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:25,351
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehnan?

653
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:25,611
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

654
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Marks?

655
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:27,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

656
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli?

657
00:57:28,452 --> 00:57:28,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

658
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:29,933
[SPEAKER_26]: Senator McCabeo?

659
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:30,373
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

660
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:33,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

661
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:34,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion ordinance passed.

662
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

663
00:57:35,295 --> 00:57:36,515
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, we're in suspension.

664
00:57:36,555 --> 00:57:38,256
[SPEAKER_30]: Can we take communications from the mayor?

665
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:38,516
[SPEAKER_30]: Paper 17649.

666
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:41,237
[SPEAKER_30]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take 17649.

667
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:53,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

668
00:57:53,565 --> 00:57:55,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

669
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:57,487
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President and councilors.

670
00:57:57,547 --> 00:58:00,388
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration.

671
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:01,748
[SPEAKER_30]: Give us a brief synopsis of the paper.

672
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:02,429
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

673
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:06,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though we can't see your name and address of the record.

674
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:07,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

675
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Frank Gilroy, Fire Chief, City of Medford.

676
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:14,713
[SPEAKER_13]: On 26 May.

677
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:19,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The request before you this evening, Mr. President, is for, uh,

678
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:35,140
[SPEAKER_13]: to approve payment of those five invoices with this year's appropriation.

679
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:38,582
[SPEAKER_13]: The amount totaling $4,362.25.

680
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:41,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Move approval.

681
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:43,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilman Locario.

682
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:48,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Just through the chair, what were the invoices specifically?

683
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

684
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:50,912
[SPEAKER_06]: A breakdown of what the invoices were for?

685
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:54,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Overhead door repairs on various stations.

686
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:00,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

687
00:59:00,962 --> 00:59:01,643
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, if I may?

688
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:03,304
[SPEAKER_30]: Constantly.

689
00:59:03,484 --> 00:59:07,026
[SPEAKER_30]: Chief, have those door issues been rectified in their entirety?

690
00:59:07,446 --> 00:59:10,868
[SPEAKER_30]: Have there been new doors placed in, or is it more of a patchwork repair type of thing?

691
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:12,849
[SPEAKER_18]: These were all just repairs for various items.

692
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:25,315
[SPEAKER_30]: And if I may, Chief, would you be comfortable this evening giving us an update on the status of the relocation search committee for the training tower?

693
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:27,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Not at all.

694
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:42,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe we're much closer to acquiring the property that I've requested behind the VFW.

695
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,950
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so you've identified a site.

696
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I wrote to the mayor.

697
00:59:48,232 --> 00:59:58,135
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor passed that along to our state representative, Mr. Donato, and he's been in touch with MassDOT and they seem to be very receptive to us.

698
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:01,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

699
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:02,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

700
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:02,492
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

701
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:03,212
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much.

702
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:04,193
[SPEAKER_30]: You've been done.

703
01:00:04,293 --> 01:00:05,634
[SPEAKER_30]: One other item I just want to follow up on.

704
01:00:05,774 --> 01:00:07,295
[SPEAKER_30]: The turnoff key, has that been issued?

705
01:00:07,836 --> 01:00:08,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

706
01:00:08,296 --> 01:00:10,698
[SPEAKER_30]: The second set of turnoff key, or is the second set of turnoff key have been issued?

707
01:00:10,738 --> 01:00:12,039
[SPEAKER_30]: We're just waiting for delivery.

708
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:13,200
[SPEAKER_30]: Waiting for delivery.

709
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,560
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

710
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:14,641
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much.

711
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:15,382
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

712
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:16,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Dello Russo.

713
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:21,106
[SPEAKER_27]: Chief, thank you for your leadership of the department.

714
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:23,248
[SPEAKER_27]: You're a man who gets things done.

715
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:25,149
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

716
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

717
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:27,391
[SPEAKER_29]: Move approval, Mr. President.

718
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Move the motion by Councilor Layton, seconded by?

719
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:45,482
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

720
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:45,562
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

721
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:46,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

722
01:00:46,322 --> 01:00:46,422
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

723
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:46,622
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

724
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:46,802
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

725
01:00:46,822 --> 01:00:46,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

726
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:47,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

727
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:19,981
[SPEAKER_30]: Move to suspend the rules and take 1-7-6-5-0, Mr. President.

728
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:20,222
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-6-5-0.

729
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:24,043
[SPEAKER_30]: Motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration give a brief synopsis of the paper.

730
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:32,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

731
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:33,765
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Councilors.

732
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:43,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here tonight to request approval for a bill we have from Jamie Thompson-Plumbing regarding a site at 38 Circus Street.

733
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:50,009
[SPEAKER_20]: He was called out in November of 2015 on two separate calls on an emergency basis.

734
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:55,590
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a two-family dwelling, first floor was vacant, and on the second floor,

735
01:01:56,397 --> 01:02:06,043
[SPEAKER_20]: A single mother with three children, they had no hot water, so he had to go out, place a hot water line, and hook that up to the second floor water line to give them the hot water.

736
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:12,927
[SPEAKER_20]: The next night, because of, this all occurred because of a sewage backup that went in the house, caused several other problems.

737
01:02:12,947 --> 01:02:14,668
[SPEAKER_20]: And the next night, he had a no heat call.

738
01:02:15,088 --> 01:02:21,332
[SPEAKER_20]: He had to go out and repair the boiler, fire up the boiler, restart it, so this woman and her young children could have heat.

739
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:30,434
[SPEAKER_20]: And the total amount on these bills that we're requesting payment for is $545 for the plumbing work he did at this site.

740
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:31,214
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

741
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:32,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

742
01:02:32,774 --> 01:02:35,655
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, through the chair, thank you, President Caraviello.

743
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:37,355
[SPEAKER_07]: You said the bills were from 2015.

744
01:02:37,475 --> 01:02:40,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a reason why it's taken so long?

745
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:44,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, there was a reason why it took so long.

746
01:02:44,657 --> 01:02:48,438
[SPEAKER_20]: There was an absentee landlord who subsequently moved to Hawaii.

747
01:02:49,245 --> 01:03:14,604
[SPEAKER_20]: And during that time, we were in the process of contacting a management company, which took quite a while, and what ended up happening, we had to put a lien on the house, and it took several, after the lien was put on, the vendor took several months to give us his invoice, and then once we got the invoice, we had to wait another several months for the attorney that closed on the property to give us a check for the lien that we had placed on the property.

748
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:16,765
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

749
01:03:16,786 --> 01:03:17,046
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President?

750
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:24,634
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Mulkey, you said that there's Thompson Plumbing Company and they went out to this site twice?

751
01:03:25,294 --> 01:03:25,995
[SPEAKER_30]: Two separate occasions.

752
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,776
[SPEAKER_30]: Two separate occasions and the total bill was only $545?

753
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:29,496
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

754
01:03:29,596 --> 01:03:30,276
[SPEAKER_30]: That's quite a deal.

755
01:03:31,497 --> 01:03:33,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Relatively speaking, it's a very good price, yes.

756
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,078
[SPEAKER_30]: Move approval, Mr. President.

757
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:41,560
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor McLachlan.

758
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

759
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:49,747
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor De La Rosa?

760
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:50,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

761
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:51,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco?

762
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:51,848
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

763
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:53,328
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight?

764
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:53,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

765
01:03:54,488 --> 01:03:55,248
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehnan?

766
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:55,608
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

767
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:56,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Martz?

768
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:57,249
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

769
01:03:57,269 --> 01:03:58,469
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli?

770
01:03:58,629 --> 01:03:58,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

771
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:00,189
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Caraviello?

772
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:00,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

773
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

774
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:07,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

775
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:07,291
[SPEAKER_30]: 17-652.

776
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,231
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, City Council.

777
01:04:09,251 --> 01:04:14,032
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration give a brief synopsis on the paper.

778
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:16,913
[SPEAKER_30]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, do we have a representative from

779
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,826
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't say how to seal this.

780
01:04:19,846 --> 01:04:22,128
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't say we shouldn't.

781
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:22,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

782
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:22,889
[SPEAKER_19]: The record, please.

783
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia Hunt 41 Watson Street, Medford.

784
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:28,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so basically this is, sorry,

785
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:41,816
[SPEAKER_39]: I expected to have it all read, so I am going to summarize it for you.

786
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:44,338
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a request for $348,336 from Free Cash.

787
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:46,980
[SPEAKER_39]: The information you typically request is there in the paper.

788
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,443
[SPEAKER_39]: The first $256,000 is to upgrade the lights at the Andrews School to controllable LED lights.

789
01:05:02,313 --> 01:05:06,195
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a natural next step after the other work that we've done in the schools.

790
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,497
[SPEAKER_39]: You might be aware that last winter we did the Curtis Tosta LED lights interior.

791
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:14,720
[SPEAKER_39]: We did some of the hallways and some other LED light projects at the schools.

792
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,641
[SPEAKER_39]: This is the direction that the industry is moving.

793
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:21,643
[SPEAKER_39]: Our DPW was built with all LED lights as well.

794
01:05:23,304 --> 01:05:28,227
[SPEAKER_39]: This particular project is being, I'm asking for this money to do this project at this time.

795
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:37,409
[SPEAKER_39]: because this will serve as the city's match to a grant the state and B2Q Consulting received from the state.

796
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,091
[SPEAKER_39]: So the lighting project on its own makes sense.

797
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,712
[SPEAKER_39]: It'll save the city about $22,000 a year.

798
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:51,115
[SPEAKER_39]: But if we do it at this time, we can use it as our share on this grant project.

799
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:57,637
[SPEAKER_39]: The grant is to do electricity peak demand reduction, and it's a pilot for the state.

800
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:02,949
[SPEAKER_39]: So basically the state gave B2Q and the city money to work on this.

801
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,030
[SPEAKER_39]: The grant itself is $478,000.

802
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:12,513
[SPEAKER_39]: And as well, National Grid is very interested in how this would work.

803
01:06:12,693 --> 01:06:19,916
[SPEAKER_39]: And they have committed $125,000 of technical assistance time on this specific project.

804
01:06:20,456 --> 01:06:24,378
[SPEAKER_39]: And the project would actually run in the Andrews School and the DPW.

805
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:43,610
[SPEAKER_39]: We'll get additionally, they'll be upgrading the controls in the schools and the DPW to be able to control the lights in both of those buildings through our computer system, as well as doing additional upgrades to the heating and cooling system and their controls, how we run it, energy efficiency.

806
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:48,133
[SPEAKER_39]: It is also likely that we would get revenue from the demand response program.

807
01:06:48,553 --> 01:06:51,195
[SPEAKER_39]: The amount of that revenue is very dependent on

808
01:06:51,795 --> 01:07:02,563
[SPEAKER_39]: The whole process, we're still doing the feasibility part of it that determines how much electricity we would actually produce through these programs during peak demand time.

809
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:04,364
[SPEAKER_39]: That's one piece of it.

810
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:06,286
[SPEAKER_39]: The other part of the money is $83,000.

811
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:22,049
[SPEAKER_39]: that would serve as a match for another grant that we received from the Department of Energy Resources that would add battery and the ability to run solar off-grid to the DPW and the Andrews School.

812
01:07:22,169 --> 01:07:26,713
[SPEAKER_39]: And as you know, we're in the process of putting solar on the DPW, so this adds battery to that.

813
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:29,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you repeat the figure you just said?

814
01:07:30,035 --> 01:07:31,936
[SPEAKER_39]: So, which, okay.

815
01:07:31,976 --> 01:07:34,278
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount awarded by the grant from the Department of Energy?

816
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,399
[SPEAKER_39]: So the first grant is,

817
01:07:38,363 --> 01:07:39,324
[SPEAKER_39]: $478,688.

818
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:39,324
[SPEAKER_39]: The second grant, I'm asking for $83,000.

819
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:48,478
[SPEAKER_39]: I can be more specific.

820
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,739
[SPEAKER_39]: $83,336 serves as a match.

821
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:51,199
[SPEAKER_39]: It is 10% of the grant amount.

822
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:52,639
[SPEAKER_39]: Hold on a second.

823
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:53,700
[SPEAKER_39]: Because we have it as $833,000.

824
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,540
[SPEAKER_39]: No, the grant is $833,000.

825
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,560
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, so the grant is an $833,000 and change grant.

826
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And so our match is 10% that we need to have in hand as we begin the project.

827
01:08:15,436 --> 01:08:18,918
[SPEAKER_39]: So battery is very, very expensive to pair with solar.

828
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,279
[SPEAKER_39]: And we believe it's a good idea.

829
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:25,821
[SPEAKER_39]: It'll allow us to run these buildings off grid when the electricity is down.

830
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:38,187
[SPEAKER_39]: And the grant will pay for this battery that would go with both the solar systems, the one we're in the process of, and the one that is planned that will be coming eventually our future.

831
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:44,690
[SPEAKER_39]: We have to redo the roof at the Andrews School before we come forward with a solid proposal on solar for that building.

832
01:08:45,212 --> 01:08:47,093
[SPEAKER_39]: So that's the whole package altogether.

833
01:08:47,793 --> 01:08:48,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

834
01:08:48,414 --> 01:08:48,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

835
01:08:49,314 --> 01:08:49,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco.

836
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:51,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:08:51,535 --> 01:08:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for this report, Ms.

838
01:08:54,237 --> 01:08:56,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt and Superintendent Bellison.

839
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program.

840
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this here type of project.

841
01:09:04,282 --> 01:09:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regards to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?

842
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:18,384
[SPEAKER_39]: Right, so the lighting project, it would be our intention to do it second shift.

843
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:21,527
[SPEAKER_39]: So they would be in there 3 p.m.

844
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:22,628
[SPEAKER_39]: to 11 p.m.

845
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:24,149
[SPEAKER_39]: in order to do that piece of it.

846
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,111
[SPEAKER_39]: Solar, if and when we are able.

847
01:09:28,151 --> 01:09:30,053
[SPEAKER_39]: So we'll need to do a new roof and solar.

848
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:33,755
[SPEAKER_39]: My hope is that we could get something lined up for next summer.

849
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,921
[SPEAKER_39]: But that is still the chunk to come.

850
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:45,983
[SPEAKER_39]: The battery piece of it would actually be completely out of the way in the back area, not where students are.

851
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:51,885
[SPEAKER_39]: There's a separate entrance into the electrical rooms where we have generators and HVAC equipment.

852
01:09:52,385 --> 01:10:00,747
[SPEAKER_39]: So the contractors, when they do do work, could work in that area without ever having to go into the main portion of the building.

853
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:03,768
[SPEAKER_39]: Or they could go in through the main portion, check in with the

854
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:14,090
[SPEAKER_39]: with the security, but then they would just traverse through the building and be in that back area and never have to actually be in student areas.

855
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:18,891
[SPEAKER_39]: I also know the superintendent is here to speak to some of this as well.

856
01:10:19,472 --> 01:10:22,152
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, what would be the duration of the project?

857
01:10:22,192 --> 01:10:25,033
[SPEAKER_04]: How long would it take to replace all the lights?

858
01:10:25,912 --> 01:10:26,792
[SPEAKER_39]: A couple of weeks.

859
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:30,634
[SPEAKER_39]: So I will tell you that this is a large project, so it would have to be bid out.

860
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:35,737
[SPEAKER_39]: And part of the bidding out process is to ask the contractors, how long will it take?

861
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:40,079
[SPEAKER_39]: Because some contractors will put one crew on and do it over many weeks.

862
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:44,822
[SPEAKER_39]: Other contractors will say, I have 10 crews, and I'll get it done in three days.

863
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:51,025
[SPEAKER_39]: So because it's going to be a project that would be bid out, I cannot tell you now.

864
01:10:51,825 --> 01:10:55,407
[SPEAKER_39]: And I can't bid it out until we're at that stage of the project.

865
01:10:55,943 --> 01:10:57,983
[SPEAKER_39]: is when we would have to schedule.

866
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:05,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Superintendent, so it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there.

867
01:11:05,285 --> 01:11:07,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Will all the workers be quarried and whatnot?

868
01:11:08,786 --> 01:11:19,628
[SPEAKER_21]: If there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons.

869
01:11:20,228 --> 01:11:20,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

870
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:25,529
[SPEAKER_21]: So we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.

871
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:29,477
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that we're doing everything we can.

872
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a pretty big project.

873
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be a lot of people in the building, so we just want to make sure we're protecting our students.

874
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:36,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

875
01:11:42,568 --> 01:11:43,529
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

876
01:11:44,850 --> 01:12:01,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Alicia, regarding the paired battery storage, will we be able to accept additional electricity from the current windmill and also provide that to the battery storage?

877
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:11,270
[SPEAKER_39]: The wind turbine is actually connected to the McGlynn School, not the Andrews School, so it would not be connected to this battery.

878
01:12:12,387 --> 01:12:12,527
[SPEAKER_39]: Right.

879
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:14,868
[SPEAKER_39]: But we couldn't connect one to the other.

880
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:16,768
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, the schools are on the same property, right?

881
01:12:29,295 --> 01:12:38,457
[SPEAKER_39]: The wind turbine doesn't make as much electricity compared to what a solar installation does to make it worth the amount of electrical work you would have to do to do that.

882
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:45,319
[SPEAKER_39]: There would also be a lot of changes to the control system in order to take in that separate, very different input.

883
01:12:48,512 --> 01:12:56,796
[SPEAKER_39]: And I hope that at some point in the future, we'd be able to do a similar project at the McGlynn School, and at which point we would have the wind turbine.

884
01:12:56,836 --> 01:13:02,038
[SPEAKER_39]: We would also have the benefit of having done this project at the Andrew School first.

885
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:03,538
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

886
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,060
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

887
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,481
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

888
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:10,561
[SPEAKER_30]: Ms.

889
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:12,182
[SPEAKER_30]: Hunt, thank you very much for your work.

890
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:15,884
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm looking at this paper and reading what it says.

891
01:13:17,187 --> 01:13:19,469
[SPEAKER_30]: grant for this, grant for that, grant for this.

892
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:21,410
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know that those grants didn't write themselves.

893
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:25,933
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that they deserve a lot of credit for going out there and finding the money.

894
01:13:25,953 --> 01:13:27,274
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you very much for your effort.

895
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:34,418
[SPEAKER_30]: And looking at this paper, I mean, we have $265,000 to upgrade the LED lights at the Andrews.

896
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:39,282
[SPEAKER_30]: My math, as spooky as it is, would come back and show that we have about

897
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,363
[SPEAKER_30]: 12-year return on our investment.

898
01:13:42,164 --> 01:13:50,130
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to save about $22,000 a year if we convert to the LED lighting, and we'll be able to capture this investment within a period of about 12 years.

899
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:53,413
[SPEAKER_30]: I also understand that this $83,000 is a 10% match on the battery, correct?

900
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:53,633
[SPEAKER_30]: Right.

901
01:13:53,693 --> 01:13:56,055
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you add the $265,000 and the $83,000, we come up with a figure of $348,000.

902
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,795
[SPEAKER_30]: So this appropriation is for $348,000, but we're also looking at $100,000 grant?

903
01:14:06,855 --> 01:14:07,136
[SPEAKER_30]: A $478,000 grant?

904
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:07,236
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

905
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:07,456
[SPEAKER_30]: A $125,000 grant?

906
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:07,736
[SPEAKER_30]: So the $100,000 is

907
01:14:21,275 --> 01:14:23,516
[SPEAKER_39]: There are two different numbers for National Grid.

908
01:14:23,696 --> 01:14:27,417
[SPEAKER_39]: One is an incentive for the lighting.

909
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:30,458
[SPEAKER_39]: So the lighting project is actually more expensive than this.

910
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:33,639
[SPEAKER_39]: So that comes in to offset the cost of the lighting.

911
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:48,323
[SPEAKER_39]: And the other is that National Grid will put technical assistance in to this project, which honestly, I feel is very notable that they've actually said that this project is interesting enough to them that they want to put that much of their own

912
01:14:49,577 --> 01:14:52,039
[SPEAKER_39]: into the project to make this work.

913
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,924
[SPEAKER_39]: But it's the equivalent of $125,000 in national grid time.

914
01:14:58,204 --> 01:14:58,445
[SPEAKER_30]: OK.

915
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:08,373
[SPEAKER_30]: So in looking at all the grant money or the matching funds that have been awarded to the city, how much money are we talking here?

916
01:15:10,735 --> 01:15:12,316
[SPEAKER_39]: I have not done that math.

917
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:15,459
[SPEAKER_39]: But we're looking at like 833 and 478, so that's

918
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:26,725
[SPEAKER_39]: close to one plus the $100,000, on the order of $1.3 million of money that'll be coming into city buildings.

919
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:33,589
[SPEAKER_30]: So this evening you're asking for us to make an investment of $348,000 so that we can get a return on that investment of over a million dollars?

920
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:34,049
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

921
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,930
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm comfortable voting for this this evening.

922
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:38,352
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much for your work, Mr. President, and for approval.

923
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:40,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

924
01:15:41,013 --> 01:15:42,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

925
01:15:42,694 --> 01:15:43,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

926
01:15:44,035 --> 01:15:46,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Hentwell, we have you before us, and we're talking about the Andrews School.

927
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:55,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us an update on the test borings that were done very close to there and whether or not they were done behind the Andrews School, any results that may be coming back?

928
01:15:56,264 --> 01:16:04,906
[SPEAKER_39]: Right, so I do believe that there is a response in your packets that is from the motion prior about that.

929
01:16:04,966 --> 01:16:07,047
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm happy to speak to it for a minute or two.

930
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:07,907
[SPEAKER_39]: That would be great.

931
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,952
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't have the response that went to you in front of me.

932
01:16:13,733 --> 01:16:15,053
[SPEAKER_39]: But we did the test scoring.

933
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:22,638
[SPEAKER_39]: We found that there were two locations that had very high levels deep down.

934
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:27,260
[SPEAKER_39]: One was, oh my gosh, my brain is going to stop on that, lead.

935
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,703
[SPEAKER_39]: And the other was very unusually, threw me for a loop, I believe it was zinc.

936
01:16:31,723 --> 01:16:33,284
[SPEAKER_39]: Is that right that's in there?

937
01:16:34,244 --> 01:16:36,946
[SPEAKER_39]: And I didn't even know prior that could be contaminating.

938
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:52,727
[SPEAKER_39]: And so those two locations, we need to do, so we did testing in the grid, and two spots showed up with high levels, and now we need to, oh, thank you, I really appreciate that.

939
01:16:55,703 --> 01:16:57,304
[SPEAKER_39]: I did not refresh myself on it.

940
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:00,527
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, zinc.

941
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,809
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, it's such an odd thing.

942
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:11,595
[SPEAKER_39]: I was not aware that zinc at a high level could be a soil contaminant until we got involved in this project, so I always question myself when I say that.

943
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:24,908
[SPEAKER_39]: So those two spots are very high and actually either have to be removed or we have to do extensive room reporting and testing to the state that would be extremely costly to removing those areas.

944
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:39,095
[SPEAKER_39]: So we need to do testing around those locations to find out exactly so we know where there is a problem and we know these areas where there isn't and we want to test in closer to see how small of an area can we deal with.

945
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,976
[SPEAKER_39]: So it might be that we put

946
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:50,406
[SPEAKER_39]: you know, a bench and a paved area and a bench over the zinc location, or it may be that we dig a hole and dig it out.

947
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:55,911
[SPEAKER_39]: And we need to, in order to do one of those things, do a little bit more testing to understand those locations.

948
01:17:57,032 --> 01:17:59,954
[SPEAKER_39]: We haven't yet tested on the other side of the sidewalk.

949
01:18:01,395 --> 01:18:08,682
[SPEAKER_39]: The lead level is actually very close to the sidewalk, and so as part of narrowing that, we are gonna need to go on the other side of the sidewalk

950
01:18:09,202 --> 01:18:10,442
[SPEAKER_39]: and do that testing.

951
01:18:11,163 --> 01:18:17,404
[SPEAKER_39]: But we'd sort of been waiting to get it all done at the same time and not do that separately.

952
01:18:18,244 --> 01:18:26,566
[SPEAKER_39]: There were two areas that had petroleum and PCBs, which we also have to do some further examination to understand.

953
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:36,789
[SPEAKER_39]: The other thing that was notable that I mentioned in here, one of the other properties, they have had a problem with their groundwater that they are very aware of.

954
01:18:37,335 --> 01:18:48,629
[SPEAKER_39]: And one of the questions that had come up to me, and what prompted this testing partially in part was, was this problem in the groundwater under our property?

955
01:18:48,649 --> 01:18:51,752
[SPEAKER_39]: And we did not find any of that under our property.

956
01:18:53,505 --> 01:18:59,608
[SPEAKER_39]: So additionally, some of the area within the fence belongs to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR.

957
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:02,409
[SPEAKER_39]: That area has been delineated.

958
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:06,892
[SPEAKER_39]: We have not been doing testing on that area, but we are in close contact with them.

959
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:09,113
[SPEAKER_39]: I, in fact, discussed that.

960
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:26,004
[SPEAKER_39]: with them today, and they're very interested in working with us to be able to do a solution that provides safety and protection to everybody, but is as minimal expense and actually impact to the area as possible.

961
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:36,651
[SPEAKER_39]: And with their extensive experience in these sorts of problems, I think we're going to be able to do things a little bit better because they're going to be a partner with us on this.

962
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for the update.

963
01:19:39,512 --> 01:19:40,712
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have it in our packet.

964
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,917
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a number of parents that have been asking me questions, you know, so I wanted you to state it publicly.

965
01:19:46,357 --> 01:19:52,822
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so I have it clearly, after reading it and after your explanation, test pourings were done at the clippership part section.

966
01:19:52,842 --> 01:19:54,844
[SPEAKER_07]: The lead and the zinc were found.

967
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:04,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But there will be, as requested by the council, there will be some pourings on the other side of the walkway, which is behind Andrews, where the children play soccer and whatnot.

968
01:20:04,892 --> 01:20:05,152
[SPEAKER_39]: Right.

969
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:09,397
[SPEAKER_39]: So I do not anticipate that we would go up onto the soccer field.

970
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,021
[SPEAKER_39]: We were able to find the records.

971
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:13,843
[SPEAKER_39]: So when those schools were built,

972
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:22,752
[SPEAKER_39]: They found arsenic in that area, and the area was low enough that they were legally allowed to close the site without doing anything.

973
01:20:23,273 --> 01:20:27,079
[SPEAKER_39]: But they came in and put clean fill over that whole area.

974
01:20:28,362 --> 01:20:40,085
[SPEAKER_39]: But it was after the fact that the area was closed with the state as being acceptable as is, but then the city came in and put the clean fill on anyhow.

975
01:20:40,605 --> 01:20:52,208
[SPEAKER_39]: So the records on that and exactly the locations are a little different, but it's pretty clear to the eye that where the soccer field raises up is part of that area with the clean fill on top.

976
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,108
[SPEAKER_39]: and which makes us very comfortable about that area.

977
01:20:55,428 --> 01:21:03,753
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's just the part that slopes down to the pathway where you might say, well, that doesn't look like there's clean fill on there.

978
01:21:04,213 --> 01:21:06,975
[SPEAKER_39]: And so that's where some of these borings are going to be.

979
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:13,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And then can you just, lastly, just give us a time frame so we know when to request an update?

980
01:21:13,878 --> 01:21:14,119
[SPEAKER_39]: Right.

981
01:21:15,535 --> 01:21:19,376
[SPEAKER_39]: So I'm hoping to do that over the next four to six weeks.

982
01:21:19,856 --> 01:21:25,678
[SPEAKER_39]: Some of it is scheduling with the equipment that is necessary to do that.

983
01:21:26,338 --> 01:21:28,559
[SPEAKER_39]: And finalizing it all.

984
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:29,259
[SPEAKER_39]: We've been waiting.

985
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,920
[SPEAKER_39]: Honestly, our point of contact at the state

986
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:44,038
[SPEAKER_39]: The Environmental Protection Office has been out for three weeks on leave, and we really wanted him to see our most recent report and discuss it with him, and he returned from leave yesterday.

987
01:21:44,058 --> 01:21:52,909
[SPEAKER_39]: So before I schedule the borings, I do want to review with him the results of our first round of borings.

988
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:03,292
[SPEAKER_27]: Move approval.

989
01:22:04,573 --> 01:22:05,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for following up on that.

990
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,115
[SPEAKER_16]: It's you.

991
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:10,376
[SPEAKER_33]: Wow.

992
01:22:11,316 --> 01:22:11,816
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Zink.

993
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:12,817
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Zink.

994
01:22:12,937 --> 01:22:18,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scudero.

995
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

996
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,641
[SPEAKER_16]: My colleague asked the questions.

997
01:22:21,661 --> 01:22:22,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

998
01:22:22,382 --> 01:22:24,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Move approval, Mr. President.

999
01:22:24,923 --> 01:22:26,503
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor- Mr. President.

1000
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:26,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1001
01:22:27,684 --> 01:22:28,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Naik.

1002
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:29,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President.

1003
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:30,571
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Mox.

1004
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:38,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Just if we could, if we can also, while we have Alicia here, if you can give us just a brief update on where we stand with the lighting in the square.

1005
01:22:39,478 --> 01:22:58,994
[SPEAKER_39]: So the lighting of the square has been folded in with our larger city lighting project, and I actually spoke with our consultants at Lane Thomp, oh my gosh, on Monday, yesterday, about the history of those lights, what are in those various fixtures, what we're looking for,

1006
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:11,293
[SPEAKER_39]: Based on what I've said and the observations, and I'd love feedback, but my impression is that most people are happy with the light levels at the Peace Garden.

1007
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:14,435
[SPEAKER_39]: Those are the same fixtures, but much brighter.

1008
01:23:15,175 --> 01:23:26,781
[SPEAKER_39]: And so I believe that we'll be able, through this project, to install equivalent light bulbs, basically, from what's in the Peace Garden into the square.

1009
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:36,281
[SPEAKER_39]: For technical reasons, under an energy efficiency project, I could never put those in because it would be increasing the electricity that's used.

1010
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:42,893
[SPEAKER_39]: And that would fall outside of any kind of grant money I could do, or I would have to put that out to bid.

1011
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:48,015
[SPEAKER_39]: Under our larger lighting project, it's probably the right thing to do.

1012
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:52,657
[SPEAKER_39]: And that will increase the electricity usage on those lights.

1013
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:57,559
[SPEAKER_39]: But at this point, I think most people would agree that's the right thing to do.

1014
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:03,141
[SPEAKER_39]: And we'll be decreasing the light, the electricity usage throughout the rest of the city.

1015
01:24:03,948 --> 01:24:15,194
[SPEAKER_39]: So that is our tentative plan, and I've asked them to get me that information concretely as quickly as possible to move that forward faster than the main project.

1016
01:24:15,494 --> 01:24:26,600
[SPEAKER_39]: But I'm not sure what the timing on that would be and whether there's an appetite for coming forward with a request for just that chunk of money separate from the main lighting project.

1017
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Originally, it started off as a standalone project.

1018
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:30,822
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, it did.

1019
01:24:30,842 --> 01:24:39,605
[SPEAKER_39]: And we were trying to make it an energy efficiency project that we could procure through energy, through the Green Communities Act at the state level.

1020
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:44,968
[SPEAKER_39]: And you can't do it in an energy efficient manner and fix the light levels there.

1021
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:45,608
[SPEAKER_39]: So.

1022
01:24:46,288 --> 01:24:46,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Move the question.

1023
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:47,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1024
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:49,109
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion.

1025
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1026
01:24:52,971 --> 01:24:54,132

01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:01,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1048
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:02,079
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1049
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:02,279

01:25:02,419 --> 01:25:02,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:02,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1052
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:03,239

01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:05,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1062
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:05,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1063
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:05,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1064
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1065
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:06,841
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1066
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:07,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1067
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:27,079
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to wait.

1068
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:31,403
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll be two minutes, because the other topic is going to take a long time.

1069
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:37,628
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, session of the rules.

1070
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:39,370
[SPEAKER_24]: We're already under suspension, right?

1071
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:39,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, no.

1072
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,552
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1073
01:25:43,453 --> 01:25:44,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

1074
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:47,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1075
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:49,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1076
01:25:49,418 --> 01:25:49,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1077
01:25:52,352 --> 01:25:57,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I'm here again to address this council on the matter of the upkeep of Evans Street.

1078
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:12,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoken to you for years about it at the council chambers, at the last meeting across the courtyard, and here I am in the little theater addressing you again tonight, and I really hope to God this is the last time.

1079
01:26:14,574 --> 01:26:15,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The last meeting,

1080
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:22,412
[SPEAKER_09]: This council informed me, which I then informed my neighbors on Evans Street, that Evans Street wasn't on the list.

1081
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:27,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we came to find out that that was a miscommunication, that Evans Street was on the list.

1082
01:26:28,335 --> 01:26:37,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And DPW workers came to Evans Street and they mapped out with colored spray paint the water pipes on Evans Street that are going to be replaced.

1083
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:48,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were told, a friend of mine, one of my neighbors, Shawna Smith, has a friend in DPW who told her that work would begin on September 11th.

1084
01:26:48,664 --> 01:26:51,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's September 19th, the work hasn't begun.

1085
01:26:52,125 --> 01:27:02,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So my friend Shauna went on C-Click Fix Sunday night to report to the city that Evans Street is one big pothole.

1086
01:27:02,768 --> 01:27:13,892
[SPEAKER_09]: We come to find out there that the work wasn't started on September 11th, as promised, because the work order was assigned to the science department.

1087
01:27:16,216 --> 01:27:21,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrible incompetence on the behalf of this mayoral administration, or it's on purpose.

1088
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,462
[SPEAKER_09]: We are at our wit's end on Evans Street.

1089
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:33,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the proper format, I think, for the current mayoral administration, because it's all an act.

1090
01:27:33,607 --> 01:27:34,908
[SPEAKER_09]: We're frustrated.

1091
01:27:35,328 --> 01:27:36,209
[SPEAKER_09]: on Edmonds Street.

1092
01:27:36,429 --> 01:27:37,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1093
01:27:37,751 --> 01:27:38,131
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1094
01:27:38,191 --> 01:27:39,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of order, Mr. President.

1095
01:27:39,632 --> 01:27:40,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of order, Councilor Dello Russo.

1096
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:46,539
[SPEAKER_27]: I wish that caution would be given as to making disparaging remarks.

1097
01:27:46,939 --> 01:27:48,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

1098
01:27:49,082 --> 01:27:50,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I can address that.

1099
01:27:51,803 --> 01:28:07,226
[SPEAKER_09]: It's disparaging for 30 houses on Evans Street to be paying taxes for the last 67 years in the tune of millions of dollars and not have proper basic services done for the residents of Evans Street.

1100
01:28:07,346 --> 01:28:08,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's disparaging.

1101
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:09,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1102
01:28:09,726 --> 01:28:10,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1103
01:28:11,087 --> 01:28:12,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We could just get an update through the chair on

1104
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:17,402
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the latest status of every street?

1105
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:19,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Several weeks since we.

1106
01:28:20,064 --> 01:28:24,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Resolution by Councilman Locario that we get an update on the status of every street.

1107
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:28,410
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

1108
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:28,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1109
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1110
01:28:32,012 --> 01:28:34,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilman Locario to take paper 7.

1111
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,876
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-590.

1112
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,737
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-590 off the table.

1113
01:28:51,637 --> 01:28:53,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to take that off the table?

1114
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:53,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1115
01:28:54,419 --> 01:28:56,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1116
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:56,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1117
01:28:56,641 --> 01:28:59,262
[SPEAKER_19]: All in favor?

1118
01:28:59,362 --> 01:28:59,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1119
01:28:59,542 --> 01:28:59,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1120
01:28:59,843 --> 01:29:03,885
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-590 special permit hours for the Meadow Glen Mall Awakements.

1121
01:29:04,465 --> 01:29:08,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a representative from Awakements here this evening to make a presentation?

1122
01:29:24,357 --> 01:29:24,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

1123
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:26,038
[SPEAKER_36]: Name and address of the record, please.

1124
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:28,319
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening, Mr. Council President.

1125
01:29:28,339 --> 01:29:30,239
[SPEAKER_36]: Brian Dugdale from Goulston and Storrs.

1126
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,081
[SPEAKER_36]: Here on behalf of Medford Associates LLC, an affiliate of New England Development, the owner of the Medford.

1127
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:37,902
[SPEAKER_36]: And do we have a representative from Wakeman's here also?

1128
01:29:38,622 --> 01:29:39,403
[SPEAKER_36]: We do.

1129
01:29:39,423 --> 01:29:40,683
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. Art Drez.

1130
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:45,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

1131
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:47,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Art Pierce, Wakeman's Food Markets.

1132
01:29:48,506 --> 01:29:50,427
[SPEAKER_19]: And do you have a presentation you'd like to make this evening?

1133
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:53,154
[SPEAKER_15]: We do, yes.

1134
01:29:53,294 --> 01:29:54,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll start off with Mr. Dugdown.

1135
01:29:55,095 --> 01:29:55,375
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1136
01:29:55,735 --> 01:29:56,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1137
01:29:58,996 --> 01:29:59,416
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening.

1138
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,497
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Mr. Council President and councillors.

1139
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:07,118
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Brian Dugdale, again from Wilson and Storrs, on behalf of the owner of the Meadow Glen Mall.

1140
01:30:07,978 --> 01:30:13,020
[SPEAKER_36]: We're here in connection with a request for extended hours at the mall, which is located in the city's industrial zoning district.

1141
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:23,366
[SPEAKER_36]: We have a detailed application on the record that goes through in detail each of the criteria for a special permit and how this request meets that criteria.

1142
01:30:23,386 --> 01:30:34,110
[SPEAKER_36]: So what I'd like to do is just give a very quick introduction before Art from Wegmans comes back up to give his explanation about Wegmans, its request, and to answer any questions the council might have.

1143
01:30:35,053 --> 01:30:44,039
[SPEAKER_36]: So this request, which is to extend by just one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, was submitted in connection with substantial rehabilitation of the Meadow Glen Mall.

1144
01:30:45,000 --> 01:31:00,691
[SPEAKER_36]: New England Development is extremely excited that this fall we'll be bringing forward not only Wegmans, but also Petco, Dick's Sporting Goods, to support the existing coals and marshals that are located at the Meadow Glen Mall today.

1145
01:31:02,886 --> 01:31:04,308
[SPEAKER_36]: New England Development is very excited.

1146
01:31:04,328 --> 01:31:09,355
[SPEAKER_36]: The whole purpose of that redevelopment project was to bring forward tenants of the highest quality.

1147
01:31:09,415 --> 01:31:15,423
[SPEAKER_36]: And Wegmans, if anybody's been to a Wegmans, you know that that supermarket is really top of the industry.

1148
01:31:16,424 --> 01:31:28,429
[SPEAKER_36]: So we came before the city council on August 15th, at which time we were instructed to engage in further discussions with our immediately abutting neighbors to the east at the Mystic River Park condominiums.

1149
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:35,912
[SPEAKER_36]: We immediately engaged with the condo and had what we believe turned out to be productive conversations.

1150
01:31:37,031 --> 01:31:58,908
[SPEAKER_36]: NED, together with Wegmans, as part of those discussions committed to do, we heard their concerns about overnight loading, in particular, at evening hours, so New England Development and Wegmans committed to no overnight loading, sealed loading docks, a landscape buffer, fencing, and other funds for the condo to put even more landscape buffering on their side of the property.

1151
01:32:00,243 --> 01:32:09,571
[SPEAKER_36]: In addition, there will be protocols for security and a designated representative at the shopping center to handle any concerns from any of the residents of the condo or otherwise.

1152
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:19,218
[SPEAKER_36]: So we're confident that the community overall, as well as our neighbors, are going to be happy with the changes that have come to fruition here at the Meadowland Mall.

1153
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:20,940
[SPEAKER_36]: And we're very excited to have Whiteman.

1154
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,702
[SPEAKER_36]: So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Perez.

1155
01:32:24,182 --> 01:32:24,463
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1156
01:32:29,521 --> 01:32:30,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Brian.

1157
01:32:30,442 --> 01:32:41,555
[SPEAKER_15]: As Mr. Dugdale just presented, we're here for the application once again for extension of the hours of operation specifically, and a special use permit modification on that.

1158
01:32:42,215 --> 01:32:45,639
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, currently it's allowed, as the council knows, 7 a.m.

1159
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:46,180
[SPEAKER_15]: to 11 p.m.

1160
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:59,649
[SPEAKER_15]: With consideration of the weather in the Northeast, of the states here obviously, as well as the traffic in the area, we're seeking an extension on either end by simply one hour.

1161
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:01,930
[SPEAKER_15]: That being allowing 6 a.m.

1162
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,792
[SPEAKER_15]: till midnight hours of operation.

1163
01:33:05,272 --> 01:33:09,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Hours of operation meaning allowing the store to be open for the public.

1164
01:33:10,455 --> 01:33:25,002
[SPEAKER_15]: With that, understanding and speaking to the residents, more specifically the residents of Mystic Condos right behind us, as noted by the council on the 8th, 15th, the question I think was raised, have we reached out?

1165
01:33:25,383 --> 01:33:29,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, we had reached out and had communications prior to that to a representative of the condo.

1166
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:54,478
[SPEAKER_15]: As of today, we've had conversations with representatives of the condo, recognizing their adjacent neighbors, being a good neighbor, and in the culture of a community partner, both on the business level, where we've reached out, even as of recent of August 15th, we've invited and had a special meeting with local leaders of the community, the school superintendent, United Way Food Bank,

1167
01:33:55,178 --> 01:33:59,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Food Bank, et cetera, recognizing that we are part of the community.

1168
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:10,322
[SPEAKER_15]: We are in this fine community and are very respectful for that and are involved across the board.

1169
01:34:10,722 --> 01:34:16,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we are engaged with the community through the community leaders, we are also respective of our neighbors.

1170
01:34:16,743 --> 01:34:22,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, the reach out, once again, prior to the August 15th and up as of late yesterday.

1171
01:34:23,685 --> 01:34:34,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Mr. Dugdale noted, we will self-restrict overnight deliveries, mimicking the hours of operations for the board to grant the application request.

1172
01:34:34,551 --> 01:34:37,853
[SPEAKER_15]: With that, I'd be glad to address any questions from the council.

1173
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:39,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilwoman O'Connor.

1174
01:34:40,155 --> 01:34:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1175
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:52,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello, if you or Brian could go over the no overnight loading deliveries, scale loading, landscaping, if you could just go into more detail.

1176
01:34:53,262 --> 01:35:07,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the only complaints or questions that I've received from the residents that live behind there are worries about overnight deliveries, the noise, obviously, how the property looks.

1177
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:09,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, I really haven't.

1178
01:35:09,718 --> 01:35:11,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to just make sure those are addressed.

1179
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,221
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could just give hours.

1180
01:35:14,162 --> 01:35:16,464
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's very simplistic here again.

1181
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:21,027
[SPEAKER_15]: The application, and that's the beauty of it, we're currently 7 to 11.

1182
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:39,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Store operations allowing our customers to come into the store with consideration of many families have two of the adults working in the family, school activities, and just a desire to get into the store and do their shopping on the way to work or after work.

1183
01:35:40,255 --> 01:35:41,776
[SPEAKER_15]: It allows them that flexibility.

1184
01:35:42,356 --> 01:35:45,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So here again, the key point is hours of operations of the store.

1185
01:35:46,578 --> 01:35:56,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Tied in with that, we will self-restrict out of consideration to the neighbors and not have tractor-trailer deliveries at the rear of the store from midnight till 6 a.m.

1186
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:56,560
[SPEAKER_15]: in the morning.

1187
01:35:58,301 --> 01:36:13,964
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the property here again, New England Development has committed to, as evidenced by Mr. Dugdale's statements there, that they are committed to a number of additional landscaping treatments at the rear of the store, the property line, the fencing,

1188
01:36:14,664 --> 01:36:19,128
[SPEAKER_15]: including access across the driveway to the condo development.

1189
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:23,051
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the site overall itself, I think that speaks for itself.

1190
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:30,056
[SPEAKER_15]: As Mr. Dugdale had made presentation, it's a very beautiful upgrade from what the development had been.

1191
01:36:31,537 --> 01:36:33,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that addresses your question.

1192
01:36:34,299 --> 01:36:34,980
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Box.

1193
01:36:36,535 --> 01:36:37,496
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1194
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:44,199
[SPEAKER_24]: And by no way am I speaking on behalf of the residents of Mr. Condos.

1195
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:53,323
[SPEAKER_24]: However, the phone calls that I received from residents mainly were regarding the deliveries.

1196
01:36:54,483 --> 01:37:02,427
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's roughly 132 units that directly face the rear of your establishment.

1197
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:12,727
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would say within approximately 200 feet from the rear of where deliveries will take place, give or take.

1198
01:37:13,788 --> 01:37:28,151
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the concern that I've been hearing from residents is, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying no overnights, but when a truck rolls up at 11, 11.30, quarter or 12, to me, that's a late hour.

1199
01:37:28,951 --> 01:37:30,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Or when it rolls up at 6 a.m.

1200
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:31,292
[SPEAKER_24]: in the morning,

1201
01:37:33,415 --> 01:37:47,319
[SPEAKER_24]: That's an early hour, and I can appreciate the fact that you have sealed loading docks, and you're taking steps to minimize the noise impact of the Mystic condo residents.

1202
01:37:47,879 --> 01:37:57,402
[SPEAKER_24]: However, in my opinion, in order for this to be acceptable to Wegmans, who we welcome you to the community, I look forward to shopping in Wegmans.

1203
01:37:57,842 --> 01:37:59,343
[SPEAKER_24]: I currently have to go up to Burlington now.

1204
01:38:00,033 --> 01:38:01,654
[SPEAKER_24]: to shop at Wegmans.

1205
01:38:01,674 --> 01:38:02,815
[SPEAKER_24]: And we welcome you here.

1206
01:38:03,095 --> 01:38:09,159
[SPEAKER_24]: The residents that I've spoken with in the condos also are eager to shop in your facility.

1207
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,461
[SPEAKER_24]: But the concern is the deliveries.

1208
01:38:12,701 --> 01:38:28,352
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would ask that the deliveries be limited not to just your hours of operation, but to hours that are acceptable to, even though you're in a commercial zoned area, to residential abutters.

1209
01:38:29,392 --> 01:38:36,038
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would be my first point, if you're willing to make a concession on those particular hours.

1210
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:42,703
[SPEAKER_24]: And knowing that, you know, that's the heart of a business, deliveries, and I understand that.

1211
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:44,524
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be my first.

1212
01:38:44,984 --> 01:38:58,430
[SPEAKER_24]: The second point residents have noticed that I spoke with was having nothing to do with delivery trucks, but the exhaust unit on top of your building, which is the size of a small bus.

1213
01:38:59,673 --> 01:39:03,098
[SPEAKER_24]: And recently that exhaust unit has been functioning.

1214
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:10,789
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if they're testing it or what's going on, but it emits a rather loud and frequent noise.

1215
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:16,436
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was wondering if there's any consideration to put additional buffers

1216
01:39:17,277 --> 01:39:36,981
[SPEAKER_24]: I know with other business establishments, we just had something on Riverside Ave, Smashburger, and a few other establishments that had something similar, not to the size that you have for exhaust, and they were able to put noise buffers to mitigate some of the noise for area residents that were roughly in the same proximity.

1217
01:39:37,001 --> 01:39:39,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I was wondering if you could speak on that also.

1218
01:39:39,162 --> 01:39:45,323
[SPEAKER_24]: So it would be limiting the delivery hours, not to just your hours of operation, but to extend it further.

1219
01:39:45,883 --> 01:39:48,525
[SPEAKER_24]: and also the exhaust on top of the building.

1220
01:39:48,765 --> 01:39:48,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1221
01:39:49,305 --> 01:39:50,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me work backwards on that.

1222
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:54,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, as far as the rooftop units, we use state-of-the-art units.

1223
01:39:55,008 --> 01:40:12,558
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer to this council and certainly to the building department and any professionals they have on staff, we can certainly review with the town engineer or, again, through you, with you, the specific specifications of those units and if there's the possibility to look at possible mitigation measures on that.

1224
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:23,364
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the deliveries, we are not speaking a large number of tractor trailers from 11 to midnight, or between 11 and midnight, and 6 AM in the morning.

1225
01:40:23,604 --> 01:40:28,467
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking one, two at the extreme, and the standard time of year.

1226
01:40:28,707 --> 01:40:32,129
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's once seven days a week.

1227
01:40:32,789 --> 01:40:34,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're talking one tractor trailer

1228
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:38,952
[SPEAKER_15]: the anomaly of two at that one hour at the extreme and one hour in the morning.

1229
01:40:39,392 --> 01:40:49,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And here again, we're, we will be in compliance, we're committed to as we are in all communities being compliance with town codes, city codes or noise ordinances in this particular case.

1230
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:52,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have the city council has that

1231
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:59,994
[SPEAKER_15]: if you will, that safeguard to come to us and saying you're in violation.

1232
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:06,080
[SPEAKER_15]: But quite frankly, before that happens, we'll be the first to hear in our store operations, our store managers.

1233
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:10,303
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not the first store we're adjacent to a residential unit.

1234
01:41:10,904 --> 01:41:13,146
[SPEAKER_15]: We have at least a dozen of them in our chains.

1235
01:41:13,386 --> 01:41:16,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have worked through any issues, if there were issues to begin with.

1236
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:34,642
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's where we would offer, here again, self-restricted overnight deliveries, but keep up to midnight, with the understanding that it would be one, two, at the extreme as far as the anomaly, and that is in that particular hour, at the end and at the beginning.

1237
01:41:35,002 --> 01:41:36,523
[SPEAKER_15]: And here again, it comes to, if we

1238
01:41:37,944 --> 01:41:44,768
[SPEAKER_15]: It does come down to the basics of the weather and transportation and the overload of the highways.

1239
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:47,229
[SPEAKER_15]: These tractor trailers are coming from Rochester, New York.

1240
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_15]: It's six plus hours.

1241
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:59,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have the, as folks that are familiar or in the business themselves, I'm not telling them anything new, the logistics on getting stuff from a warehouse into a truck

1242
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:02,781
[SPEAKER_15]: 300 miles away.

1243
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,263
[SPEAKER_15]: There's six hours away.

1244
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:13,485
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very difficult, and it's a challenging month of flexibility.

1245
01:42:13,985 --> 01:42:22,230
[SPEAKER_15]: That will allow us as a free board, and where we can, we will try to keep it to 11 and not 5 to 12 or 11.45.

1246
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:35,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Our intent is not to push it to the limits, but give a little latitude to remain a flexible, productive, successful business for the benefit, obviously, our business and then the community.

1247
01:42:37,687 --> 01:42:46,096
[SPEAKER_24]: So from what I'm hearing from you, and I appreciate the flexibility, but not at the expense of the residents that live within 200 feet.

1248
01:42:46,997 --> 01:42:50,941
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate the fact that these trucks are going to be coming from Rochester, New York.

1249
01:42:51,442 --> 01:42:53,945
[SPEAKER_24]: The fact that there's New England weather involved.

1250
01:42:54,465 --> 01:43:12,940
[SPEAKER_24]: and so forth, and that makes me even feel more comfortable with my decision not to go right to midnight, because I think what we're going to end up seeing, and I've been doing this for a number of years, is that we're going to see the later deliveries, and we're going to see the 11, 30, 12 o'clock, a truck shows up at midnight,

1251
01:43:16,343 --> 01:43:23,146
[SPEAKER_24]: or 10 past midnight with $300,000 worth of filet mignon, I'm sure you're going to unload it.

1252
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:29,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I can commit to Mr. Councilman and to this council and to the community, we would self-restrict on that.

1253
01:43:29,449 --> 01:43:36,272
[SPEAKER_15]: We start hearing those concerns, our tractor-trailer drivers, if that starts happening, we will be the first to reign that in.

1254
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And adjusted accordingly.

1255
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:41,934
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's where we're asking for that flexibility under the recognition.

1256
01:43:42,474 --> 01:43:43,395
[SPEAKER_15]: We are a partner.

1257
01:43:43,895 --> 01:43:45,896
[SPEAKER_15]: We are a community neighbor.

1258
01:43:46,716 --> 01:43:47,617
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask for that.

1259
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:51,204
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will not be doing the 12 o'clock, 1145.

1260
01:43:51,584 --> 01:43:52,644
[SPEAKER_15]: It will not be creeping.

1261
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:54,445
[SPEAKER_15]: If that happens, we'll be the first to cut back on it.

1262
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:21,299
[SPEAKER_24]: And you realize this is a special permit, so even the fact that you understand code and noise ordinances, you're asking to work outside of the operating parameters of the current... No, actually, what I'm saying is an overlay on that.

1263
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:23,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm respectful of what we're saying is...

1264
01:44:23,881 --> 01:44:28,225
[SPEAKER_15]: that certainly understand that, yes, and I'm not trying to end around the special permit.

1265
01:44:28,626 --> 01:44:37,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm recognizing that we understand the rules and regulations just as throughout the construction that we have to abide by, you know, building codes, etc.

1266
01:44:38,195 --> 01:44:44,722
[SPEAKER_15]: The same thing once we're up and operating, we understand and respect, quite frankly, and understand and we will comply.

1267
01:44:45,342 --> 01:44:54,649
[SPEAKER_15]: if not self-restricted, if there's little missteps, we are the first to react to the positive in reaction to the community, more specifically the town and the council.

1268
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:56,511
[SPEAKER_15]: You have our commitment.

1269
01:44:57,892 --> 01:45:04,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, just if I could, and I know some residents are probably going to want to speak from the Mr. Condos.

1270
01:45:05,638 --> 01:45:10,982
[SPEAKER_24]: My support for any special permit tonight, and I just want the gentleman who I respect and

1271
01:45:11,937 --> 01:45:28,303
[SPEAKER_24]: thank the business for coming into our community, that my stance is going to remain the same, that the hours of operation for delivery should at the very least coincide with current ordinances and not the extended permit which you're requesting.

1272
01:45:29,064 --> 01:45:36,446
[SPEAKER_24]: And if that is something that you can work with and compromise, then as a member of the council, you'll have my vote tonight.

1273
01:45:36,847 --> 01:45:40,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Otherwise, I think, at least from my standpoint,

1274
01:45:40,977 --> 01:45:41,677
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't support it.

1275
01:45:42,818 --> 01:45:43,258
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1276
01:45:43,858 --> 01:45:46,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ferris, you have a store in Chestnut Hill.

1277
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:47,760
[SPEAKER_19]: We do.

1278
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:52,722
[SPEAKER_19]: That has apartments that are closer than what are here in Midwood.

1279
01:45:52,762 --> 01:45:56,703
[SPEAKER_19]: How have you dealt with that situation?

1280
01:45:56,803 --> 01:45:59,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Here again, we're committed as we are in this community to that community.

1281
01:45:59,865 --> 01:46:02,066
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's restricted from midnight to 6 AM.

1282
01:46:03,046 --> 01:46:05,127
[SPEAKER_19]: And you've had no problems in Chestnut Hill?

1283
01:46:06,047 --> 01:46:07,128
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my understanding, correct.

1284
01:46:10,525 --> 01:46:12,226
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

1285
01:46:12,727 --> 01:46:24,034
[SPEAKER_16]: I know in the past this council has looked at different concerns and issues like this and not holding Wegmans back, but could we do a 90-day

1286
01:46:26,367 --> 01:46:45,140
[SPEAKER_16]: trial period and move from there to see if that, in that 90 days, if those 200 abutters feel that we report back to those neighbors, and if it's something that it has been a distraction, that we re-evaluate.

1287
01:46:48,663 --> 01:46:49,123
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1288
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:50,924
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Layton.

1289
01:46:50,964 --> 01:46:52,265
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1290
01:46:53,705 --> 01:47:06,747
[SPEAKER_30]: This is a situation that is very similar to the situation we faced at the last meeting, where we had a business that was seeking a special permit that directly abutted a residential property that was multi-family use.

1291
01:47:08,128 --> 01:47:10,888
[SPEAKER_30]: Now, we have Wegmans, and Wegmans has been a great partner of the community.

1292
01:47:10,948 --> 01:47:12,108
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not going to say they haven't been.

1293
01:47:12,228 --> 01:47:20,370
[SPEAKER_30]: Wegmans has done a great job in redeveloping their parcel and giving it a new, fresh look from that old, tired, and drawn-out look that was the Meadowbrook Mall.

1294
01:47:21,371 --> 01:47:29,387
[SPEAKER_30]: But we also have an opportunity this evening to protect the quality of life of 132 residents whose homes face this building and face this street, Mr. President.

1295
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:34,772
[SPEAKER_30]: I, for one, am a little concerned about an application for a special permit.

1296
01:47:36,092 --> 01:47:41,774
[SPEAKER_30]: And Wegmans coming here and asking us to offer it when they really haven't been in operation for too long, as it is right now.

1297
01:47:42,514 --> 01:47:56,179
[SPEAKER_30]: And the residents, the 132 residents that units face this property, haven't really gotten the full picture of what it's going to be like when Wegmans is in operation, whether or not the hours of operation is 7 in the morning till 11 at night or 6 in the morning till midnight.

1298
01:47:57,699 --> 01:47:59,140
[SPEAKER_30]: One of the concerns that I might have is,

1299
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:02,226
[SPEAKER_30]: We say, OK, here's your special permit.

1300
01:48:02,466 --> 01:48:05,487
[SPEAKER_30]: You guys can go until 12 o'clock at night, and you can deliver until 12 o'clock at night.

1301
01:48:06,247 --> 01:48:08,928
[SPEAKER_30]: Something I'm not too crazy about at this point in time, Mr. President.

1302
01:48:09,988 --> 01:48:15,329
[SPEAKER_30]: And what happens is the residents come back and say Wegmans has been in operation now for 180 days.

1303
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:21,531
[SPEAKER_30]: And over the last 180 days, at 930 at night, 55 trucks pull up, and they make more noise than we could ever deal with.

1304
01:48:21,891 --> 01:48:27,553
[SPEAKER_30]: We have the opportunity, because this is a special permit, to put certain restrictions and certain parameters on the special permit.

1305
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:35,674
[SPEAKER_30]: Some of those restrictions that we could put in would be that signs are posted visibly at the access points that say no loading after certain hours or during certain hours.

1306
01:48:35,714 --> 01:48:39,916
[SPEAKER_30]: And those hours can be whatever this council sees fit, whatever this council deems appropriate, Mr. President.

1307
01:48:40,676 --> 01:48:43,258
[SPEAKER_30]: Whereas this is a special permit, and I believe it's

1308
01:48:43,938 --> 01:48:50,362
[SPEAKER_30]: Governor, under Chapter 48 of the General Law, Section 9, we have 90 days to act on the request once it's perfected and comes to our body.

1309
01:48:50,622 --> 01:48:59,007
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it might make sense for us to table this matter and wait 90 days and see what happens with Wegmans when they're in operation so that the residents have a better idea of what it is that they're dealing with, Mr. President.

1310
01:49:00,047 --> 01:49:04,149
[SPEAKER_30]: Ultimately, we're in a situation right now where we have a new, fresh business in the community, and they're a great partner.

1311
01:49:04,169 --> 01:49:05,069
[SPEAKER_30]: They are a great partner.

1312
01:49:05,469 --> 01:49:14,432
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think that the first job that we have in the City Council, number one, is to keep our streets safe, and number two is to protect the integrity and the quality of life of the taxpaying residents that reside here, Mr. President.

1313
01:49:14,812 --> 01:49:21,675
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's very important for us to recognize the fact that the condo market in the city of Medford is, through the roof, skyrocketing hot right now.

1314
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:27,477
[SPEAKER_30]: The residents in these condominiums pay a ton of money in taxes, as does Wegmans, Mr. President, as does Wegmans.

1315
01:49:27,517 --> 01:49:29,338
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think that the residents have to come first.

1316
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:33,079
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that this is something that needs a longer and hotter look, Mr. President.

1317
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:35,340
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to determine what the impact is going to be.

1318
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,681
[SPEAKER_30]: And maybe we should look at that impact in the first 90 days of their operation.

1319
01:49:38,881 --> 01:49:42,603
[SPEAKER_30]: Right now, we have a permit that's in front of us that's saying, you let us be open longer.

1320
01:49:43,183 --> 01:49:49,710
[SPEAKER_30]: Why don't we say, well think about it, let's see what happens over the next 90 days, as opposed to putting contingencies and parameters on it.

1321
01:49:50,030 --> 01:50:01,842
[SPEAKER_30]: Why don't we see what happens over the next 90 days, let these residents get a taste of what's going on over there, so when they come back to us with their concerns, they have a little bit more of an informed opinion and a little bit more of an understanding of what it's really like.

1322
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,643
[SPEAKER_30]: so that they can tell us what it's really like, because none of us live there.

1323
01:50:04,783 --> 01:50:07,384
[SPEAKER_30]: They live there every day, and they're the ones that are going to have to deal with this.

1324
01:50:07,904 --> 01:50:15,147
[SPEAKER_30]: So, well, you know, the partnership in the community is excellent, and we certainly appreciate the fundings that they've donated for the Clippership Connector and so on and so forth.

1325
01:50:15,487 --> 01:50:18,388
[SPEAKER_30]: It's the people that live in this community that make this community great, Mr. President.

1326
01:50:18,428 --> 01:50:19,709
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to protect them.

1327
01:50:19,769 --> 01:50:29,813
[SPEAKER_30]: So my recommended course of action would be tabling this matter for 90 days, as outlined by the general laws, which is well within our scope and authority, and seeing what happens over the next

1328
01:50:30,413 --> 01:50:33,718
[SPEAKER_30]: two or three months during the regular hours of operation of 7 a.m.

1329
01:50:33,758 --> 01:50:34,559
[SPEAKER_30]: to 11 p.m.

1330
01:50:34,939 --> 01:50:42,931
[SPEAKER_30]: so that we can determine whether or not there are additional parameters that need to be put on the special permit outside of the 11 o'clock hour, never mind granting it until 12.

1331
01:50:42,991 --> 01:50:46,395
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe they come for a special permit and say we want our hours of operation to be X, Y, and Z.

1332
01:50:46,896 --> 01:50:57,000
[SPEAKER_30]: But all the residents are very upset that the deliveries that happen at a certain time, during jeopardy, I don't know, for whatever reason, whatever problems that the residents have with deliveries happening, whether the volume is high, so on and so forth.

1333
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:05,223
[SPEAKER_30]: We have an opportunity to protect these residents, Mr. President, and I think that the proper course of action this evening would be to table the matter.

1334
01:51:05,783 --> 01:51:07,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1335
01:51:07,223 --> 01:51:11,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just be interested in hearing from the residents, if anybody would like to add.

1336
01:51:12,334 --> 01:51:13,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have made concessions.

1337
01:51:13,855 --> 01:51:15,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Wegmans has made concessions.

1338
01:51:15,556 --> 01:51:20,078
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been suggestions on the floor, but I think it's important to hear from those that live there.

1339
01:51:20,558 --> 01:51:25,020
[SPEAKER_19]: If any residents would like to speak on this matter, please step forward.

1340
01:51:27,321 --> 01:51:28,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1341
01:51:28,402 --> 01:51:29,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bill Barabino.

1342
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:31,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 390 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1343
01:51:31,303 --> 01:51:32,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can say, I joined the community

1344
01:51:38,048 --> 01:51:40,489
[SPEAKER_03]: commerce there in supporting this.

1345
01:51:40,509 --> 01:51:43,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is gonna be, Wegmans is a beautiful building.

1346
01:51:43,851 --> 01:51:45,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing on the outside.

1347
01:51:45,612 --> 01:51:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself and my wife went to the Burlington store just to check it out because we got the Wegmans fever.

1348
01:51:52,855 --> 01:52:00,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've met the owner, not the owner, but the store manager, Kevin, he was here a minute ago.

1349
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:03,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Very kind, very, very nice people.

1350
01:52:04,438 --> 01:52:19,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So however, I think Wegmans, as it stands right now, as it's set up, it's gonna be damaging and it's gonna be simply destructive to 39020 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1351
01:52:19,956 --> 01:52:23,100
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, I think what you find is the west facing side.

1352
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:39,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and the reason why is basically, and I have a packet in front of you, I don't know if you've gotten to it, but essentially what you have is a 390-20 Mystic Valley Parkway is a very large 11-story, 265 units, I know you're familiar with it, but it's large and it's brick.

1353
01:52:40,327 --> 01:52:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have Wegmans, and the whole Mystic Valley Parkway Mall, and what that is is also a very large brick.

1354
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:52,413
[SPEAKER_03]: building, or it's cement or whatever.

1355
01:52:53,013 --> 01:52:56,516
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have, it develops as an echo chamber, right?

1356
01:52:56,796 --> 01:52:58,318
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an echo chamber in there.

1357
01:52:58,418 --> 01:53:04,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, they've even made another road, which has sort of taken out some vegetation as well.

1358
01:53:04,923 --> 01:53:07,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably even slightly even louder than it was.

1359
01:53:08,706 --> 01:53:10,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you have is now an echo chamber.

1360
01:53:11,008 --> 01:53:16,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And the shipping lanes are in that echo chamber.

1361
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:22,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything you hear about the trucks is spot on, spot on, everybody who has mentioned that.

1362
01:53:22,779 --> 01:53:24,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's a big problem.

1363
01:53:24,481 --> 01:53:32,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So the shipping lanes, the reason why this place is defective is because the shipping lanes go right through the back, right in between that echo chamber.

1364
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, when something travels in between, it's loud.

1365
01:53:38,094 --> 01:53:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, trucks.

1366
01:53:39,316 --> 01:53:40,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Trucks have to go through there.

1367
01:53:40,257 --> 01:53:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: They go through there.

1368
01:53:41,278 --> 01:53:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Trucks are loud for all the reasons.

1369
01:53:43,101 --> 01:53:48,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The gate drops, the doors shut, and the engines, the brakes go.

1370
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:52,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But the biggest thing,

1371
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:57,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest thing is when the reverse lights go on.

1372
01:53:57,712 --> 01:54:06,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you're probably well aware, and it's probably come up before, the reverse alarms, when a truck, any truck reverses, the alarms go off.

1373
01:54:06,675 --> 01:54:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It's federal law.

1374
01:54:07,355 --> 01:54:08,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to have those alarms.

1375
01:54:08,736 --> 01:54:09,956
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a loud noise.

1376
01:54:13,085 --> 01:54:18,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Those alarms that you hear, first of all, at night, it's dead quiet there.

1377
01:54:18,446 --> 01:54:20,907
[SPEAKER_03]: At night, you don't even hear the traffic unless you're out front.

1378
01:54:21,667 --> 01:54:24,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But in that echo chamber, you hear those alarms.

1379
01:54:25,308 --> 01:54:31,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And those alarms, those reverse alarms, most pungent, those are at about between 97 and 112 decibels.

1380
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how loud they are.

1381
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:39,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically the study show.

1382
01:54:39,361 --> 01:54:39,981
[SPEAKER_03]: 97 between 112.

1383
01:54:40,161 --> 01:54:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, to give you an example of decibels, a turboprop airplane taking off at 200 feet away is 118 decibels on takeoff.

1384
01:54:53,764 --> 01:54:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's that explosive, that noise.

1385
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:58,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's taking into consideration the echo.

1386
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:03,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what happens when those alarms go off?

1387
01:55:03,902 --> 01:55:17,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I wake up, and so when I wake up, I can't sleep, or I at least get up for a period of time, and then when I get up, if I can't sleep there, then the whole purpose of my home is no longer there.

1388
01:55:17,469 --> 01:55:22,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I have is now, I own a piece of brick, and I own some sheet rock in Medford.

1389
01:55:22,552 --> 01:55:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't own a home, because I can't live there.

1390
01:55:25,315 --> 01:55:31,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately for me, and I think for some of the people here, is I know that the city council,

1391
01:55:34,913 --> 01:55:36,613
[SPEAKER_03]: can't protect my family.

1392
01:55:37,033 --> 01:55:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I can possibly have a partner here.

1393
01:55:40,474 --> 01:55:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is because in 2014, I came before the council.

1394
01:55:44,435 --> 01:55:45,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I just happened to be here.

1395
01:55:45,975 --> 01:55:47,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It was exactly the same issue.

1396
01:55:47,575 --> 01:55:49,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a special permit in Kohl's.

1397
01:55:50,456 --> 01:55:59,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Kohl's, because it's a special permit, and you can put conditions on it, I simply came up and said, you know, there's a couple trucks and the reverse alarms.

1398
01:55:59,597 --> 01:56:03,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I think Kohl's at the time, they wanted just to operate 24 hours a day.

1399
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:10,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's essentially what Wegmans is to us, because I think the most part, if it's during any time you're sleeping, forget it.

1400
01:56:11,098 --> 01:56:16,660
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they want in 2014 is just to operate six days, 24 hours.

1401
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:20,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And right here, right at the podium, I was so impressed.

1402
01:56:20,061 --> 01:56:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't been in one of these before.

1403
01:56:22,581 --> 01:56:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We solved it right there with the attorney.

1404
01:56:24,282 --> 01:56:31,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, ladies and gentlemen, both came in and said, we sat there, went back and forth, and eventually you put a prohibition.

1405
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:32,905
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, listen, 11 to seven,

1406
01:56:34,539 --> 01:56:49,229
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not driving trucks, and you also put some, I think, some police presence and different things, which hadn't even come to my mind, but in the knowledge and wisdom of the board, you addressed it, you protected the community, you protected me.

1407
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:57,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, fortunately, as Councilor Knight had mentioned, people don't know what's coming.

1408
01:56:58,282 --> 01:57:16,821
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been construction, the construction dude's been pretty good, and I've gone out and talked to them, and there's been some missteps, well at least I can tell you, I don't know if they're missteps, but I can tell you at least three events in the last two months that document in my affidavit, and also give you some supporting evidence, but I can tell you that,

1409
01:57:20,315 --> 01:57:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really know what's coming.

1410
01:57:21,736 --> 01:57:22,656
[SPEAKER_03]: The building's up.

1411
01:57:22,716 --> 01:57:23,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.

1412
01:57:23,417 --> 01:57:25,117
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen a truck, really.

1413
01:57:25,157 --> 01:57:27,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've got some pick up.

1414
01:57:27,919 --> 01:57:28,539
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not ready.

1415
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:34,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you've saved certainly my family.

1416
01:57:35,523 --> 01:57:37,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's going to be a lot in 2014.

1417
01:57:37,104 --> 01:57:39,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be a lot different now.

1418
01:57:41,946 --> 01:57:43,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking for three things.

1419
01:57:43,867 --> 01:57:46,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm asking for three things, and I think that,

1420
01:57:48,418 --> 01:57:54,723
[SPEAKER_03]: we can coexist with Wegmans, and I think embrace them and have a great welcoming to Medford.

1421
01:57:55,043 --> 01:57:57,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And those three things are, which have somewhat been mentioned.

1422
01:57:58,706 --> 01:58:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that you limit the operation of the vehicles.

1423
01:58:03,429 --> 01:58:08,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really, I think, is going to be the operation of the back of Wegmans, the vehicles.

1424
01:58:08,613 --> 01:58:11,875
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's number one, the operation of the vehicles.

1425
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:17,224
[SPEAKER_03]: When those alarms go off, I think it's fair, we want, I think you need to get eight hours of sleep.

1426
01:58:17,585 --> 01:58:23,015
[SPEAKER_03]: If we know that they're gonna, you've acknowledged to me before that they can be bothersome, we're gonna restrict them.

1427
01:58:23,356 --> 01:58:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should give at least eight hours.

1428
01:58:26,672 --> 01:58:31,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm suggesting, I've talked to the attorney, the morning hours are more important to them.

1429
01:58:32,535 --> 01:58:44,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I get up at 6.30, I don't wanna speak for everyone else, but my sense is, start at seven, or even six, but let's just get to bed, because you gotta go to sleep to get to work.

1430
01:58:44,904 --> 01:58:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know for me, I go to bed at 9.30, and as counsel has mentioned, I'm not sure exactly who, but when we were talking about it before,

1431
01:58:56,163 --> 01:59:07,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be, when they start operating, I would be sitting, waiting, because I go to bed about nine, 30, 10, I would be sitting waiting for them to stop operations to go to sleep.

1432
01:59:07,987 --> 01:59:09,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would be doing.

1433
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:10,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So to think one's rolling in.

1434
01:59:11,468 --> 01:59:19,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, so I said one, the hours of operation, two, the other thing is they also have 24 hour, they also have 24 hour trash pickup.

1435
01:59:21,972 --> 01:59:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's an accelerated noise.

1436
01:59:24,513 --> 01:59:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually as you get the reverse lights.

1437
01:59:26,634 --> 01:59:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: 24 hours, it's minus 10.

1438
01:59:28,475 --> 01:59:30,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked to the building department.

1439
01:59:30,596 --> 01:59:32,477
[SPEAKER_03]: The building department, they're allowed to do that.

1440
01:59:32,837 --> 01:59:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: That 24, that is a disaster.

1441
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:36,359
[SPEAKER_03]: 438, I've been out there.

1442
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:36,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to them.

1443
01:59:37,259 --> 01:59:39,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, they're allowed to do that.

1444
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:42,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just scrapes the two, right, the metal right off.

1445
01:59:42,162 --> 01:59:44,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's nothing else to do but go over there because I'm awake.

1446
01:59:46,469 --> 01:59:52,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked to Kevin, and this is an important point, and I think he's mentioned it too.

1447
01:59:52,774 --> 01:59:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, we want to partner with weapons.

1448
01:59:54,775 --> 01:59:55,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to interfere with them.

1449
01:59:56,236 --> 02:00:01,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell, and I know, Mr. President, you were very supportive and you've been very communicative.

1450
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:08,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You've answered as best as you can all my concerns, and everybody has, and I acknowledge that.

1451
02:00:08,145 --> 02:00:12,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not been ignored by anybody, and I thank you for that.

1452
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:15,150
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last thing I have is oversight.

1453
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:21,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Because whatever restriction you have, that restriction has to be like, that is it.

1454
02:00:21,778 --> 02:00:22,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't get in.

1455
02:00:22,739 --> 02:00:25,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad for some person driving from Maine.

1456
02:00:26,849 --> 02:00:30,473
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to know that that's it, that's bedtime.

1457
02:00:30,713 --> 02:00:32,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the rules, that's bedtime.

1458
02:00:32,315 --> 02:00:41,646
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion, six, seven, whatever it is they start, but let us get to bed and you have to give us eight hours of sleep.

1459
02:00:42,006 --> 02:00:45,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the only thing I mentioned and I'm gonna close is,

1460
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:56,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoke to, in terms of controlling deliveries, I took time off of my schedule and I went to the alcohol meeting and now the question was, they wanted special permits.

1461
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:01,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you, I listened to the questions and it was very probing questions of all the councils.

1462
02:01:01,941 --> 02:01:05,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have end caps, they're gonna have, they're gonna sell alcohol at the end.

1463
02:01:05,642 --> 02:01:07,383
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have I think something like 10,000 square feet.

1464
02:01:10,273 --> 02:01:13,315
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a separate commission that doesn't fall under our purview.

1465
02:01:13,635 --> 02:01:15,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to close right now.

1466
02:01:16,417 --> 02:01:25,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just say that at that meeting, you were very generous with your time there and you were now, but I would just close with

1467
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I met with, I didn't object, and I conditioned my objection solely on deliveries.

1468
02:01:35,406 --> 02:01:42,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Kevin gave me his card, which is in your packet, he told me, we control deliveries.

1469
02:01:42,712 --> 02:01:43,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an issue.

1470
02:01:43,933 --> 02:01:46,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I spoke to the attorney, I spoke to Kevin.

1471
02:01:46,295 --> 02:01:47,195
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel good.

1472
02:01:47,716 --> 02:01:53,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also, additionally, it also is reinforced by the fact that

1473
02:01:55,029 --> 02:01:56,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They come all the way from Maine.

1474
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's really scheduled.

1475
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:03,793
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I just want to, you know, be able to go to sleep on time.

1476
02:02:04,213 --> 02:02:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1477
02:02:04,673 --> 02:02:05,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1478
02:02:06,774 --> 02:02:07,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else like to speak?

1479
02:02:09,295 --> 02:02:10,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

1480
02:02:10,495 --> 02:02:10,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1481
02:02:10,775 --> 02:02:13,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, John Costas, 25 Salem Street.

1482
02:02:14,957 --> 02:02:21,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Past president of the Chamber of Commerce, current board member of the Chamber of Commerce, but I'm not speaking here for the Chamber of Commerce.

1483
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Wegmans is a huge operation.

1484
02:02:26,981 --> 02:02:30,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We all enjoy large operations in the city.

1485
02:02:31,622 --> 02:02:38,023
[SPEAKER_02]: The property tax they're paying, and what they're going to do financially for the city at twice the residential.

1486
02:02:38,823 --> 02:02:41,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what is the answer?

1487
02:02:42,423 --> 02:02:46,924
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, why did we allow Wegmans to build all the Meadow Glen Mall?

1488
02:02:47,184 --> 02:02:50,805
[SPEAKER_02]: When Meadow Glen Mall went out of business, we should have said, tear it down.

1489
02:02:51,942 --> 02:02:53,423
[SPEAKER_02]: There's residential condos.

1490
02:02:53,763 --> 02:03:00,227
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what we do, unless we put a tiny modern pub store there, you shouldn't have Wegmans there.

1491
02:03:00,827 --> 02:03:04,530
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we had Meadow Glen Mall for 35 years there.

1492
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:07,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand there's noises.

1493
02:03:07,972 --> 02:03:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the people that are going to complain about the noises at 11.30 at night, you're going to have people that work nights.

1494
02:03:16,477 --> 02:03:21,280
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to complain, I don't want you unloading your trucks at 11 o'clock in the morning.

1495
02:03:21,807 --> 02:03:22,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to sleep.

1496
02:03:23,168 --> 02:03:24,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I work nights.

1497
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:26,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, what are you going to do?

1498
02:03:27,512 --> 02:03:28,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big operation.

1499
02:03:29,373 --> 02:03:32,175
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't be accommodating every single little rule.

1500
02:03:32,876 --> 02:03:42,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the city and the residents have issues with these corporations, then do not allow any large corporations to open up in this city anymore.

1501
02:03:43,144 --> 02:03:50,190
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not a tiny operation, you're not going to sell alcohol, you're not going to have tractor trailers, you're welcome in Medford.

1502
02:03:51,042 --> 02:03:55,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a big company that's going to generate 1,000 jobs, get lost.

1503
02:03:56,426 --> 02:04:02,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want you here because you're too close to residential condos or apartments or whatever.

1504
02:04:02,710 --> 02:04:04,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, the doggy daycare thing.

1505
02:04:05,332 --> 02:04:10,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the answer when you get residential next to commercial industrial property?

1506
02:04:11,336 --> 02:04:16,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can't keep coming and complaining and saying, listen, I don't want this business here.

1507
02:04:16,579 --> 02:04:17,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't sleep.

1508
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this business here.

1509
02:04:19,496 --> 02:04:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we should not have let them open if everybody's going to complain about their operation.

1510
02:04:25,721 --> 02:04:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have good neighbors.

1511
02:04:28,964 --> 02:04:32,646
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to generate all this revenue for us, all this job opportunities.

1512
02:04:34,268 --> 02:04:35,989
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is the answer to them?

1513
02:04:36,229 --> 02:04:44,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's not make it difficult for business to survive in this community and put a whole lot of restrictions on them.

1514
02:04:44,576 --> 02:04:47,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to find an answer, but they're good people.

1515
02:04:47,691 --> 02:04:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they have a lot to offer this community, in addition to twice the property tax rate their residents pay.

1516
02:04:55,538 --> 02:04:55,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1517
02:04:56,119 --> 02:04:56,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1518
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1519
02:05:01,664 --> 02:05:02,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

1520
02:05:02,065 --> 02:05:03,246
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

1521
02:05:03,426 --> 02:05:05,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Tina Caruso, Medford Square.

1522
02:05:06,749 --> 02:05:10,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I am the president of the chamber and I'm representing the Chamber of Commerce.

1523
02:05:11,398 --> 02:05:18,204
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to take a moment of your time just to give you our view on the support for Wegmans.

1524
02:05:19,105 --> 02:05:26,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Since the announcement of Wegmans coming to Medford, they've generously donated to many local organizations and events.

1525
02:05:27,652 --> 02:05:29,053
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's all throughout the city.

1526
02:05:29,874 --> 02:05:32,056
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, they're present.

1527
02:05:32,296 --> 02:05:34,538
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't just write a check and walk away.

1528
02:05:34,558 --> 02:05:35,498
[SPEAKER_12]: They show up.

1529
02:05:37,708 --> 02:05:48,217
[SPEAKER_12]: By changing the work hours, they're meeting the needs of our community, the part of the community that has to be in work super early and those that work very late.

1530
02:05:49,618 --> 02:05:54,542
[SPEAKER_12]: They're also hiring locally, part-time as well as full-time.

1531
02:05:55,463 --> 02:06:02,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Think of the effect that that extra one hour can have on one part-time employee.

1532
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:04,070
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about $3,000 a year.

1533
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:10,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think of my daughter and I say, oh boy, she could really use that.

1534
02:06:12,114 --> 02:06:21,360
[SPEAKER_12]: All these types of things, along with the other things that have already been said, are helping our local economy in Medven.

1535
02:06:22,581 --> 02:06:30,726
[SPEAKER_12]: As a strong contributor to the economic climate in our city, it would be beneficial to support Wegmans in their request.

1536
02:06:31,206 --> 02:06:32,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for your time.

1537
02:06:33,048 --> 02:06:33,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1538
02:06:36,423 --> 02:06:37,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

1539
02:06:38,425 --> 02:06:46,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Donovan Camara, Chamber of Commerce, co-chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee for the Chamber, and a very happy resident of the city of Medford.

1540
02:06:47,512 --> 02:07:00,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, before I make the comments about Whitewater, I'd like to say how happy I am to return to Medford High School after 33 glorious years of having taught the likes of George Scarpelli and Adam Knight at this wonderful high school.

1541
02:07:00,983 --> 02:07:02,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's nice to be back.

1542
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:02,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel at home.

1543
02:07:04,594 --> 02:07:15,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to strongly echo everything that Madam President of the Chamber just said and John Costas, although I am extremely empathetic that the gentleman spoke just before them.

1544
02:07:16,328 --> 02:07:18,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important to get a good night's sleep.

1545
02:07:19,052 --> 02:07:20,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important for me.

1546
02:07:20,193 --> 02:07:21,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on Lawrence Road.

1547
02:07:21,815 --> 02:07:31,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And on any given morning from, let's say, September to June, I hear nothing but beep, beep, beep, because this high school has cursed me for the past 40 years that I've been living there.

1548
02:07:31,518 --> 02:07:31,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1549
02:07:31,759 --> 02:07:33,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they have to get to the high school.

1550
02:07:33,139 --> 02:07:37,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a hell of a noise out there in the morning for 10 months out of the year.

1551
02:07:37,521 --> 02:07:38,601
[SPEAKER_10]: But I chose to live there.

1552
02:07:39,201 --> 02:07:39,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I love where I live.

1553
02:07:40,382 --> 02:07:43,403
[SPEAKER_10]: The woods are in the back, so it's quiet in the back, but lots of noise in the front.

1554
02:07:44,043 --> 02:07:46,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So I accommodated myself to having lived there.

1555
02:07:46,024 --> 02:07:46,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a choice.

1556
02:07:47,666 --> 02:07:51,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I also made a choice not to buy a condo in that particular complex years ago.

1557
02:07:51,571 --> 02:07:53,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have when Murata first built it, you know.

1558
02:07:54,435 --> 02:07:57,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's one of the busiest parkways in the state.

1559
02:07:57,909 --> 02:08:00,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a choice that we make, or we don't make.

1560
02:08:01,011 --> 02:08:01,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel bad.

1561
02:08:01,771 --> 02:08:05,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel bad for the gentleman who says he wants to go to sleep at 9.30 at night or get a good night's sleep.

1562
02:08:06,034 --> 02:08:06,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not.

1563
02:08:06,834 --> 02:08:23,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would be strongly in favor, I am, as a member of the chamber and everything else, for their extended hours, assuming, of course, that some arrangements can be made, accommodations between the council, the neighbors, who should be respected, of course, and, naturally, the Wigmans itself.

1564
02:08:24,245 --> 02:08:25,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great institution.

1565
02:08:25,806 --> 02:08:27,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to go shopping there.

1566
02:08:28,047 --> 02:08:30,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've got Bar Food Store in South Medford.

1567
02:08:30,308 --> 02:08:30,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1568
02:08:31,089 --> 02:08:33,610
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got Whole Foods in the back, and now we have Wegmans.

1569
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:35,391
[SPEAKER_10]: How lucky can this town get?

1570
02:08:35,911 --> 02:08:46,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful, beautiful combination, and I'm happy that they're here, and I hope that a resolution that is happy to the neighbors and Wegmans and the council and everybody that wants to shop there is reached.

1571
02:08:46,476 --> 02:08:48,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am strongly in favor of the extended hours.

1572
02:08:49,038 --> 02:08:49,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1573
02:08:52,989 --> 02:08:54,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

1574
02:08:54,789 --> 02:08:57,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlotte Scuderi, 283 High Street, Medford.

1575
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:02,171
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to say I'm happy to have Whitemans in our city.

1576
02:09:02,911 --> 02:09:06,512
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an excellent reputation wherever they have come up.

1577
02:09:07,112 --> 02:09:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that extra hour isn't going to bother anybody.

1578
02:09:10,933 --> 02:09:12,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on High Street.

1579
02:09:12,093 --> 02:09:17,054
[SPEAKER_01]: My trash gets picked up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and there's a lot of noise with the trucks.

1580
02:09:17,394 --> 02:09:18,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose to live there.

1581
02:09:20,994 --> 02:09:24,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they're going to be having trash removed all day, all night.

1582
02:09:24,258 --> 02:09:25,158
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not happening.

1583
02:09:25,719 --> 02:09:27,401
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the liquor, that's not happening.

1584
02:09:27,641 --> 02:09:32,106
[SPEAKER_01]: The trucks coming in, delivering, I know they'll find an answer.

1585
02:09:32,266 --> 02:09:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should move ahead, give them the opportunity to show us what they can do, and if there's a problem, address it after, not now.

1586
02:09:41,276 --> 02:09:41,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1587
02:09:42,036 --> 02:09:42,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1588
02:09:47,168 --> 02:09:47,548
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening.

1589
02:09:47,988 --> 02:09:50,329
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address of the record, please.

1590
02:09:50,409 --> 02:09:52,150
[SPEAKER_37]: Brice Cipriani, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1591
02:09:53,791 --> 02:10:00,834
[SPEAKER_37]: I'd like to start by saying thank you again for having us here this evening, and thanks to everyone that came out to speak on this issue.

1592
02:10:01,695 --> 02:10:08,198
[SPEAKER_37]: A lot of the items that I had in my notes were already addressed, so without risking repeating a lot of things,

1593
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:12,635
[SPEAKER_37]: Comments will be briefer than what I originally thought.

1594
02:10:13,356 --> 02:10:19,800
[SPEAKER_37]: But it's also important for me to say that I think we all agree that we're welcoming white men into the community.

1595
02:10:20,321 --> 02:10:24,584
[SPEAKER_37]: I also, and my family, also frequents the Burlington location.

1596
02:10:25,945 --> 02:10:34,471
[SPEAKER_37]: And to have a location right next door within walking distance, we're thrilled about that.

1597
02:10:34,491 --> 02:10:36,233
[SPEAKER_37]: I personally,

1598
02:10:37,272 --> 02:10:49,381
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not in favor of the extended hours, but I want to be very specific that this is pertaining to the delivery, not the hours of operation of the store or what's going on in the front of the store.

1599
02:10:51,002 --> 02:10:51,863
[SPEAKER_37]: We're fine with that.

1600
02:10:52,503 --> 02:10:54,985
[SPEAKER_37]: But again, that's my personal opinion.

1601
02:10:55,345 --> 02:11:02,451
[SPEAKER_37]: As a member of the Board of Trustees of the Conval Association, I have an obligation and a responsibility to the unit owners

1602
02:11:03,411 --> 02:11:05,592
[SPEAKER_37]: and address any concerns that they have.

1603
02:11:06,092 --> 02:11:07,733
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's a balancing act.

1604
02:11:08,013 --> 02:11:18,357
[SPEAKER_37]: We want to make sure that we're being good neighbors, welcoming Whiteman's into the community, but we do have the concerns against specifically what's going on in the rear of the store.

1605
02:11:18,877 --> 02:11:24,719
[SPEAKER_37]: As far as the hours of operation, store hours, that's fine.

1606
02:11:28,561 --> 02:11:31,262
[SPEAKER_37]: In talking with some of the residents this evening,

1607
02:11:32,386 --> 02:11:40,474
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that we would be open to possibly considering a review and maybe readdressing the issue.

1608
02:11:40,494 --> 02:11:52,305
[SPEAKER_37]: I will say one thing, that this morning, by coincidence, at 3.04 a.m., a truck pulled in to the back of Wegmans and made a delivery.

1609
02:11:53,579 --> 02:12:00,065
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think that Wegmans should already be taking control of this, not once the store has this grand opening.

1610
02:12:00,085 --> 02:12:07,071
[SPEAKER_37]: I think from the time that the shovel was put in the ground up until whenever they're gonna be in control of this.

1611
02:12:07,352 --> 02:12:14,539
[SPEAKER_37]: And so 3 or 4 a.m., I made a note of the time, and I got up to see that truck making a delivery.

1612
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:17,441
[SPEAKER_37]: So another one of my concerns is that

1613
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:34,608
[SPEAKER_37]: even if we do allow a certain amount of time or a time window from 7 in the morning, 8 in the morning, 9 in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, what is going to happen?

1614
02:12:34,648 --> 02:12:39,511
[SPEAKER_37]: Are those hours going to be extended because of unforeseen circumstances?

1615
02:12:39,591 --> 02:12:46,195
[SPEAKER_37]: Are we going to have trucks coming in earlier than the time that we do agree on, trucks staying later?

1616
02:12:46,873 --> 02:12:48,293
[SPEAKER_37]: than the time we agree on.

1617
02:12:49,134 --> 02:13:02,038
[SPEAKER_37]: So in wrapping everything up, I think that we would like to find a balance and we're not against having a review period and confirming that everything will be in line.

1618
02:13:03,879 --> 02:13:04,399
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1619
02:13:04,559 --> 02:13:06,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1620
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:08,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1621
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we could get addressed the trash pickup.

1622
02:13:17,417 --> 02:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, Elaine Mastracola, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1623
02:13:21,963 --> 02:13:24,366
[SPEAKER_34]: I live on the ninth floor overlooking Wegmans.

1624
02:13:25,106 --> 02:13:27,429
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm delighted that they're there.

1625
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:29,492
[SPEAKER_34]: I was thinking of going for a job.

1626
02:13:29,792 --> 02:13:34,879
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know if they hire old ladies, but I'm delighted they're there.

1627
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:42,375
[SPEAKER_34]: But I respectfully submit that I would request we keep the status quo with the hours.

1628
02:13:43,035 --> 02:13:48,179
[SPEAKER_34]: And if Whiteman really cares about community, they will adhere to the 7 to 11 as well.

1629
02:13:48,239 --> 02:13:49,019
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much.

1630
02:13:58,817 --> 02:14:06,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Firstly, I'd like to express our appreciation for all the accolades from the various individuals that just came up before us.

1631
02:14:06,624 --> 02:14:08,006
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as Ms.

1632
02:14:08,346 --> 02:14:18,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilwoman, I'd be glad to address a number of the questions that were raised beyond the trash collection, if you'd like, but starting specifically that we do not have overnight pickup of refugees at all.

1633
02:14:20,657 --> 02:14:21,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1634
02:14:21,097 --> 02:14:25,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be glad to go down and, from my best recall, address it.

1635
02:14:25,901 --> 02:14:30,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, maybe not a pickup, but do they have a compactor that works?

1636
02:14:31,205 --> 02:14:34,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Our compactor is up against the building and enclosed.

1637
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:36,929
[SPEAKER_15]: We feed it from the inside of the store.

1638
02:14:37,129 --> 02:14:37,950
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is no noise.

1639
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:38,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1640
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:39,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1641
02:14:40,232 --> 02:14:46,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And once again, Mr. President, if you'd like, I can go down the list the best I can recall of the number of comments and questions.

1642
02:14:49,116 --> 02:14:50,418
[SPEAKER_15]: So we just answered the refuge.

1643
02:14:50,458 --> 02:14:53,442
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no overnight refuge or pickup.

1644
02:14:54,203 --> 02:15:03,575
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the security, we do have, in fact, a very intensive security staff supplementing

1645
02:15:04,957 --> 02:15:11,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Police Department that are in this parcel on the site for Wegmans specifically from 4 p.m.

1646
02:15:11,241 --> 02:15:11,781
[SPEAKER_15]: to midnight.

1647
02:15:11,881 --> 02:15:23,088
[SPEAKER_15]: So here again and one just one other factor where Wegmans is helping the community out in the area of security well beyond just being here as a good neighbor.

1648
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:26,350
[SPEAKER_15]: In addition to that

1649
02:15:30,122 --> 02:15:31,123
[SPEAKER_15]: The backup alarms.

1650
02:15:31,383 --> 02:15:37,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there is technology out there that you have more of a swish thing rather than the high audible that was referred to.

1651
02:15:37,931 --> 02:15:40,254
[SPEAKER_15]: That's something that we can certainly look into.

1652
02:15:40,374 --> 02:15:46,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's available, which I believe the technology there, we can incorporate that into our program.

1653
02:15:47,749 --> 02:15:58,514
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as condo values, our experience is whether we're there before or after, when people know there's a wetness, the property values typically are increased.

1654
02:15:58,594 --> 02:16:08,158
[SPEAKER_15]: We've never had any indication in the 93 stores we have that there's been a decrease in the values of real estate, more specifically residential, against us.

1655
02:16:08,218 --> 02:16:16,422
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, we've had places that we've been building, the condos came up after the fact, and they jumped in price, realizing that road use is coming into place.

1656
02:16:17,898 --> 02:16:21,120
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the use, obviously, we're a special permit.

1657
02:16:22,041 --> 02:16:28,064
[SPEAKER_15]: We understand that in an industrialized zone, a more intensive use than is technically permitted on this parcel.

1658
02:16:28,084 --> 02:16:33,287
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask that that be a very key consideration in this.

1659
02:16:35,189 --> 02:16:42,693
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to remain competitive.

1660
02:16:43,354 --> 02:16:44,915
[SPEAKER_15]: As you've probably read in the papers,

1661
02:16:46,135 --> 02:16:50,397
[SPEAKER_15]: The grocery business is becoming more and more competitive for a number of reasons.

1662
02:16:51,257 --> 02:16:56,219
[SPEAKER_15]: And this here is another factor that allows us to remain competitive and remain more flexible.

1663
02:16:56,680 --> 02:17:05,823
[SPEAKER_15]: We've heard all the comments, and we respect very sincerely and deeply the comments made by councilmen and women, as well as the residents about the noise.

1664
02:17:05,883 --> 02:17:06,724
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's here again.

1665
02:17:06,744 --> 02:17:09,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot overemphasize our commitment

1666
02:17:09,645 --> 02:17:27,315
[SPEAKER_15]: to be in compliance with code, noise ordinance or otherwise, should there be an issue, we respect and expect and will deal responsibly to the town officials, whether it be here again the council or building inspector, et cetera.

1667
02:17:27,335 --> 02:17:32,138
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will have ongoing dialogue with the neighbors and take that into consideration.

1668
02:17:33,245 --> 02:17:51,860
[SPEAKER_15]: The overall conclusion, though, in all of this, hearing the potential scenarios that were offered by both council as well as citizens, we ask that, at minimal, focusing on the central application, that we have the store open and operating from 6 a.m.

1669
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,600
[SPEAKER_15]: till midnight.

1670
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:53,801
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask that be the key.

1671
02:17:54,762 --> 02:18:04,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Should there be a desire to have some kind of restriction beyond our self-restriction of no overnight deliveries, then we bring the deliveries from 6 a.m.

1672
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:04,431
[SPEAKER_15]: to 11 p.m.

1673
02:18:07,351 --> 02:18:20,196
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a consideration for the board out of appreciation to all the comments and not to extend the meeting to the wee hours of the morning for the sake of obviously the council and the citizens.

1674
02:18:20,537 --> 02:18:21,917
[SPEAKER_15]: But here again, one indication.

1675
02:18:22,277 --> 02:18:26,139
[SPEAKER_15]: But to remain successful in a competitive market, we need to remain flexible.

1676
02:18:26,499 --> 02:18:28,240
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to have the hours of operations.

1677
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:29,180
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very critical.

1678
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:33,262
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's no guarantee that just because we're Wegmans that we're successful.

1679
02:18:34,082 --> 02:18:40,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Rochester knows very well the implications of not remaining competitive, not staying ahead of the eight ball.

1680
02:18:40,366 --> 02:18:43,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Kodak has come and gone for all practical purposes.

1681
02:18:43,428 --> 02:18:45,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Bausch & Lomb is fighting for its life.

1682
02:18:46,090 --> 02:18:47,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Xerox has been split up.

1683
02:18:48,211 --> 02:18:52,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the point, you always have to be in front of the game, ever flexible.

1684
02:18:54,153 --> 02:18:57,454
[SPEAKER_15]: With respect for the community, so you can give back to the community.

1685
02:18:58,295 --> 02:19:02,076
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no guarantee that we could be here if we're not successful.

1686
02:19:02,497 --> 02:19:05,578
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a benefit to them all, to the community, and certainly to our business.

1687
02:19:06,698 --> 02:19:10,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be glad to address any of the questions that I haven't been brought up.

1688
02:19:14,049 --> 02:19:18,592
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as, here again, one other point that store manager Kevin Russell pointed out to me.

1689
02:19:19,272 --> 02:19:24,655
[SPEAKER_15]: If a trucker comes there and he's outside the hours or close to the hours, then he should not be there.

1690
02:19:24,695 --> 02:19:30,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're going to dictate, if we do have the 11 to 12, you cannot come at 10 minutes of 12.

1691
02:19:30,879 --> 02:19:33,220
[SPEAKER_15]: You cannot be there a quarter of, et cetera.

1692
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:39,584
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to leave the site now, go back to the throwaway, and station it there, wherever that way station is, number one.

1693
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:44,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, when our trucks come here, our cabs are turned off.

1694
02:19:45,663 --> 02:19:47,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So that engine is not running.

1695
02:19:47,303 --> 02:19:51,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's some people who have thought and we've heard expressed concerns about the cab running.

1696
02:19:51,766 --> 02:19:53,807
[SPEAKER_15]: That engine is turned off as it comes in.

1697
02:19:54,587 --> 02:19:57,248
[SPEAKER_15]: The refrigeration units, when they're there, yes, they're on.

1698
02:19:57,308 --> 02:20:00,850
[SPEAKER_15]: But they are no different than the refrigeration units that are on the building.

1699
02:20:00,910 --> 02:20:04,792
[SPEAKER_15]: So in essence, it's the same mechanical operation that's on the building.

1700
02:20:05,112 --> 02:20:08,614
[SPEAKER_15]: And I go back to the initial concern that was expressed by Mr. Councilman.

1701
02:20:09,214 --> 02:20:11,937
[SPEAKER_15]: about the units on the HVAC units.

1702
02:20:11,957 --> 02:20:18,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure which particular unit that the individual is concerned about or which one the noise emanating has come from.

1703
02:20:19,383 --> 02:20:25,208
[SPEAKER_15]: We will certainly work with the city, look at it, look at the specs, and if there's a mitigation measure, we would incorporate it.

1704
02:20:25,228 --> 02:20:25,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1705
02:20:27,310 --> 02:20:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falwell.

1706
02:20:28,451 --> 02:20:29,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1707
02:20:29,191 --> 02:20:30,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.

1708
02:20:30,533 --> 02:20:32,775
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as when the trucks come to make deliveries,

1709
02:20:33,703 --> 02:20:36,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they be coming all in one direction?

1710
02:20:36,226 --> 02:20:38,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they be coming from Locust Street or the parkway?

1711
02:20:38,969 --> 02:20:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Which way would they be approaching the back of the building?

1712
02:20:42,233 --> 02:20:46,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Quite frankly, I don't know if we have that specific on that, but Kevin might have more detail.

1713
02:20:47,699 --> 02:20:49,701
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi folks, Kevin Russell, store manager at Wegmans.

1714
02:20:51,343 --> 02:21:02,497
[SPEAKER_35]: What I envision, and I'm not a professional truck driver, but looking at the property, I would say the one that makes the most sense would come off Locust and go around the side of Marshalls and come across the back in that direction.

1715
02:21:03,157 --> 02:21:06,421
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not sure if they're on the Mystic Valley Parkway, if they could really turn a right.

1716
02:21:06,782 --> 02:21:07,543
[SPEAKER_35]: It's pretty sharp.

1717
02:21:08,183 --> 02:21:12,227
[SPEAKER_35]: And again, these folks are professionals and they might be able to get it in there.

1718
02:21:12,287 --> 02:21:15,050
[SPEAKER_35]: I couldn't do it, but I think it'll come around the backside.

1719
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:17,252
[SPEAKER_35]: And if we say that's the way you have to come, that's the way you come.

1720
02:21:17,272 --> 02:21:24,919
[SPEAKER_35]: When I was the store manager in Burlington, and I don't know if anybody's been up there and seen the third item project, but we said, let's not have trucks come in on first, second, or third.

1721
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:25,759
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll come in on fourth.

1722
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:29,523
[SPEAKER_35]: And that way, they're able to navigate and negotiate much easier.

1723
02:21:29,623 --> 02:21:33,727
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's easier on the pavement, too, in an area like that.

1724
02:21:34,938 --> 02:21:35,638
[SPEAKER_35]: That's what we do there.

1725
02:21:36,519 --> 02:21:41,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking if you come around that side of the building, it probably might get a little bit quieter.

1726
02:21:41,362 --> 02:21:44,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, so thank you for answering that.

1727
02:21:44,403 --> 02:21:53,068
[SPEAKER_04]: With regard to the compactor, um, I believe the compactor has some sort of, uh, I think when you hit the button, it starts to compact.

1728
02:21:53,128 --> 02:21:54,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And is that pretty loud?

1729
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:57,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I used to work in a store when I was back in college.

1730
02:21:57,451 --> 02:21:59,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that seemed to be pretty loud, but I don't know.

1731
02:22:00,777 --> 02:22:02,619
[SPEAKER_35]: I personally don't believe that it's loud.

1732
02:22:02,679 --> 02:22:08,643
[SPEAKER_35]: I've worked with wagons 31 years and used the compactor, I don't even know how many, probably hundreds of thousands of times.

1733
02:22:09,584 --> 02:22:12,806
[SPEAKER_35]: It's louder on the inside because you're actually there with the mechanics.

1734
02:22:13,167 --> 02:22:18,511
[SPEAKER_35]: When you hit that button, there's a big ram that pushes out and compacts the garbage.

1735
02:22:18,571 --> 02:22:19,932
[SPEAKER_35]: On the outside, it's much different.

1736
02:22:20,918 --> 02:22:22,379
[SPEAKER_35]: And last question.

1737
02:22:22,419 --> 02:22:28,103
[SPEAKER_15]: We could certainly restrict the hours on that operationally wise.

1738
02:22:29,083 --> 02:22:32,946
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, typically overnight, we'll have grocery stocking that takes place.

1739
02:22:33,306 --> 02:22:35,387
[SPEAKER_35]: And they're really generating cardboard, not waste.

1740
02:22:35,888 --> 02:22:40,130
[SPEAKER_35]: So that goes inside a bale or inside the building that you wouldn't even know existed from the outside.

1741
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:40,430
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1742
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:46,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as, actually, you already answered the question.

1743
02:22:51,999 --> 02:23:00,385
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you address the gentleman's comment, Mr. Cipriani's comment about the truck coming in at 3.05 this morning?

1744
02:23:01,145 --> 02:23:01,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not aware of it.

1745
02:23:01,846 --> 02:23:03,287
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the first I've heard.

1746
02:23:03,307 --> 02:23:06,228
[SPEAKER_15]: That's definitely a road tractor trailer.

1747
02:23:07,649 --> 02:23:11,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be surprised if we don't have a receiver that early in the morning.

1748
02:23:13,252 --> 02:23:16,313
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not up in operation now, so I can't speak to who that was.

1749
02:23:16,413 --> 02:23:20,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we did receive a number of complaints in talking to our construction folks.

1750
02:23:20,455 --> 02:23:22,936
[SPEAKER_15]: We had received it from a number of the neighbors.

1751
02:23:22,976 --> 02:23:28,398
[SPEAKER_15]: But my understanding is those were construction vehicles as part of the overall site construction.

1752
02:23:28,958 --> 02:23:38,624
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can assure you again that there are roads in this particular case, especially coming down to the line with Peck opening up and decks and, you know, we're coming down to the wire.

1753
02:23:38,704 --> 02:23:45,548
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's an anomaly that something that, here again, if we hear something like that, it'll be shut down very quickly.

1754
02:23:45,568 --> 02:23:46,709
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be addressed immediately.

1755
02:23:47,992 --> 02:23:51,913
[SPEAKER_35]: I also wanted to mention that so the property really isn't turned over to us yet.

1756
02:23:52,013 --> 02:23:54,554
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, it will be us as of November 5th.

1757
02:23:54,594 --> 02:23:55,415
[SPEAKER_35]: We'll run that building.

1758
02:23:56,175 --> 02:23:58,536
[SPEAKER_35]: As you know, New England Development was the developer.

1759
02:23:58,836 --> 02:24:01,097
[SPEAKER_35]: EMJ actually runs that construction site.

1760
02:24:01,617 --> 02:24:03,318
[SPEAKER_35]: May have been something that they ordered in.

1761
02:24:03,458 --> 02:24:06,779
[SPEAKER_35]: But as Art said, we don't have a receiver on that property until 7 a.m.

1762
02:24:08,648 --> 02:24:12,371
[SPEAKER_35]: They may have had 28 cash registers come in from North Carolina.

1763
02:24:12,511 --> 02:24:15,793
[SPEAKER_35]: They got here early, thought it was OK to park behind the store, pulled in.

1764
02:24:15,973 --> 02:24:17,795
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if that unit continued to run.

1765
02:24:17,815 --> 02:24:19,636
[SPEAKER_35]: I know nothing about that delivery.

1766
02:24:19,736 --> 02:24:25,500
[SPEAKER_35]: But I can guarantee you that if we say we won't have folks after 11 or before 6, it won't happen.

1767
02:24:27,021 --> 02:24:27,361
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1768
02:24:30,884 --> 02:24:32,645
[SPEAKER_19]: Further comments from the audience?

1769
02:24:33,986 --> 02:24:34,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, you may.

1770
02:24:36,656 --> 02:24:37,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record.

1771
02:24:37,657 --> 02:24:40,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1772
02:24:41,319 --> 02:24:50,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Patiently, I've been listening, and I'd like to offer a few words, knowing that you can never satisfy all the people all the time.

1773
02:24:51,106 --> 02:24:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I believe that is still an industrial zone, not residential.

1774
02:24:56,890 --> 02:25:01,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, the old saying goes, competition usually makes better business.

1775
02:25:02,542 --> 02:25:12,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So the more competition, it would definitely be better for the consumer, I presume, lowering the prices, maybe stopping shop or lower the usury prices.

1776
02:25:13,366 --> 02:25:29,072
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, it might be a great idea to, instead of the 490 unit proposed development across the street, which is tied up in two or three lawsuits, that market basket goes in there.

1777
02:25:30,835 --> 02:25:32,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we could really lower some prices.

1778
02:25:33,596 --> 02:25:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening.

1779
02:25:35,437 --> 02:25:35,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1780
02:25:44,141 --> 02:25:44,981
[SPEAKER_29]: Come on down, Frank.

1781
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:48,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1782
02:25:48,623 --> 02:25:49,783
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Frank Bankey.

1783
02:25:50,063 --> 02:25:57,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a trustee, and I happen to be chairman of the board of trustees at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the abutting property.

1784
02:26:00,787 --> 02:26:04,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not profess to speak for everybody in the building.

1785
02:26:05,642 --> 02:26:06,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody can.

1786
02:26:06,645 --> 02:26:07,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody has that authority.

1787
02:26:08,685 --> 02:26:11,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here to speak for myself, but I'll say one thing.

1788
02:26:11,506 --> 02:26:20,449
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anybody can dispute the fact that I get around the building probably more than anyone else because I happen to be retired and I know a lot of people, and I do speak with them.

1789
02:26:21,249 --> 02:26:26,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I can honestly say I have never had anybody say to me that they were against waiters.

1790
02:26:27,351 --> 02:26:28,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome them with open arms.

1791
02:26:28,752 --> 02:26:30,132
[SPEAKER_14]: We're excited to get them.

1792
02:26:30,512 --> 02:26:32,193
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are some concerns.

1793
02:26:32,893 --> 02:26:39,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of those concerns would affect me because I am on the side that abuts the back of the building.

1794
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:51,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Now today, the Honorable President of the Board made reference that one of the members of the Board of Trustees met with people from Wegmans, and that happened to be me.

1795
02:26:53,619 --> 02:26:57,365
[SPEAKER_14]: We did have, I thought, a very productive meeting.

1796
02:26:58,487 --> 02:27:05,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of the things, like we've heard about the great contributions that Wegmans has made to the community at large, but I'll tell you,

1797
02:27:05,969 --> 02:27:16,499
[SPEAKER_14]: They were more than happy to support a resolution that the president of this city council is going to propose at the next meeting that I'm asking for his support.

1798
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:25,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is, I think the people who live in our building can appreciate the poor condition of the sidewalk in front of our building.

1799
02:27:26,528 --> 02:27:31,332
[SPEAKER_14]: It's particularly that section that leads from our driveway over to Wegmans.

1800
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:37,283
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lack of adequate lighting, and the trees are overhanging.

1801
02:27:37,743 --> 02:27:47,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I today contacted the office of Senator Pat Jalen, who I've known for a long time, and I said that I would like to get some support from the local community.

1802
02:27:47,649 --> 02:27:49,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And your president here, the boy, jumped right on it.

1803
02:27:50,071 --> 02:27:51,151
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, be glad to do it.

1804
02:27:51,191 --> 02:27:52,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll sponsor it for you at the next meeting.

1805
02:27:53,333 --> 02:27:56,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And the people from Wegmans, when I spoke with them, glad to do it.

1806
02:27:58,419 --> 02:28:00,962
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we want to be, is we want to be good neighbors.

1807
02:28:00,982 --> 02:28:02,563
[SPEAKER_14]: We want it to be a two-way street.

1808
02:28:02,623 --> 02:28:06,347
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to be able to go over and speak with the people there.

1809
02:28:06,367 --> 02:28:08,430
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of other issues that came up.

1810
02:28:10,592 --> 02:28:15,137
[SPEAKER_14]: You people are going to have, when I say you people, I mean Wegmans, is going to have 24-hour security.

1811
02:28:16,571 --> 02:28:19,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that bolsters our security.

1812
02:28:19,835 --> 02:28:30,906
[SPEAKER_14]: First day I took office as the chairman, I ordered the security guards at nighttime to make rounds of the building so that we have increased visibility with the security people.

1813
02:28:31,687 --> 02:28:35,291
[SPEAKER_14]: And now if we have the, I understand that the people from

1814
02:28:36,878 --> 02:28:38,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Brinkman's are going to be outside as well.

1815
02:28:39,099 --> 02:28:43,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So that gives us another degree of security, I think, at least on that side of the building.

1816
02:28:44,301 --> 02:28:47,702
[SPEAKER_14]: There have been some pretty good issues here raised tonight about the picking up of trash.

1817
02:28:47,842 --> 02:28:48,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is loud.

1818
02:28:48,742 --> 02:28:49,483
[SPEAKER_14]: It is loud.

1819
02:28:50,603 --> 02:28:53,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm talking about the compressor that we have on our own property.

1820
02:28:54,224 --> 02:29:00,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly something can be done to probably abate that, whether there's some kind of muffler systems or whether

1821
02:29:02,019 --> 02:29:05,963
[SPEAKER_14]: We could have scheduled pickups during normal business hours, not through the night.

1822
02:29:05,983 --> 02:29:10,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that these types of things, according to the law, they're able to come in.

1823
02:29:10,947 --> 02:29:13,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I know in Somerville that they have problems with that.

1824
02:29:13,289 --> 02:29:20,496
[SPEAKER_14]: They can come in commercial people and empty dumpsters at all times of the day and night.

1825
02:29:20,516 --> 02:29:22,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I came here tonight with the

1826
02:29:23,514 --> 02:29:27,316
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, expectation that you people were going to vote on it.

1827
02:29:27,476 --> 02:29:30,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no problem with going with the normal scheduled hours.

1828
02:29:31,277 --> 02:29:49,645
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard Councilor Knight come up with what I thought was a pretty good proposal and that was to put it on, I don't know if the correct term was to put it on the table or hold it in abeyance for a period of time so that if there are particular complaints, certainly people in my building are not bashful about expressing their complaints.

1829
02:29:50,392 --> 02:30:16,317
[SPEAKER_14]: uh... they would contact either hopefully they would let us know on the board but they would also contact Wegmans as well but I'm one person who is extremely excited and grateful to have this new business coming into our neighborhood they've done a heck of a job on the front of that building and when you think of what's left there are no disparaging calls but the way the brick and mortar stores are going I don't know how much longer Kohl's is going to last

1830
02:30:17,097 --> 02:30:22,759
[SPEAKER_14]: And if that falls under, and we didn't do anything about bringing Wegmans in, we'd have a dust bowl over there.

1831
02:30:22,799 --> 02:30:24,940
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd probably have cops down there all the time.

1832
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:40,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of which, and I worked for the Somerville police for 28 years, if ever there was a violation of any kind that somebody suspects, they should call the police and the police will come down and stop the delivery.

1833
02:30:40,926 --> 02:30:41,647
[SPEAKER_14]: And also,

1834
02:30:42,467 --> 02:31:02,083
[SPEAKER_14]: When the police department responds to a call, they are required to keep a record of that call, so that if we came back in 30 days or 90 days, it's very simple to go down to the police station, any one of us, and ask for a copy of the calls that were received by the police for the response they had to May 29th.

1835
02:31:05,112 --> 02:31:09,516
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't want to be here and frustrate Wegmans from coming in.

1836
02:31:09,876 --> 02:31:11,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody here really is for them.

1837
02:31:12,338 --> 02:31:18,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think with your cooperation, your guidance, I'm sure we can have a great relationship with them.

1838
02:31:18,584 --> 02:31:20,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that I've spoken with them today.

1839
02:31:20,125 --> 02:31:20,866
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to do some

1840
02:31:22,787 --> 02:31:27,753
[SPEAKER_14]: shrubbery work for us, and they're going to help us out with some property concerns that we have.

1841
02:31:28,674 --> 02:31:37,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I'm excited about getting this front sidewalk fixed and the trees trimmed and adequate lighting, and it's going to be safe for people to go back and forth.

1842
02:31:38,505 --> 02:31:47,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And in closing, I do want to thank you very much, Mr. President, and all the honorable members of the board for allowing us to come here this evening.

1843
02:31:47,512 --> 02:31:51,276
[SPEAKER_14]: A little tough there during the beginning there, you know, with the long hearings there.

1844
02:31:52,917 --> 02:31:54,498
[SPEAKER_14]: But this was productive.

1845
02:31:54,518 --> 02:31:55,199
[SPEAKER_14]: It was worth the wait.

1846
02:31:55,219 --> 02:31:56,920
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you very much.

1847
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:00,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Being a former select one, I think, you know, I was in this business.

1848
02:32:00,643 --> 02:32:01,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I know how boring that is.

1849
02:32:09,415 --> 02:32:11,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President and council members of I white.

1850
02:32:11,879 --> 02:32:22,315
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've heard a lot tonight from obviously the council and the neighbors here again back to the original application asking for hours of operations 6 a.m.

1851
02:32:22,375 --> 02:32:22,916
[SPEAKER_15]: to midnight.

1852
02:32:22,996 --> 02:32:23,837
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked that that

1853
02:32:24,836 --> 02:32:34,879
[SPEAKER_15]: We voted on with consideration that we will not only self-restrict overnight, but if the board chooses to restrict deliveries between 11 p.m.

1854
02:32:35,619 --> 02:32:36,760
[SPEAKER_15]: and 6 p.m., that we feel

1855
02:32:42,656 --> 02:32:55,751
[SPEAKER_15]: We feel that that is a situation where it's very clear in its cast and stone where we heard the resonance, we respected the resonance primarily at the end of the night, end of the day, if you will.

1856
02:32:56,933 --> 02:33:02,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Albeit, it restricts us in the, quite frankly, I'll tell you the challenges now, again, and not to belabor it, with the weather.

1857
02:33:02,415 --> 02:33:12,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Ideally, we'd get both together, hours of operations, 6 to midnight, and deliveries, because the weather, and it's not something that I fabricate this, but we feel it's going to happen.

1858
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:19,422
[SPEAKER_15]: possibly with the weather and traffic, and then we don't want the frustration with the neighbors, the council, and certainly us.

1859
02:33:19,482 --> 02:33:23,102
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that said, we'd appreciate an offer if they would, 6 a.m.

1860
02:33:23,963 --> 02:33:31,044
[SPEAKER_15]: to midnight for hours of operation, and then concurrent with that, a restrict of deliveries of tractor trailers in the back from 11 p.m.

1861
02:33:31,064 --> 02:33:31,264
[SPEAKER_15]: till 6 a.m.

1862
02:33:34,025 --> 02:33:34,545
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Knight.

1863
02:33:35,245 --> 02:33:36,926
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1864
02:33:36,946 --> 02:33:38,146
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate it.

1865
02:33:38,166 --> 02:33:48,550
[SPEAKER_30]: Sir, can you please explain to me a little bit more about what Mr. Bakey was discussing, some of these contingencies and some of these commitments that you've made to the Condo Association over there, so we have a better understanding?

1866
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll have to defer to Mr. Dugney.

1867
02:33:50,531 --> 02:33:53,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe he's referring to site improvements, that New England development.

1868
02:33:53,672 --> 02:33:57,253
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, once again, it's a tenant, so that was New England development.

1869
02:34:03,855 --> 02:34:04,696
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor.

1870
02:34:05,056 --> 02:34:07,739
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, Brian Dugdale from Goulston Stores.

1871
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:12,644
[SPEAKER_36]: After the development, there were commitments that have been made.

1872
02:34:12,664 --> 02:34:17,889
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we went through a lot of them previously in terms of there'll be sealed loading docks.

1873
02:34:17,909 --> 02:34:22,073
[SPEAKER_36]: In terms of the landscape offer, there will be additional planting that's done between

1874
02:34:22,965 --> 02:34:28,487
[SPEAKER_36]: the mall property and the condo property, as well as a fence that's going to gate off.

1875
02:34:28,527 --> 02:34:35,070
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a, I don't want to get too lost in the weeds, but there's a driveway that leads right in between the two properties, and there's an entrance.

1876
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:39,872
[SPEAKER_36]: That's going to be gated off to ensure that there'll be no truck access from the condo side.

1877
02:34:40,332 --> 02:34:42,533
[SPEAKER_36]: Everything will be coming through the mall property.

1878
02:34:43,433 --> 02:34:44,834
[SPEAKER_36]: We've agreed to give additional funding.

1879
02:34:44,854 --> 02:34:54,259
[SPEAKER_36]: The amount's still to be determined, but that funding's going to be used to plant an additional layer of shrubs, buffer-type landscaping improvements on the condo side of the property.

1880
02:34:55,120 --> 02:35:02,084
[SPEAKER_36]: In terms of security, I'm not sure that exactly it's going to be 24-hour security, but there is going to be security both through Wegmans and the mall.

1881
02:35:02,124 --> 02:35:06,126
[SPEAKER_36]: There's going to be two layers of security, and there will be monitoring, I believe.

1882
02:35:06,166 --> 02:35:08,387
[SPEAKER_36]: And Wegmans, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but 24-7 with cameras.

1883
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:26,634
[SPEAKER_36]: And again, the other commitment the two other things that were discussed there will be a designated representative so it's gonna be very easy to get in touch with both the ownership of the mall as well as Wegmans for to address any of these issues and then the other thing that we were talking about earlier is just the condition of the sidewalk.

1884
02:35:27,434 --> 02:35:28,674
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. Bakey was referring to.

1885
02:35:28,714 --> 02:35:34,596
[SPEAKER_36]: It's along Mystic Valley Parkway, which unfortunately is owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

1886
02:35:34,636 --> 02:35:50,120
[SPEAKER_36]: So we don't have the ability to actually do those improvements, but we would be more than happy to support any sort of a resolution of this council or any actions taken by Mr. Bakey himself to try to get some sort of funding and attention on that matter.

1887
02:35:51,369 --> 02:35:58,695
[SPEAKER_30]: The reason I ask, Mr. Dungill, is because I think that based upon what we're hearing from the residents, that they want to be a good neighbor.

1888
02:35:58,735 --> 02:36:00,596
[SPEAKER_30]: They want to be a partner with Wegmans.

1889
02:36:00,817 --> 02:36:06,501
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think they realize that Wegmans is going to be there for a long time, provided that they have tools to be successful.

1890
02:36:09,403 --> 02:36:19,265
[SPEAKER_30]: concessions that have been made, I think, are very important to gaining the support of the residents of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway and their efforts to be in favor of extended hours.

1891
02:36:19,826 --> 02:36:26,107
[SPEAKER_30]: And I was hoping maybe that we could get these criteria outlined so that we could include them as conditions in the special permit.

1892
02:36:27,067 --> 02:36:32,388
[SPEAKER_30]: Because the way that I'm looking at it, I think, is that people don't seem to have too much concern over the front of the house.

1893
02:36:32,529 --> 02:36:36,549
[SPEAKER_30]: They're not too worried about the hours of operation being six o'clock in the morning till midnight in the front of the house.

1894
02:36:37,010 --> 02:36:38,670
[SPEAKER_30]: The concerns are really on the loading in the back.

1895
02:36:39,311 --> 02:36:48,103
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, the request that's before us this evening is to allow a 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house and allow a 6 to 11 o'clock at night operation in the back of the house.

1896
02:36:48,984 --> 02:36:53,951
[SPEAKER_30]: I, for one, am a little bit more comfortable with the status quo operation in the back of the house.

1897
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:56,891
[SPEAKER_30]: and with the 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house.

1898
02:36:57,671 --> 02:37:00,392
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think it would be very important that we get these criteria included.

1899
02:37:00,412 --> 02:37:19,360
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd make the motion, Mr. President, to support the special permit, provided that there are restrictions that are placed upon it, one of them being that these special conditions and concessions that have been made by the developer and the condominium association are included as an addendum to the special permit.

1900
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:29,865
[SPEAKER_30]: that the hours are restricted for deliveries from status quo 7 to 11 in the back, and that we allow the permit to go forward for 6 to 12 in the front for the operations of the house, Mr. President.

1901
02:37:30,345 --> 02:37:34,747
[SPEAKER_30]: I also have a concern about the permit being issued in perpetuity.

1902
02:37:35,287 --> 02:37:37,368
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that there should be a review placed on it.

1903
02:37:37,468 --> 02:37:41,530
[SPEAKER_30]: And I also think that the permit should go with the petitioner and not the property.

1904
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:43,671
[SPEAKER_30]: So those are some of the concerns that I have.

1905
02:37:43,791 --> 02:37:47,993
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that with these parameters, I'd be comfortable voting for this.

1906
02:37:50,609 --> 02:37:59,491
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they're more concerned, it's probably the beginning hours more than the back hours for deliveries.

1907
02:37:59,532 --> 02:38:05,373
[SPEAKER_19]: Because most of their break and things like that are all coming in the morning versus in the afternoon.

1908
02:38:05,393 --> 02:38:07,874
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think they're concerned it's more of the.

1909
02:38:09,034 --> 02:38:13,556
[SPEAKER_19]: The front of the hour versus the back of the hour.

1910
02:38:13,576 --> 02:38:16,337
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if they want to address that.

1911
02:38:16,357 --> 02:38:24,440
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President, I don't want to speak for awakens, but just to be clear, we're happy to accommodate any of those conditions as part of the conditional special permit, with that exception.

1912
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:31,083
[SPEAKER_36]: I think, again, I don't want to speak for awakens, but I think I heard that 6 to 11 is what their request is now in terms of the length.

1913
02:38:31,103 --> 02:38:31,423
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President?

1914
02:38:35,523 --> 02:38:43,808
[SPEAKER_28]: If I could, just a point of clarification on Councilor Knights, if I may, Mr. President, Chair, to Councilor Knights' summation.

1915
02:38:46,289 --> 02:38:59,036
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Weidman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with 6 to 11 in the back of the house.

1916
02:39:01,657 --> 02:39:04,019
[SPEAKER_28]: And your suggestion was that

1917
02:39:05,232 --> 02:39:05,853
[SPEAKER_28]: remains status quo.

1918
02:39:05,873 --> 02:39:06,433
[SPEAKER_28]: That we have a review?

1919
02:39:07,274 --> 02:39:09,236
[SPEAKER_28]: That your suggestion is status quo?

1920
02:39:09,737 --> 02:39:11,098
[SPEAKER_28]: That we have a review?

1921
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:12,560
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes?

1922
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:13,181
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1923
02:39:13,641 --> 02:39:14,382
[SPEAKER_28]: At what point?

1924
02:39:14,402 --> 02:39:15,183
[SPEAKER_28]: 30 days.

1925
02:39:15,203 --> 02:39:15,823
[SPEAKER_28]: 30 days.

1926
02:39:15,844 --> 02:39:16,464
[SPEAKER_28]: 30 days.

1927
02:39:17,245 --> 02:39:23,472
[SPEAKER_28]: And that we have, that it's tied only to weapons.

1928
02:39:23,752 --> 02:39:24,193
[SPEAKER_28]: Only to weapons.

1929
02:39:24,213 --> 02:39:25,073
[SPEAKER_28]: And not to the property.

1930
02:39:25,093 --> 02:39:25,374
[SPEAKER_30]: Correct.

1931
02:39:27,445 --> 02:39:28,526
[SPEAKER_30]: Do I have those three points?

1932
02:39:28,786 --> 02:39:29,786
[SPEAKER_30]: Those three points are correct.

1933
02:39:29,826 --> 02:39:32,647
[SPEAKER_30]: Hours 6 to 12 in the front of the house, 7 to 11 in the back of the house.

1934
02:39:32,687 --> 02:39:34,808
[SPEAKER_30]: The permit goes with the petitioner and not with the property.

1935
02:39:35,209 --> 02:39:41,952
[SPEAKER_30]: And then the criteria that have been outlined and agreed upon between the two parties would be attached as an addendum to the special permit so that we know what's expected.

1936
02:39:42,032 --> 02:39:44,193
[SPEAKER_28]: And with a 30-day review, we can look at this.

1937
02:39:44,213 --> 02:39:46,554
[SPEAKER_30]: 30-day review, provided there's no problems with the deliveries.

1938
02:39:46,594 --> 02:39:55,878
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe we can look at extending the hours of deliveries and the hours of operation in the back of the house, provided that there's no problems from the deliveries during the status quo hours.

1939
02:39:56,558 --> 02:39:57,699
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1940
02:39:57,739 --> 02:39:58,339
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1941
02:39:58,359 --> 02:39:59,701
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Kern.

1942
02:39:59,981 --> 02:40:00,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1943
02:40:00,301 --> 02:40:12,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I just also like it noted on the as a condition to make sure there's no trash pickup in the back during the evening hours, the night hours from at least 11 to 6 in the morning.

1944
02:40:13,551 --> 02:40:18,315
[SPEAKER_19]: You would want to address that the developer because there are three of the four other companies

1945
02:40:19,187 --> 02:40:21,128
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, besides waiting, there's a pickup trash.

1946
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:25,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, wagons are saying that they will not have any trash pick up again.

1947
02:40:25,669 --> 02:40:27,709
[SPEAKER_19]: That doesn't address the dicks.

1948
02:40:27,889 --> 02:40:28,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Marshall's calls.

1949
02:40:28,869 --> 02:40:29,850
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not before us right now.

1950
02:40:29,890 --> 02:40:31,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

1951
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:32,970
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they will not trash pick up.

1952
02:40:33,271 --> 02:40:37,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can make that a condition to make sure that stays that way,

1953
02:40:40,477 --> 02:40:42,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And, Mr. President, if I might, back to the 6 a.m.

1954
02:40:42,839 --> 02:40:45,420
[SPEAKER_15]: hours of operation to midnight hours of operation.

1955
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:47,761
[SPEAKER_15]: We still, once again, request that.

1956
02:40:47,922 --> 02:40:51,624
[SPEAKER_15]: And then back to the deliveries, to the point of being freshness here again.

1957
02:40:51,644 --> 02:40:57,067
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to get product, fresh product there, out there before our customers come in.

1958
02:40:57,087 --> 02:41:00,849
[SPEAKER_15]: And that extra hour goes a long way to allow us to get it private.

1959
02:41:01,330 --> 02:41:04,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it was made mention that my ears heard, because I think some counsel

1960
02:41:05,452 --> 02:41:09,034
[SPEAKER_15]: folks that the residents seem to support the 6 a.m.

1961
02:41:09,314 --> 02:41:11,995
[SPEAKER_15]: They definitely did not like the evening.

1962
02:41:12,055 --> 02:41:18,958
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard that very loud and clear, not speaking for each and every one of the residents, but I thought that's what I heard, and it's on record.

1963
02:41:19,578 --> 02:41:23,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So we ask that that be modified for consideration of a 6 a.m.

1964
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,460
[SPEAKER_15]: to 11 p.m.

1965
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:26,541
[SPEAKER_15]: for the deliveries.

1966
02:41:28,842 --> 02:41:31,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, would you be willing to go to 10 p.m.? ?

1967
02:41:33,159 --> 02:41:37,942
[SPEAKER_15]: That's taking a step backwards and really being problematic for operations to put them on.

1968
02:41:37,982 --> 02:41:44,284
[SPEAKER_15]: We already have had, at least even last week, I've had conversations with our distribution transportation groups.

1969
02:41:44,745 --> 02:41:47,906
[SPEAKER_15]: They are reconsidering all of Massachusetts and all the programs.

1970
02:41:47,946 --> 02:41:54,529
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how strapped we are with the tight program of 7-Eleven.

1971
02:41:54,649 --> 02:41:56,230
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be more than problematic.

1972
02:41:57,978 --> 02:41:58,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

1973
02:41:59,659 --> 02:42:08,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, if I could, I think the compromise that the gentleman is stating from 6 to 11 is a compromise.

1974
02:42:10,187 --> 02:42:14,510
[SPEAKER_24]: As Councilor Knight mentioned about putting a 30-day review

1975
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:17,231
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to see maybe a 30-, 60-, or 90-day review.

1976
02:42:17,251 --> 02:42:18,951
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to see them all.

1977
02:42:19,691 --> 02:42:26,573
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we could take a look at it to talk to the residents of Mr. Condos to see how it's working.

1978
02:42:27,193 --> 02:42:31,614
[SPEAKER_24]: And the condition is only based on the reviews.

1979
02:42:32,354 --> 02:42:42,837
[SPEAKER_24]: So if within 30 days, sir, if we get a number of complaints about the trucking and so forth, we can withdraw the extensive

1980
02:42:45,712 --> 02:42:53,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not overstating my welcome, but any operation up and running, it takes time to get some of the bugs out of it.

1981
02:42:54,639 --> 02:42:59,222
[SPEAKER_15]: We have truckers coming into the site that haven't been here before.

1982
02:43:00,163 --> 02:43:08,969
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd ask further out than 30 days, whether it be 60 or 90, but just from a more practical up and running sort of thing, versus out of the gate.

1983
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:11,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Hydronaline is obviously a here,

1984
02:43:12,592 --> 02:43:18,553
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going at a mile a minute sort of thing, with consideration of that factor, that we're going from zero.

1985
02:43:18,573 --> 02:43:29,356
[SPEAKER_15]: And I trust you'll find from our other experiences with stores, it'll be very successful, thanks to the community, and hopefully, obviously, our customers, including the condo residents.

1986
02:43:29,956 --> 02:43:36,077
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be going 100 miles an hour, all aspects of the operations, internal and external.

1987
02:43:36,097 --> 02:43:37,838
[SPEAKER_15]: So we ask that, whether it be 60 or 90,

1988
02:43:39,918 --> 02:43:46,721
[SPEAKER_15]: 30-day, we certainly respect the ultimate goal, but that's, from a very practical point of view, a challenge.

1989
02:43:46,761 --> 02:43:52,064
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, we're not surrendering at all the recognition that we have to be in compliance.

1990
02:43:52,804 --> 02:43:53,385
[SPEAKER_30]: Cops on night.

1991
02:43:54,685 --> 02:43:58,327
[SPEAKER_30]: This brings me back to my initial point, Mr. President, when I first spoke on the topic.

1992
02:43:58,547 --> 02:43:59,848
[SPEAKER_30]: We don't know what to expect down there.

1993
02:44:00,328 --> 02:44:03,769
[SPEAKER_30]: So now we want to go from 7 to 11 to 6 to 12.

1994
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:06,931
[SPEAKER_30]: He just says, we're going to be going 100 miles an hour.

1995
02:44:06,971 --> 02:44:08,692
[SPEAKER_30]: The first 30 days, it's probably going to be bumpy.

1996
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:10,551
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't say that.

1997
02:44:10,711 --> 02:44:14,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I said it's always a challenge and be very realistic.

1998
02:44:15,174 --> 02:44:24,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think in any kind of event, any kind of exercise, that giving due process consideration of practical time is somebody's up and running.

1999
02:44:25,681 --> 02:44:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a recognition of reality.

2000
02:44:28,583 --> 02:44:36,968
[SPEAKER_15]: We are very successful in what we do, but I didn't want to have the town get a false read why anomalies without liars.

2001
02:44:37,588 --> 02:44:38,689
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my point there.

2002
02:44:38,729 --> 02:44:44,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think as you give a little beyond 30 to 60, we're not trying to duck away from any responsibilities.

2003
02:44:44,933 --> 02:44:48,035
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to fine tune our machine from day one.

2004
02:44:48,055 --> 02:44:51,417
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're not rated number one in the industry because we're

2005
02:44:52,253 --> 02:44:53,333
[SPEAKER_15]: slack at what we do.

2006
02:44:53,353 --> 02:45:01,536
[SPEAKER_15]: We are very good across the board, but I think from the practical point of implementation, that's all I'm asking for a little free board there.

2007
02:45:01,976 --> 02:45:04,176
[SPEAKER_15]: We respect everything else that goes with that.

2008
02:45:04,216 --> 02:45:05,897
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's 30 days, it's 30 days.

2009
02:45:05,937 --> 02:45:07,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, in the end, we respect it.

2010
02:45:08,378 --> 02:45:10,438
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's all I'm asking for that point of view.

2011
02:45:10,458 --> 02:45:12,519
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I might, from our point of view, if you could,

2012
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:19,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, summarizing, I think, what I've said, to make sure I'm clear, is that 6 to midnight for operations, in front.

2013
02:45:19,564 --> 02:45:21,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I like how you put that, very good.

2014
02:45:21,685 --> 02:45:23,367
[SPEAKER_15]: The back is 6 to 11.

2015
02:45:23,867 --> 02:45:28,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we ask, if not, if it's 60 or 90 would be considered.

2016
02:45:28,951 --> 02:45:31,152
[SPEAKER_15]: But certainly, if 30 is 30, that's what it is.

2017
02:45:31,173 --> 02:45:32,614
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, why don't we do both, Mr. President?

2018
02:45:32,634 --> 02:45:36,276
[SPEAKER_30]: Because the residents are going to have to live there for the 30 days, and they're going to have to put up with it.

2019
02:45:36,416 --> 02:45:37,717
[SPEAKER_30]: So why don't we bring them in at 30 and at 90?

2020
02:45:38,518 --> 02:45:44,540
[SPEAKER_30]: So we can see if the kinks have worked out, if any issues are raised within 30 days that may be attributable.

2021
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:46,260
[SPEAKER_30]: A 30-day review and a 90-day review.

2022
02:45:46,841 --> 02:45:47,461
[SPEAKER_24]: 60 and six months.

2023
02:45:47,841 --> 02:45:50,562
[SPEAKER_24]: We could do that too, but I mean... Let's do three reviews.

2024
02:45:50,582 --> 02:45:50,562
30, 60, 90.

2025
02:45:50,942 --> 02:45:52,782
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm all for it.

2026
02:45:53,343 --> 02:45:53,983
[SPEAKER_30]: All for it.

2027
02:45:54,763 --> 02:45:55,063
[SPEAKER_30]: Do it.

2028
02:45:55,103 --> 02:46:01,105
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want the flexibility to be able to address the residents' concerns and not have to wait 60 or 90 days to get the main evidence.

2029
02:46:03,258 --> 02:46:08,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, our preference is other, but certainly we respect the ultimate vote on the board.

2030
02:46:08,981 --> 02:46:10,762
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to make sure that we have this correct.

2031
02:46:10,782 --> 02:46:12,123
[SPEAKER_19]: The front of the house.

2032
02:46:12,754 --> 02:46:15,757
[SPEAKER_19]: will be able to operate from 6 to midnight, 6 to 12, correct?

2033
02:46:16,057 --> 02:46:16,277
[SPEAKER_33]: Correct.

2034
02:46:16,858 --> 02:46:21,021
[SPEAKER_19]: And the rear of the house for the deliveries will be 6 to 11.

2035
02:46:23,203 --> 02:46:30,310
[SPEAKER_19]: The review for the back of the house will be in the 30 days, another review in 60 days, and a third review in 90 days.

2036
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:32,271
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, that's the review of the back of the house.

2037
02:46:32,291 --> 02:46:32,992
[SPEAKER_15]: The back of the house.

2038
02:46:33,052 --> 02:46:33,573
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct.

2039
02:46:33,713 --> 02:46:34,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for that clarification.

2040
02:46:35,074 --> 02:46:35,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Back of the house.

2041
02:46:35,554 --> 02:46:36,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, if I could point out,

2042
02:46:38,837 --> 02:46:43,618
[SPEAKER_28]: a special permit solely to the company of weapons, not to the property.

2043
02:46:44,239 --> 02:46:44,679
[SPEAKER_27]: That's correct.

2044
02:46:45,159 --> 02:46:54,941
[SPEAKER_27]: And, like I said... And the trash, President Langelkorn, without any trash... Maybe the term we should use is no loading or unloading.

2045
02:46:54,961 --> 02:46:57,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there'll be no trash pickup during those hours.

2046
02:46:57,302 --> 02:47:03,604
[SPEAKER_19]: This is 30 days from when they start the... This will be 30 days from when the store opens, correct?

2047
02:47:03,744 --> 02:47:03,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

2048
02:47:04,524 --> 02:47:15,232
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, also a review of any potential mitigation regarding the exhaust, which the gentleman already said that they would review the exhaust on top of the building.

2049
02:47:15,592 --> 02:47:24,779
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as guidelines tonight, I mean, we can start with specifications, show that it's a state-of-the-art, and we can provide that to the council through engineering.

2050
02:47:24,959 --> 02:47:26,100
[SPEAKER_15]: What's your preference on that?

2051
02:47:27,501 --> 02:47:31,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm in particular mitigation regarding noise mitigation.

2052
02:47:32,464 --> 02:47:33,165
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm saying.

2053
02:47:33,265 --> 02:47:35,126
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure the unit is state of the art.

2054
02:47:35,146 --> 02:47:36,907
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure it's up to code.

2055
02:47:37,647 --> 02:47:37,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

2056
02:47:37,947 --> 02:47:40,929
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the point is, what is triggering the mitigation?

2057
02:47:41,009 --> 02:47:42,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Because what's the threshold?

2058
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:43,491
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's what I'm doing.

2059
02:47:43,511 --> 02:47:46,252
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll comply with ordinance of the city.

2060
02:47:47,013 --> 02:47:51,055
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know if it's how specific it is, quite frankly, because we haven't been asked to review that.

2061
02:47:51,555 --> 02:47:52,936
[SPEAKER_15]: But we'll take a look at that.

2062
02:47:53,116 --> 02:47:55,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I would say the mitigation is regarding any additional steps

2063
02:47:56,934 --> 02:48:13,495
[SPEAKER_24]: And our building department would be aware of this, like we did on Riverside Ave, which is right around the corner from your current establishment, when we had a few food establishments go in that had a similar, actually much smaller, exhaust, and they were able to put some type of barrier.

2064
02:48:14,275 --> 02:48:24,439
[SPEAKER_24]: around the particular system, the system was state-of-the-art, it was very efficient, but this barrier helped with alleviating some of the noise potential.

2065
02:48:24,859 --> 02:48:26,860
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask that that be reviewed.

2066
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:31,782
[SPEAKER_15]: We certainly will review it, yes, and we'll present that to the Council through them, however you prefer.

2067
02:48:31,862 --> 02:48:32,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2068
02:48:33,263 --> 02:48:38,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Move approval on the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by

2069
02:48:41,202 --> 02:48:45,183
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion will be the front of the House 6 to 12.

2070
02:48:46,504 --> 02:48:55,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Back of the House 6 to 11 with a review of the 6090 days to be no rubbish pick up and there will be a review of also of the ventilation.

2071
02:48:55,726 --> 02:48:57,487
[SPEAKER_19]: This is correct.

2072
02:48:57,567 --> 02:49:00,267
[SPEAKER_25]: I have everything in the system.

2073
02:49:00,648 --> 02:49:03,148
[SPEAKER_19]: And the president is restricted to wagons only.

2074
02:49:03,168 --> 02:49:07,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, very good.

2075
02:49:07,329 --> 02:49:07,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything.

2076
02:49:10,063 --> 02:49:12,404

[SPEAKER_19]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2092
02:49:32,682 --> 02:49:33,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

2093
02:49:33,303 --> 02:49:38,328
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could make one request under legal developments, we're holding Wegmans to this high standard.

2094
02:49:39,549 --> 02:49:50,881
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope that you'll do the same with your other five stores that are coming in and make sure that they comply to the same standards that we're holding Wegmans to.

2095
02:49:50,901 --> 02:49:51,221
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2096
02:49:51,461 --> 02:49:53,803
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I might, in closing, number one and two,

2098
02:50:16,327 --> 02:50:19,309
[SPEAKER_15]: and number one in supermarkets in the nation, so.

2099
02:50:19,769 --> 02:50:20,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2100
02:50:20,970 --> 02:50:24,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular business.

2104
02:50:32,898 --> 02:50:35,860
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, can I move to have the record reflect that I vote in favor of that last paper, please?

2105
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:42,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, if you could move to reflect the record, show that Councilor Layton is in favor of this motion.

2106
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:46,133
[SPEAKER_19]: and we'll take a five minute recess.

2107
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:19,741
All right.

2108
02:51:58,360 --> 02:51:58,580
Okay.

2109
02:52:30,039 --> 02:52:30,340
Okay.

2110
02:53:15,583 --> 02:53:16,647
I will.

2111
02:53:16,808 --> 02:53:17,229
Thank you.

2112
02:53:39,812 --> 02:53:40,072
th th

2113

th th

2115
02:55:31,373 --> 02:55:32,193
have a good night.

2116
02:56:06,539 --> 02:56:09,382
I know I was thinking the same thing.

2117
02:56:09,442 --> 02:56:11,965
I was thinking that.

2118
02:56:38,536 --> 02:56:39,800
This is what it sounds like.

2119
02:57:09,665 --> 02:57:10,185
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't see it.

2120
02:57:10,225 --> 02:57:10,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't see it.

2121
02:57:36,363 --> 02:57:38,105
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually I'm not a lawyer.

2122
02:57:38,205 --> 02:57:39,867
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm a second person.

2123
02:57:40,047 --> 02:57:42,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you wear a blue suit and you think, man, this is a real attorney.

2124
02:57:42,629 --> 02:57:42,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2125
02:57:42,970 --> 02:57:43,650
[SPEAKER_15]: First year.

2126
02:57:43,670 --> 02:57:44,832
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all right.

2127
02:57:44,912 --> 02:57:45,512
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all right.

2128
02:57:45,572 --> 02:57:46,473
[SPEAKER_15]: First year or 100 year.

2129
02:57:46,513 --> 02:57:47,935
[SPEAKER_30]: Where did you go to school?

2130
02:57:48,255 --> 02:57:49,156
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to Georgetown.

2131
02:57:49,316 --> 02:57:49,636
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, nice.

2132
02:57:49,877 --> 02:57:50,898
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm from the area, so.

2133
02:57:50,918 --> 02:57:51,558
[SPEAKER_30]: Where are you from?

2134
02:57:51,778 --> 02:57:52,759
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm from Lowell.

2135
02:57:52,779 --> 02:57:52,920
[SPEAKER_30]: Lowell?

2136
02:57:53,100 --> 02:57:53,320
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

2137
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:55,402
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, I'm from Northwest.

2138
02:57:55,422 --> 02:57:55,923
[SPEAKER_30]: God, no Keith?

2139
02:57:57,025 --> 02:57:58,205
[SPEAKER_30]: That's what I was going to think was right.

2140
02:57:58,245 --> 02:57:59,266
[SPEAKER_31]: That's not fair.

2141
02:57:59,306 --> 02:58:00,526
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you go to the library?

2142
02:58:00,966 --> 02:58:01,386
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I don't.

2143
02:58:01,446 --> 02:58:02,867
[SPEAKER_30]: I used to go to the library.

2144
02:58:02,927 --> 02:58:03,367
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, really?

2145
02:58:03,447 --> 02:58:04,187
[SPEAKER_30]: Are you from there?

2146
02:58:04,207 --> 02:58:06,047
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I'm from Medford, obviously.

2147
02:58:06,168 --> 02:58:19,471
[SPEAKER_30]: But no, I used to represent the waste water treatment plant and school custodians, the libraries, the school clerks, the cafeteria workers.

2148
02:58:19,851 --> 02:58:20,751
[SPEAKER_30]: You'd think it has been gone.

2149
02:58:20,812 --> 02:58:22,152
[SPEAKER_30]: It sounds like it's actually been abandoned.

2150
02:58:23,153 --> 02:58:24,014
[SPEAKER_30]: 10% of the population.

2151
02:58:24,154 --> 02:58:24,675
[SPEAKER_30]: You're busy, 90% of them.

2152
02:58:24,715 --> 02:58:25,736
[SPEAKER_30]: You see that in these people?

2153
02:58:25,956 --> 02:58:26,177
Yeah.

2154
02:58:26,277 --> 02:58:26,937
[SPEAKER_30]: I went there.

2155
02:58:41,107 --> 02:58:41,587
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, you did?

2156
02:58:41,767 --> 02:58:42,228
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2157
02:58:42,488 --> 02:58:42,548
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

2158
02:58:42,588 --> 02:58:47,371
[SPEAKER_30]: So Mike Javis was the Cambridge Region Latin basketball coach.

2159
02:58:47,672 --> 02:58:48,752
[SPEAKER_30]: Patrick Ewing, you know what I mean?

2160
02:58:48,772 --> 02:58:50,374
[SPEAKER_30]: They ended up down there in Georgetown.

2161
02:58:50,554 --> 02:58:51,534
[SPEAKER_30]: I chose Washington, rather.

2162
02:58:51,594 --> 02:58:54,136
[SPEAKER_30]: My father and Mike played together in college at Northeastern.

2163
02:58:54,156 --> 02:58:54,937
[SPEAKER_30]: They played against each other.

2164
02:58:54,957 --> 02:58:56,098
[SPEAKER_30]: My father played at Summerline.

2165
02:58:56,138 --> 02:58:57,198
[SPEAKER_30]: Mike played at Cambridge Island.

2166
02:58:57,719 --> 02:58:59,200
[SPEAKER_30]: And then my father was a coach.

2167
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:01,021
[SPEAKER_30]: My father played at Northeastern.

2168
02:59:01,081 --> 02:59:02,522
[SPEAKER_30]: And Javis played at Northeastern.

2169
02:59:02,542 --> 02:59:04,223
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, they played together after college.

2170
02:59:04,504 --> 02:59:05,384
[SPEAKER_30]: And my father graduated.

2171
02:59:05,404 --> 02:59:05,905
[SPEAKER_30]: He graduated.

2172
02:59:05,925 --> 02:59:06,905
[SPEAKER_30]: He went to Cambridge Region Latin.

2173
02:59:06,925 --> 02:59:07,826
[SPEAKER_30]: My father went to Summerlin.

2174
02:59:08,146 --> 02:59:09,007
[SPEAKER_30]: He coached Patrick Ewing.

2175
02:59:09,347 --> 02:59:10,548
[SPEAKER_30]: when he got the college job.

2176
02:59:10,748 --> 02:59:11,488
[SPEAKER_30]: He's a lawyer?

2177
02:59:40,005 --> 02:59:40,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.

2178
02:59:40,986 --> 02:59:41,306
[SPEAKER_31]: Right.

2179
02:59:41,426 --> 02:59:42,187
[SPEAKER_31]: So with them all?

2180
02:59:42,207 --> 02:59:42,667
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I don't.

2181
02:59:42,687 --> 02:59:43,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I live in Dorchester.

2182
02:59:43,408 --> 02:59:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Dorchester?

2183
02:59:43,988 --> 02:59:44,228
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2184
02:59:44,248 --> 02:59:44,729
[SPEAKER_31]: Lowell Hills?

2185
02:59:44,749 --> 02:59:47,331
[SPEAKER_30]: No, no, I live between Staten Fields.

2186
02:59:47,411 --> 02:59:47,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

2187
02:59:48,271 --> 02:59:49,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you go to the B&G?

2188
02:59:50,493 --> 02:59:51,834
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you go to the B&G?

2189
02:59:51,914 --> 02:59:53,876
[SPEAKER_30]: I literally go to the B&G all the time.

2190
02:59:53,976 --> 02:59:54,416
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why.

2191
02:59:54,456 --> 02:59:55,337
[SPEAKER_30]: Are you serious?

2192
02:59:55,357 --> 02:59:55,997
[SPEAKER_30]: Absolutely.

2193
02:59:56,057 --> 02:59:58,159
[SPEAKER_30]: I literally go to the B&G all the time.

2194
02:59:58,279 --> 03:00:03,183
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't mean to make myself sound like I'm too far off, but I go to the B&G all the time.

2195
03:00:03,283 --> 03:00:05,344
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I go to some corrections offices.

2196
03:00:05,364 --> 03:00:08,567
[SPEAKER_30]: You guys always talk to me all the time.

[SPEAKER_28]: I said Chairman Marks give a discourse on this matter.

2203
03:00:57,227 --> 03:00:58,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's giving a discourse on this matter?

2204
03:00:59,088 --> 03:00:59,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Chairman Marks.

2205
03:01:01,017 --> 03:01:08,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Vice President, would you like to report on your subcommittee on business, economic, development, and science meeting of September 6th, 2017?

2206
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:11,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

2207
03:01:11,062 --> 03:01:15,564
[SPEAKER_24]: The subcommittee on business, economic, development, and science met September 6th.

2208

[SPEAKER_24]: Attendees at the meeting was myself, Councilor Scarpelli, Paul Mulkey, the Billing Commissioner, John Mavuso, Code Enforcement, Pastor Ferrier,

2209
03:01:30,501 --> 03:01:31,782
[SPEAKER_24]: was out in the audience.

2210
03:01:34,423 --> 03:01:45,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Former President Robert Mayocko was president, and George, Rick Sackle was also president at the meeting, Mr. President.

2211
03:01:46,109 --> 03:01:54,553
[SPEAKER_24]: The request that we had was for a sign, a denial, for the evangelical

2212
03:01:56,274 --> 03:01:58,535
[SPEAKER_24]: Haitian Church 400 High Street.

2213
03:01:59,535 --> 03:02:01,656
[SPEAKER_24]: The sign exceeded allowable size.

2214
03:02:02,556 --> 03:02:14,680
[SPEAKER_24]: We met in subcommittee to discuss the request of illumination, which we recommend to this full council that the sign be turned off by 11 p.m.

2215
03:02:15,601 --> 03:02:19,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Also the request for a message board on the sign.

2216
03:02:21,042 --> 03:02:24,984
[SPEAKER_24]: We requested that it only be used for church

2217
03:02:25,864 --> 03:02:30,687
[SPEAKER_24]: and educational notices, which we presented to the full council tonight.

2218
03:02:31,368 --> 03:02:41,495
[SPEAKER_24]: And the frequency of the changing of the sign, which this council has debated over years, and the standard pretty much is four times per hour.

2219
03:02:41,975 --> 03:02:46,918
[SPEAKER_24]: So we allow a 15-minute frequency of change for the signage.

2220
03:02:47,719 --> 03:02:54,023
[SPEAKER_24]: And we ask that this paper be reported out favorably to the full council, Mr. President.

2221
03:02:54,828 --> 03:02:55,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilman Scarpelli.

2222
03:02:55,769 --> 03:02:57,850
[SPEAKER_16]: With the focus on just church business.

2223
03:02:59,451 --> 03:03:00,051
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if I missed it.

2224
03:03:00,071 --> 03:03:02,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Church and educational notice of the church business question.

2225
03:03:02,292 --> 03:03:02,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2226
03:03:04,674 --> 03:03:11,518
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by President Box that this paper be re- You have a deadline?

2227
03:03:12,608 --> 03:03:14,709
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to take up the other one?

2228
03:03:15,009 --> 03:03:18,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 17-573 for Global Healthcare Services, Mr. President.

2229
03:03:19,890 --> 03:03:24,492
[SPEAKER_24]: This particular petitioner did not show up at the meeting, Mr. President.

2230
03:03:25,032 --> 03:03:31,574
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the time, there was a motion during a subcommittee meeting that it would be received and placed on file.

2231
03:03:32,274 --> 03:03:33,754
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be the motion for paper 17-573.

2232
03:03:33,874 --> 03:03:35,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion that the committee report

2233

2234
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:47,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2235
03:03:49,811 --> 03:03:51,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Ready?

2236
03:03:51,051 --> 03:03:51,231
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

2237
03:03:51,271 --> 03:03:52,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get back to 17.

2238
03:03:52,392 --> 03:03:58,314
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, we're under suspension.

2239
03:03:58,414 --> 03:04:01,435
[SPEAKER_30]: Can we take paper 17-606 off the table?

2240
03:04:01,455 --> 03:04:04,295
[SPEAKER_30]: 17-606.

2241
03:04:04,535 --> 03:04:08,717
[SPEAKER_30]: The recommendation for the sign for the Evangelical Occasion Church at 400 High Street.

2242
03:04:10,651 --> 03:04:14,053
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take paper 17-606 off the table.

2243
03:04:14,133 --> 03:04:17,516
[SPEAKER_19]: Moved and seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

2244
03:04:17,576 --> 03:04:18,176
[SPEAKER_19]: All in favor?

2245
03:04:18,796 --> 03:04:21,699
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

2246
03:04:21,739 --> 03:04:26,222
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, I think Councilor Marks gave an excellent synopsis of what occurred at the subcommittee meeting.

2247
03:04:26,282 --> 03:04:28,844
[SPEAKER_30]: I thank him and the other members of the subcommittee for their work.

2248
03:04:29,784 --> 03:04:34,588
[SPEAKER_30]: Personally, I think this is a good way to make some concessions to a situation that had some concerns.

2249
03:04:35,566 --> 03:04:43,229
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd just like to add that the permit expired with the petitioner, if my council colleagues would indulge me.

2250
03:04:43,549 --> 03:04:47,770
[SPEAKER_30]: And also, we put a 90-day review on it, and I'd have no problem supporting this this evening, Mr. President.

2251
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:55,512
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think I'd have a problem supporting it either way, but I have gotten some feedback from some abutters and residents in the neighborhood that did have some concern about the illumination and would like to see a review.

2252
03:04:58,133 --> 03:05:00,154
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Nate,

2253
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:09,730
[SPEAKER_24]: second by Councilor Mr. President, if I could Mr. Vice President, I think those are excellent recommendations made by Council at night.

2254
03:05:10,571 --> 03:05:15,517
[SPEAKER_24]: The 90 day reviewers, I think, is appropriate where this sign is illuminated.

2255
03:05:15,537 --> 03:05:15,577
[SPEAKER_24]: Um,

2256
03:05:17,311 --> 03:05:31,562
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want people in the viewing audience to realize there at one point there was two signs in front of the church, one off to the right and the main sign which we're dealing with, which is off to the left.

2257
03:05:32,463 --> 03:05:38,607
[SPEAKER_24]: And that sign actually faces perpendicular to High Street.

2258
03:05:39,068 --> 03:05:41,089
[SPEAKER_24]: So it doesn't face High Street.

2259
03:05:42,610 --> 03:05:44,492
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want people to realize that.

2260
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:52,268
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think that's an excellent recommendation with the permit to expire with this petitioner and the 90-day review.

2261
03:05:52,769 --> 03:05:53,970
[SPEAKER_24]: I would support that, Mr. President.

2262
03:05:55,532 --> 03:05:56,774
[SPEAKER_30]: Move approval as amended, Mr. President.

2263
03:05:57,294 --> 03:06:02,922
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on the motion by Councilor Naito, move the committee report as amended.

2264
03:06:05,185 --> 03:06:06,086
[SPEAKER_30]: Committee report has been adopted.

2265
03:06:06,126 --> 03:06:07,528
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to move the paper out favorably.

2266
03:06:07,548 --> 03:06:13,534
[SPEAKER_30]: 17-606 approval for a special permit for the sign of variance with both following criteria of the contingencies.

2267
03:06:13,795 --> 03:06:18,620
[SPEAKER_30]: The AB&C that was established at the subcommittee, a 90-day review and the permit with the petitioner.

2268
03:06:21,457 --> 03:06:24,940
[SPEAKER_19]: 17606 is not on the table yet, Councilor Knight.

2269
03:06:25,280 --> 03:06:26,722
[SPEAKER_30]: We just adopted the committee report.

2270
03:06:26,742 --> 03:06:27,603
[SPEAKER_24]: He asked to take it off.

2271
03:06:27,883 --> 03:06:35,050
[SPEAKER_30]: We adopted the committee report and we took the paper up for the pastor and then we adopted the paper with those five restrictions.

2272
03:06:36,391 --> 03:06:38,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfinished business, right?

2273
03:06:43,204 --> 03:06:45,105
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, the committee report came out.

2274
03:06:45,685 --> 03:06:48,906
[SPEAKER_30]: If I may, point of parliamentary procedure, Mr. President.

2275
03:06:49,666 --> 03:06:51,247
[SPEAKER_30]: The committee report was reported out favorably.

2276
03:06:51,287 --> 03:06:51,747
[SPEAKER_30]: That's paper 17651.

2277
03:06:51,787 --> 03:06:51,887
[SPEAKER_30]: Right.

2278
03:06:52,167 --> 03:06:53,307
[SPEAKER_30]: Paper 17651 contained two papers, 17606 and 17573.

2279
03:06:53,608 --> 03:06:55,008
[SPEAKER_30]: The petition 17606 is the Evangelical Church.

2280
03:06:55,028 --> 03:06:57,069
[SPEAKER_30]: But its entirety is the committee report.

2281
03:06:57,089 --> 03:06:57,149
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

2282
03:06:57,169 --> 03:06:58,429
[SPEAKER_30]: Which you're adopting those provisions.

2283
03:07:09,733 --> 03:07:14,435
[SPEAKER_25]: What you're doing is you're actually amending the committee report for a 90-day review.

2284
03:07:14,575 --> 03:07:16,395
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what you're doing.

2285
03:07:16,415 --> 03:07:19,516
[SPEAKER_30]: 90-day review and elimination.

2286
03:07:19,556 --> 03:07:20,096
[SPEAKER_30]: Good point.

2287
03:07:20,156 --> 03:07:20,977
[SPEAKER_30]: Good point.

2288
03:07:21,957 --> 03:07:24,898
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended.

2289
03:07:25,338 --> 03:07:26,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

2290
03:07:26,218 --> 03:07:29,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote has been requested by Vice President Mox.

2291
03:07:34,921 --> 03:07:35,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Dello Russo.

2292
03:07:36,061 --> 03:07:36,161
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2293
03:07:37,042 --> 03:07:37,762
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco.

2294
03:07:37,922 --> 03:07:38,102
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2295
03:07:39,008 --> 03:07:39,108
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2296
03:07:39,168 --> 03:07:39,288
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2297
03:07:39,328 --> 03:07:39,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2298
03:07:40,309 --> 03:07:40,409
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

2299
03:07:40,429 --> 03:07:41,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Six of the affirmative.

2300
03:07:41,871 --> 03:07:43,932
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the negative motion passes.

2301
03:07:52,605 --> 03:07:57,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

2302
03:07:57,286 --> 03:08:08,809
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-634, offered by President Caraviello and Councilor Layton, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of William Bill Quigley on his recent passing.

2303
03:08:08,869 --> 03:08:13,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Bill was a lifelong Medford resident and Navy veteran who served his country in World War II.

2304
03:08:14,230 --> 03:08:17,231
[SPEAKER_19]: His presence in our community will be sorely missed.

2305
03:08:18,891 --> 03:08:22,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally have known the Quigley family and Bill for many, many years,

2306
03:08:23,893 --> 03:08:29,215
[SPEAKER_19]: He passed very quickly, and we had a good man, good family man.

2307
03:08:29,235 --> 03:08:29,935
[SPEAKER_19]: He will be missed.

2308
03:08:30,335 --> 03:08:30,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

2309
03:08:31,376 --> 03:08:35,898
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd just like to take a moment to offer my condolences to the Quigley family.

2310
03:08:35,918 --> 03:08:37,318
[SPEAKER_30]: Bill was a great guy.

2311
03:08:37,338 --> 03:08:43,421
[SPEAKER_30]: You'd always see him down at Puppers wearing his hat and showing that he was a United States veteran proudly.

2312
03:08:43,781 --> 03:08:45,882
[SPEAKER_30]: He and his sons would always go down for dinner.

2313
03:08:45,922 --> 03:08:49,083
[SPEAKER_30]: His grandson, Michael, and I were very good friends in high school, played lacrosse together.

2314
03:08:49,543 --> 03:08:50,744
[SPEAKER_30]: It's very sad to see him go.

2315
03:08:50,764 --> 03:08:55,167
[SPEAKER_30]: He was a good man, a good friend, and he's going to be sorely missed in this community because he was somebody that gave back.

2316
03:08:55,767 --> 03:08:58,289
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

2317
03:08:58,309 --> 03:09:02,071
[SPEAKER_30]: I ask my council colleagues to join us in offering our condolences to the Quigley family.

2318
03:09:24,864 --> 03:09:41,871
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-636, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the tree warden, Aggie Tudin, attend the next city council meeting to explain the fungus that has affected hundreds of trees in Medford and offer a solution to what can be done to prevent this from happening again.

2319
03:09:41,891 --> 03:09:42,711
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Ms.

2320
03:09:42,731 --> 03:09:50,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Tudin was here earlier, but the meeting went on and she did have some explanations and she will be happy to come next week to offer

2321
03:09:53,725 --> 03:09:58,927
[SPEAKER_19]: and explain what has happened to the trees and what can be done to hopefully stop this from happening again.

2322
03:09:58,947 --> 03:10:05,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor- She'll be coming next week to speak.

2323
03:10:05,670 --> 03:10:07,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to leave this on this table?

2324
03:10:07,971 --> 03:10:08,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2325
03:10:08,972 --> 03:10:12,433
[SPEAKER_19]: The resolution is to ask her to come next week.

2326
03:10:12,513 --> 03:10:13,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor McCurran.

2327
03:10:13,914 --> 03:10:14,534
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2328
03:10:15,674 --> 03:10:15,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2329
03:10:16,154 --> 03:10:16,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2330
03:10:18,112 --> 03:10:29,697
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-637, I'll invite Vice President Mox and Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the administration provide an update to the Medford City Council with regards to the Hagen Center and what current and the future plans are.

2331
03:10:30,117 --> 03:10:30,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Mox.

2332
03:10:30,897 --> 03:10:33,178
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll yield to my colleague.

2333
03:10:33,198 --> 03:10:34,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2334
03:10:34,839 --> 03:10:35,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be brief.

2335
03:10:35,439 --> 03:10:37,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2336
03:10:37,580 --> 03:10:40,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the last time Council Member Mox and I brought this up

2337
03:10:41,355 --> 03:10:48,324
[SPEAKER_07]: the request of a number of residents that live in the area and just inquiring what's going on with the Hegner Center was in June.

2338
03:10:49,045 --> 03:10:51,367
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked just for an update from the administration.

2339
03:10:51,388 --> 03:10:55,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe we got a detailed update that we were expecting.

2340
03:10:55,132 --> 03:10:58,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that I did reach out to the chief of police at the time, and there was

2341
03:10:59,673 --> 03:11:02,475
[SPEAKER_07]: allowable use by the police department in that area.

2342
03:11:02,495 --> 03:11:11,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was some dog training going on, and it almost seemed like that was going to be just temporary until a plan is put in place for the Heckner Center.

2343
03:11:12,162 --> 03:11:17,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The city did acquire it, and we as a council just want to know what is the plan.

2344
03:11:18,707 --> 03:11:19,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been mentioned that

2345
03:11:20,575 --> 03:11:22,256
[SPEAKER_07]: to have it as a possible art center?

2346
03:11:22,276 --> 03:11:24,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Are multiple uses for the city?

2347
03:11:25,057 --> 03:11:26,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to redevelop it?

2348
03:11:26,177 --> 03:11:27,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we afford to redevelop it?

2349
03:11:27,878 --> 03:11:29,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But are we going to redevelop it?

2350
03:11:29,499 --> 03:11:30,539
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the plan?

2351
03:11:32,240 --> 03:11:32,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple question.

2352
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:34,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we just get an update on the Heckner Center?

2353
03:11:35,101 --> 03:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_07]: There are neighbors that live in the area.

2354
03:11:36,842 --> 03:11:41,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it has been cleaned up by the DPW, so the neighbors are very thankful for that.

2355
03:11:41,864 --> 03:11:45,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But an ultimate plan, what is our yearly plan for this?

2356
03:11:45,565 --> 03:11:46,586
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the five-year goal?

2357
03:11:46,666 --> 03:11:48,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have goals for this Heckner Center?

2358
03:11:49,447 --> 03:11:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it included in the capital plan?

2359
03:11:51,008 --> 03:11:55,430
[SPEAKER_07]: A number of questions that just need to be answered for us and for the residents.

2360
03:11:55,790 --> 03:11:56,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2361
03:11:56,191 --> 03:11:56,531
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2362
03:11:56,971 --> 03:11:57,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Mox.

2363
03:11:58,292 --> 03:11:59,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2364
03:11:59,112 --> 03:12:03,194
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for co-sponsoring this resolution.

2365
03:12:03,954 --> 03:12:08,577
[SPEAKER_24]: As the Council mentioned, there's been a lot of activity over the last several months there.

2366
03:12:09,217 --> 03:12:23,749
[SPEAKER_24]: and residents in the area are concerned what's going on, and naturally with the track record we have as a community on upkeeping our facilities, they're concerned that this building not fall into disarray.

2367
03:12:24,349 --> 03:12:27,410
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that is why we offer this tonight, Mr. President.

2368
03:12:27,790 --> 03:12:29,991
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a number of needs in this community.

2369
03:12:30,732 --> 03:12:38,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scott Peli will tell you, with the new addition of a recreation department, this may be a great location for Method Recreation.

2370
03:12:39,575 --> 03:12:43,337
[SPEAKER_24]: We currently don't have a home for Method Arts or Method Art Council.

2371
03:12:43,797 --> 03:12:45,878
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be a great location, Mr. President.

2372
03:12:46,679 --> 03:12:47,859
[SPEAKER_24]: in that area.

2373
03:12:48,500 --> 03:13:01,831
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that it was only roughly about a year, year and a half ago when the city administration sent a paper to this council requesting that we sell off the building.

2374
03:13:02,772 --> 03:13:05,414
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was this council that stood up and said, Wait a minute.

2375
03:13:06,074 --> 03:13:08,396
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, we leased this building out for $1.

2376
03:13:09,823 --> 03:13:20,670
[SPEAKER_24]: And the stipulation was if it was no longer gonna be used for the intended purpose, which was to assist people with disability, that it would revert back to the city.

2377
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:33,178
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was this council that halted the process, and thanks to City Solicitor Mark Rumley, we were able to get control back of the building, which in my opinion was a step in the right direction.

2378
03:13:33,599 --> 03:13:35,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we have to figure out what we're gonna do with the building.

2379
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:38,402
[SPEAKER_24]: So I support this resolution wholeheartedly,

2380
03:13:38,862 --> 03:13:40,143
[SPEAKER_24]: and hope we can get an answer on this.

2381
03:14:04,112 --> 03:14:04,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2382
03:14:05,412 --> 03:14:06,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2383
03:14:06,913 --> 03:14:07,133
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2384
03:14:07,833 --> 03:14:08,533
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2385
03:14:08,693 --> 03:14:09,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2386
03:14:09,033 --> 03:14:10,133
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2387
03:14:10,213 --> 03:14:10,473
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2388
03:14:10,493 --> 03:14:11,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2389
03:14:11,353 --> 03:14:11,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2390
03:14:12,174 --> 03:14:12,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2391
03:14:12,974 --> 03:14:13,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven affirmative.

2392
03:14:14,014 --> 03:14:16,714
[SPEAKER_19]: None of the negative motion passes.

2393
03:14:16,734 --> 03:14:18,415
[SPEAKER_19]: 17 6 3 9 offered by council night.

2394
03:14:18,855 --> 03:14:31,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas the method square draft master plan recommends establishment of a metric square historic district in whereas the sea of method has adopted general laws chapter 40 section 18 to enable the establishment

2395
03:14:32,582 --> 03:14:34,524
[SPEAKER_19]: of the Medford Historic District Commission.

2396
03:14:34,544 --> 03:14:50,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, whereas pursuant to City of Medford Code of Ordinances 48-546, the Medford Historic Commission shall propose from time to time, as the Mayor deems appropriate, the creation of additional historic districts or changes to the existing

2397
03:14:51,142 --> 03:14:51,983
[SPEAKER_19]: historic districts.

2398
03:14:52,363 --> 03:15:06,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Method Historic District Commission examined the recommendations outlined in the Method Square Draft Master Plan and provide the Council of the Indian Administration with an analysis on implementation.

2399
03:15:06,976 --> 03:15:07,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

2400
03:15:08,117 --> 03:15:11,460
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

2401
03:15:12,361 --> 03:15:15,384
[SPEAKER_30]: Ultimately, we spend lots and lots of money in this community on plans.

2402
03:15:16,064 --> 03:15:18,086
[SPEAKER_30]: And we get plans and reports back, but

2403
03:15:18,671 --> 03:15:21,373
[SPEAKER_30]: One thing that I think we're not so strong at is implementation.

2404
03:15:21,953 --> 03:15:26,676
[SPEAKER_30]: And this right here, Mr. President, is a measure that was outlined in the Medford Square Draft Master Plan.

2405
03:15:27,677 --> 03:15:31,799
[SPEAKER_30]: And it calls for the establishment of Medford Square Historic District.

2406
03:15:32,379 --> 03:15:38,623
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that this is going to be a catalyst, Mr. President, in generating some interest in foot traffic down through Medford Square.

2407
03:15:38,663 --> 03:15:42,226
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's going to be something that's going to help us revitalize that

2408
03:15:44,646 --> 03:15:48,868
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't wanna say blighted business district, but business district in need of some resuscitation.

2409
03:15:49,628 --> 03:16:06,115
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm asking my council colleagues to support the resolution asking for the Medford Historic District Commission to exercise their power established under the general laws and by city ordinance to provide the mayor with an analysis on the implementation thereof so that it can come to the council and then we can move forward on the matter.

2410
03:16:07,055 --> 03:16:28,603
[SPEAKER_30]: In looking at this, Mr. President, and thinking about the situation in Medford Square and the status of the certain requests that come before this council, I also want to put forth a B paper asking that the Medford City Council place a moratorium on sign variances in the proposed Medford Square Historic District until the analysis is completed by the Medford Historic District Commission.

2411
03:16:28,623 --> 03:16:33,325
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my colleagues to support the A paper and the B paper moving forward.

2412
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may.

2413
03:16:43,320 --> 03:16:44,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2414
03:16:44,621 --> 03:16:48,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I think on the main motion, I think this is definitely a great resolve by Councilor Knight.

2415
03:16:48,961 --> 03:16:56,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that we get input from the Historic District Commission on which areas they believe should be designated historic.

2416
03:16:57,463 --> 03:17:05,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that there's not obviously many changes and definitely not eliminations to any of our current historic districts.

2417
03:17:05,645 --> 03:17:11,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's the premise of the resolution, although I did get a concerned citizen calling me about that.

2418
03:17:12,146 --> 03:17:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I think it's a good resolve.

2419
03:17:13,708 --> 03:17:17,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a moratorium is something that probably just needs a little bit more discussion.

2420
03:17:17,512 --> 03:17:26,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a late hour, and I just would like to lay that B paper laid on the table for a week so we can wrap our minds around it.

2421
03:17:27,988 --> 03:17:48,164
[SPEAKER_30]: And if I may, Mr. President, the reason that I bring the B paper forward is because if we're going to take a serious look at preserving the historic character of Medford Square and the sub squares that have been identified in the master plan, then I think one thing that we need to do is make sure that we have some continuity and some compliance with our locally established ordinance.

2422
03:17:48,184 --> 03:17:49,445
[SPEAKER_30]: We've been giving a lot of variances.

2423
03:17:49,786 --> 03:17:51,307
[SPEAKER_30]: The property, 5 High Street, comes to mind.

2424
03:17:51,967 --> 03:17:54,569
[SPEAKER_30]: We've had how many requests for sign variances at that one property?

2425
03:17:54,609 --> 03:17:56,630
[SPEAKER_30]: That's one of the keystone buildings in our square.

2426
03:17:57,091 --> 03:18:09,700
[SPEAKER_30]: And the more times we issue permits for non-conforming use of signs, the less and less character we have down there, the less and less historic feel that we have down there, Mr. President.

2427
03:18:09,720 --> 03:18:11,881
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that it is time to take a look at that.

2428
03:18:11,921 --> 03:18:15,784
[SPEAKER_30]: I certainly have no problem with Councilor Longo's recommendation that we deal with it at a later time.

2429
03:18:16,264 --> 03:18:17,825
[SPEAKER_30]: However, it's something that I think is very important.

2430
03:18:17,885 --> 03:18:20,306
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's very important to the revitalization of our square.

2431
03:18:20,326 --> 03:18:23,427
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's very important to the aesthetic feel of our square.

2432
03:18:23,467 --> 03:18:33,151
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's very important to us preserving our historic landmarks in the square and those items that people recognize from afar and have recognized from afar for many a year.

2433
03:18:33,731 --> 03:18:36,692
[SPEAKER_30]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the B paper.

2434
03:18:36,712 --> 03:18:38,573
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll reintroduce that paper at a later date.

2435
03:18:38,593 --> 03:18:40,073
[SPEAKER_30]: And I ask to move for approval on the A paper.

2436
03:18:40,694 --> 03:18:43,255
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by

2437
03:18:44,275 --> 03:18:46,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Domenico Falco.

2438
03:18:47,096 --> 03:18:47,877
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2439
03:18:48,017 --> 03:18:48,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2440
03:18:48,737 --> 03:18:51,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2441
03:18:51,198 --> 03:18:53,279
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-640 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2442
03:18:53,740 --> 03:18:59,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to the status of hiring of a traffic engineer.

2443
03:18:59,842 --> 03:19:00,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2444
03:19:01,303 --> 03:19:02,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2445
03:19:02,924 --> 03:19:10,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if my colleagues have any answers with regards to the traffic engineer, but it's something we did approve back in June with the fiscal

2446
03:19:12,520 --> 03:19:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 budget, and it's something that is desperately needed.

2447
03:19:16,242 --> 03:19:18,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering if the hiring process has started.

2448
03:19:19,003 --> 03:19:19,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I can.

2449
03:19:20,043 --> 03:19:21,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2450
03:19:21,484 --> 03:19:40,431
[SPEAKER_16]: The only reason why I can speak somewhat to this, my fellow council, that both the recreation and the assistant recreation director's position has been posted with the traffic engineer's position has been posted, and they're now accepting resumes

2451
03:19:41,151 --> 03:19:43,612
[SPEAKER_16]: for all three positions, which is very exciting.

2452
03:19:44,333 --> 03:19:47,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, just just finish.

2453
03:19:47,414 --> 03:19:48,955
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that that's great news.

2454
03:19:50,056 --> 03:20:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear it, and I think it's extremely important, especially with the new plans or potential plans for Method Square, Mystic Ave and a number of other locations within the city.

2455
03:20:00,582 --> 03:20:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need traffic engineer for the entire city complaints all the time about traffic, and definitely it's a needed position.

2456
03:20:07,245 --> 03:20:09,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's good to hear that it has been posted.

2457
03:20:10,027 --> 03:20:10,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President,

2458
03:20:12,365 --> 03:20:12,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

2459
03:20:12,985 --> 03:20:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2460
03:20:14,847 --> 03:20:17,348
[SPEAKER_04]: As everyone knows, this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart.

2461
03:20:17,388 --> 03:20:25,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We've sponsored a number of resolutions regarding a traffic engineer that was supported by this board unanimously, and I'm happy that it's been included in the budget.

2462
03:20:25,513 --> 03:20:30,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been on top of this with regard to, I mean, we really want to see this happen.

2463
03:20:30,436 --> 03:20:35,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the police community meetings that we have monthly, traffic always comes up.

2464
03:20:39,687 --> 03:20:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a meeting in, traffic is always the number one issue.

2465
03:20:42,929 --> 03:20:46,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been in contact with the Chief of Staff on a regular basis just to get updates.

2466
03:20:47,110 --> 03:20:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I can tell you is, just to give you a little bit more specifics, is that it's been posted on the Mass.

2467
03:20:54,513 --> 03:20:58,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Municipal Association website, as well as the City of Medford website.

2468
03:20:58,335 --> 03:21:05,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gone out to different colleges, WPI, University of Lowell, UMass Boston, Bentley, and so it's on numerous college

2469
03:21:06,798 --> 03:21:21,669
[SPEAKER_04]: websites and boards and they've also gone out to three engineering associations as well to post a position and they are currently screening resumes and people can still apply but it's definitely something that I know that they're working on.

2470
03:21:21,709 --> 03:21:32,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this is near and dear to my heart and I know I've been curious about it as well and that's just to give you an update with regard to where they are with regard to the hiring process.

2471
03:21:32,136 --> 03:21:33,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2472
03:21:33,277 --> 03:21:33,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2473
03:21:35,797 --> 03:21:37,118
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Kerr.

2474
03:21:39,799 --> 03:21:41,339
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

2475
03:21:41,479 --> 03:21:42,120
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2476
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:42,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2477
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:44,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion is approved.

2478
03:21:45,001 --> 03:21:56,626
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-641 offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that a citywide reverse 911 call be made alerting residents where to find contact info regarding airplane noise.

2479
03:21:57,066 --> 03:22:03,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Additionally, that the city create boilerplate noise complaint letters on the city website for residents to use.

2480
03:22:03,488 --> 03:22:04,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Mox.

2481
03:22:05,241 --> 03:22:06,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2482
03:22:06,262 --> 03:22:13,529
[SPEAKER_24]: I had the opportunity to attend the September 11th meeting at the South Medford Fire Station.

2483
03:22:14,409 --> 03:22:27,241
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to put out a special thank you to Luke Presner and Peter Hulk, who are the appointees to the MCAC, which is Massport Community Advisory Committee.

2484
03:22:27,861 --> 03:22:40,353
[SPEAKER_24]: And they've done yeoman's work over the last several months and organizing and also having a seat at the table when decisions are being made at Massport to make sure that method is well represented.

2485
03:22:41,034 --> 03:22:44,277
[SPEAKER_24]: And I can say unequivocally that is happening.

2486
03:22:44,717 --> 03:22:47,000
[SPEAKER_24]: which didn't happen for a number of years.

2487
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:49,602
[SPEAKER_24]: But it was well attended.

2488
03:22:49,642 --> 03:23:00,734
[SPEAKER_24]: There probably was 80 to 100 people stuffed into that small room, and there was a number of issues discussed, a number of concerns raised by residents.

2489
03:23:01,355 --> 03:23:04,559
[SPEAKER_24]: And two particular ones that I raised tonight, Mr. President, is

2490
03:23:05,259 --> 03:23:21,942
[SPEAKER_24]: that unless you've been following the issue, most residents that are experiencing this particular noise from airplanes on a consistent basis, early and both late in the evening, are unaware where to file complaints.

2491
03:23:22,403 --> 03:23:24,145
[SPEAKER_24]: they're unaware what the next step is.

2492
03:23:24,785 --> 03:23:42,023
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would ask that the city take its reverse 911 option and alert the 58,000 residents of Method where they can get this information and how to go about filing a complaint with Massport regarding the noise, Mr. President.

2493
03:23:42,615 --> 03:23:57,753
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, it was recommended that let us be written to our congressional delegation and also to Massport regarding the noise and some of the other communities like Milton and other communities that have been very successful.

2494
03:23:58,417 --> 03:24:17,193
[SPEAKER_24]: in kind of altering the air traffic over their communities have created these boilerplate letters that rather than having a citizen sit down and try to craft their own letter, they can go online and just pick out a letter, Mr. President, and send it to the congressional delegation or the Mass Board.

2495
03:24:17,513 --> 03:24:25,720
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would ask that our city put on our website right now some boilerplate letters on behalf of the residents of this community.

2496
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:39,765
[SPEAKER_24]: There is currently, what we heard that night, MIT is currently doing a study that the city of Medford will be able to use as an impact study on the air traffic over our community.

2497
03:24:40,546 --> 03:24:42,826
[SPEAKER_24]: And I found it very interesting that

2498
03:24:44,267 --> 03:24:56,383
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of the modifications that could be made to decrease the noise of our community is to have flight patents go out over the water rather than over the major communities.

2499
03:24:57,064 --> 03:24:59,107
[SPEAKER_24]: And from what we heard from Peter and Luke,

2500
03:24:59,667 --> 03:25:06,392
[SPEAKER_24]: is that sometimes these are decisions that are made by the actual pilot and not Logan.

2501
03:25:06,693 --> 03:25:10,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Logan may recommend they go some way, but it's only a recommendation.

2502
03:25:10,896 --> 03:25:23,646
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe if we're able to put some teeth in these patents, flight patents, we'll be able to divert some of this traffic out over the ocean where there'll be less of an impact on our community.

2503
03:25:24,286 --> 03:25:35,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, Mr. President, because East Boston and Winthrop and Revere have such an impact, when planes take off from Logan Airport, they're going at a much slower rate of speed.

2504
03:25:36,419 --> 03:25:42,465
[SPEAKER_24]: And that lessens the impact of noise to East Boston, Winthrop, Revere.

2505
03:25:43,046 --> 03:25:50,249
[SPEAKER_24]: However, once they take off at that slower rate of speed, to reach the altitude they need, they have to start picking up speed.

2506
03:25:50,669 --> 03:25:52,590
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's when they're coming over the city of Medford.

2507
03:25:52,970 --> 03:25:59,834
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's when we're hearing the rumbling that these large jets are trying to pick up altitude.

2508
03:26:00,514 --> 03:26:06,937
[SPEAKER_24]: And if they were able to take off a little quicker at Logan Airport, we may be able to alleviate some of the noise

2509
03:26:07,717 --> 03:26:13,099
[SPEAKER_24]: that we're considering, however, that'll be more of an impact on East Boston and Winthrop and Revere.

2510
03:26:14,119 --> 03:26:24,763
[SPEAKER_24]: So the MIT study is taking all this into consideration, flap deployment, modified acceleration, and a number of other issues, Mr. President, but

2511
03:26:25,663 --> 03:26:29,085
[SPEAKER_24]: It's fair to say that this is not an issue that's going to go away.

2512
03:26:29,485 --> 03:26:31,987
[SPEAKER_24]: It's an issue of grave concern in this community.

2513
03:26:32,687 --> 03:26:36,249
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would ask that the reverse 911 call go out.

2514
03:26:36,990 --> 03:26:40,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I get calls for every particular road race and everything under the sun.

2515
03:26:41,292 --> 03:26:44,914
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is an impact issue that affects the entire community.

2516
03:26:45,354 --> 03:26:47,435
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it's only appropriate we use our reverse 911.

2517
03:26:48,796 --> 03:26:53,579
[SPEAKER_24]: and also to create the boilerplates to make it easier to file a complaint.

2518
03:26:54,239 --> 03:26:56,240
[SPEAKER_24]: I looked up the complaints over the last several years.

2519
03:26:56,700 --> 03:27:10,247
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll list all 60 or 70 communities that filed complaints, and I found it interesting month after month, Method was in the top one, two, or three for number of complaints filed every month consistently.

2520
03:27:11,228 --> 03:27:24,059
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think it shows you that this is an issue, Mr. President, and hopefully with the new representation we have now on the Community Advisory Committee, we're gonna be able to get some results.

2521
03:27:24,939 --> 03:27:34,867
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to concur with Vice President Mox, that Peter and Luke, from having no representation, these two gentlemen,

2522
03:27:35,868 --> 03:27:39,411
[SPEAKER_19]: in nine months have done more work than anyone can imagine.

2523
03:27:39,431 --> 03:27:46,478
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you, the knowledge that they've brought and the slides and the work they've done is just overwhelming.

2524
03:27:46,558 --> 03:27:53,825
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that if you listen to the people of Milton and these other cities that were there,

2525
03:27:54,704 --> 03:28:05,528
[SPEAKER_19]: And the people from the MIT study says, you know, you have to stay on top of the FAA because the federal government allow the FAA to do these things.

2526
03:28:05,948 --> 03:28:16,312
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, you know, you can send all the stuff you want to Massport and everywhere else, but it's our federal officials are the only ones who can stop this, and those are the ones

2527
03:28:17,274 --> 03:28:19,655
[SPEAKER_19]: that we really need to hound to get this done.

2528
03:28:19,715 --> 03:28:22,795
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's see, we had some great representation there tonight.

2529
03:28:22,875 --> 03:28:28,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I was there, Councilor De La Ruzo, Councilor Falco, Vice President Marx, we were there.

2530
03:28:29,457 --> 03:28:35,698
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had good representation from our council to keep everybody abreast of what's happening there.

2531
03:28:36,539 --> 03:28:45,961
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, Peter and Luke, those two men deserve a tremendous amount of respect in this community for the work that they've done in nine months.

2532
03:28:46,971 --> 03:28:47,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Dello Russo.

2533
03:28:48,191 --> 03:28:49,652
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, thank you for that.

2534
03:28:50,272 --> 03:28:56,154
[SPEAKER_28]: I too was very, very impressed with the amount of expertise that they've developed.

2535
03:28:56,794 --> 03:29:10,438
[SPEAKER_28]: It's clear that the work of making headway with the FAA is going to be through contact

2536
03:29:11,175 --> 03:29:29,926
[SPEAKER_28]: and petition to our federal delegation, to our representatives, to the House of Representatives, and also to our Senators, and through work at their offices, with the cooperation of Mask Watch at the FAA.

2537
03:29:29,966 --> 03:29:32,888
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it seems to me from their presentations that

2538
03:29:35,668 --> 03:29:38,710
[SPEAKER_28]: There's not going to be elimination of this noise.

2539
03:29:38,730 --> 03:29:51,960
[SPEAKER_28]: There's going to have to be a way to find an equitable distribution of who's going to get some of the noise, some of the time.

2540
03:29:52,730 --> 03:29:59,813
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's what we're going to have to live with, if I understood their presentations correctly.

2541
03:30:00,293 --> 03:30:05,435
[SPEAKER_28]: But our efforts have to be focused, as you mentioned, on the federal level.

2542
03:30:06,275 --> 03:30:06,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Belco.

2543
03:30:07,055 --> 03:30:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2544
03:30:08,216 --> 03:30:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

2545
03:30:12,778 --> 03:30:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting that Peter and Luke put on was a great meeting, great presentations.

2546
03:30:18,102 --> 03:30:19,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They did one earlier in the spring.

2547
03:30:20,324 --> 03:30:30,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Very informative, and it's nice to see that there are many people that are attending these meetings because it's a quality of life issue that impacts pretty much all the neighborhoods throughout our city.

2548
03:30:31,813 --> 03:30:39,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But the most important thing that I really took out of this is really that it's a federal issue, and we really need to make sure that we contact

2549
03:30:41,232 --> 03:30:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Senator Markey, Senator Warren, Congresswoman Clark.

2550
03:30:44,295 --> 03:30:46,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's important.

2551
03:30:46,056 --> 03:30:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to be involved in this.

2552
03:30:48,839 --> 03:30:54,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to make sure that, you know, we have many people sending them letters so they know how we feel.

2553
03:30:54,924 --> 03:30:57,967
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an issue that impacts all of us.

2554
03:30:58,187 --> 03:30:59,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's a quality of life issue.

2555
03:30:59,788 --> 03:31:05,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the boilerplate letters are a great idea, and it makes it easier for everyone.

2556
03:31:05,974 --> 03:31:07,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support the resolution.

2557
03:31:08,175 --> 03:31:08,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2558
03:31:10,975 --> 03:31:14,416
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Vice President Bach, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2559
03:31:15,336 --> 03:31:15,976
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2560
03:31:16,136 --> 03:31:16,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2561
03:31:16,716 --> 03:31:17,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2562
03:31:18,076 --> 03:31:22,117
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to fall down the stairs.

2563
03:31:22,197 --> 03:31:22,977
[SPEAKER_23]: Just really quick.

2564
03:31:22,997 --> 03:31:25,098
[SPEAKER_23]: Sharma Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2565
03:31:25,118 --> 03:31:29,498
[SPEAKER_23]: A couple of important takeaways from that meeting for me were that we need to keep filing the complaints.

2566
03:31:29,919 --> 03:31:37,280
[SPEAKER_23]: The volume of complaints are what our elected officials, our representatives, our senators use to show that our community is impacted.

2567
03:31:37,861 --> 03:31:42,764
[SPEAKER_23]: So while it's great to write letters to our federal delegation, and I encourage you to write to Elizabeth Warren.

2568
03:31:42,804 --> 03:31:45,626
[SPEAKER_23]: She is our representative on the Quiet Skies Caucus.

2569
03:31:45,766 --> 03:31:50,869
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's in the federal level for making the skies quieter and more livable for all of us.

2570
03:31:51,269 --> 03:31:52,690
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to keep filing the complaints.

2571
03:31:52,730 --> 03:31:54,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Those are the numbers that they refer to.

2572
03:31:54,851 --> 03:32:01,475
[SPEAKER_23]: If the complaints go down, that's how Milton got action was that their complaints were up, unique complaints, multiple complaints.

2573
03:32:01,935 --> 03:32:03,816
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what they're going to use for leverage.

2574
03:32:03,856 --> 03:32:05,497
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to keep filing those complaints.

2575
03:32:05,517 --> 03:32:06,438
[SPEAKER_23]: So I hope that reverse 9-1-1,

2576
03:32:07,415 --> 03:32:08,956
[SPEAKER_23]: will get us some unique complaints.

2577
03:32:09,657 --> 03:32:10,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2578
03:32:11,619 --> 03:32:11,899
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2579
03:32:11,919 --> 03:32:23,829
[SPEAKER_19]: 17 642 over by Councilman occur and be resolved that the administration look into purchasing flashing stop signs as a pilot program on at least 10 of our highly trafficked trafficked intersections.

2580
03:32:23,889 --> 03:32:24,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilman go current.

2581
03:32:25,090 --> 03:32:27,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2582
03:32:27,412 --> 03:32:35,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I put this on because as you drive through neighboring cities and towns, you always look at different ways that

2583
03:32:36,022 --> 03:32:41,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Cities and towns are trying to curb, obviously, speeding and create safer streets.

2584
03:32:42,769 --> 03:32:47,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've had an interest in the last couple months since I've been seeing the flashing stop signs.

2585
03:32:47,734 --> 03:32:52,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely brings more attention to a stop sign, and it worked great from what I saw.

2586
03:32:52,579 --> 03:32:55,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday.

2587
03:32:55,942 --> 03:32:57,223
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a number of issues on.

2588
03:32:57,563 --> 03:32:59,484
[SPEAKER_07]: One specifically was on South Street.

2589
03:32:59,564 --> 03:33:05,287
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a number of residents that are concerned with the traffic and the pedestrians crossing from the square.

2590
03:33:06,828 --> 03:33:11,570
[SPEAKER_07]: There are three or four different crosswalks from both sides of South Street.

2591
03:33:12,211 --> 03:33:13,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suggested this.

2592
03:33:13,711 --> 03:33:24,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, have we looked into flashing stop signs, especially at the stop sign at Walnut and South, where you have hundreds of people going into the square and coming

2593
03:33:24,935 --> 03:33:27,317
[SPEAKER_07]: heading into South Medford, crossing that roadway.

2594
03:33:27,337 --> 03:33:31,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been busy the last, especially in the summer months.

2595
03:33:32,122 --> 03:33:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chief of police said to me, stated to the residents that that's just something that needs to be, there needs to be funding allocated.

2596
03:33:39,809 --> 03:33:44,254
[SPEAKER_07]: The traffic commission can't just vote to put a flashing stop sign in without the funding.

2597
03:33:44,334 --> 03:33:47,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So I then put it on the council agenda.

2598
03:33:48,017 --> 03:33:55,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think it would be a great pilot program along with speed bumps and various crosswalks that we've been talking about for a long time.

2599
03:33:55,506 --> 03:34:03,155
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we could investigate, see how much these flashing stop signs are and pilot them in a number of different highly trafficked areas.

2600
03:34:03,732 --> 03:34:08,656
[SPEAKER_07]: busy intersections where there are a number of accidents, I think it would go a long way.

2601
03:34:08,696 --> 03:34:15,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's just an addition to the new radar guns that we've all fought for and that we've received and are being put in place.

2602
03:34:15,842 --> 03:34:19,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe new laser guns, new speed monitoring signs.

2603
03:34:19,344 --> 03:34:24,589
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just another way to curb traffic, slow people down, make them realize there is a stop sign.

2604
03:34:24,629 --> 03:34:26,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to stop for pedestrians.

2605
03:34:26,210 --> 03:34:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to stop, obviously, for safety reasons.

2606
03:34:29,210 --> 03:34:31,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a way I think that will definitely help.

2607
03:34:31,553 --> 03:34:37,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could roll call vote on this and purchase, look into purchasing and purchase 10.

2608
03:34:38,719 --> 03:34:41,920
[SPEAKER_07]: blinking stop signs, I think it will go a long way.

2609
03:34:41,960 --> 03:34:42,860
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see how it does.

2610
03:34:43,460 --> 03:34:43,821
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2611
03:34:43,841 --> 03:34:44,841
[SPEAKER_28]: What a wonderful measure.

2612
03:34:44,881 --> 03:35:03,906
[SPEAKER_28]: And I was pleased, I forget what venue it was in, but recently at some point this summertime, I believe I heard the mayor announce that she was pursuing this, this exploration and was working on it as an effort for traffic calming measures.

2613
03:35:04,667 --> 03:35:04,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2614
03:35:06,027 --> 03:35:06,508
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Knight.

2615
03:35:07,108 --> 03:35:09,190
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, I find this to be a great resolution.

2616
03:35:09,710 --> 03:35:17,076
[SPEAKER_30]: I hope the councilor doesn't mind if I amend it and give 10 recommended intersections that we can place flashing stop signs at.

2617
03:35:17,556 --> 03:35:20,158
[SPEAKER_30]: No, in all seriousness, this is a great resolution.

2618
03:35:20,218 --> 03:35:21,860
[SPEAKER_30]: It's something that the community needs.

2619
03:35:22,640 --> 03:35:29,826
[SPEAKER_30]: I was just sitting on Woburn Street the other day, and I watched five cars in a row going 35 miles an hour blow through a four-way stop sign.

2620
03:35:29,986 --> 03:35:30,767
[SPEAKER_30]: Just one after another.

2621
03:35:30,807 --> 03:35:32,108
[SPEAKER_30]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2622
03:35:33,089 --> 03:35:47,077
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's getting to the point now where the cut through traffic is not only becoming a problem with congestion, but they're also getting pretty familiar and bold and almost have a contempt now for the rules of the road that we have here in our community, Mr. President.

2623
03:35:47,097 --> 03:35:48,218
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think this is a great measure.

2624
03:35:48,278 --> 03:35:58,925
[SPEAKER_30]: Anything that can raise awareness to drivers and bring some more controls to the area for pedestrian safety is something that I'll always support.

2625
03:35:58,985 --> 03:36:00,166
[SPEAKER_30]: This is a great resolution.

2626
03:36:01,441 --> 03:36:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

2627
03:36:03,422 --> 03:36:05,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, 02155.

2628
03:36:05,562 --> 03:36:25,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Councilor Piano for bringing this resolution forward, especially when in 2001, I believe, we had a large meeting with the neighborhood crime watch at the old train station, I believe, on Washington Street, former Redskins building.

2629
03:36:26,289 --> 03:36:29,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when the new schools were opening, I believe.

2630
03:36:31,891 --> 03:36:49,977
[SPEAKER_05]: police, if he could get installed a push-button stoplight so the children could cross Riverside Avenue onto the newly created Freedom Way, the two schools, Tucker Andrews and McGlynn.

2631
03:36:50,997 --> 03:36:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, his reply, I believe,

2632
03:36:57,962 --> 03:37:02,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, basically, I'm just asking for a push-button stop, not a full-fledged.

2633
03:37:02,863 --> 03:37:03,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It cost $100,000.

2634
03:37:03,723 --> 03:37:09,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So nothing has ever been put there except a crosswalk, I believe.

2635
03:37:09,764 --> 03:37:20,986
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not mistaken, not long ago, within 12 months, on High Street, they put something in real quick when the child was almost hit by a car, they say.

2636
03:37:21,886 --> 03:37:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's on High Street in front of this book school, I believe.

2637
03:37:26,820 --> 03:37:51,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to confide with Councilor Knight also, if I could have a request to put it there, because that crosswalk, the dangerous street, Riverside Avenue, and furthermore, it's used 12 months a year, not just for the school year, because of the park, footpath, bike paths, partial bike paths, soccer fields, et cetera, Little League.

2638
03:37:54,189 --> 03:37:54,610
[SPEAKER_05]: request.

2639
03:37:54,731 --> 03:37:56,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening.

2640
03:37:56,976 --> 03:37:58,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2641
03:37:59,583 --> 03:38:00,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2642
03:38:00,766 --> 03:38:03,051
[SPEAKER_24]: And I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Kurd for bringing this up.

2643
03:38:04,383 --> 03:38:10,487
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been talking about traffic calming initiatives in this city for the better part of a lot of years.

2644
03:38:11,648 --> 03:38:24,175
[SPEAKER_24]: But needless to say, Mr. President, I agree with this, but I think procedurally we have a commission that is responsible for signage in any traffic calming initiatives.

2645
03:38:24,755 --> 03:38:27,638
[SPEAKER_24]: markings on roads, that is the traffic commission.

2646
03:38:28,258 --> 03:38:39,968
[SPEAKER_24]: So I would respectfully ask my council colleague if we can send this to the traffic commission, let them review the need for these particular flashing stop signs.

2647
03:38:40,548 --> 03:38:46,591
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the requests be sent to the administration for the purchasing based on their recommendation.

2648
03:38:47,031 --> 03:38:54,954
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think this is kind of putting the cart before the horse, asking to purchase signs and not go through the appropriate body first.

2649
03:38:54,994 --> 03:38:57,415
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the only change I'd make.

2650
03:38:57,555 --> 03:38:59,236
[SPEAKER_24]: I support this wholeheartedly.

2651
03:38:59,816 --> 03:39:01,037
[SPEAKER_24]: I like the flashing signs.

2652
03:39:01,097 --> 03:39:02,658
[SPEAKER_24]: I like raised crosswalks.

2653
03:39:03,118 --> 03:39:05,879
[SPEAKER_24]: I like, you know, cutouts, bump outs.

2654
03:39:06,279 --> 03:39:07,900
[SPEAKER_24]: I like all that traffic calming.

2655
03:39:08,620 --> 03:39:09,141
[SPEAKER_24]: approaches.

2656
03:39:09,181 --> 03:39:15,885
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was that was the one thing I'd ask my council colleague if she would amend it and send it to the Traffic Commission for us for their input.

2657
03:39:16,485 --> 03:39:18,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe we could do both at the same time.

2658
03:39:18,407 --> 03:39:20,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a good resolve.

2659
03:39:20,288 --> 03:39:24,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask the administration to look into pricing and send it to the Traffic Commission.

2660
03:39:25,231 --> 03:39:32,035
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was there on Tuesday, they said that it seemed like that was something they would definitely want to implement but didn't have the funding for it.

2661
03:39:32,135 --> 03:39:34,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think sending it to the Traffic Commission and having them

2662
03:39:35,086 --> 03:39:42,503
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out where the locations would be, because we'd all probably fight over, we'd want 100 of them, between the seven of us.

2663
03:39:43,085 --> 03:39:59,250
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we could have them designate where these 10 spots would be, or more if we can afford it, and have the administration try to figure out how much they would cost, and what funding we have, and how many we could purchase, I think we could collectively be able to implement it within a reasonable amount of time.

2664
03:39:59,270 --> 03:40:03,911
[SPEAKER_19]: So are you going to amend it to send it both to the administration and the traffic commission?

2665
03:40:03,951 --> 03:40:04,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please.

2666
03:40:04,431 --> 03:40:05,331
[SPEAKER_27]: Move approval.

2667
03:40:05,912 --> 03:40:10,613
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion that we send this vote to the administration,

2668
03:40:11,398 --> 03:40:13,159
[SPEAKER_19]: in the Traffic Commission.

2669
03:40:13,960 --> 03:40:19,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion has been on the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Langlois-Carron.

2670
03:40:20,024 --> 03:40:20,724
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2671
03:40:20,885 --> 03:40:21,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2672
03:40:21,485 --> 03:40:22,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2673
03:40:22,345 --> 03:40:22,786
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-6.

2674
03:40:22,886 --> 03:40:29,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, just if I could, not to have any confusion, but I think we have to word it a little different.

2675
03:40:29,470 --> 03:40:37,816
[SPEAKER_24]: If we're going to send the Mayor a request to look into purchasing flashing stop signs, we're certainly not going to ask the Traffic Commission to look into purchasing

2676
03:40:38,525 --> 03:40:44,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Flashing stop signs, but we're going to ask them to look into the feasibility of... In locations.

2677
03:40:44,550 --> 03:40:47,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Feasibility in location.

2678
03:40:49,777 --> 03:40:50,958
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could amend that, Mr. Clerk.

2679
03:40:51,078 --> 03:40:56,203
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, I think this is where it becomes important that we get the traffic engineer on board.

2680
03:40:56,383 --> 03:40:58,825
[SPEAKER_30]: We get the traffic engineer on the payroll.

2681
03:40:59,366 --> 03:41:06,712
[SPEAKER_30]: Because the traffic engineer is probably going to be the one that's going to be able to determine where the best locations are and where we're going to get the most bang for our buck and the most impact.

2682
03:41:06,732 --> 03:41:08,674
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's what Chief Sacco was saying.

2683
03:41:08,754 --> 03:41:11,596
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think Chief Sacco is on the right track when he talks about that.

2684
03:41:11,696 --> 03:41:16,280
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, Chief Sacco, I think, is more excited than anybody to have a traffic engineer come on board here in the city.

2685
03:41:17,341 --> 03:41:18,621
[SPEAKER_30]: for the last 20-some odd years.

2686
03:41:18,661 --> 03:41:29,864
[SPEAKER_30]: He's been the one that's been wearing the badge that says this is where the stop sign goes, this is where the do not enter sign goes after the deliberations from the Traffic Commission.

2687
03:41:29,904 --> 03:41:32,845
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think this traffic engineer is going to add some professionalism.

2688
03:41:32,905 --> 03:41:38,586
[SPEAKER_30]: It's going to allow us to have some data-driven decision making, Mr. President, as opposed to some reactionary decision making.

2689
03:41:38,606 --> 03:41:39,587
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm looking forward to it.

2690
03:41:39,607 --> 03:41:41,027
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think this, again, is a great resolve.

2691
03:41:41,787 --> 03:41:51,310
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, we can ask the Traffic Commission to implement, but the locations, I think, really should be up to them and the traffic engineer, the people that have the ability to make data-driven decisions.

2692
03:41:53,930 --> 03:42:00,432
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so as amended there, we'll change the wording.

2693
03:42:00,452 --> 03:42:03,013
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, 17-643, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved.

2694
03:42:03,451 --> 03:42:08,693
[SPEAKER_19]: that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Deacon Mark Rumley on his recent assignment to St.

2695
03:42:09,353 --> 03:42:12,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Raphael's Parish by Archbishop Sean O'Malley.

2696
03:42:14,135 --> 03:42:21,558
[SPEAKER_19]: It was announced a couple weeks ago that our city solicitor, Deacon Rumley, will be joining the staff at St.

2697
03:42:21,598 --> 03:42:29,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Ray's, and I just wish him good luck on his new assignment there, and I know the people in the community were also excited about having him there also.

2698
03:42:30,022 --> 03:42:30,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2699
03:42:31,102 --> 03:42:32,042
[SPEAKER_19]: We see a motion to receive.

2700
03:42:33,836 --> 03:42:37,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2701
03:42:37,459 --> 03:42:38,119
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2702
03:42:38,259 --> 03:42:38,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2703
03:42:38,980 --> 03:42:41,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

2704
03:42:41,041 --> 03:42:43,143
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-638 offered by Councilor Lococo and be it resolved.

2705
03:42:43,883 --> 03:42:52,545
[SPEAKER_19]: that the Medford City Council provide the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and how one can get a video aired on TV3.

2706
03:42:52,885 --> 03:42:53,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilwoman Locren.

2707
03:42:54,326 --> 03:42:55,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2708
03:42:55,766 --> 03:43:03,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually asking that we be provided the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and get a video aired.

2709
03:43:03,668 --> 03:43:07,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, people are very excited about TV3, it's opening.

2710
03:43:08,364 --> 03:43:10,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And people also have questions.

2711
03:43:10,269 --> 03:43:14,843
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been scuttlebutt of whether or not you need a court report filled out.

2712
03:43:15,044 --> 03:43:15,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's.

2713
03:43:16,583 --> 03:43:20,866
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously something that may be needed because it is located within the high school.

2714
03:43:20,926 --> 03:43:23,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's obviously understandable.

2715
03:43:23,808 --> 03:43:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we could just get a list of what is going to be required, is it going to be a contract that's going to need to be signed?

2716
03:43:29,552 --> 03:43:31,333
[SPEAKER_07]: How long will it take to be quarried?

2717
03:43:31,373 --> 03:43:32,794
[SPEAKER_07]: When can you get a video aired?

2718
03:43:32,874 --> 03:43:35,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And how will you be able to get a video aired?

2719
03:43:35,856 --> 03:43:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important for the public to know now that it's

2720
03:43:39,398 --> 03:43:46,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a new station, people really want to get involved, and it's just common information that probably should be posted and figured out.

2721
03:43:47,904 --> 03:43:49,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2722
03:43:50,266 --> 03:43:51,146
[SPEAKER_38]: Good evening, Councilors.

2723
03:43:51,206 --> 03:43:54,829
[SPEAKER_38]: Ben Brown, station manager, City of Medford, Medford Community Media.

2724
03:43:56,350 --> 03:44:01,333
[SPEAKER_38]: I brought with me tonight the form for how to get a show on the air.

2725
03:44:02,374 --> 03:44:06,237
[SPEAKER_38]: It is several pages, and I apologize if it wasn't in your packet ahead of time.

2726
03:44:08,423 --> 03:44:11,404
[SPEAKER_38]: Simply, to fill out, to get a show on the air, there is this form.

2727
03:44:11,484 --> 03:44:19,906
[SPEAKER_38]: Once it's filled out, it does require a QWERTY form also to be submitted the first time the resident submits programming.

2728
03:44:21,366 --> 03:44:24,346
[SPEAKER_38]: And after that, they can submit programming as many times as they like.

2729
03:44:24,366 --> 03:44:30,288
[SPEAKER_38]: As far as becoming a member goes, we're going to have an open house on October 15th from 10 to noon.

2730
03:44:31,128 --> 03:44:35,849
[SPEAKER_38]: And we'll be signing members up then in a more official way.

2731
03:44:36,589 --> 03:44:37,970
[SPEAKER_38]: October 15th, 10 to noon?

2732
03:44:38,371 --> 03:44:38,511
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep.

2733
03:44:40,672 --> 03:44:48,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may, through the chair, the CORI form, once one does come in and fill it out, how long is the process to get that back and approved?

2734
03:44:49,739 --> 03:44:50,380
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not long.

2735
03:44:51,381 --> 03:44:51,581
[SPEAKER_07]: 24 hours?

2736
03:44:51,601 --> 03:44:52,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, usually.

2737
03:44:52,962 --> 03:44:57,566
[SPEAKER_38]: We normally wouldn't start airing programming the same hour that programming came in anyways.

2738
03:44:58,826 --> 03:45:05,891
[SPEAKER_38]: We usually air schedules on a weekly basis, so if you came in on Monday, it may not air until Friday.

2739
03:45:05,931 --> 03:45:10,053
[SPEAKER_38]: That's just logistically the timing to get the programming in and started.

2740
03:45:10,073 --> 03:45:12,935
[SPEAKER_38]: That's not to say it wouldn't happen faster than that, though.

2741
03:45:13,675 --> 03:45:14,076
[SPEAKER_38]: Go on.

2742
03:45:15,857 --> 03:45:21,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does look like there's a contract here, producer agreement and indemnification form.

2743
03:45:21,680 --> 03:45:21,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

2744
03:45:22,841 --> 03:45:23,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Who drafted that?

2745
03:45:24,402 --> 03:45:26,363
[SPEAKER_38]: That is city policy.

2746
03:45:27,682 --> 03:45:28,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So City Hall?

2747
03:45:28,603 --> 03:45:28,823
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2748
03:45:32,888 --> 03:45:36,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And once that's signed, who's going to keep hold of that?

2749
03:45:37,333 --> 03:45:41,317
[SPEAKER_38]: That comes to me, and then I file them and put them on the computer.

2750
03:45:41,337 --> 03:45:41,397
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep.

2751
03:45:44,007 --> 03:45:53,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're just getting this, so I think that's, how can somebody, do they have to come in and apply to be a member, apply in person, or will this be online?

2752
03:45:53,413 --> 03:45:59,936
[SPEAKER_38]: It will be online once the media center has a website, but that's a couple weeks-ish away.

2753
03:46:02,538 --> 03:46:05,159
[SPEAKER_38]: But if anyone wants to email me, I'm happy to send it back to them.

2754
03:46:06,080 --> 03:46:07,641
[SPEAKER_38]: And I have sent it back to a few people.

2755
03:46:09,444 --> 03:46:12,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So have you had anybody sign the agreement and become members yet?

2756
03:46:12,888 --> 03:46:24,081
[SPEAKER_38]: I've had one come back to me that's been fully signed, and I have a few others that are out now.

2757
03:46:27,345 --> 03:46:27,645
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2758
03:46:28,246 --> 03:46:28,727
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Day.

2759
03:46:29,650 --> 03:46:30,411
[SPEAKER_26]: Ben, welcome aboard.

2760
03:46:30,931 --> 03:46:31,211
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2761
03:46:31,311 --> 03:46:34,673
[SPEAKER_30]: We've had the opportunity to see you at your finest hour.

2762
03:46:34,693 --> 03:46:38,074
[SPEAKER_30]: We had a couple of council meetings over there in the media center, and things went well.

2763
03:46:38,194 --> 03:46:41,096
[SPEAKER_30]: It's certainly a lot cooler in there than it is in here, and the lights aren't as bright.

2764
03:46:42,336 --> 03:46:55,363
[SPEAKER_30]: But with that being said, can you tell us a little bit about your experience so far being there, based upon where you've been in the past and where you are now, what you think the direction the media center can go in, and what we should expect?

2765
03:46:56,192 --> 03:47:01,456
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure, so I'm coming to Medford from the town of Brookline.

2766
03:47:02,117 --> 03:47:03,257
[SPEAKER_38]: I was there for seven years.

2767
03:47:03,317 --> 03:47:06,059
[SPEAKER_38]: Previous to that, I was in the city of Northampton.

2768
03:47:06,880 --> 03:47:16,207
[SPEAKER_38]: In both the media centers that I worked in in the past, they've had a long record of being the media center for all three of the channels.

2769
03:47:16,867 --> 03:47:19,549
[SPEAKER_38]: And Medford used to be known as TV3.

2770
03:47:20,590 --> 03:47:24,853
[SPEAKER_38]: Now I've been asked to help support all three of the channels.

2771
03:47:26,173 --> 03:47:31,317
[SPEAKER_38]: And as part of that, we decided on the name Medford Community Media, as opposed to just TV3.

2772
03:47:32,698 --> 03:47:41,424
[SPEAKER_38]: And going forward, I would hope that we could work to be a model of media centers around the state and around the country.

2773
03:47:42,037 --> 03:47:54,263
[SPEAKER_38]: providing media training and education, providing some media literacy education, and as well as the normal public access programming that everyone has known and loves.

2774
03:47:56,224 --> 03:48:02,007
[SPEAKER_29]: And in terms of programming right now, obviously the TV Guide right now.

2775
03:48:03,597 --> 03:48:06,879
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, so there is... I'm a big Three Stooges fan.

2776
03:48:07,499 --> 03:48:09,280
[SPEAKER_38]: There is some programming on the channel.

2777
03:48:09,400 --> 03:48:13,081
[SPEAKER_38]: It's all educational programming and public domain movies.

2778
03:48:13,881 --> 03:48:24,146
[SPEAKER_38]: There was one form that came back to me today that is a resident who makes both an English language and a Russian language program, interview program.

2779
03:48:24,906 --> 03:48:28,047
[SPEAKER_38]: That'll be on within the next couple days.

2780
03:48:29,468 --> 03:48:35,394
[SPEAKER_38]: There is a cooking show that has been requested be aired.

2781
03:48:36,074 --> 03:48:37,295
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't gotten the form back.

2782
03:48:37,315 --> 03:48:46,904
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a music program that's been made in the city of Medford that's been requested, but I haven't received the form yet.

2783
03:48:48,441 --> 03:48:56,103
[SPEAKER_38]: And other programming would be things like NASA TV and other news programs from around the country.

2784
03:48:56,804 --> 03:48:59,925
[SPEAKER_29]: And where can an individual find out what's playing and when?

2785
03:49:00,485 --> 03:49:03,906
[SPEAKER_38]: So right now, you can't because we don't have a website.

2786
03:49:03,986 --> 03:49:05,846
[SPEAKER_38]: Once there's a website, it'll all be on our website.

2787
03:49:06,407 --> 03:49:08,087
[SPEAKER_38]: My hope would be that in the future,

2788
03:49:11,408 --> 03:49:24,337
[SPEAKER_38]: There is a push for Comcast and Verizon to include the media centers as part of the electronic program guide, and I would hope that we could adopt that in Medford soon, though it's a complex issue at the Comcast and Verizon level.

2789
03:49:24,957 --> 03:49:25,177
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

2790
03:49:25,217 --> 03:49:25,697
[SPEAKER_30]: Awesome.

2791
03:49:25,718 --> 03:49:26,358
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much.

2792
03:49:26,378 --> 03:49:26,958
[SPEAKER_30]: Keep up the good work.

2793
03:49:26,978 --> 03:49:27,639
[SPEAKER_30]: The place looks great.

2794
03:49:27,659 --> 03:49:28,539
[SPEAKER_30]: I think you're doing a great job.

2795
03:49:30,801 --> 03:49:31,101
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2796
03:49:31,141 --> 03:49:32,482
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President.

2797
03:49:32,502 --> 03:49:33,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

2798
03:49:37,658 --> 03:49:37,978
[SPEAKER_24]: President.

2799
03:49:39,399 --> 03:49:41,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2800
03:49:42,240 --> 03:49:43,360
[SPEAKER_24]: This question is for Ben.

2801
03:49:43,400 --> 03:49:48,342
[SPEAKER_24]: Ben, I just had a question for you.

2802
03:49:48,882 --> 03:49:53,764
[SPEAKER_24]: What involvement did you have in putting together this particular application?

2803
03:49:54,565 --> 03:50:02,388
[SPEAKER_38]: So there are some standard forms that are used in other centers around the state.

2804
03:50:04,189 --> 03:50:04,589
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, I

2805
03:50:05,815 --> 03:50:09,296
[SPEAKER_38]: took that and submitted it to the city.

2806
03:50:10,376 --> 03:50:17,038
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, the original language is from me, but I'm not an attorney and I don't represent one as the city.

2807
03:50:17,078 --> 03:50:21,080
[SPEAKER_38]: So I couldn't venture to say that that's my writing, I think.

2808
03:50:22,300 --> 03:50:32,343
[SPEAKER_24]: So just if I can understand better, what was the discussion or thoughts regarding first time submitters will be required to fill out a core reform?

2809
03:50:33,359 --> 03:50:36,560
[SPEAKER_38]: I believe that has to do with the location of the media center.

2810
03:50:37,900 --> 03:50:44,562
[SPEAKER_24]: So the fact that the media center is located at the high school, we're requesting core reforms?

2811
03:50:45,082 --> 03:50:45,783
[SPEAKER_38]: I believe so, yes.

2812
03:50:46,543 --> 03:50:46,743
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2813
03:50:47,323 --> 03:50:51,184
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was under the impression that this had a separate entrance.

2814
03:50:51,984 --> 03:51:00,027
[SPEAKER_24]: I was under the impression that the new media center would be used on off hours.

2815
03:51:01,343 --> 03:51:02,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that not correct?

2816
03:51:03,406 --> 03:51:05,768
[SPEAKER_38]: That is correct.

2817
03:51:05,888 --> 03:51:09,092
[SPEAKER_38]: We are planning on having hours outside of the school day, yes.

2818
03:51:09,672 --> 03:51:10,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2819
03:51:10,613 --> 03:51:13,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I really have a concern with this.

2820
03:51:14,418 --> 03:51:16,179
[SPEAKER_24]: And let me tell you what my concern is.

2821
03:51:16,980 --> 03:51:22,506
[SPEAKER_24]: That if the requirement of a quarry is based on the fact that this is housed

2822
03:51:23,215 --> 03:51:24,116
[SPEAKER_24]: here at the high school.

2823
03:51:25,257 --> 03:51:44,918
[SPEAKER_24]: And the fact that we have outside non-resident organizations that are renting out school facilities, and as far as I know, not required to fill out core reforms that are occupying our school buildings,

2824
03:51:45,945 --> 03:52:00,132
[SPEAKER_24]: How would that be any different than someone coming up here from the community that's in a room that's dedicated for that purpose, with no access, the way I understand it, into the high school, then be required to fill out a core reform.

2825
03:52:00,692 --> 03:52:13,559
[SPEAKER_24]: But if I live in Lexington, I can come up here on a Saturday, spend hours in the building, bring in rolling luggage with me, occupy classrooms under lock and key,

2826
03:52:14,957 --> 03:52:17,918
[SPEAKER_24]: in a building that houses our students without a quarry check.

2827
03:52:18,238 --> 03:52:22,760
[SPEAKER_24]: And this question may not be for you, it may be for the superintendent of schools.

2828
03:52:23,660 --> 03:52:29,242
[SPEAKER_24]: I just, I wanna better understand why we're requiring a quarry for local access.

2829
03:52:29,842 --> 03:52:44,587
[SPEAKER_24]: And if what you're telling me is because it's up at the high school, but then we have people renting out these buildings, numerous people renting out these buildings, and not requiring a quarry to be inside these buildings,

2830
03:52:45,844 --> 03:52:47,145
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a concern.

2831
03:52:47,585 --> 03:52:49,166
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to know what's going on here.

2832
03:52:49,266 --> 03:52:51,187
[SPEAKER_38]: I unfortunately can't speak directly to that.

2833
03:52:51,827 --> 03:52:53,908
[SPEAKER_38]: I can only speak to the form.

2834
03:52:54,729 --> 03:53:02,132
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, and, you know, the form states that because it's located in the high school, that's why the court check is being requested.

2835
03:53:02,453 --> 03:53:10,397
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe the superintendent schools, I don't want to put you on the spot, Mr. Belson, but maybe maybe if you can answer that, you stay to the late hour.

2836
03:53:10,457 --> 03:53:10,577
[SPEAKER_24]: So

2837
03:53:12,835 --> 03:53:19,239
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm here, Mr. Vice President, as tonight's security, because you were concerned about that, as I mentioned.

2838
03:53:19,379 --> 03:53:20,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you're providing the security.

2839
03:53:20,620 --> 03:53:22,121
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wearing blue, so.

2840
03:53:23,362 --> 03:53:24,262
[SPEAKER_24]: It's good to know.

2841
03:53:24,523 --> 03:53:25,243
[SPEAKER_24]: It's good to know.

2842
03:53:25,563 --> 03:53:26,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Feel safe?

2843
03:53:28,385 --> 03:53:28,785
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

2844
03:53:28,845 --> 03:53:29,486
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your answer?

2845
03:53:29,586 --> 03:53:30,286
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2846
03:53:31,147 --> 03:53:36,991
[SPEAKER_21]: So we do quarry checks on everyone who has unsupervised contact with students.

2847
03:53:38,011 --> 03:53:42,094
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's anyone who works here, a contractor, anyone who comes in like that.

2848
03:53:46,284 --> 03:53:52,731
[SPEAKER_21]: dedicated door that you can't go from the studio into the high school once it's fully operational.

2849
03:53:52,771 --> 03:53:57,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously we're still using it with students so they can go during the school day.

2850
03:53:57,095 --> 03:54:04,563
[SPEAKER_21]: But there are any number of activities that students have that people coming up here in the afternoon might interact with them.

2851
03:54:05,322 --> 03:54:22,390
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I think that the city, and I don't have an objection to taking the extra step in making sure that anyone who might be up here frequently, who is moving around that area outside of the studio into the area, might find their way into the front door at a given time.

2852
03:54:23,290 --> 03:54:25,292
[SPEAKER_21]: we check it out a little bit.

2853
03:54:25,733 --> 03:54:36,023
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as other groups go, we've rented properties for years, and we haven't required it because generally they're under the supervision of people, and the people there are on a volunteer basis.

2854
03:54:36,564 --> 03:54:42,470
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it really isn't exactly the same thing, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra measure of precaution.

2855
03:54:43,590 --> 03:55:03,319
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to figure out, Mr. Superintendent, if this is a new standard that we're implementing because the media centers up here at the high school, or for that reason, any other building, then why does it not trickle down to organizations that have full access to these buildings?

2856
03:55:04,159 --> 03:55:08,161
[SPEAKER_24]: And why wouldn't we want to secure our buildings to that extent?

2857
03:55:09,162 --> 03:55:12,143
[SPEAKER_24]: And are you willing to make that commitment?

2858
03:55:16,940 --> 03:55:18,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Our students are here.

2859
03:55:18,421 --> 03:55:21,464
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we had a coach, and they were coaching on the field, they'd be quarried.

2860
03:55:22,405 --> 03:55:27,950
[SPEAKER_21]: If we have a rental out there, they're not our students.

2861
03:55:27,990 --> 03:55:31,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not unsupervised contact with students.

2862
03:55:31,653 --> 03:55:33,215
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the requirement of the court.

2863
03:55:33,235 --> 03:55:36,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, but they have access to our building.

2864
03:55:37,058 --> 03:55:39,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but access to the building isn't the standard.

2865
03:55:39,140 --> 03:55:40,802
[SPEAKER_21]: There are people who have access to the building.

2866
03:55:41,062 --> 03:55:42,083
[SPEAKER_21]: A parent comes up here.

2867
03:55:44,825 --> 03:55:46,526
[SPEAKER_21]: They're checked in, but they're not quarried.

2868
03:55:46,546 --> 03:55:48,387
[SPEAKER_21]: So access to the building is one thing.

2869
03:55:48,507 --> 03:55:53,369
[SPEAKER_21]: The standard for quarrying is unsupervised contact with students.

2870
03:55:53,989 --> 03:56:06,975
[SPEAKER_24]: So for instance, on Saturdays, you know there's a program up here on Saturdays where hundreds of people, mostly from outside this community, come in and use the classrooms, use the facilities, use the cafeteria.

2871
03:56:07,835 --> 03:56:16,179
[SPEAKER_24]: And in my opinion, you might say they're supervised by their own staff, not by our staff, by their own staff.

2872
03:56:16,599 --> 03:56:27,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Why wouldn't that then trigger off this new requirement of being in a building unsupervised that, you know, could have a potential risk?

2873
03:56:27,664 --> 03:56:34,146
[SPEAKER_21]: Look, you can have a person walking on the street and have them contact with someone who's inappropriate.

2874
03:56:35,167 --> 03:56:36,007
[SPEAKER_21]: In this building,

2875
03:56:36,833 --> 03:56:51,412
[SPEAKER_21]: When we have a rental, and we have a situation where people, let's say the Japanese language school, because that's the sanity reference you're making, they have their own students, they have their own people, they have their own coverages, they supervise their students.

2876
03:56:52,033 --> 03:56:53,915
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not responsible for their students.

2877
03:56:55,365 --> 03:57:03,948
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyone who works with our students, if we had an athletic team, if we had a club that met on the weekend, whoever is a supervisor has a quarry check.

2878
03:57:04,368 --> 03:57:07,189
[SPEAKER_21]: And on top of that, most instances has a fingerprint check.

2879
03:57:07,269 --> 03:57:16,413
[SPEAKER_24]: But wouldn't we have a responsibility, Mr. Superintendent, to our students that attend the public schools, that whoever we're letting into the building,

2880
03:57:17,461 --> 03:57:20,744
[SPEAKER_24]: rental, or whatever other purpose, that we know who they are.

2881
03:57:21,364 --> 03:57:33,213
[SPEAKER_24]: And the reason why you're requesting a quarry is to check the background of someone that's coming into the building, that's using the media center, and that you want to know who they are.

2882
03:57:33,474 --> 03:57:37,257
[SPEAKER_24]: And you want to make sure that the quarry, because the quarry's for a reason.

2883
03:57:38,377 --> 03:57:56,387
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, you're doing a background investigation on the person, but then again we're saying, we'll allow hundreds of people up here with luggage, wheeled in luggage, and access to every classroom in this community, in this school, and not have the same type of requirements.

2884
03:57:57,987 --> 03:57:59,228
[SPEAKER_24]: I just don't understand.

2885
03:57:59,288 --> 03:58:02,369
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to figure out what the policy and procedure is.

2886
03:58:02,749 --> 03:58:04,049
[SPEAKER_21]: But you're making two different things.

2887
03:58:04,069 --> 03:58:07,170
[SPEAKER_21]: So, for example, on parents night, parents come up for curriculum night.

2888
03:58:07,490 --> 03:58:09,751
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't quarry every parent who comes in the door.

2889
03:58:10,511 --> 03:58:12,052
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not talking about parents.

2890
03:58:12,072 --> 03:58:12,552
[SPEAKER_21]: But they could.

2891
03:58:13,032 --> 03:58:14,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Byron is a person.

2892
03:58:14,955 --> 03:58:19,060
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not talking about, you're talking about something that I'm not talking about.

2893
03:58:19,140 --> 03:58:22,004
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm talking about the renting of our facilities.

2894
03:58:22,064 --> 03:58:27,751
[SPEAKER_21]: You're talking about a type of person in the building, but there's all kinds of people who come into this building who are not chlorinated.

2895
03:58:28,271 --> 03:58:51,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, so if we're going to require a quarry for someone using a particular room, a media room, that doesn't have access to high school, maybe we should require a quarry for people that are coming into the building, that are renting the building, and not just this high school as you know, other school facilities, and make it so that we have a responsibility to safeguard our students.

2896
03:58:52,417 --> 03:58:58,821
[SPEAKER_24]: because in my opinion, Mr. Superintendent, there's no way that we're supervising what's going on.

2897
03:58:59,141 --> 03:59:07,426
[SPEAKER_24]: We're relying on people that are renting to make sure it's a secure atmosphere and make sure that our students are safe come Monday morning.

2898
03:59:07,946 --> 03:59:10,427
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is a concern I have, Mr. Superintendent.

2899
03:59:10,567 --> 03:59:14,850
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand what you're saying, but that's not the standard of Corey.

2900
03:59:15,790 --> 03:59:22,856
[SPEAKER_21]: The Corey check requires when a person has unsupervised contact, a frequent visitor kind of thing.

2901
03:59:23,176 --> 03:59:33,865
[SPEAKER_21]: So if a person's going to use the media studio, and they're going to come up here more than once, I assume they're going to try to use the studio more than once, they're not becoming a member to only have one production or one activity.

2902
03:59:34,466 --> 03:59:39,728
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're a frequent action person up here, and so it doesn't hurt to know who they are.

2903
03:59:40,169 --> 03:59:40,529
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all.

2904
03:59:40,769 --> 03:59:42,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, but it would be supervision, correct?

2905
03:59:43,150 --> 03:59:44,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that studio lift unmanned?

2906
03:59:44,411 --> 03:59:46,051
[SPEAKER_24]: They won't be supervising students?

2907
03:59:46,712 --> 03:59:56,936
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, I'm talking if someone's gonna come up here and use the media center, is there not, Dan, someone that's gonna be supervising, or will that be unmanned?

2908
03:59:57,016 --> 03:59:57,596
[SPEAKER_24]: They could.

2909
03:59:57,616 --> 04:00:00,518
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm asking with all due respect to the gentleman.

2910
04:00:01,990 --> 04:00:03,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Does your facility go unsupervised?

2911
04:00:03,792 --> 04:00:06,374
[SPEAKER_38]: It will not go unsupervised to an extent.

2912
04:00:07,054 --> 04:00:14,560
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the point is that they could walk out of the media center by accident, right?

2913
04:00:14,580 --> 04:00:16,661
[SPEAKER_21]: They could walk into the front of the building.

2914
04:00:16,781 --> 04:00:20,184
[SPEAKER_21]: They go out the main door of the studio.

2915
04:00:20,264 --> 04:00:27,810
[SPEAKER_24]: So similar to the hundreds of people that come in here every Saturday, could walk into any area of the building.

2916
04:00:28,910 --> 04:00:30,831
[SPEAKER_24]: generally at that time they're not here.

2917
04:00:31,011 --> 04:00:33,513
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Superintendent, I don't want to belabor the point.

2918
04:00:33,833 --> 04:00:43,678
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just trying to figure out if this is a new policy or procedure, based on the fact that people coming up to the high school or any of our schools, I think it should be carried out across the board.

2919
04:00:43,718 --> 04:00:45,498
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I'm saying.

2920
04:00:45,559 --> 04:00:48,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Check every parent who walks in the building too.

2921
04:00:48,380 --> 04:00:52,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Now you're getting back to the parents again, and I'm talking about rentals.

2922
04:00:52,802 --> 04:00:55,925
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know how I can lay that out any easier.

2923
04:00:55,945 --> 04:00:58,427
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't tell who's who's a problem on a given day.

2924
04:00:58,507 --> 04:00:59,108
[SPEAKER_21]: It could be anybody.

2925
04:01:09,835 --> 04:01:14,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it doesn't seem like much thought went into this quarry process.

2926
04:01:15,777 --> 04:01:20,418
[SPEAKER_24]: It seemed like it was just isolated to the media center, and that's all I'm bringing up.

2927
04:01:20,498 --> 04:01:22,139
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to know what the thoughts are.

2928
04:01:22,439 --> 04:01:25,440
[SPEAKER_24]: I wasn't involved in creating this, so I just want to know what the thoughts are.

2929
04:01:25,480 --> 04:01:28,941
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it's unreasonable if a person is going to be up here frequently.

2930
04:01:32,348 --> 04:01:34,389
[SPEAKER_21]: have access to a particular area of the building.

2931
04:01:35,409 --> 04:01:35,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

2932
04:01:35,590 --> 04:01:38,711
[SPEAKER_24]: So the rentals we have are frequent rentals.

2933
04:01:39,351 --> 04:01:45,934
[SPEAKER_24]: And some of these organizations have been renting for, I'd venture to say, 10, 15 years.

2934
04:01:46,675 --> 04:01:50,196
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know how much more frequent you can get than that, Mr. Superintendent.

2935
04:01:50,216 --> 04:01:50,196
40.

2936
04:01:50,276 --> 04:01:51,057
[SPEAKER_24]: It may be longer.

2937
04:01:51,637 --> 04:01:57,240
[SPEAKER_24]: And I never see a request to have other people storied that are using our buildings.

2938
04:01:57,260 --> 04:01:59,061
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not working with our students directly.

2939
04:01:59,301 --> 04:02:01,942
[SPEAKER_21]: They're working with their population.

2940
04:02:02,342 --> 04:02:05,863
[SPEAKER_24]: And someone going to the media room is not working with our students directly either.

2941
04:02:06,183 --> 04:02:06,743
[SPEAKER_24]: They could.

2942
04:02:06,763 --> 04:02:10,764
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, look, it's obviously a discussion.

2943
04:02:11,305 --> 04:02:12,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, thank you.

2944
04:02:12,585 --> 04:02:14,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Dello Russo.

2945
04:02:14,285 --> 04:02:15,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Just one suggestion, please.

2946
04:02:16,846 --> 04:02:22,768
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion that the city solicitor be sent this question

2947
04:02:23,448 --> 04:02:38,518
[SPEAKER_28]: as to how this questionnaire developed and what the standard was used to institute the query and ask for an answer from the city solicitor.

2948
04:02:39,999 --> 04:02:41,199
[SPEAKER_28]: This way we can get an answer.

2949
04:02:42,440 --> 04:02:46,882
[SPEAKER_28]: rather than be swallowed up by endless speculation and debate.

2950
04:02:48,202 --> 04:02:49,663
[SPEAKER_24]: What I'll do is respect that.

2951
04:02:49,703 --> 04:02:51,283
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not speculation and debate.

2952
04:02:51,763 --> 04:02:57,585
[SPEAKER_24]: And if the gentleman had students in the public schools, he would be looking out for the safety of students.

2953
04:02:58,126 --> 04:03:00,146
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's what my concern is, Mr. President.

2954
04:03:02,855 --> 04:03:05,898
[SPEAKER_30]: Ben, if you could tell me, the Cori check is required.

2955
04:03:05,938 --> 04:03:07,820
[SPEAKER_30]: What if the Cori check does not come back clean?

2956
04:03:07,900 --> 04:03:17,309
[SPEAKER_30]: Is the person now precluded from being able to utilize the studio, or is it just so that you know that there is someone in there that might have a questionable background that needs to be monitored more closely?

2957
04:03:17,329 --> 04:03:20,873
[SPEAKER_38]: The way the policy is written, they would be precluded from using the studio.

2958
04:03:21,594 --> 04:03:21,894
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2959
04:03:24,917 --> 04:03:26,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

2960
04:03:26,118 --> 04:03:26,399
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

2961
04:03:28,228 --> 04:03:32,629
[SPEAKER_11]: My name's Robert Pentez, Zero Summit, Rowan-Benton Mass, former member of this body.

2962
04:03:32,949 --> 04:03:37,350
[SPEAKER_11]: When we talk about security, again, you can walk into this building tonight, there's no security here at all.

2963
04:03:37,970 --> 04:03:39,651
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the first time this has happened.

2964
04:03:40,011 --> 04:03:43,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's been a pet peeve of Councilman Locke's relative to the security of the building.

2965
04:03:44,151 --> 04:03:44,972
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's number one.

2966
04:03:45,012 --> 04:03:53,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement, the demarcation bond.

2967
04:03:53,634 --> 04:03:54,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been query checked?

2968
04:03:56,113 --> 04:03:56,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you pass?

2969
04:03:57,633 --> 04:03:57,933
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

2970
04:03:58,834 --> 04:03:59,274
[SPEAKER_11]: He speaks.

2971
04:04:01,214 --> 04:04:01,414
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2972
04:04:02,434 --> 04:04:03,535
[SPEAKER_11]: The question becomes this.

2973
04:04:04,735 --> 04:04:05,755
[SPEAKER_11]: He's running the program.

2974
04:04:05,775 --> 04:04:06,655
[SPEAKER_11]: He's corporate checked.

2975
04:04:07,115 --> 04:04:07,636
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

2976
04:04:08,236 --> 04:04:11,616
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if you ask the question of surrounding cities and towns, they don't have this.

2977
04:04:12,157 --> 04:04:22,859
[SPEAKER_11]: And the question boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students.

2978
04:04:24,170 --> 04:04:36,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School, and I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will become quarry checked, okay?

2979
04:04:37,573 --> 04:04:46,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were and were they quarry checked and did they pass.

2980
04:04:46,819 --> 04:04:49,120
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, just making the comment is one thing.

2981
04:04:49,840 --> 04:04:51,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And the superintendent is absolutely right.

2982
04:04:52,560 --> 04:04:56,901
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked.

2983
04:04:57,261 --> 04:04:58,462
[SPEAKER_11]: This is public access.

2984
04:04:58,522 --> 04:05:00,882
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a Medford City Council meeting.

2985
04:05:00,902 --> 04:05:02,003
[SPEAKER_11]: It's public access.

2986
04:05:02,043 --> 04:05:03,043
[SPEAKER_11]: The people can see it.

2987
04:05:03,303 --> 04:05:06,964
[SPEAKER_11]: They can come in and they can talk the same way you can, too.

2988
04:05:08,004 --> 04:05:10,245
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got to follow the same rules.

2989
04:05:10,985 --> 04:05:15,626
[SPEAKER_11]: You, in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council.

2990
04:05:16,627 --> 04:05:30,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Now when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children.

2991
04:05:30,839 --> 04:05:32,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we'll give you a grant to that.

2992
04:05:33,962 --> 04:05:42,429
[SPEAKER_11]: But if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you gonna play it without having the quarry checked?

2993
04:05:49,456 --> 04:05:52,677
[SPEAKER_11]: If I can't answer it, I would have to go back to the city and ask.

2994
04:05:53,697 --> 04:05:55,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where the problem begins.

2995
04:05:55,818 --> 04:05:57,178
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to go back to the city.

2996
04:05:57,538 --> 04:05:59,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the gentleman who's the manager of the station.

2997
04:05:59,918 --> 04:06:02,079
[SPEAKER_11]: And these questions should be all readily available.

2998
04:06:02,439 --> 04:06:06,920
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played.

2999
04:06:07,280 --> 04:06:18,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights.

3000
04:06:19,763 --> 04:06:26,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former Channel 3.

3001
04:06:26,766 --> 04:06:28,687
[SPEAKER_11]: They did all those things to me.

3002
04:06:29,567 --> 04:06:32,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here.

3003
04:06:32,749 --> 04:06:36,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things.

3004
04:06:36,670 --> 04:06:46,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities, and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words.

3005
04:06:47,276 --> 04:06:58,285
[SPEAKER_11]: There I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played.

3006
04:06:59,025 --> 04:07:08,573
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something to

3007
04:07:12,502 --> 04:07:20,426
[SPEAKER_11]: If you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it, or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part.

3008
04:07:21,187 --> 04:07:32,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise.

3009
04:07:32,974 --> 04:07:34,315
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett.

3010
04:07:41,083 --> 04:07:51,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television.

3011
04:07:51,896 --> 04:08:00,026
[SPEAKER_11]: They may want to come in and, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever, just a one-shot deal.

3012
04:08:01,070 --> 04:08:10,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that one shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in at non-school hours, you're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check.

3013
04:08:11,718 --> 04:08:12,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Councilor Marks, you're absolutely right.

3014
04:08:13,399 --> 04:08:15,220
[SPEAKER_11]: You really need to know the genesis behind this.

3015
04:08:15,240 --> 04:08:17,322
[SPEAKER_11]: No city and town around this has this.

3016
04:08:18,363 --> 04:08:19,063
[SPEAKER_11]: This is crazy.

3017
04:08:19,844 --> 04:08:22,686
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not making any sense at all as to go through this.

3018
04:08:22,906 --> 04:08:25,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is going to really stifle free speech.

3019
04:08:25,548 --> 04:08:27,950
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to stifle your election coming up right now.

3020
04:08:29,195 --> 04:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_11]: for reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a carving check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be.

3021
04:08:37,687 --> 04:08:38,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you think about it.

3022
04:08:39,630 --> 04:08:40,971
[SPEAKER_11]: You've served all these years.

3023
04:08:42,482 --> 04:08:46,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you have to submit a Corby check to get into your local public access channel.

3024
04:08:47,465 --> 04:08:48,546
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes no sense at all.

3025
04:08:49,227 --> 04:08:51,848
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point.

3026
04:08:52,729 --> 04:08:55,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think the administration has the right to do this.

3027
04:08:55,931 --> 04:08:59,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you.

3028
04:09:00,854 --> 04:09:06,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this is the issuing authority.

3029
04:09:06,498 --> 04:09:07,859
[SPEAKER_11]: And who is the issuing authority?

3030
04:09:08,139 --> 04:09:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the mayor of this community.

3031
04:09:13,930 --> 04:09:23,578
[SPEAKER_11]: because you are on public access right now and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes.

3032
04:09:24,418 --> 04:09:32,645
[SPEAKER_11]: But to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a quarry check.

3033
04:09:33,045 --> 04:09:37,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford.

3034
04:09:38,129 --> 04:09:38,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

3035
04:09:39,630 --> 04:09:40,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

3036
04:09:41,992 --> 04:09:42,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Move approval.

3037
04:09:44,129 --> 04:09:45,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

3038
04:09:45,633 --> 04:09:50,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, my name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, and I just rushed here from band practice.

3039
04:09:51,402 --> 04:09:52,382
[SPEAKER_17]: We play once a year.

3040
04:09:53,183 --> 04:09:56,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Inside this phone's one of the best bands in New England, my band.

3041
04:09:56,904 --> 04:10:07,426
[SPEAKER_17]: And the key here is this, more than the Corey check, which is laughable, when I called Access Station and read it to them, they laughed, they fell over laughing.

3042
04:10:08,307 --> 04:10:09,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been in Access Television since 1979.

3043
04:10:10,067 --> 04:10:13,868
[SPEAKER_17]: In America, I'm one of the oldest producers.

3044
04:10:14,208 --> 04:10:15,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I produce over in Somerville.

3045
04:10:15,509 --> 04:10:17,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Ben Brown has five of my shows.

3046
04:10:17,509 --> 04:10:19,870
[SPEAKER_17]: So he played Steve Katz's from Arlington, great show.

3047
04:10:20,930 --> 04:10:24,452
[SPEAKER_17]: But he's hemming and hawing about playing my show, and it's like, come on.

3048
04:10:24,772 --> 04:10:27,954
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I've got Gilbert Gottfried on, and Ray Manzarek at the door.

3049
04:10:28,034 --> 04:10:30,415
[SPEAKER_17]: So you want me to go down with thousands of people I've had on?

3050
04:10:30,435 --> 04:10:33,937
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, tomorrow I've got Gentle Giant, a band that opened for Jethro Tull.

3051
04:10:34,357 --> 04:10:37,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week I had Jethro Tull's Martin Barron.

3052
04:10:37,379 --> 04:10:38,960
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm a famous rock critic.

3053
04:10:40,111 --> 04:10:41,511
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do community work.

3054
04:10:42,051 --> 04:11:03,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So my great community work for the Kitty Connection, which I do a lot of work for Marie, and I'm going to continue to, is stifled not only by the Corey check, but there's another element to that contract which threatens to sue you if, oh, someone thinks you've intimidated a witness, and God knows I prevailed in court over that when someone fraudulently sued me.

3055
04:11:04,414 --> 04:11:06,015
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's the kind of thing that can happen.

3056
04:11:06,035 --> 04:11:13,259
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you do a show and someone doesn't like that, you say, oh, I saw the city council president skip out on a vote to pay the part, which I did.

3057
04:11:13,959 --> 04:11:20,623
[SPEAKER_17]: If you say that on TV, the city council president could probably sue me because he doesn't like what I said, but he'd be wrong in doing that.

3058
04:11:20,663 --> 04:11:21,504
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my free speech.

3059
04:11:21,984 --> 04:11:23,865
[SPEAKER_17]: So then you have to pay for your attorney.

3060
04:11:24,205 --> 04:11:28,708
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the contract, you must pay for the city hall's attorney if my reading is correct.

3061
04:11:29,228 --> 04:11:30,510
[SPEAKER_17]: What planet are we on?

3062
04:11:30,830 --> 04:11:34,614
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm one of the oldest producers in the history of friggin' public access.

3063
04:11:35,054 --> 04:11:36,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Pardon my friggin' French.

3064
04:11:36,936 --> 04:11:43,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've seen many a producer's indemnification agreement and this is wholesale censorship.

3065
04:11:43,783 --> 04:11:49,709
[SPEAKER_17]: And may I quote the city solicitor, I would find the city squelching free speech.

3066
04:11:50,543 --> 04:11:51,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Repugnant.

3067
04:11:52,044 --> 04:11:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Rumley, you're the author of censorship.

3068
04:11:54,245 --> 04:11:55,406
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you talking about?

3069
04:11:55,426 --> 04:11:58,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I believe in public access.

3070
04:11:59,168 --> 04:12:04,871
[SPEAKER_17]: So if a grandma wants to do a cooking show, you insult her by cory-checking her.

3071
04:12:04,891 --> 04:12:05,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's she gonna hurt?

3072
04:12:05,932 --> 04:12:06,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Number one.

3073
04:12:06,993 --> 04:12:17,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, to have a grandma sign this thing, and if someone's just deciding they're gonna be a bully, and they don't like her grandson or her husband, and they sue her,

3074
04:12:18,583 --> 04:12:28,885
[SPEAKER_17]: That poor family has to go through what I've gone through, paying thousands of dollars in legal bills, because I've fought for public access harder than any person in Medford for the past 15 years.

3075
04:12:29,265 --> 04:12:33,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And the 600 grand we have came because I kept the fight alive.

3076
04:12:33,666 --> 04:12:38,507
[SPEAKER_17]: And then a city councilor came in, and Doreen Wade came in, and we brought down TV3.

3077
04:12:38,587 --> 04:12:40,168
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why the 600 grand.

3078
04:12:40,468 --> 04:12:42,608
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to talk about someone who's really upset?

3079
04:12:42,968 --> 04:12:46,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I've given a quarter of my life to Medford.

3080
04:12:47,855 --> 04:12:50,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've given thousands of dollars in legal bills.

3081
04:12:50,156 --> 04:12:50,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And I win.

3082
04:12:50,716 --> 04:12:54,477
[SPEAKER_17]: I won against the TV station manager in Superior Court.

3083
04:12:54,857 --> 04:12:56,858
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a restraining order on the next manager.

3084
04:12:57,298 --> 04:13:01,619
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I have to file restraining orders on the mayor and the new manager, so be it.

3085
04:13:01,999 --> 04:13:03,419
[SPEAKER_17]: My show has to be played.

3086
04:13:03,479 --> 04:13:04,540
[SPEAKER_17]: You have my show.

3087
04:13:05,140 --> 04:13:06,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I've done nothing wrong.

3088
04:13:06,300 --> 04:13:07,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a good human being.

3089
04:13:07,601 --> 04:13:08,521
[SPEAKER_17]: How dare you?

3090
04:13:08,961 --> 04:13:11,722
[SPEAKER_17]: How dare you not play my show in this city?

3091
04:13:12,799 --> 04:13:24,207
[SPEAKER_17]: My God, I have sweat blood for public access TV, and I will not be intimidated and bullied and dragged into court by people who aren't even fit to shine my shoes.

3092
04:13:25,988 --> 04:13:27,890
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will see them in court in another venue.

3093
04:13:28,430 --> 04:13:30,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I want the access, I want it now.

3094
04:13:31,072 --> 04:13:35,135
[SPEAKER_17]: The candidates running for office are being denied.

3095
04:13:36,096 --> 04:13:38,377
[SPEAKER_17]: They were denied the primary election.

3096
04:13:38,397 --> 04:13:41,680
[SPEAKER_17]: So all the incumbents came in, including Mrs. Cuno,

3097
04:13:43,238 --> 04:13:47,380
[SPEAKER_17]: But the people that don't get the traction did not get it.

3098
04:13:48,320 --> 04:13:55,362
[SPEAKER_17]: While I've been fighting day after day after day to get public access in this city, I will not stand for it.

3099
04:13:55,823 --> 04:13:59,044
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I had to sue a smirking Dello Russo, I will sue him.

3100
04:14:00,024 --> 04:14:01,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm tired, I'm fed up.

3101
04:14:02,479 --> 04:14:05,181
[SPEAKER_17]: You, Mr. Dello Russo, said we need a young man to do access.

3102
04:14:05,241 --> 04:14:07,722
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Mr. Dello Russo, I'm the authority here.

3103
04:14:08,283 --> 04:14:09,363
[SPEAKER_17]: You know about undertaking.

3104
04:14:09,443 --> 04:14:10,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I know about public access.

3105
04:14:11,144 --> 04:14:11,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I am the authority.

3106
04:14:12,245 --> 04:14:18,369
[SPEAKER_17]: We need an older person that knows public access, that knows the rules, and that wants to facilitate programming.

3107
04:14:18,389 --> 04:14:19,109
[SPEAKER_17]: That's his job.

3108
04:14:19,809 --> 04:14:21,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Outreach is his job.

3109
04:14:21,851 --> 04:14:26,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And that contract, that indemnification agreement, is the antithesis of outreach.

3110
04:14:27,454 --> 04:14:30,176
[SPEAKER_17]: I just played in one of the best rock and roll bands in Boston.

3111
04:14:31,274 --> 04:14:31,674
[SPEAKER_17]: just now.

3112
04:14:31,694 --> 04:14:32,655
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to come over here.

3113
04:14:32,715 --> 04:14:33,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny Byers called me.

3114
04:14:34,035 --> 04:14:36,397
[SPEAKER_17]: That poor kid wants to put his sports show on the air.

3115
04:14:36,437 --> 04:14:37,457
[SPEAKER_17]: We are denying him now.

3116
04:14:38,178 --> 04:14:40,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone who subscribes to this is denying him now.

3117
04:14:43,040 --> 04:14:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: This has to end.

3118
04:14:44,601 --> 04:14:45,522
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to end now.

3119
04:14:45,622 --> 04:14:49,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I have to file an injunction, so help me God, I will.

3120
04:14:50,584 --> 04:14:51,725
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty good in the courtroom.

3121
04:14:53,600 --> 04:14:55,802
[SPEAKER_17]: as someone here knows very well.

3122
04:14:56,803 --> 04:15:01,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will not stand for this and the smirking and the censorship at this very city council.

3123
04:15:01,648 --> 04:15:03,089
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's have access TV.

3124
04:15:03,470 --> 04:15:06,172
[SPEAKER_17]: If Ben Brown can't answer the questions, he should just quit.

3125
04:15:06,793 --> 04:15:10,076
[SPEAKER_17]: He couldn't tell me how a Verizon contract works.

3126
04:15:10,537 --> 04:15:12,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So I sent him to Hingham and I sent him Malden.

3127
04:15:13,099 --> 04:15:15,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm only music director over in, uh,

3128
04:15:16,342 --> 04:15:22,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Malden's live on tape, and I'm music director over at Boston Free Radio, and I do my show in Somerville.

3129
04:15:22,424 --> 04:15:35,147
[SPEAKER_17]: So why should I be denied a show when I do it in Somerville, when I have six memberships, when you could learn so much from me, young man, you could learn so much from me, but you'd rather take the blood money and censor us.

3130
04:15:35,607 --> 04:15:36,907
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what I have to say tonight.

3131
04:15:37,787 --> 04:15:40,028
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to know about AXS TV, give me a call.

3132
04:15:40,088 --> 04:15:40,748
[SPEAKER_17]: You know where I am.

3133
04:15:41,538 --> 04:15:48,822
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have access to TV, we're not going to have censorship, and Stephanie Burke will be held accountable if this nonsense continues.

3134
04:15:49,683 --> 04:15:51,224
[SPEAKER_17]: So help me God.

3135
04:15:51,804 --> 04:15:54,065
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, a couple of questions for the gentleman at the podium.

3136
04:15:54,125 --> 04:15:59,128
[SPEAKER_30]: It sounds like, based upon the presentation, that you haven't signed the producer in indemnification form.

3137
04:16:00,129 --> 04:16:00,609
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that correct?

3138
04:16:00,789 --> 04:16:00,949
[SPEAKER_35]: Yep.

3139
04:16:01,710 --> 04:16:05,652
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you did, you'd be subjecting yourself to a Corey check, is that correct?

3140
04:16:06,460 --> 04:16:08,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the Cori check, who cares?

3141
04:16:08,122 --> 04:16:12,146
[SPEAKER_30]: What I'm more concerned about, sir... Just bear with me for a minute.

3142
04:16:12,166 --> 04:16:13,547
[SPEAKER_17]: City Hall has my Cori, come on.

3143
04:16:13,567 --> 04:16:15,129
[SPEAKER_30]: Just bear with me for a second, sir.

3144
04:16:16,390 --> 04:16:20,134
[SPEAKER_30]: You'd have to take a Cori check if you signed up for the producer identification form, right?

3145
04:16:20,154 --> 04:16:20,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Who cares?

3146
04:16:20,414 --> 04:16:21,235
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not a big deal.

3147
04:16:21,275 --> 04:16:22,096
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you pass the Cori check?

3148
04:16:23,787 --> 04:16:24,387
[SPEAKER_30]: Of course I can.

3149
04:16:24,467 --> 04:16:26,248
[SPEAKER_30]: You can, Mr. Corry.

3150
04:16:26,328 --> 04:16:27,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Unlike you, Mr. Knight, I think I can.

3151
04:16:28,028 --> 04:16:28,708
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm worried about you.

3152
04:16:28,728 --> 04:16:29,728
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not worried about you.

3153
04:16:29,768 --> 04:16:30,609
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm concerned about you.

3154
04:16:30,809 --> 04:16:32,849
[SPEAKER_30]: I actually worked for the school department for a couple of years.

3155
04:16:32,929 --> 04:16:33,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you do.

3156
04:16:33,469 --> 04:16:34,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I've actually passed the Corry check.

3157
04:16:34,650 --> 04:16:39,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, you know, when people put signs against bus stops, people should be held accountable.

3158
04:16:39,831 --> 04:16:41,451
[SPEAKER_17]: You break the rules, I play by the rules.

3159
04:16:41,531 --> 04:16:41,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

3160
04:16:42,091 --> 04:16:45,252
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank Councilor Brianna Longo-Curran for putting this on the thing.

3161
04:16:45,292 --> 04:16:49,373
[SPEAKER_17]: But the thing that concerns me is not the Corry check and you trying to embarrass people all the time.

3162
04:16:49,393 --> 04:16:50,393
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, I do believe I have the floor.

3163
04:16:50,413 --> 04:16:51,614
[SPEAKER_17]: You ignorant person.

3164
04:16:51,634 --> 04:16:52,794
[SPEAKER_30]: I do believe I have the floor, Mr. President.

3165
04:16:53,594 --> 04:16:55,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight has the floor, Mr. Biglioni.

3166
04:16:56,238 --> 04:16:58,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight has the floor at the particular moment.

3167
04:16:58,801 --> 04:16:59,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Was he congratulating someone?

3168
04:17:00,483 --> 04:17:01,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Or did someone die?

3169
04:17:01,244 --> 04:17:03,827
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm congratulating you on your excellent presentation this evening.

3170
04:17:03,847 --> 04:17:05,389
[SPEAKER_30]: I do appreciate you coming out here this evening.

3171
04:17:05,409 --> 04:17:07,312
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been very enlightening.

3172
04:17:07,352 --> 04:17:07,933
[SPEAKER_30]: What are they called?

3173
04:17:09,150 --> 04:17:13,952
[SPEAKER_17]: We're called Love and Flame, and we were one of Boston's five best bands in Playboy magazine, 1978.

3174
04:17:14,212 --> 04:17:15,632
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good year.

3175
04:17:15,652 --> 04:17:18,633
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the year I was born.

3176
04:17:19,453 --> 04:17:26,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I know a little bit more about dancing on stage, too, so I think I gave a pretty good performance here tonight, after I sang all Lou Reed's songs on my own.

3177
04:17:26,075 --> 04:17:27,356
[SPEAKER_30]: Sounds like you had a good night.

3178
04:17:27,396 --> 04:17:28,036
[SPEAKER_30]: Congratulations.

3179
04:17:28,076 --> 04:17:28,416
[SPEAKER_30]: I really do.

3180
04:17:28,436 --> 04:17:29,917
[SPEAKER_17]: The band is unbelievable.

3181
04:17:30,057 --> 04:17:30,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

3182
04:17:30,457 --> 04:17:34,418
[SPEAKER_30]: It's nice of you to come up here and put that aside to come up here and share with us, so I do appreciate that, Mr.

3183
04:17:34,658 --> 04:17:38,041
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I wish I could teach you how to talk in a mic, too, Ms.

3184
04:17:38,081 --> 04:17:38,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Linda.

3185
04:17:38,542 --> 04:17:39,683
[SPEAKER_17]: You talk way too fast.

3186
04:17:39,743 --> 04:17:40,744
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to articulate.

3187
04:17:43,885 --> 04:17:48,148
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. President, this is bringing me to my point, Mr. President.

3188
04:17:48,468 --> 04:17:51,109
[SPEAKER_30]: I fail to see how this is helping move Medford forward.

3189
04:17:51,409 --> 04:17:56,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll move Medford forward with Kitty Connection and with all the personality stuff I do with people on the street.

3190
04:17:56,872 --> 04:17:57,833
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to help the city.

3191
04:17:58,313 --> 04:17:59,133
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to help the city.

3192
04:17:59,414 --> 04:18:00,514
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't congratulate people.

3193
04:18:00,534 --> 04:18:01,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I work hard for people.

3194
04:18:01,895 --> 04:18:02,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep it up.

3195
04:18:02,815 --> 04:18:04,136
[SPEAKER_17]: I congratulate you for your hard work.

3196
04:18:04,156 --> 04:18:08,258
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing that worries me is not the quarry check as much as the legal aspect of that.

3197
04:18:08,839 --> 04:18:10,740
[SPEAKER_17]: That is the thing that worries me, Mr. Knight.

3198
04:18:11,260 --> 04:18:12,921
[SPEAKER_17]: The quarry check, City Hall has my quarry.

3199
04:18:13,041 --> 04:18:13,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's Skidding Hall?

3200
04:18:14,162 --> 04:18:14,723
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

3201
04:18:14,803 --> 04:18:15,804
[SPEAKER_29]: I was just asking a question.

3202
04:18:16,044 --> 04:18:17,065
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in court with someone.

3203
04:18:17,165 --> 04:18:17,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course they do.

3204
04:18:18,145 --> 04:18:19,346
[SPEAKER_17]: But that doesn't worry me.

3205
04:18:19,366 --> 04:18:21,488
[SPEAKER_17]: What worries me, what concerns me, is more lawsuits.

3206
04:18:22,209 --> 04:18:24,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you shouldn't go to Axis and be sued like TV3 did.

3207
04:18:24,951 --> 04:18:26,632
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what Mrs. Burke is setting up here.

3208
04:18:27,333 --> 04:18:27,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's wrong.

3209
04:18:28,133 --> 04:18:32,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm trying to facilitate programming for 60,000 people in Medford, and I want to help the candidates out.

3210
04:18:33,037 --> 04:18:37,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. McKillip, Cheryl Rodriguez, Ray Scarfo, they all deserve Axis TV.

3211
04:18:37,621 --> 04:18:38,401
[SPEAKER_17]: What else is happening?

3212
04:18:38,421 --> 04:18:40,463
[SPEAKER_17]: The quarry thing is kind of like a stumbling block

3213
04:18:44,417 --> 04:18:45,458
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't find it to be scary either.

3214
04:18:45,478 --> 04:18:48,261
[SPEAKER_30]: That's why I was just trying to get a little bit more clarification.

3215
04:18:48,501 --> 04:18:49,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't know.

3216
04:18:49,262 --> 04:18:50,122
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't speak for 60,000 people.

3217
04:19:03,495 --> 04:19:06,597
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't scare me, you, but it would scare the community, and that's not right.

3218
04:19:06,617 --> 04:19:14,522
[SPEAKER_30]: It doesn't sound very scary to me, but I do appreciate Councilman Longocare bringing this matter forward, and I do appreciate Mr. Brown for being up here this evening as well, because I think he did a great presentation.

3219
04:19:15,122 --> 04:19:16,663
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you very much, Mr. Brown.

3220
04:19:17,824 --> 04:19:18,965
[SPEAKER_30]: Name and address of the record, please.

3221
04:19:20,566 --> 04:19:24,308
[SPEAKER_08]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

3222
04:19:26,069 --> 04:19:27,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you just gave it to me.

3223
04:19:31,293 --> 04:19:39,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, I had a couple of conversations with Ben Brown, and a couple of really great conversations.

3224
04:19:40,517 --> 04:19:46,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that Ben has a long road ahead of him in the respect of trying to get TV3 up and running.

3225
04:19:46,719 --> 04:19:51,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with him in one respect, that there should be some modicum

3226
04:19:53,242 --> 04:19:56,844
[SPEAKER_08]: independence from the city, although it can't be completely.

3227
04:19:56,864 --> 04:20:04,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be a non-profit organization with a board of directors and I believe hopefully someday we'll get there and that will help in that respect.

3228
04:20:05,069 --> 04:20:14,695
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the Corey check goes, the conversations that Ben and I had, because I believe all candidates, both incumbent and ones that are running for positions,

3229
04:20:15,415 --> 04:20:20,236
[SPEAKER_08]: are very excited about the opportunity of Medford Media.

3230
04:20:20,696 --> 04:20:21,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I saying it correct, Ben?

3231
04:20:22,136 --> 04:20:22,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Media.

3232
04:20:24,117 --> 04:20:27,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody should be excited about it, as well as the community itself.

3233
04:20:28,277 --> 04:20:33,658
[SPEAKER_08]: However, when I had those conversations, what I was asking Ben is, how do we get involved in it?

3234
04:20:33,718 --> 04:20:35,319
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we get to be a part of it?

3235
04:20:35,639 --> 04:20:41,300
[SPEAKER_08]: The first conversation was based off of this contract that City Solicitor Rumley had

3236
04:20:42,600 --> 04:20:46,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Ben did call me and tell me that he finally got it in his hands, whatever that timeframe was.

3237
04:20:46,722 --> 04:20:55,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the next question I asked, quite specifically, how can candidates get involved now that we have some leeway?

3238
04:20:55,727 --> 04:21:02,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first response was, my plan is, Dave, to try to get all the candidates to submit

3239
04:21:06,333 --> 04:21:14,865
[SPEAKER_08]: a film stating what they would like to project for their candidacy, and that way there he could air it the first two weeks in October.

3240
04:21:14,925 --> 04:21:17,648
[SPEAKER_08]: My first question was, my God, that's so many candidates.

3241
04:21:17,768 --> 04:21:20,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to be able to pull this off starting the end of this week, hopefully?

3242
04:21:22,102 --> 04:21:36,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my next question was specifically, well, what happens, and I'm sorry if I throw you under the bus, Councilor Marks, but what happens if Michael Marks asks, how do I get myself on TV and do a call-in show or something like that?

3243
04:21:37,131 --> 04:21:41,434
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a little hemming and hawing because he wasn't quite sure of the answer as of that point.

3244
04:21:42,114 --> 04:21:44,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Nowhere in that conversation did it state a Corey check.

3245
04:21:44,816 --> 04:21:45,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody here,

3246
04:21:46,797 --> 04:21:54,442
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm wrong, please correct me, but I think that everybody knows that a CORI check takes some time, not 24 hours, maybe not even a week.

3247
04:21:56,003 --> 04:21:56,764
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 hours for sure?

3248
04:21:56,784 --> 04:22:00,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so then I stand corrected.

3249
04:22:00,827 --> 04:22:01,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I apologize.

3250
04:22:02,228 --> 04:22:07,211
[SPEAKER_08]: But that would be, you know, the first step is to get that out of the way and get everybody up and running because...

3251
04:22:09,085 --> 04:22:17,668
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are going to submit a copy, and we all have to be quarried on that, and we're not even in the building, that doesn't make any sense to me.

3252
04:22:17,708 --> 04:22:20,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we are coming into the building, and it is a one-shot deal.

3253
04:22:20,449 --> 04:22:25,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see candidates coming in once a week to start a show.

3254
04:22:25,890 --> 04:22:27,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's a one-shot deal.

3255
04:22:27,391 --> 04:22:32,493
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to come in, and they want to present their case in the respect of how they'd like to see Medford move forward.

3256
04:22:34,321 --> 04:22:36,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that Medford has to be better than this.

3257
04:22:36,503 --> 04:22:43,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this hemming and hawing about Medford media has got to stop.

3258
04:22:43,351 --> 04:22:45,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, let's just move it forward now.

3259
04:22:45,393 --> 04:22:49,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's stop this constant trying to find a way to

3260
04:22:50,378 --> 04:22:55,339
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out how it's going to delay the process a little bit longer, a little bit longer, a little bit longer.

3261
04:22:55,379 --> 04:22:57,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have somebody that really wants to move it forward.

3262
04:22:57,900 --> 04:23:01,041
[SPEAKER_08]: His vision seems in my mind to be a progressive vision.

3263
04:23:01,681 --> 04:23:04,761
[SPEAKER_08]: He believes that, you know, the technology has to come to a different level.

3264
04:23:05,021 --> 04:23:05,882
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of work to do.

3265
04:23:05,922 --> 04:23:09,342
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the same respect, it's got to be launched and it's got to be launched now.

3266
04:23:09,482 --> 04:23:10,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's time.

3267
04:23:10,903 --> 04:23:17,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think all of the including the mayor would probably want to see everyone be able to use this.

3268
04:23:17,364 --> 04:23:19,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And I and I would ask Mayor Stephanie Burke to

3269
04:23:20,685 --> 04:23:26,428
[SPEAKER_08]: make a comment that she can't wait to see us all get on here as well because that's really what this is about.

3270
04:23:26,608 --> 04:23:41,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody should be able to use this and be able to show the people in Medford that may not be able to come to different events and different venues that want to sit at home or can't do anything but sit at home but want to listen and want to learn.

3271
04:23:41,276 --> 04:23:43,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that surprised me more than anything else

3272
04:23:44,137 --> 04:23:53,644
[SPEAKER_08]: and Ben can attest to this, is how fascinating the fact that Medford residents love to watch this media.

3273
04:23:53,884 --> 04:23:55,525
[SPEAKER_08]: They absolutely love watching it.

3274
04:23:55,885 --> 04:24:01,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is viable, it's incredibly important, it needs to move forward, it needs to move forward now.

3275
04:24:01,509 --> 04:24:05,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that we've got the contracts and anybody that wants to get involved, let's get this ball rolling.

3276
04:24:05,692 --> 04:24:06,573
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really all I can say.

3277
04:24:12,510 --> 04:24:13,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

3278
04:24:13,852 --> 04:24:20,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 4th Street.

3279
04:24:24,625 --> 04:24:26,308
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm not afraid of my Cori check.

3280
04:24:26,388 --> 04:24:27,169
[SPEAKER_23]: I get it every year.

3281
04:24:28,410 --> 04:24:36,575
[SPEAKER_23]: a very active volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School, and I'm fortunate enough to be a stay-at-home mom and able to go into the school during the school day to submit my CORI.

3282
04:24:37,136 --> 04:24:43,820
[SPEAKER_23]: My husband, Alex, works outside the home, and he usually has to work from home or something if he wants to get his CORI.

3283
04:24:44,728 --> 04:24:46,529
[SPEAKER_23]: because it's only offered during the school hours.

3284
04:24:46,589 --> 04:24:50,211
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm concerned about possibly hours that people will be able to do quarries.

3285
04:24:50,291 --> 04:24:53,632
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure if everyone knows that you do have to submit a quarry in person.

3286
04:24:54,032 --> 04:24:56,474
[SPEAKER_23]: You have to show a physical copy of your ID.

3287
04:24:57,174 --> 04:25:02,516
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we wanna make sure that this is accessible, there needs to be multiple hours.

3288
04:25:03,077 --> 04:25:13,862
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure why if you're not coming in the building, you would need one, but just logistically speaking, it can be difficult for people to do the quarries in person if there are not evening hours, weekend hours, things like that.

3289
04:25:14,755 --> 04:25:14,955
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.

3290
04:25:18,678 --> 04:25:23,761
[SPEAKER_21]: President, let me just make a couple quick comments on CORI so everyone understands how CORIs work, okay?

3291
04:25:24,461 --> 04:25:26,583
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, a CORI check is very quick.

3292
04:25:26,603 --> 04:25:36,569
[SPEAKER_21]: You fill out the paperwork, you bring in your material, obviously identification is required to ensure that you are actually the person who is being CORI checked.

3293
04:25:37,269 --> 04:25:38,750
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just a safeguard.

3294
04:25:39,271 --> 04:25:41,212
[SPEAKER_21]: You get it back in about 24 hours or less.

3295
04:25:42,332 --> 04:25:43,793
[SPEAKER_21]: It's that quick, right?

3296
04:25:44,153 --> 04:25:56,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if you're denied employment or volunteer status on a Cori check, what happens is you then can be told why you're denied, and you have a right to appeal it.

3297
04:25:57,764 --> 04:26:00,125
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I can't share a Cori.

3298
04:26:00,165 --> 04:26:05,590
[SPEAKER_21]: If I get a Cori, and I'm the person who reviews Coris in the school department, I can't share that Cori with anybody.

3299
04:26:05,610 --> 04:26:07,571
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to look at it.

3300
04:26:08,171 --> 04:26:09,012
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give you an example.

3301
04:26:09,052 --> 04:26:10,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Typically, DUI.

3302
04:26:11,924 --> 04:26:14,866
[SPEAKER_21]: insurance violation, failure to register your car.

3303
04:26:14,886 --> 04:26:16,948
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of those things that show up.

3304
04:26:17,008 --> 04:26:25,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Those things are not terribly important to me unless, in fact, you're driving a bus or you're doing something that might be related to the particular offense.

3305
04:26:25,734 --> 04:26:28,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously, substances, things of that type.

3306
04:26:28,697 --> 04:26:34,901
[SPEAKER_21]: And when it happened, how it happened, did it happen last week, last year, or did it happen 20 years ago when you were a kid?

3307
04:26:34,921 --> 04:26:36,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, those things are different.

3308
04:26:37,043 --> 04:26:38,304
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously, you look at those things.

3309
04:26:38,704 --> 04:26:39,725
[SPEAKER_21]: But let's say you're denied.

3310
04:26:40,501 --> 04:26:42,302
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a right to get your Cory check.

3311
04:26:42,922 --> 04:26:45,043
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a right to make it public yourself.

3312
04:26:45,543 --> 04:26:50,926
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you're denied for something stupid or something you think is discriminatory, you can make that public.

3313
04:26:51,686 --> 04:26:52,847
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't, but you can.

3314
04:26:53,667 --> 04:26:59,570
[SPEAKER_21]: So any issuing authority has to keep it quiet, has to look at it that way.

3315
04:26:59,610 --> 04:27:02,691
[SPEAKER_21]: But an individual who's affected by it has every right to protest.

3316
04:27:03,910 --> 04:27:08,294
[SPEAKER_21]: that, in fact, that Corey was denied for some superficial reason.

3317
04:27:08,894 --> 04:27:09,975
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's important to know that.

3318
04:27:10,736 --> 04:27:16,921
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can't discriminate just simply because, you know, I don't like you because you're a person who says things that I don't like.

3319
04:27:17,682 --> 04:27:21,685
[SPEAKER_21]: It has to be a substantive reason or a person has a right to appeal it.

3320
04:27:22,446 --> 04:27:26,149
[SPEAKER_21]: And oftentimes, people come in and they say, you know, that happened so many years ago.

3321
04:27:27,049 --> 04:27:28,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been this way for so many times.

3322
04:27:28,851 --> 04:27:29,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you give me a chance?

3323
04:27:30,652 --> 04:27:31,113
[SPEAKER_21]: That happens.

3324
04:27:32,155 --> 04:27:34,397
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want you to understand how that process works.

3325
04:27:34,958 --> 04:27:38,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Now within the school system, everybody has to be fingerprinted as well.

3326
04:27:39,221 --> 04:27:40,122
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an FBI job.

3327
04:27:41,503 --> 04:27:44,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Not volunteers, but people who are employees.

3328
04:27:44,406 --> 04:27:44,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Fingerprinted.

3329
04:27:45,827 --> 04:27:50,191
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a whole series of things that have to go on in our world.

3330
04:27:51,376 --> 04:27:52,817
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the nature of society today.

3331
04:27:53,178 --> 04:27:54,819
[SPEAKER_21]: People are very concerned about safety.

3332
04:27:54,839 --> 04:27:59,063
[SPEAKER_21]: They're very concerned about who's there, who's in contact with their young people.

3333
04:27:59,724 --> 04:28:00,905
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's a lot of steps involved.

3334
04:28:00,945 --> 04:28:09,834
[SPEAKER_21]: But you do have a right to protest an adverse decision on your car for each other.

3335
04:28:09,854 --> 04:28:10,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

3336
04:28:11,175 --> 04:28:12,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

3337
04:28:12,816 --> 04:28:13,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's late.

3338
04:28:14,849 --> 04:28:19,750
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just get an update, I want to thank Ben for being here and answering questions as well as the superintendent.

3339
04:28:21,071 --> 04:28:30,393
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just get an update with regards to outreach to the public to let people know that there is a process in place, how they can apply.

3340
04:28:30,413 --> 04:28:32,614
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people don't really know about this.

3341
04:28:32,654 --> 04:28:34,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We've kind of bring it to light tonight.

3342
04:28:36,199 --> 04:28:41,901
[SPEAKER_07]: There was word that there might be a candidates clip that you're going to accept, so obviously reach out to the candidates.

3343
04:28:42,001 --> 04:28:49,784
[SPEAKER_07]: But with regards to the general public, if they want to become a member, if they want to do a show, want to put a tape in, what type of outreach will you be doing?

3344
04:28:49,824 --> 04:28:50,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Will there be a reverse 911 call?

3345
04:28:52,332 --> 04:29:08,944
[SPEAKER_38]: So as far as the open house goes, we're going to invite the delegation from the school committee and the city council, as well as the mayor's office and other people that we can get off of lists from around the community.

3346
04:29:11,307 --> 04:29:15,770
[SPEAKER_38]: After that, we'll hold several nights for different groups of people.

3347
04:29:15,830 --> 04:29:17,972
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll hold a night for nonprofit organizations.

3348
04:29:18,012 --> 04:29:32,261
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll hold a, you know, just meet and greet nights where I do plan on working with the Arts Council as well as the Chamber of Commerce to try to get the word out there as much as I can.

3349
04:29:33,582 --> 04:29:40,107
[SPEAKER_38]: And yeah, my hope is that that will generate enough organic

3350
04:29:41,900 --> 04:29:42,200
[SPEAKER_38]: response.

3351
04:29:42,681 --> 04:29:56,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, as a resolve, I'd just like to see if we could put out a reverse 911 call before the open house and let people know that applications can be submitted either at the open house or in person anytime and with the hours of operation of TV3.

3352
04:29:57,593 --> 04:30:01,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can get this up and running and help Ben with his endeavor.

3353
04:30:01,095 --> 04:30:03,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

3354
04:30:04,638 --> 04:30:06,339
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Lingo-Curran.

3355
04:30:06,359 --> 04:30:08,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

3356
04:30:19,555 --> 04:30:20,776
[SPEAKER_11]: have a quarry check or not?

3357
04:30:20,796 --> 04:30:22,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you just said you were going to invite the men over there.

3358
04:30:22,757 --> 04:30:25,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that going to be required of a candidate running for office?

3359
04:30:26,980 --> 04:30:28,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Incumbent, newcomer?

3360
04:30:31,803 --> 04:30:32,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I believe it will.

3361
04:30:34,465 --> 04:30:38,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight we had you folks up here with your public access.

3362
04:30:39,228 --> 04:30:42,711
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had, right down the hall, we had the band playing, practicing.

3363
04:30:44,092 --> 04:30:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: You followed the rules, and you guys were all in violation tonight because you didn't have a quarry check.

3364
04:30:49,480 --> 04:30:53,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is where the situation is going to become really sticky and technical.

3365
04:30:54,604 --> 04:30:55,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Why the quarry check?

3366
04:30:55,565 --> 04:30:57,346
[SPEAKER_11]: No other city in town around this has it.

3367
04:30:57,607 --> 04:30:58,888
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at their applications.

3368
04:31:00,529 --> 04:31:05,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you guys in Bureau, you're candidates as well as candidates for re-election.

3369
04:31:05,253 --> 04:31:07,254
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all going to have to have a quarry check.

3370
04:31:08,715 --> 04:31:10,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And I disagree with you for 24 hours.

3371
04:31:11,878 --> 04:31:12,478
[SPEAKER_11]: For the time being.

3372
04:31:14,040 --> 04:31:14,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

3373
04:31:14,500 --> 04:31:17,803
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Locario, seconded by Councilor Falco.

3374
04:31:19,141 --> 04:31:19,781
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

3375
04:31:21,363 --> 04:31:21,983
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

3376
04:31:22,103 --> 04:31:22,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

3377
04:31:23,004 --> 04:31:23,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

3378
04:31:23,804 --> 04:31:24,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

3379
04:31:24,365 --> 04:31:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can move a suspension of rules that takes 17-648, I'm going to table my last four since it's almost midnight.

3380
04:31:31,630 --> 04:31:31,650
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-648.

3381
04:31:35,773 --> 04:31:38,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Petitions, presentations, and civil matters.

3382
04:31:38,595 --> 04:31:38,815
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-648.

3383
04:31:39,215 --> 04:31:47,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Petition by Andrew P. Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, to address the council to ask a question.

3384
04:31:49,758 --> 04:31:50,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Casey Diddy.

3385
04:32:31,957 --> 04:32:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to re-ask a question that I brought forward to the council at the last meeting.

3386
04:32:38,942 --> 04:32:46,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was simply, for a council, councilor I ask to bring forward the question.

3387
04:32:46,708 --> 04:32:48,570
I don't have that power or authority.

3388
04:32:50,411 --> 04:32:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: To ask the mayor, why isn't new growth, brand new real estate tax used to offset any proposed

3389
04:33:09,174 --> 04:33:11,414
[SPEAKER_05]: The council voted for it.

3390
04:33:11,855 --> 04:33:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to know, was that question actually sent to the mayor?

3391
04:33:17,757 --> 04:33:18,297
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Clerk.

3392
04:33:18,477 --> 04:33:19,898
[SPEAKER_30]: The minutes haven't been adopted.

3393
04:33:20,598 --> 04:33:21,118
[SPEAKER_30]: I do not know.

3394
04:33:21,378 --> 04:33:22,999
[SPEAKER_30]: The minutes haven't been adopted from the last meeting.

3395
04:33:23,859 --> 04:33:24,960
[SPEAKER_30]: Until we get official minutes.

3396
04:33:24,980 --> 04:33:30,622
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, the minutes were not adopted from the last meeting, so that question would not have gone to the mayor.

3397
04:33:32,570 --> 04:33:35,314
[SPEAKER_19]: After tonight when the minutes get adopted.

3398
04:33:35,354 --> 04:33:36,456
[SPEAKER_19]: The minutes weren't adopted.

3399
04:33:38,258 --> 04:33:39,119
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be adopted.

3400
04:33:39,340 --> 04:33:44,507
[SPEAKER_05]: My question, hopefully, is indeed inside the minutes.

3401
04:33:44,547 --> 04:33:45,488
[SPEAKER_19]: It is inside those minutes.

3402
04:33:45,528 --> 04:33:46,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you sure of that, Councilor?

3403
04:33:46,950 --> 04:33:47,591
[SPEAKER_19]: I would hope so.

3404
04:33:49,874 --> 04:33:51,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Clerk Finn does a very good job with his records.

3405
04:33:52,776 --> 04:34:02,685
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's not, I'm sure, Councilor Lungo-Koehn will, I think she, Councilor Lungo-Koehn is reviewing it right as we speak.

3406
04:34:02,705 --> 04:34:04,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

3407
04:34:04,987 --> 04:34:06,789
[SPEAKER_24]: You have another question, Mr. Castagnetti?

3408
04:34:07,409 --> 04:34:07,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

3409
04:34:07,849 --> 04:34:08,790
[SPEAKER_05]: The rules are suspended.

3410
04:34:09,711 --> 04:34:10,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I address the council?

3411
04:34:10,892 --> 04:34:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to make, I actually wanted to say, Honorable Councilors,

3412
04:34:20,328 --> 04:34:30,053
[SPEAKER_05]: While I have this moment, I would like a minute to congratulate all of the seven city councilors and the seven council challengers.

3413
04:34:30,873 --> 04:34:40,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you all good luck, and more importantly, good health before and after seven of the 14 are elected in November.

3414
04:34:41,498 --> 04:34:49,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd like to give a heartfelt thanks to my 499 people who voted for me.

3415
04:34:55,549 --> 04:34:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It did me no favor.

3416
04:34:58,650 --> 04:35:00,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now I'm in a real good place.

3417
04:35:02,031 --> 04:35:02,872
The pressure is off.

3418
04:35:03,812 --> 04:35:06,113
I don't have to abound at the Board of Republicans.

3419
04:35:06,933 --> 04:35:07,373
Thank God.

3420
04:35:09,114 --> 04:35:10,295
And now here's the best part.

3421
04:35:12,055 --> 04:35:20,778
Now Andrew can go back to my roots in Michigan, helping other people, making it a better place,

3422
04:35:29,852 --> 04:35:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my five key priorities.

3423
04:35:33,495 --> 04:35:38,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, number one, improve public safety.

3424
04:35:39,359 --> 04:35:44,002
Two, improve maintenance of public buildings and city infrastructure.

3425
04:35:45,023 --> 04:35:48,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, encourage fiscal responsibility.

3426
04:35:49,406 --> 04:35:52,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Four, promote responsible development.

3427
04:35:53,568 --> 04:35:58,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And my baby, number five, reduce real estate tax burden.

3428
04:35:59,485 --> 04:36:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: for unoccupied homelands by adopting the full 35% undone message of the federal law, under 59 section 5C, as it's done in the formidable Walden area, and all across the other area communities.

3429
04:36:17,991 --> 04:36:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, provide some long overdue tax relief for homelands.

3430
04:36:22,652 --> 04:36:24,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have a sixth,

3431
04:36:48,929 --> 04:36:51,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your attention, assistance, and public spirit.

3432
04:36:51,850 --> 04:36:54,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Now back to my question.

3433
04:36:56,732 --> 04:36:58,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the question in the records, Councilor?

3434
04:36:58,693 --> 04:36:59,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was.

3435
04:36:59,233 --> 04:37:01,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for listening.

3436
04:37:01,414 --> 04:37:02,915
[SPEAKER_30]: It is 17607, Mr. Kessinger.

3437
04:37:04,135 --> 04:37:04,555
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

3438
04:37:04,815 --> 04:37:11,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, while we're on to suspension, I've been asked to make the following announcement by the leaders of the

3439
04:37:16,383 --> 04:37:27,245
[SPEAKER_28]: There are a series of public forums coming up for surveys and input into the community preservation process.

3440
04:37:28,545 --> 04:37:36,987
[SPEAKER_28]: The committee forums will be on Wednesday evening, October 4, 2017 from 7 to 9 at the Medford High School Library.

3441
04:37:37,267 --> 04:37:39,467
[SPEAKER_28]: And Saturday morning, October 14, from 11 to 12,

3442
04:37:46,512 --> 04:37:50,095
[SPEAKER_28]: at the Medford Senior Center, 101 Riverside Avenue.

3443
04:37:50,115 --> 04:37:58,842
[SPEAKER_28]: And to take the survey, and for further information, go to www.preservemedford.org.

3444
04:37:59,723 --> 04:38:00,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Donovan.

3445
04:38:00,564 --> 04:38:01,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3446
04:38:02,005 --> 04:38:02,065
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-644.

3447
04:38:02,085 --> 04:38:04,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table my next four.

3448
04:38:05,508 --> 04:38:07,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Landau-Kernan to table 17-644, 17-645, 17-646, and 17-647.

3449
04:38:30,483 --> 04:38:33,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I'd like to be heard for a moment.

3450
04:38:33,445 --> 04:38:34,306
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been here all night.

3451
04:38:35,547 --> 04:38:36,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been here all night.

3452
04:38:37,308 --> 04:38:42,752
[SPEAKER_21]: And three motions on the agenda tonight, I stayed to answer them, and they just got tabled.

3453
04:38:43,353 --> 04:38:50,698
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to be given the courtesy of making a couple of comments, if I can, because I've issued you a couple of reports that the school committee received.

3454
04:38:52,319 --> 04:38:55,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe some people don't want to hear the facts, but nevertheless, here they are.

3455
04:38:55,742 --> 04:38:59,745
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Mr. Superintendent, you gave them to us at 10 o'clock for us to review.

3456
04:39:00,696 --> 04:39:01,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Why 10 o'clock?

3457
04:39:01,417 --> 04:39:06,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you give them to Larry, the answers, at 10 o'clock.

3458
04:39:06,684 --> 04:39:06,985
[SPEAKER_07]: That's OK.

3459
04:39:07,005 --> 04:39:09,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I have an opportunity to review them before my own resolution?

3460
04:39:09,849 --> 04:39:10,670
[SPEAKER_21]: That's OK.

3461
04:39:11,210 --> 04:39:13,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Your resolution was on the agenda.

3462
04:39:13,293 --> 04:39:14,435
[SPEAKER_21]: I came here and stayed here.

3463
04:39:14,575 --> 04:39:16,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you were here all night, why didn't you give them to us at 10 o'clock?

3464
04:39:17,385 --> 04:39:21,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I gave it to everyone, but I thought you wouldn't listen to the other.

3465
04:39:21,426 --> 04:39:22,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to trade with her.

3466
04:39:22,927 --> 04:39:25,947
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'd like a moment as a citizen to be able to address the council.

3467
04:39:26,527 --> 04:39:31,989
[SPEAKER_19]: We will not, uh, Councilor Laguna has pulled those motions, but you are free to address the council.

3468
04:39:33,049 --> 04:39:33,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

3469
04:39:34,530 --> 04:39:35,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Just want to say something.

3470
04:39:35,690 --> 04:39:37,971
[SPEAKER_21]: There are three reports on the agenda tonight.

3471
04:39:38,351 --> 04:39:44,832
[SPEAKER_21]: The school committee received these reports last night, or received the update last night.

3472
04:39:45,953 --> 04:39:46,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Let him speak.

3473
04:39:47,980 --> 04:39:52,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we in public participation or are we in suspending the rules?

3474
04:39:53,366 --> 04:39:59,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to suspend the rules by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Falco, I mean by Councilor Scapelli.

3475
04:40:00,454 --> 04:40:03,057
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

3476
04:40:03,077 --> 04:40:03,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

3477
04:40:03,538 --> 04:40:05,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you Mr. President, members of the council.

3478
04:40:06,798 --> 04:40:18,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Tonight, on the agenda, there were items that dealt with enrollment and real estate development, and the impact upon class size, the impact upon enrollment in the schools.

3479
04:40:19,525 --> 04:40:23,727
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's important that you hear this, and you are aware of it.

3480
04:40:23,927 --> 04:40:25,208
[SPEAKER_21]: I gave you reports tonight.

3481
04:40:25,928 --> 04:40:28,009
[SPEAKER_21]: One report was done at the beginning of the school year.

3482
04:40:28,890 --> 04:40:34,953
[SPEAKER_21]: The second report was done this week and given to the school committee, and they had a discussion on it last night.

3483
04:40:35,853 --> 04:40:41,277
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's important that you know this because there are some things flying around the community that are just patently not true.

3484
04:40:42,138 --> 04:40:49,544
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's important that you know it so that when you're asked these questions in public, you can answer them truthfully and you have the statistics in front of you.

3485
04:40:50,765 --> 04:40:55,949
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna refer to the report that was given last night because I think that's the most relevant one right now.

3486
04:40:57,030 --> 04:41:04,376
[SPEAKER_21]: It talks about the impact of real estate development on class size, class enrollment in the Metro Public Schools.

3487
04:41:06,100 --> 04:41:24,418
[SPEAKER_21]: And we picked eight units or eight different developments in the city with 150 or more units in it and looked at the class size impact, looked at the impact of student enrollment by school, by grade.

3488
04:41:27,454 --> 04:41:31,836
[SPEAKER_21]: by different development to give you an idea of what the impact is.

3489
04:41:32,436 --> 04:41:39,880
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you read it closely, you'll find that there's 105 students in eight developments that come to our public schools, 105.

3490
04:41:41,681 --> 04:41:43,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Two of them are in outside placements.

3491
04:41:45,903 --> 04:41:47,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Two of them are in outside placements.

3492
04:41:48,204 --> 04:41:54,027
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you spread them out and look at it, the average class size in the elementary schools is 18.3.

3493
04:41:56,229 --> 04:41:57,750
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the best in the commonwealth.

3494
04:41:57,930 --> 04:41:59,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost the best in the commonwealth.

3495
04:41:59,731 --> 04:42:00,552
[SPEAKER_21]: You should be proud of that.

3496
04:42:00,612 --> 04:42:01,633
[SPEAKER_21]: You support the schools.

3497
04:42:01,933 --> 04:42:03,554
[SPEAKER_21]: The school committee supports the schools.

3498
04:42:03,574 --> 04:42:05,195
[SPEAKER_21]: You should be proud of that.

3499
04:42:05,815 --> 04:42:07,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you've got good class size.

3500
04:42:07,136 --> 04:42:13,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you've asked the question about class size over and over again at the various meetings that I've attended on budget.

3501
04:42:13,860 --> 04:42:16,102
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think you should have that as you go into the campaign.

3502
04:42:16,462 --> 04:42:17,343
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you should know that.

3503
04:42:18,231 --> 04:42:24,637
[SPEAKER_21]: But there is a rumor going around that somewhere development is overrunning the schools.

3504
04:42:24,677 --> 04:42:25,758
[SPEAKER_21]: The schools are overwhelmed.

3505
04:42:25,899 --> 04:42:26,880
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not true.

3506
04:42:27,779 --> 04:42:28,440
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not true.

3507
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:29,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Go over the report.

3508
04:42:29,440 --> 04:42:32,903
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to go over it with you now because it's late and you can read.

3509
04:42:32,923 --> 04:42:38,607
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think it's important that you know this as you move around the city and people ask you about development.

3510
04:42:39,288 --> 04:42:46,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Development is important to support the various initiatives, to reduce the tax rate, to do all the things that you want to do in the community.

3511
04:42:47,094 --> 04:42:53,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And at the same time, it's a legitimate concern to determine whether or not it's going to cost you more money in your public schools.

3512
04:42:53,739 --> 04:42:56,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, right now, we're doing just fine.

3513
04:42:56,892 --> 04:43:06,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, you could add 155 seats to the elementary schools and still be below 20 students in a class, on average.

3514
04:43:06,959 --> 04:43:08,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, it's a flashlight.

3515
04:43:08,961 --> 04:43:09,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry?

3516
04:43:09,921 --> 04:43:10,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Your light?

3517
04:43:10,842 --> 04:43:11,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'm sorry.

3518
04:43:11,442 --> 04:43:11,943
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all right.

3519
04:43:12,503 --> 04:43:13,344
[SPEAKER_21]: I just had it so I could see.

3520
04:43:15,724 --> 04:43:21,710
[SPEAKER_21]: you could add 500 seats and still have decent class size at this particular point in time.

3521
04:43:22,310 --> 04:43:25,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, there may be some need for some looking at distribution.

3522
04:43:26,054 --> 04:43:28,096
[SPEAKER_21]: One school maybe has a little bit less than another.

3523
04:43:28,656 --> 04:43:29,858
[SPEAKER_21]: That's always the case.

3524
04:43:29,898 --> 04:43:30,638
[SPEAKER_21]: You work on that.

3525
04:43:31,599 --> 04:43:39,147
[SPEAKER_21]: But you should know as a city council, you should know as the people that help to fund the budget and do development in the city,

3526
04:43:40,280 --> 04:43:45,644
[SPEAKER_21]: that your schools have sufficient capacity to handle additional students right now.

3527
04:43:46,244 --> 04:43:47,245
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can move forward.

3528
04:43:47,765 --> 04:43:51,408
[SPEAKER_21]: You should also know that our schools are doing just fine.

3529
04:43:52,109 --> 04:43:53,029
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're part of the support.

3530
04:43:53,049 --> 04:43:54,650
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of great programs going on.

3531
04:43:55,351 --> 04:44:00,274
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you're here tonight in this auditorium, which has been renovated in many ways.

3532
04:44:00,955 --> 04:44:03,437
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to see any number of other additional renovations.

3533
04:44:03,997 --> 04:44:06,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Last night, the school committee received a report

3534
04:44:07,282 --> 04:44:13,105
[SPEAKER_21]: on the merger between the high school and the vocational school and the exciting programs that are taking place there.

3535
04:44:13,765 --> 04:44:23,809
[SPEAKER_21]: And we welcome the opportunity when the new Bistro 49 is there to have you there and to see that and to see how the youngsters use the new resources that you have helped to support.

3536
04:44:25,230 --> 04:44:31,052
[SPEAKER_21]: Last spring I came to you and I asked you to support the submission of an SOI to the School Building Authority.

3537
04:44:31,953 --> 04:44:34,814
[SPEAKER_21]: The School Building Authority will be in Medford

3538
04:44:35,792 --> 04:44:41,997
[SPEAKER_21]: on October 5 to begin their site visit to determine whether or not we can receive funding for that purpose.

3539
04:44:42,819 --> 04:44:49,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can look at that as another possibility of developing our schools, our programs, and moving things forward.

3540
04:44:49,783 --> 04:44:51,144
[SPEAKER_21]: So a lot of good is going on.

3541
04:44:51,485 --> 04:44:53,426
[SPEAKER_21]: And I welcome the opportunity to share that tonight.

3542
04:44:53,846 --> 04:45:03,112
[SPEAKER_21]: But I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell you that the discussion about overwhelmed numbers in the schools are not true.

3543
04:45:03,132 --> 04:45:04,413
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not true.

3544
04:45:04,633 --> 04:45:05,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at the numbers.

3545
04:45:05,834 --> 04:45:07,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy to answer any questions you have.

3546
04:45:08,782 --> 04:45:16,587
[SPEAKER_21]: I want you to know that, and just in case you get asked on the street, and when you have to make development decisions, I want you to be fully informed.

3547
04:45:17,467 --> 04:45:18,608
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate the time.

3548
04:45:19,168 --> 04:45:20,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and have a good night.

3549
04:45:27,690 --> 04:45:30,871
[SPEAKER_07]: The public know that I am not one to be spreading rumors.

3550
04:45:31,071 --> 04:45:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: My point of the resolutions that I'll put forward next week is that we plan and get the answers like we did tonight at 10 p.m.

3551
04:45:39,775 --> 04:45:46,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to just review them and hopefully I'll be able to thank whoever produced them for us next week.

3552
04:45:46,378 --> 04:45:51,300
[SPEAKER_07]: But to get something at 10 when you're trying to concentrate on people in the audience, on people at the podium,

3553
04:45:51,858 --> 04:45:53,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little hard to review what you were given.
