    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=212.503s">Anita</a>  Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=215.524s">And</a>  you were the owner, correct?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=218.345s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=219.106s">I'm</a>  the managing director of Ultimate Tango, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=223.266s">We</a>  want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=230.854s">So</a>  Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=243.508s">and</a>  also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=252.091s">So</a>  we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=266.638s">So</a>  those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=274.082s">And</a>  right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=277.984s">So</a>  our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of being open, business being open, would be Sunday to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=289.931s">We</a>  will not initially use any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=293.533s">so</a>  it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=303.761s">Those</a>  milongas have special settings, it's the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other, they usually come as a couple, husband and wife or people who are together or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=318.932s">There</a>  is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance, there is a special code how many dances then dance together. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=328.055s">There</a>  is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=332.776s">And</a>  of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=339.895s">So</a>  there is no kind of like a wild party settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=345.02s">The</a>  music is very mild. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=346.702s">People</a>  behave actually very, very politely. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=349.084s">They</a>  care for the ladies, they care for the partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=351.926s">They</a>  walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=354.889s">I</a>  explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=363.857s">how</a>  it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=370.801s">And</a>  that's pretty much it.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=371.701s">Yeah,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=374.463s">I</a>  mean, one of the reasons also we have the event at 9 p.m., because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=384.128s">So</a>  on this Sunday, there are another two studios who organize two more practices in different hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=390.431s">If</a>  we don't want a conflict with another business, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=393.073s">We</a>  want to respect the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=394.874s">The</a>  only hour we can start it would be like at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=398.235s">And</a>  because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and for different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=411.341s">For</a>  they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour and be in the studio just for two hours practicing or maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=420.602s">And</a>  also in Argentina, the milongas went for hours, so people just keep dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=424.664s">It's</a>  a kind of ritual. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=425.665s">In</a>  Argentina, we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=427.926s">until...</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=450.421s">We</a>  also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hears it outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=461.728s">And</a>  since most people drive, and there's plenty of parking here, and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=477.834s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=480.135s">Councilor</a>  Dajew.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=482.547s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=485.229s">I've</a>  reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=489.212s">I've</a>  noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=492.434s">Initially,</a>  the request was to stay open until 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=495.957s">Sunday</a>  evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=497.458s">Chief</a>  Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=503.982s">That's</a>  something that he feels as though he's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=506.905s">Also,</a>  I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=511.948s">And</a>  no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=524.444s">I</a>  do have a question for the petitioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=526.146s">Is</a>  there going to be any live music?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=532.225s">No,</a>  there is only going to be recorded music.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=536.306s">Mr.</a>  President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=542.608s">So</a>  with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=546.869s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=548.389s">I</a>  think my first question you answer the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=560.74s">The</a>  sound of the tango is very mild music. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=564.043s">It</a>  doesn't get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=565.644s">Even</a>  the rest of us, we did a check sound with them and they don't hear nothing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=585.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=585.911s">And</a>  my second question, if you are going to be open till one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=593.001s">What</a>  will there be for food and beverage?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=599.534s">During</a>  regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=606.781s">So</a>  no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=618.537s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=635.572s">Development</a>  Committee, which takes care of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=638.813s">We've</a>  worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=654.4s">They've</a>  been compliant to any of our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=658.261s">They've</a>  certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us, and so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=675.346s">As</a>  a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=684.452s">They'll</a>  bring something new and diverse to us, something positive and energetic, and so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=696.661s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=697.602s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak in fairness?</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=702.088s">name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=703.068s">Once</a>  again, Dominic Camara, the Chamber of Commerce of the Governmental Affairs Committees, and I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbon symbolically, if nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=721.273s">And</a>  I was very, very enthralled. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=723.115s">I</a>  was very happy to see the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=725.336s">It's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=726.057s">It's</a>  downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the geographic position of the place, and that's where the old Channel 3 thing used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=734.764s">And</a>  it's very, very nice, very professional and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=739.168s">And</a>  I gotta tell you, with all the tango that was playing and so on, and these two can dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=743.331s">Oh</a>  my God, can they dance? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=747.943s">And</a>  so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=757.893s">So</a>  even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=761.477s">So</a>  disturbance is not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=762.698s">But</a>  here's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=764.139s">Any</a>  life that you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=770.603s">So</a>  I hope that another studio like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=774.225s">I</a>  don't want to, you know, when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=776.506s">And</a>  that's pretty much what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=778.227s">And</a>  I welcome them in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=780.228s">I</a>  think they're wonderful professional people and they're so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=783.21s">And</a>  I have nothing but happiness for them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=785.371s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=785.732s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=786.724s">And</a>  I for one can say I was there that night that they opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=789.306s">I</a>  was very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=790.647s">The</a>  men were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=791.348s">The</a>  women were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=792.729s">The</a>  dancing was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=794.33s">And</a>  like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=802.096s">But</a>  again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango, and anybody can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=807.421s">But</a>  again, I welcome them, and I think the studio was very, very nice, and it's very impressive what I saw that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=814.647s">If</a>  they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=816.168s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=816.728s">We</a>  wouldn't give up hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=819.05s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=823.654s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=825.496s">Second.</a>  <a

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1056.76s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Congressman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1057.98s">Dean</a>  Forwell and Comcast, moving Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1060.221s">I'm</a>  in favor of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1061.501s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1061.721s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1062.181s">To</a>  be able to provide service.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1094.169s">Okay,</a>  could you please explain your project then? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1096.934s">For</a>  this project we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1101.687s">We're</a>  basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1107.992s">Originally</a>  the Century Bank is the customer but in doing this project we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1124.728s">I</a>  did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1131.372s">I</a>  don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1138.717s">Those</a>  maps.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1141.439s">Those</a>  full maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1142.259s">I</a>  think everybody has their maps with them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1149.664s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1153.206s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1160.74s">I</a>  have a few questions about just the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1165.884s">So</a>  if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1174.65s">That's</a>  going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1181.796s">I</a>  know that's a heavy congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1185.299s">Depending</a>  upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1194.965s">I</a>  would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1203.43s">And</a>  do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1208.733s">Again,</a>  it all depends on what the city engineer believe when they issue the permit, if it's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1218.095s">to</a>  do it at night and we may be able to get more work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1220.637s">I</a>  just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1225.56s">And</a>  could you tell us, let's see, basically with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1236.648s">You're</a>  going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1242.091s">You're</a>  going to be replacing them with cements? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.553s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.993s">And</a>  can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1250.157s">I</a>  believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1253.619s">And</a>  I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault location is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1262.125s">So</a>  there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1267.508s">And</a>  they'll be replaced with concrete?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1269.189s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1270.585s">And</a>  can you tell us with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1280.554s">Are</a>  they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1283.736s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1284.197s">The</a>  first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street, so there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1291.783s">the</a>  first utility pulled down to Salem Street that would be impacted, and that work there is probably only going to take a day or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1299.045s">They</a>  would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1304.427s">And</a>  with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1316.898s">needs</a>  to be paid once you're done opening up the street and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1321.299s">And</a>  this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is, over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1330.061s">And</a>  I noticed that you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1336.662s">So</a>  is that payment going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1341.069s">reimbursement</a>  from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the sections that you cut open?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1349.126s">I'm</a>  not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1351.727s">I</a>  just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1357.611s">But</a>  I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1365.935s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1370.358s">That's</a>  all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1378.005s">So</a>  I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1384.11s">So</a>  I guess my question is basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1387.702s">are</a>  you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1390.464s">It</a>  sounds like enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1391.244s">It</a>  sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1395.767s">Based</a>  off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1410.075s">I</a>  can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1418.282s">I</a>  think that might be a little bit of a point of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1422.005s">I</a>  mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1428.049s">The</a>  last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1432.172s">And</a>  they basically promised that they would pave curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1437.817s">And</a>  I feel like we're almost setting precedent by doing this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1442.2s">And</a>  in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1450.359s">My</a>  colleagues may have a further comment on that, but I just think that we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1456.339s">make</a>  sure that the street is repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1457.88s">And</a>  I may like to see curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1461.061s">I</a>  think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1466.943s">I</a>  mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1469.544s">But</a>  I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1474.325s">And</a>  I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1483.008s">Um,</a>  it's a big cut through the street methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1485.129s">Big</a>  cut through community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1487.611s">And,</a>  um, sorry, I think curb to curb paving would be something that we should look at.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1497.797s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1500.243s">And</a>  first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1512.411s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1523.358s">We</a>  also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old Armory building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1533.328s">And</a>  I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1541.695s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this finally moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1545.056s">The</a>  question I had, and I think Councilor Falco touched upon it, is of recent, the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1560.551s">And</a>  it's been <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1561.472s">an</a>  issue of contention among this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1564.495s">And</a>  we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb to curb knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1580.99s">And</a>  the question I have on this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1584.833s">It</a>  does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1594.956s">And</a>  right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1600.178s">And</a>  it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1612.264s">What</a>  exactly does that language mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1614.346s">That</a>  doesn't really say much to me.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1616.587s">That's</a>  something that the city engineer wrote in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1618.689s">So</a>  I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1623.292s">Typically,</a>  we do all our own paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1626.454s">Typically,</a>  we repave the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1629.476s">Sometimes</a>  if it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1633.739s">But</a>  in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1638.29s">Therefore,</a>  you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1645.62s">Or</a>  I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1649.385s">If</a>  we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1657.084s">Okay,</a>  and the way I read it is a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1660.146s">I</a>  read it is the city will determine how these streets will be put back and not just whether Comcast will do the work of the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb center line to curb in the city will make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1674.792s">And</a>  I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1683.996s">And</a>  do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1689.598s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1690.799s">And</a>  if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1693.82s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1694.64s">So</a>  I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1708.284s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1709.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1710.305s">Councilor</a>  Dyke. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1712.366s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1713.997s">Very</a>  difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1726.985s">And</a>  the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1732.208s">But</a>  the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1736.851s">But</a>  before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1739.472s">I</a>  mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1742.114s">We</a>  need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1744.476s">We've</a>  entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Medford, where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1752.221s">But</a>  we don't know what the construction schedule is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1754.262s">Now,</a>  it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1757.484s">I</a>  think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1761.128s">I</a>  think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1774.881s">We</a>  need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Medford Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1782.428s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1789.674s">And</a>  I'd like to see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1792.356s">You</a>  know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1795.279s">I</a>  mean, we want to see the curbs paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1797.36s">We</a>  want to see it paved curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1798.761s">That's</a>  been something we've been hounding on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1801.023s">It's</a>  a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighbourhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1808.987s">Sometimes</a>  it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighbourhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1822.034s">So</a>  that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1823.955s">Certainly,</a>  I think it's a noble cause and I think it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1827.438s">and</a>  a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1831.161s">I'm</a>  just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.013s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.373s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1847.434s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1852.02s">A</a>  couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1868.876s">First,</a>  let me say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1871.728s">I</a>  think this is a good measure, we need it in the square, and Comcast needs to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1878.792s">They're</a>  the primary provider here in the city of Medford, and people need this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1886.616s">I'm</a>  looking at the language in this petition, and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone, and she's doing something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1899.32s">is</a>  going to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets, and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1915.889s">And</a>  if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1922.352s">And</a>  I think we need to have a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1925.213s">an</a>  amendment to this paper that the city council understands that the language herein, this petition for this public hearing and to have this work done is saying that the city engineer of the city of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb that Comcast understands that and will fund <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1954.449s">the</a>  City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1963.836s">Traffic</a>  plans, traffic, digging up sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1971.756s">10</a>  of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1979.222s">We</a>  had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1991.178s">not</a>  engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2004.045s">We</a>  had several private contractors over the years advise the cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2008.687s">The</a>  plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2017.592s">And</a>  one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2020.498s">from</a>  citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2031.363s">And</a>  one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2048.688s">Salem</a>  Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2054.092s">And</a>  let them find another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2055.934s">Let</a>  them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2063.379s">So</a>  if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2075.429s">Let's</a>  let's look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2077.454s">Let's</a>  let the engineering department and the community development department <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2085.023s">experiment</a>  with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2092.646s">And</a>  I think the citizens of Medford will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2095.187s">They're</a>  going to benefit from getting this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2097.548s">Hopefully,</a>  they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2103.57s">And</a>  Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.631s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.991s">With</a>  that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2109.272s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2111.815s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2112.696s">Thank</a>  you, my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2113.477s">I</a>  think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2117.982s">I</a>  appreciate Dave from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2119.943s">I</a>  don't believe Comcast has any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2124.628s">I</a>  have any issues with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2125.869s">I</a>  think you've done your due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2127.711s">I</a>  think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've made <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2134.017s">echo</a>  this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2154.314s">you</a>  put forth as your company, I think that's been very receptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2158.195s">But</a>  I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying, which is the biggest point is City Engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2167.138s">We</a>  can talk going back and forth about voting or not voting, but I think that my recommendation would be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the City Engineer <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2178.882s">to</a>  get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2182.483s">Traffic</a>  plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2196.007s">But</a>  understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2209.376s">I</a>  don't want to delay this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2210.738s">I</a>  want to push it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2211.779s">But</a>  at the same time, I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2220.349s">So</a>  I want to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2224.733s">for</a>  our businesses and our community, but at the same time, I think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2250.382s">making</a>  sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2265.434s">If</a>  I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2273.359s">Well,</a>  then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2283.265s">I</a>  don't want to delay it so it does fall into construction questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2287.347s">but</a>  moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2305.879s">with</a>  what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2321.262s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2322.523s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2323.203s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2326.743s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2327.964s">I</a>  just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2328.844s">I</a>  understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2334.913s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2336.755s">And</a>  if I if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2340.478s">We</a>  just need to know if we if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2344.982s">And</a>  then I would be able to give you a schedule, the point of information if I can.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2348.626s">I'm</a>  sorry, this is the frustration frustrating part. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2351.869s">This</a>  is something that the engineer that we should have had from the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2355.152s">This</a>  is something that you as the contract of <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2358.615s">for</a>  Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2362.261s">So</a>  that's my frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2363.603s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2372.305s">If</a>  it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare and one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2379.231s">But</a>  if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans for the week.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2386.457s">I</a>  do have a traffic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2387.778s">I</a>  did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2391.301s">And</a>  I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2393.963s">Is</a>  this it, Dick?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2396.065s">No,</a>  this isn't the traffic.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2397.806s">This</a>  is what you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2398.647s">That's</a>  the traffic.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2399.447s">Yeah,</a>  that's the traffic.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2404.435s">So</a>  again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2408.218s">I</a>  mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2412.161s">But</a>  I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2415.264s">And</a>  if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2419.928s">And</a>  I have it, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2421.669s">I</a>  was looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2422.29s">It</a>  didn't look like the directions aren't on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2424.672s">But</a>  it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2428.975s">So</a>  I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2434.233s">My</a>  last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2442.899s">I</a>  know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curve-to-curve from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curve-to-curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2456.549s">So</a>  I just think we need to figure out a way that, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2459.076s">figure</a>  out what we want as a group, collectively, of going forward for all utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2465.62s">So</a>  we do it fairly, and we require the same thing from every single company. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2469.823s">And</a>  I think we're on track with, obviously, making our streets be repaired much better than they have been, and where things are sinking and dipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2481.031s">So</a>  I think we're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2482.331s">I</a>  just think we need to have a discussion in <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2485.413s">in</a>  committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2491.948s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2493.569s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2496.131s">I</a>  think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2500.133s">I</a>  think that we've held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2501.794s">We've</a>  heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2506.837s">I</a>  think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2521.046s">to</a>  the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2522.507s">So</a>  we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2533.296s">So</a>  if the permit can be approved, provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2538.441s">Just</a>  an option, just a way for us to maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2541.283s">move</a>  this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2541.983s">I</a>  don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2544.144s">As</a>  I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2547.665s">We</a>  could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2555.148s">And</a>  upon our approval, the permit will be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2557.208s">But</a>  we don't need to bring the gentleman back. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2558.549s">I</a>  don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2560.709s">We</a>  can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.008s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.988s">Mr.</a>  President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2579.514s">If</a>  we accept this amendment, we've clarified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2582.476s">We</a>  want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2587.906s">discussions</a>  over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2604.246s">And</a>  it seems to me the way I read this language <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2608.15s">here</a>  in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2613.411s">And</a>  I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2625.915s">So</a>  if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2635.518s">Quite</a>  frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2636.738s">I'm</a>  not qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2638.1s">I'm</a>  not an engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2639.642s">I'm</a>  not a construction person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2641.705s">I</a>  can't shovel snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2643.408s">I'm</a>  pretty good with leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2645.872s">Every</a>  morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2652.647s">That's</a>  the scope of my construction skills, but the engineer and her staff understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2660.372s">This</a>  is their profession, and it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked, and I think we should allow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2669.758s">I</a>  don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2677.663s">I</a>  think that the construction people need to be aware that National Engineers had some serious problems historically in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2686.929s">So</a>  I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2691.613s">And</a>  as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2701.921s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2714.788s">As</a>  I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2725.936s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a motion on the table, if you want to present it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2729.979s">If</a>  I can, I would present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2731.34s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo's initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2736.043s">I</a>  think that, again, my biggest concern is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2742.022s">What</a>  we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that and move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2749.737s">will,</a>  what's the timeline for the construction and whether making sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally, I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Method Square and to help our business owners and the, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2776.96s">the</a>  neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2786.245s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2787.206s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2788.186s">So</a>  as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2804.615s">And</a>  that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2809.077s">And</a>  the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2820.441s">And</a>  the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2827.203s">the</a>  proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2830.726s">Summarized</a>  perfectly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2834.069s">I</a>  think somebody else would like to speak.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2838.534s">Name</a>  and address on the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2840.67s">Dave</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockblind Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2843.693s">One</a>  of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2847.957s">I</a>  think that Councilor Lungo-Koehn is 100% right as well as Councilor Marks and a few others. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2854.984s">My</a>  recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up with a comprehensive <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2865.816s">engineer</a>  and, you know, project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2875.541s">So</a>  in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2889.048s">So</a>  I kind of, I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from two and three patches to five and seven patches. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2897.871s">So</a>  I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curve based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2913.116s">So</a>  it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2918.737s">And</a>  I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2924.022s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2934.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2935.992s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2939.676s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2941.437s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2941.978s">Geron</a>  Colostos, 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2947.58s">I</a>  understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards, and we have to hold somebody accountable for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2957.407s">So</a>  I'm not gonna disregard as being not important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2961.27s">It</a>  is, it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2963.131s">But</a>  my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Avenue, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2971.697s">Now,</a>  I went 30 years without anything but DSL. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2976.615s">Now</a>  we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2981.756s">But</a>  at this point, they're the only game in town for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2985.397s">So</a>  whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2989.878s">I</a>  do have Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2992.239s">Comcast</a>  has done their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2994.379s">They</a>  signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3000.181s">And</a>  the savings is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3002.17s">So</a>  what I don't want to see happen is, as much as all these details are important, I don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like a tug of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3013.418s">Well,</a>  we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3019.422s">And</a>  in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for our expenditure to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3029.133s">Whatever</a>  the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval, and then if you're satisfied with what they submit, move forward and not come back to another public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3042.308s">So</a>  please, let's move this along as quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3045.272s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3046.513s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3047.735s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3050.258s">Move</a>  for approval as amended, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3051.859s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli has a motion to take.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3053.641s">I</a>  believe I rescinded and move on to the recommendations of Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3058.945s">Move</a>  for approval as amended.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3060.146s">A</a>  motion by Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3064.669s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3065.965s">Please</a>  call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3066.806s">Before</a>  you call the roll, just as a B paper, if we could set up a meeting within the next month to discuss standards and guidelines, I think that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3075.732s">David</a>  hit it on the head.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3078.595s">I</a>  would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3081.057s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3082.538s">I</a>  do believe we had that meeting already. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3083.819s">We</a>  posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3090.164s">I</a>  think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3095.081s">And</a>  I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3099.024s">And</a>  I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3102.026s">And</a>  I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3109.632s">And</a>  I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.316s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.636s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.896s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3147.018s">I</a>  know we have a paper that's been tabled 17-593. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3152.181s">I</a>  believe that Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC, High Street, the position High Street and Hillside Ave for intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3165.249s">I</a>  believe that we're waiting on a question that maybe could be answered to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3171.112s">I</a>  believe the question was that we were asking for <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3175.973s">If</a>  we can't take it off the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3178.254s">Motion</a>  by Councilman Scott Felde to take this up 17-593 off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3182.876s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3183.996s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3184.417s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3185.677s">Councilman</a>  Scott Felde.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3205.801s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3209.164s">I</a>  thought it was half centerline.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3222.584s">My</a>  recollection is curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3279.941s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3281.542s">It</a>  was tabled based on a roll call vote for in the affirmative, three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3287.485s">I</a>  believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3292.928s">But</a>  it doesn't say that, it just says upon motion to table a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3298.471s">And</a>  it's not reflecting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3300.692s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3303.133s">I</a>  happen to recall the discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3307.355s">from</a>  three, four weeks ago, even though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3313.499s">I</a>  do recall that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3316.181s">And</a>  at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3326.028s">So</a>  we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3331.993s">So</a>  I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked another utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3343.381s">So</a>  I don't know if this gentleman for the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3346.223s">a</a>  high street project which is going into the armory. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3348.964s">I</a>  believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3356.066s">So</a>  maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3761.016s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn, there was a reason why it took so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3764.657s">There</a>  was an absentee landlord who subsequently moved to Hawaii. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3769.245s">And</a>  during that time, we were in the process of contacting a management company, which took quite a while, and what ended up happening, we had to put a lien on the house, and it took several, after the lien was put on, the vendor took several months to give us his invoice, and then once we got the invoice, we had to wait another several months for the attorney that closed on the property to give us a check for the lien that we had placed on the property.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3877.632s">I</a>  expected to have it all read, so I am going to summarize it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3882.657s">This</a>  is a request for $348,336 from Free Cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3884.879s">The</a>  information you typically request is there in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3887.0s">The</a>  first $256,000 is to upgrade the lights at the Andrews School to controllable LED lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3902.313s">This</a>  is a natural next step after the other work that we've done in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3906.235s">You</a>  might be aware that last winter we did the Curtis Tosta LED lights interior. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3911.038s">We</a>  did some of the hallways and some other LED light projects at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3915.16s">This</a>  is the direction that the industry is moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3917.981s">Our</a>  DPW was built with all LED lights as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3923.304s">This</a>  particular project is being, I'm asking for this money to do this project at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3928.706s">because</a>  this will serve as the city's match to a grant the state and B2Q Consulting received from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3937.95s">So</a>  the lighting project on its own makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3941.751s">It'll</a>  save the city about $22,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3945.392s">But</a>  if we do it at this time, we can use it as our share on this grant project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3951.735s">The</a>  grant is to do electricity peak demand reduction, and it's a pilot for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3958.367s">So</a>  basically the state gave B2Q and the city money to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3963.769s">The</a>  grant itself is $478,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3966.951s">And</a>  as well, National Grid is very interested in how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3972.693s">And</a>  they have committed $125,000 of technical assistance time on this specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3980.456s">And</a>  the project would actually run in the Andrews School and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3985.557s">We'll</a>  get additionally, they'll be upgrading the controls in the schools and the DPW to be able to control the lights in both of those buildings through our computer system, as well as doing additional upgrades to the heating and cooling system and their controls, how we run it, energy efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4004.07s">It</a>  is also likely that we would get revenue from the demand response program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4008.553s">The</a>  amount of that revenue is very dependent on <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4011.795s">The</a>  whole process, we're still doing the feasibility part of it that determines how much electricity we would actually produce through these programs during peak demand time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4023.364s">That's</a>  one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4024.785s">The</a>  other part of the money is $83,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4028.42s">that</a>  would serve as a match for another grant that we received from the Department of Energy Resources that would add battery and the ability to run solar off-grid to the DPW and the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4042.169s">And</a>  as you know, we're in the process of putting solar on the DPW, so this adds battery to that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4047.993s">Can</a>  you repeat the figure you just said?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4050.035s">So,</a>  which, okay.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4051.976s">The</a>  amount awarded by the grant from the Department of Energy?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4054.298s">So</a>  the first grant is, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4058.363s">$478,688.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4058.383s">The</a>  second grant, I'm asking for $83,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4067.458s">I</a>  can be more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4068.898s">$83,336</a>  serves as a match. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4069.819s">It</a>  is 10% of the grant amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4071.299s">Hold</a>  on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4072.659s">Because</a>  we have it as $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4073.74s">No,</a>  the grant is $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4074.58s">Yes,</a>  so the grant is an $833,000 and change grant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4076.64s">And</a>  so our match is 10% that we need to have in hand as we begin the project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4095.436s">So</a>  battery is very, very expensive to pair with solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4099.678s">And</a>  we believe it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4101.299s">It'll</a>  allow us to run these buildings off grid when the electricity is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4106.481s">And</a>  the grant will pay for this battery that would go with both the solar systems, the one we're in the process of, and the one that is planned that will be coming eventually our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4118.627s">We</a>  have to redo the roof at the Andrews School before we come forward with a solid proposal on solar for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4125.212s">So</a>  that's the whole package altogether.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4127.793s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4128.414s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4129.314s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4130.175s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4131.535s">And</a>  thank you for this report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4134.237s">Hunt</a>  and Superintendent Bellison. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4136.998s">I</a>  think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4139.7s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this here type of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4144.282s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regards to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4153.461s">Right,</a>  so the lighting project, it would be our intention to do it second shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4158.785s">So</a>  they would be in there 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4161.587s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4162.768s">in</a>  order to do that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4165.55s">Solar,</a>  if and when we are able. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4168.151s">So</a>  we'll need to do a new roof and solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4170.913s">My</a>  hope is that we could get something lined up for next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4174.96s">But</a>  that is still the chunk to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4178.381s">The</a>  battery piece of it would actually be completely out of the way in the back area, not where students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4186.283s">There's</a>  a separate entrance into the electrical rooms where we have generators and HVAC equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4192.385s">So</a>  the contractors, when they do do work, could work in that area without ever having to go into the main portion of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4201.247s">Or</a>  they could go in through the main portion, check in with the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4204.788s">with</a>  the security, but then they would just traverse through the building and be in that back area and never have to actually be in student areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4214.11s">I</a>  also know the superintendent is here to speak to some of this as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4219.472s">If</a>  I may, what would be the duration of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4222.192s">How</a>  long would it take to replace all the lights?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4225.912s">A</a>  couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4227.333s">So</a>  I will tell you that this is a large project, so it would have to be bid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4231.035s">And</a>  part of the bidding out process is to ask the contractors, how long will it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4235.857s">Because</a>  some contractors will put one crew on and do it over many weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4240.559s">Other</a>  contractors will say, I have 10 crews, and I'll get it done in three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4245.262s">So</a>  because it's going to be a project that would be bid out, I cannot tell you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4251.825s">And</a>  I can't bid it out until we're at that stage of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4255.943s">is</a>  when we would have to schedule.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4258.163s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, so it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4265.285s">Will</a>  all the workers be quarried and whatnot?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4268.786s">If</a>  there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.228s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.528s">So</a>  we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4286.472s">make</a>  sure that we're doing everything we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4289.497s">This</a>  is a pretty big project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4292.16s">There'll</a>  be a lot of people in the building, so we just want to make sure we're protecting our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4295.645s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4302.568s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4304.85s">Alicia,</a>  regarding the paired battery storage, will we be able to accept additional electricity from the current windmill and also provide that to the battery storage?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4321.522s">The</a>  wind turbine is actually connected to the McGlynn School, not the Andrews School, so it would not be connected to this battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4332.387s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4332.567s">But</a>  we couldn't connect one to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4334.928s">I</a>  mean, the schools are on the same property, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4349.295s">The</a>  wind turbine doesn't make as much electricity compared to what a solar installation does to make it worth the amount of electrical work you would have to do to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4358.477s">There</a>  would also be a lot of changes to the control system in order to take in that separate, very different input. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4368.512s">And</a>  I hope that at some point in the future, we'd be able to do a similar project at the McGlynn School, and at which point we would have the wind turbine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4376.836s">We</a>  would also have the benefit of having done this project at the Andrew School first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4383.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4386.0s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4388.2s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4390.381s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4390.602s">Hunt,</a>  thank you very much for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4392.302s">I'm</a>  looking at this paper and reading what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4397.187s">grant</a>  for this, grant for that, grant for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4399.509s">And</a>  I know that those grants didn't write themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4401.47s">And</a>  I think that they deserve a lot of credit for going out there and finding the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4405.953s">So</a>  thank you very much for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4407.874s">And</a>  looking at this paper, I mean, we have $265,000 to upgrade the LED lights at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4415.199s">My</a>  math, as spooky as it is, would come back and show that we have about <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4419.982s">12-year</a>  return on our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4422.164s">We're</a>  going to save about $22,000 a year if we convert to the LED lighting, and we'll be able to capture this investment within a period of about 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4431.211s">I</a>  also understand that this $83,000 is a 10% match on the battery, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4433.433s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4433.693s">And</a>  if you add the $265,000 and the $83,000, we come up with a figure of $348,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4444.673s">So</a>  this appropriation is for $348,000, but we're also looking at $100,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4446.855s">A</a>  $478,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.156s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.256s">A</a>  $125,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.476s">So</a>  the $100,000 is</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4461.275s">There</a>  are two different numbers for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4463.696s">One</a>  is an incentive for the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4467.497s">So</a>  the lighting project is actually more expensive than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4470.498s">So</a>  that comes in to offset the cost of the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4474.359s">And</a>  the other is that National Grid will put technical assistance in to this project, which honestly, I feel is very notable that they've actually said that this project is interesting enough to them that they want to put that much of their own <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4489.577s">into</a>  the project to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4493.52s">But</a>  it's the equivalent of $125,000 in national grid time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4498.204s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4499.145s">So</a>  in looking at all the grant money or the matching funds that have been awarded to the city, how much money are we talking here?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4510.735s">I</a>  have not done that math. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4512.737s">But</a>  we're looking at like 833 and 478, so that's <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4518.42s">close</a>  to one plus the $100,000, on the order of $1.3 million of money that'll be coming into city buildings.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4526.805s">So</a>  this evening you're asking for us to make an investment of $348,000 so that we can get a return on that investment of over a million dollars?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4533.889s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4534.41s">I'm</a>  comfortable voting for this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4536.111s">Thank</a>  you very much for your work, Mr. President, and for approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4540.173s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4541.013s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4542.694s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4544.035s">Hentwell,</a>  we have you before us, and we're talking about the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4547.422s">Can</a>  you give us an update on the test borings that were done very close to there and whether or not they were done behind the Andrews School, any results that may be coming back?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4556.264s">Right,</a>  so I do believe that there is a response in your packets that is from the motion prior about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4564.966s">I'm</a>  happy to speak to it for a minute or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4567.067s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4569.25s">I</a>  don't have the response that went to you in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4573.733s">But</a>  we did the test scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4575.654s">We</a>  found that there were two locations that had very high levels deep down. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4582.678s">One</a>  was, oh my gosh, my brain is going to stop on that, lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4587.38s">And</a>  the other was very unusually, threw me for a loop, I believe it was zinc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4591.723s">Is</a>  that right that's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4594.244s">And</a>  I didn't even know prior that could be contaminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4597.918s">And</a>  so those two locations, we need to do, so we did testing in the grid, and two spots showed up with high levels, and now we need to, oh, thank you, I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4615.703s">I</a>  did not refresh myself on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4619.846s">Yes,</a>  zinc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4621.567s">Sorry,</a>  it's such an odd thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4623.989s">I</a>  was not aware that zinc at a high level could be a soil contaminant until we got involved in this project, so I always question myself when I say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4633.002s">So</a>  those two spots are very high and actually either have to be removed or we have to do extensive room reporting and testing to the state that would be extremely costly to removing those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4645.508s">So</a>  we need to do testing around those locations to find out exactly so we know where there is a problem and we know these areas where there isn't and we want to test in closer to see how small of an area can we deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4659.555s">So</a>  it might be that we put <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4661.398s">you</a>  know, a bench and a paved area and a bench over the zinc location, or it may be that we dig a hole and dig it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4670.826s">And</a>  we need to, in order to do one of those things, do a little bit more testing to understand those locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4677.032s">We</a>  haven't yet tested on the other side of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4681.395s">The</a>  lead level is actually very close to the sidewalk, and so as part of narrowing that, we are gonna need to go on the other side of the sidewalk <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4689.202s">and</a>  do that testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4691.163s">But</a>  we'd sort of been waiting to get it all done at the same time and not do that separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4698.244s">There</a>  were two areas that had petroleum and PCBs, which we also have to do some further examination to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4707.587s">The</a>  other thing that was notable that I mentioned in here, one of the other properties, they have had a problem with their groundwater that they are very aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4717.335s">And</a>  one of the questions that had come up to me, and what prompted this testing partially in part was, was this problem in the groundwater under our property? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4728.649s">And</a>  we did not find any of that under our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4733.505s">So</a>  additionally, some of the area within the fence belongs to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4740.749s">That</a>  area has been delineated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4742.55s">We</a>  have not been doing testing on that area, but we are in close contact with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4746.912s">I,</a>  in fact, discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4749.733s">with</a>  them today, and they're very interested in working with us to be able to do a solution that provides safety and protection to everybody, but is as minimal expense and actually impact to the area as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4766.644s">And</a>  with their extensive experience in these sorts of problems, I think we're going to be able to do things a little bit better because they're going to be a partner with us on this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4778.07s">Thank</a>  you very much for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4779.512s">We</a>  do have it in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4781.693s">There</a>  are a number of parents that have been asking me questions, you know, so I wanted you to state it publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4786.357s">And</a>  just so I have it clearly, after reading it and after your explanation, test pourings were done at the clippership part section. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4792.842s">The</a>  lead and the zinc were found. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4795.18s">But</a>  there will be, as requested by the council, there will be some pourings on the other side of the walkway, which is behind Andrews, where the children play soccer and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4804.892s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4805.292s">So</a>  I do not anticipate that we would go up onto the soccer field. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4809.738s">We</a>  were able to find the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4812.421s">So</a>  when those schools were built, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4814.458s">They</a>  found arsenic in that area, and the area was low enough that they were legally allowed to close the site without doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4823.273s">But</a>  they came in and put clean fill over that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4828.362s">But</a>  it was after the fact that the area was closed with the state as being acceptable as is, but then the city came in and put the clean fill on anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4840.605s">So</a>  the records on that and exactly the locations are a little different, but it's pretty clear to the eye that where the soccer field raises up is part of that area with the clean fill on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4852.747s">and</a>  which makes us very comfortable about that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4855.428s">And</a>  it's just the part that slopes down to the pathway where you might say, well, that doesn't look like there's clean fill on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4864.213s">And</a>  so that's where some of these borings are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4867.395s">And</a>  then can you just, lastly, just give us a time frame so we know when to request an update?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4873.878s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4875.535s">So</a>  I'm hoping to do that over the next four to six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4879.856s">Some</a>  of it is scheduling with the equipment that is necessary to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4886.338s">And</a>  finalizing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4888.579s">We've</a>  been waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4889.279s">Honestly,</a>  our point of contact at the state <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4893.345s">The</a>  Environmental Protection Office has been out for three weeks on leave, and we really wanted him to see our most recent report and discuss it with him, and he returned from leave yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4904.058s">So</a>  before I schedule the borings, I do want to review with him the results of our first round of borings.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4942.382s">Move</a>  approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4944.923s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4946.523s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4947.684s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Naik.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4948.805s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4949.91s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4950.671s">Just</a>  if we could, if we can also, while we have Alicia here, if you can give us just a brief update on where we stand with the lighting in the square.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4959.478s">So</a>  the lighting of the square has been folded in with our larger city lighting project, and I actually spoke with our consultants at Lane Thomp, oh my gosh, on Monday, yesterday, about the history of those lights, what are in those various fixtures, what we're looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4980.107s">Based</a>  on what I've said and the observations, and I'd love feedback, but my impression is that most people are happy with the light levels at the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4991.773s">Those</a>  are the same fixtures, but much brighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4995.175s">And</a>  so I believe that we'll be able, through this project, to install equivalent light bulbs, basically, from what's in the Peace Garden into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5007.827s">For</a>  technical reasons, under an energy efficiency project, I could never put those in because it would be increasing the electricity that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5017.25s">And</a>  that would fall outside of any kind of grant money I could do, or I would have to put that out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5023.493s">Under</a>  our larger lighting project, it's probably the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5028.035s">And</a>  that will increase the electricity usage on those lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5033.037s">But</a>  at this point, I think most people would agree that's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5037.579s">And</a>  we'll be decreasing the light, the electricity usage throughout the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5043.948s">So</a>  that is our tentative plan, and I've asked them to get me that information concretely as quickly as possible to move that forward faster than the main project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5055.494s">But</a>  I'm not sure what the timing on that would be and whether there's an appetite for coming forward with a request for just that chunk of money separate from the main lighting project.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5067.52s">Originally,</a>  it started off as a standalone project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5069.941s">Yes,</a>  it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5070.842s">And</a>  we were trying to make it an energy efficiency project that we could procure through energy, through the Green Communities Act at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5080.266s">And</a>  you can't do it in an energy efficient manner and fix the light levels there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5085.408s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5086.288s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5087.129s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5088.389s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5090.91s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5398.996s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5399.436s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Council President and councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5402.577s">My</a>  name is Brian Dugdale, again from Wilson and Storrs, on behalf of the owner of the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5407.978s">We're</a>  here in connection with a request for extended hours at the mall, which is located in the city's industrial zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5413.942s">We</a>  have a detailed application on the record that goes through in detail each of the criteria for a special permit and how this request meets that criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5423.386s">So</a>  what I'd like to do is just give a very quick introduction before Art from Wegmans comes back up to give his explanation about Wegmans, its request, and to answer any questions the council might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5435.053s">So</a>  this request, which is to extend by just one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, was submitted in connection with substantial rehabilitation of the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5445.0s">New</a>  England Development is extremely excited that this fall we'll be bringing forward not only Wegmans, but also Petco, Dick's Sporting Goods, to support the existing coals and marshals that are located at the Meadow Glen Mall today. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5462.886s">New</a>  England Development is very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5464.328s">The</a>  whole purpose of that redevelopment project was to bring forward tenants of the highest quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5469.415s">And</a>  Wegmans, if anybody's been to a Wegmans, you know that that supermarket is really top of the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5476.424s">So</a>  we came before the city council on August 15th, at which time we were instructed to engage in further discussions with our immediately abutting neighbors to the east at the Mystic River Park condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5489.109s">We</a>  immediately engaged with the condo and had what we believe turned out to be productive conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5497.031s">NED,</a>  together with Wegmans, as part of those discussions committed to do, we heard their concerns about overnight loading, in particular, at evening hours, so New England Development and Wegmans committed to no overnight loading, sealed loading docks, a landscape buffer, fencing, and other funds for the condo to put even more landscape buffering on their side of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5520.243s">In</a>  addition, there will be protocols for security and a designated representative at the shopping center to handle any concerns from any of the residents of the condo or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5530.792s">So</a>  we're confident that the community overall, as well as our neighbors, are going to be happy with the changes that have come to fruition here at the Meadowland Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5539.619s">And</a>  we're very excited to have Whiteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5540.96s">So</a>  with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Perez. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5544.182s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5549.521s">Thank</a>  you, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5550.442s">As</a>  Mr. Dugdale just presented, we're here for the application once again for extension of the hours of operation specifically, and a special use permit modification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5562.215s">And</a>  with that, currently it's allowed, as the council knows, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5565.9s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5567.261s">With</a>  consideration of the weather in the Northeast, of the states here obviously, as well as the traffic in the area, we're seeking an extension on either end by simply one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5579.829s">That</a>  being allowing 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5582.29s">till</a>  midnight hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5585.272s">Hours</a>  of operation meaning allowing the store to be open for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5590.455s">With</a>  that, understanding and speaking to the residents, more specifically the residents of Mystic Condos right behind us, as noted by the council on the 8th, 15th, the question I think was raised, have we reached out? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5605.383s">And</a>  in fact, we had reached out and had communications prior to that to a representative of the condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5610.705s">As</a>  of today, we've had conversations with representatives of the condo, recognizing their adjacent neighbors, being a good neighbor, and in the culture of a community partner, both on the business level, where we've reached out, even as of recent of August 15th, we've invited and had a special meeting with local leaders of the community, the school superintendent, United Way Food Bank, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5635.178s">Food</a>  Bank, et cetera, recognizing that we are part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5640.119s">We</a>  are in this fine community and are very respectful for that and are involved across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5650.722s">So</a>  as we are engaged with the community through the community leaders, we are also respective of our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5656.743s">Therefore,</a>  the reach out, once again, prior to the August 15th and up as of late yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5663.685s">And</a>  as Mr. Dugdale noted, we will self-restrict overnight deliveries, mimicking the hours of operations for the board to grant the application request. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5674.551s">With</a>  that, I'd be glad to address any questions from the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5679.034s">Councilwoman</a>  O'Connor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5680.155s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5681.275s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, if you or Brian could go over the no overnight loading deliveries, scale loading, landscaping, if you could just go into more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5693.262s">Because</a>  the only complaints or questions that I've received from the residents that live behind there are worries about overnight deliveries, the noise, obviously, how the property looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5708.436s">But</a>  other than that, I really haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5709.718s">I</a>  want to just make sure those are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5711.82s">If</a>  you could just give hours.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5714.162s">So</a>  it's very simplistic here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5717.985s">The</a>  application, and that's the beauty of it, we're currently 7 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5721.967s">Store</a>  operations allowing our customers to come into the store with consideration of many families have two of the adults working in the family, school activities, and just a desire to get into the store and do their shopping on the way to work or after work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5740.255s">It</a>  allows them that flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5742.356s">So</a>  here again, the key point is hours of operations of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5746.578s">Tied</a>  in with that, we will self-restrict out of consideration to the neighbors and not have tractor-trailer deliveries at the rear of the store from midnight till 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5756.06s">in</a>  the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5758.301s">As</a>  far as the property here again, New England Development has committed to, as evidenced by Mr. Dugdale's statements there, that they are committed to a number of additional landscaping treatments at the rear of the store, the property line, the fencing, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5774.664s">including</a>  access across the driveway to the condo development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5779.708s">As</a>  far as the site overall itself, I think that speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5783.171s">As</a>  Mr. Dugdale had made presentation, it's a very beautiful upgrade from what the development had been. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5791.537s">I</a>  hope that addresses your question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5794.299s">Vice</a>  President Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5796.535s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5797.916s">And</a>  by no way am I speaking on behalf of the residents of Mr. Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5804.799s">However,</a>  the phone calls that I received from residents mainly were regarding the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5814.483s">And</a>  there's roughly 132 units that directly face the rear of your establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5824.185s">And</a>  I would say within approximately 200 feet from the rear of where deliveries will take place, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5833.788s">And</a>  I think the concern that I've been hearing from residents is, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying no overnights, but when a truck rolls up at 11, 11.30, quarter or 12, to me, that's a late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5848.951s">Or</a>  when it rolls up at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5850.772s">in</a>  the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5853.415s">That's</a>  an early hour, and I can appreciate the fact that you have sealed loading docks, and you're taking steps to minimize the noise impact of the Mystic condo residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5867.879s">However,</a>  in my opinion, in order for this to be acceptable to Wegmans, who we welcome you to the community, I look forward to shopping in Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5877.842s">I</a>  currently have to go up to Burlington now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5880.033s">to</a>  shop at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5881.674s">And</a>  we welcome you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5883.095s">The</a>  residents that I've spoken with in the condos also are eager to shop in your facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5889.98s">But</a>  the concern is the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5892.701s">And</a>  I would ask that the deliveries be limited not to just your hours of operation, but to hours that are acceptable to, even though you're in a commercial zoned area, to residential abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5909.392s">And</a>  that would be my first point, if you're willing to make a concession on those particular hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5917.161s">And</a>  knowing that, you know, that's the heart of a business, deliveries, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5923.484s">So</a>  that would be my first. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5924.984s">The</a>  second point residents have noticed that I spoke with was having nothing to do with delivery trucks, but the exhaust unit on top of your building, which is the size of a small bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5939.673s">And</a>  recently that exhaust unit has been functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5943.118s">I</a>  don't know if they're testing it or what's going on, but it emits a rather loud and frequent noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5951.77s">And</a>  I was wondering if there's any consideration to put additional buffers <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5957.277s">I</a>  know with other business establishments, we just had something on Riverside Ave, Smashburger, and a few other establishments that had something similar, not to the size that you have for exhaust, and they were able to put noise buffers to mitigate some of the noise for area residents that were roughly in the same proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5977.001s">I</a>  was wondering if you could speak on that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5979.162s">So</a>  it would be limiting the delivery hours, not to just your hours of operation, but to extend it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5985.883s">and</a>  also the exhaust on top of the building.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5988.765s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5989.305s">Let</a>  me work backwards on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5990.526s">Certainly,</a>  as far as the rooftop units, we use state-of-the-art units. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5995.008s">We</a>  offer to this council and certainly to the building department and any professionals they have on staff, we can certainly review with the town engineer or, again, through you, with you, the specific specifications of those units and if there's the possibility to look at possible mitigation measures on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6013.439s">As</a>  far as the deliveries, we are not speaking a large number of tractor trailers from 11 to midnight, or between 11 and midnight, and 6 AM in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6023.604s">We're</a>  talking one, two at the extreme, and the standard time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6028.707s">And</a>  that's once seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6032.789s">So</a>  we're talking one tractor trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6034.95s">the</a>  anomaly of two at that one hour at the extreme and one hour in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6039.392s">And</a>  here again, we're, we will be in compliance, we're committed to as we are in all communities being compliance with town codes, city codes or noise ordinances in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6050.336s">And</a>  we have the city council has that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6054.709s">if</a>  you will, that safeguard to come to us and saying you're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6060.054s">But</a>  quite frankly, before that happens, we'll be the first to hear in our store operations, our store managers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6066.1s">This</a>  is not the first store we're adjacent to a residential unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6070.904s">We</a>  have at least a dozen of them in our chains. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6073.386s">And</a>  we have worked through any issues, if there were issues to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6077.73s">And</a>  that's where we would offer, here again, self-restricted overnight deliveries, but keep up to midnight, with the understanding that it would be one, two, at the extreme as far as the anomaly, and that is in that particular hour, at the end and at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6095.002s">And</a>  here again, it comes to, if we <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6097.944s">It</a>  does come down to the basics of the weather and transportation and the overload of the highways. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6104.848s">These</a>  tractor trailers are coming from Rochester, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6107.269s">It's</a>  six plus hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6109.27s">So</a>  we have the, as folks that are familiar or in the business themselves, I'm not telling them anything new, the logistics on getting stuff from a warehouse into a truck <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6122.399s">300</a>  miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6128.122s">There's</a>  six hours away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6129.723s">It's</a>  very difficult, and it's a challenging month of flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6133.985s">That</a>  will allow us as a free board, and where we can, we will try to keep it to 11 and not 5 to 12 or 11.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6142.83s">Our</a>  intent is not to push it to the limits, but give a little latitude to remain a flexible, productive, successful business for the benefit, obviously, our business and then the community.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6157.687s">So</a>  from what I'm hearing from you, and I appreciate the flexibility, but not at the expense of the residents that live within 200 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6166.997s">And</a>  I appreciate the fact that these trucks are going to be coming from Rochester, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6171.442s">The</a>  fact that there's New England weather involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6174.465s">and</a>  so forth, and that makes me even feel more comfortable with my decision not to go right to midnight, because I think what we're going to end up seeing, and I've been doing this for a number of years, is that we're going to see the later deliveries, and we're going to see the 11, 30, 12 o'clock, a truck shows up at midnight, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6196.343s">or</a>  10 past midnight with $300,000 worth of filet mignon, I'm sure you're going to unload it.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6203.166s">I</a>  can commit to Mr. Councilman and to this council and to the community, we would self-restrict on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6209.449s">We</a>  start hearing those concerns, our tractor-trailer drivers, if that starts happening, we will be the first to reign that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6217.472s">And</a>  adjusted accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6218.753s">But</a>  that's where we're asking for that flexibility under the recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6222.474s">We</a>  are a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6223.895s">We</a>  are a community neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6226.716s">We</a>  ask for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6229.623s">And</a>  we will not be doing the 12 o'clock, 1145. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6231.584s">It</a>  will not be creeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6232.684s">If</a>  that happens, we'll be the first to cut back on it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6248.13s">And</a>  you realize this is a special permit, so even the fact that you understand code and noise ordinances, you're asking to work outside of the operating parameters of the current... No, actually, what I'm saying is an overlay on that.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6261.359s">I'm</a>  respectful of what we're saying is... <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6263.881s">that</a>  certainly understand that, yes, and I'm not trying to end around the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6268.626s">I'm</a>  recognizing that we understand the rules and regulations just as throughout the construction that we have to abide by, you know, building codes, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6278.195s">The</a>  same thing once we're up and operating, we understand and respect, quite frankly, and understand and we will comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6285.342s">if</a>  not self-restricted, if there's little missteps, we are the first to react to the positive in reaction to the community, more specifically the town and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6295.63s">You</a>  have our commitment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6297.892s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, and I know some residents are probably going to want to speak from the Mr. Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6305.638s">My</a>  support for any special permit tonight, and I just want the gentleman who I respect and <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6311.937s">thank</a>  the business for coming into our community, that my stance is going to remain the same, that the hours of operation for delivery should at the very least coincide with current ordinances and not the extended permit which you're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6329.064s">And</a>  if that is something that you can work with and compromise, then as a member of the council, you'll have my vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6336.847s">Otherwise,</a>  I think, at least from my standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6340.977s">I</a>  can't support it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6342.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6343.858s">Mr.</a>  Ferris, you have a store in Chestnut Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6346.859s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6347.96s">That</a>  has apartments that are closer than what are here in Midwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6352.762s">How</a>  have you dealt with that situation?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6356.803s">Here</a>  again, we're committed as we are in this community to that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6359.865s">And</a>  it's restricted from midnight to 6 AM.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6363.046s">And</a>  you've had no problems in Chestnut Hill?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6366.047s">That's</a>  my understanding, correct.</p>
