    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=212.503s">Anita</a>  Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=215.524s">And</a>  you were the owner, correct?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=218.345s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=219.106s">I'm</a>  the managing director of Ultimate Tango, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=223.266s">We</a>  want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=230.854s">So</a>  Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=243.508s">and</a>  also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=252.091s">So</a>  we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=266.638s">So</a>  those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=274.082s">And</a>  right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=277.984s">So</a>  our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of being open, business being open, would be Sunday to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=289.931s">We</a>  will not initially use any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=293.533s">so</a>  it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=303.761s">Those</a>  milongas have special settings, it's the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other, they usually come as a couple, husband and wife or people who are together or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=318.932s">There</a>  is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance, there is a special code how many dances then dance together. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=328.055s">There</a>  is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=332.776s">And</a>  of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=339.895s">So</a>  there is no kind of like a wild party settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=345.02s">The</a>  music is very mild. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=346.702s">People</a>  behave actually very, very politely. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=349.084s">They</a>  care for the ladies, they care for the partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=351.926s">They</a>  walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=354.889s">I</a>  explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=363.857s">how</a>  it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=370.801s">And</a>  that's pretty much it.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=371.701s">Yeah,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=374.463s">I</a>  mean, one of the reasons also we have the event at 9 p.m., because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=384.128s">So</a>  on this Sunday, there are another two studios who organize two more practices in different hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=390.431s">If</a>  we don't want a conflict with another business, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=393.073s">We</a>  want to respect the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=394.874s">The</a>  only hour we can start it would be like at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=398.235s">And</a>  because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and for different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=411.341s">For</a>  they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour and be in the studio just for two hours practicing or maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=420.602s">And</a>  also in Argentina, the milongas went for hours, so people just keep dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=424.664s">It's</a>  a kind of ritual. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=425.665s">In</a>  Argentina, we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=427.926s">until...</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=450.421s">We</a>  also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hears it outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=461.728s">And</a>  since most people drive, and there's plenty of parking here, and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=477.834s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=480.135s">Councilor</a>  Dajew.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=482.547s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=485.229s">I've</a>  reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=489.212s">I've</a>  noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=492.434s">Initially,</a>  the request was to stay open until 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=495.957s">Sunday</a>  evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=497.458s">Chief</a>  Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=503.982s">That's</a>  something that he feels as though he's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=506.905s">Also,</a>  I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=511.948s">And</a>  no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=524.444s">I</a>  do have a question for the petitioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=526.146s">Is</a>  there going to be any live music?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=532.225s">No,</a>  there is only going to be recorded music.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=536.306s">Mr.</a>  President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=542.608s">So</a>  with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=546.869s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=548.389s">I</a>  think my first question you answer the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=560.74s">The</a>  sound of the tango is very mild music. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=564.043s">It</a>  doesn't get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=565.644s">Even</a>  the rest of us, we did a check sound with them and they don't hear nothing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=585.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=585.911s">And</a>  my second question, if you are going to be open till one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=593.001s">What</a>  will there be for food and beverage?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=599.534s">During</a>  regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=606.781s">So</a>  no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=618.537s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=635.572s">Development</a>  Committee, which takes care of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=638.813s">We've</a>  worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=654.4s">They've</a>  been compliant to any of our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=658.261s">They've</a>  certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us, and so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=675.346s">As</a>  a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=684.452s">They'll</a>  bring something new and diverse to us, something positive and energetic, and so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=696.661s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=697.602s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak in fairness?</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=702.088s">name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=703.068s">Once</a>  again, Dominic Camara, the Chamber of Commerce of the Governmental Affairs Committees, and I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbon symbolically, if nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=721.273s">And</a>  I was very, very enthralled. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=723.115s">I</a>  was very happy to see the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=725.336s">It's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=726.057s">It's</a>  downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the geographic position of the place, and that's where the old Channel 3 thing used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=734.764s">And</a>  it's very, very nice, very professional and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=739.168s">And</a>  I gotta tell you, with all the tango that was playing and so on, and these two can dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=743.331s">Oh</a>  my God, can they dance? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=747.943s">And</a>  so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=757.893s">So</a>  even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=761.477s">So</a>  disturbance is not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=762.698s">But</a>  here's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=764.139s">Any</a>  life that you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=770.603s">So</a>  I hope that another studio like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=774.225s">I</a>  don't want to, you know, when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=776.506s">And</a>  that's pretty much what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=778.227s">And</a>  I welcome them in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=780.228s">I</a>  think they're wonderful professional people and they're so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=783.21s">And</a>  I have nothing but happiness for them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=785.371s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=785.732s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=786.724s">And</a>  I for one can say I was there that night that they opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=789.306s">I</a>  was very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=790.647s">The</a>  men were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=791.348s">The</a>  women were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=792.729s">The</a>  dancing was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=794.33s">And</a>  like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=802.096s">But</a>  again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango, and anybody can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=807.421s">But</a>  again, I welcome them, and I think the studio was very, very nice, and it's very impressive what I saw that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=814.647s">If</a>  they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=816.168s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=816.728s">We</a>  wouldn't give up hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=819.05s">Move</a>  approval. <a

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1094.169s">Okay,</a>  could you please explain your project then? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1096.934s">For</a>  this project we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1101.687s">We're</a>  basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1107.992s">Originally</a>  the Century Bank is the customer but in doing this project we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1124.728s">I</a>  did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1131.372s">I</a>  don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1138.717s">Those</a>  maps.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1141.439s">Those</a>  full maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1142.259s">I</a>  think everybody has their maps with them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1149.664s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1153.206s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1160.74s">I</a>  have a few questions about just the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1165.884s">So</a>  if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1174.65s">That's</a>  going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1181.796s">I</a>  know that's a heavy congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1185.299s">Depending</a>  upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1194.965s">I</a>  would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1203.43s">And</a>  do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1208.733s">Again,</a>  it all depends on what the city engineer believe when they issue the permit, if it's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1218.095s">to</a>  do it at night and we may be able to get more work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1220.637s">I</a>  just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1225.56s">And</a>  could you tell us, let's see, basically with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1236.648s">You're</a>  going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1242.091s">You're</a>  going to be replacing them with cements? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.553s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.993s">And</a>  can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1250.157s">I</a>  believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1253.619s">And</a>  I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault location is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1262.125s">So</a>  there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1267.508s">And</a>  they'll be replaced with concrete?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1269.189s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1270.585s">And</a>  can you tell us with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1280.554s">Are</a>  they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1283.736s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1284.197s">The</a>  first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street, so there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1291.783s">the</a>  first utility pulled down to Salem Street that would be impacted, and that work there is probably only going to take a day or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1299.045s">They</a>  would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1304.427s">And</a>  with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1316.898s">needs</a>  to be paid once you're done opening up the street and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1321.299s">And</a>  this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is, over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1330.061s">And</a>  I noticed that you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1336.662s">So</a>  is that payment going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1341.069s">reimbursement</a>  from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the sections that you cut open?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1349.126s">I'm</a>  not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1351.727s">I</a>  just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1357.611s">But</a>  I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1365.935s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1370.358s">That's</a>  all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1378.005s">So</a>  I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1384.11s">So</a>  I guess my question is basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1387.702s">are</a>  you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1390.464s">It</a>  sounds like enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1391.244s">It</a>  sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1395.767s">Based</a>  off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1410.075s">I</a>  can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1418.282s">I</a>  think that might be a little bit of a point of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1422.005s">I</a>  mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1428.049s">The</a>  last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1432.172s">And</a>  they basically promised that they would pave curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1437.817s">And</a>  I feel like we're almost setting precedent by doing this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1442.2s">And</a>  in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1450.359s">My</a>  colleagues may have a further comment on that, but I just think that we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1456.339s">make</a>  sure that the street is repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1457.88s">And</a>  I may like to see curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1461.061s">I</a>  think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1466.943s">I</a>  mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1469.544s">But</a>  I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1474.325s">And</a>  I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1483.008s">Um,</a>  it's a big cut through the street methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1485.129s">Big</a>  cut through community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1487.611s">And,</a>  um, sorry, I think curb to curb paving would be something that we should look at.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1497.797s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1500.243s">And</a>  first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1512.411s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1523.358s">We</a>  also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old Armory building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1533.328s">And</a>  I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1541.695s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this finally moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1545.056s">The</a>  question I had, and I think Councilor Falco touched upon it, is of recent, the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1560.551s">And</a>  it's been <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1561.472s">an</a>  issue of contention among this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1564.495s">And</a>  we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb to curb knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1580.99s">And</a>  the question I have on this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1584.833s">It</a>  does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1594.956s">And</a>  right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1600.178s">And</a>  it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1612.264s">What</a>  exactly does that language mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1614.346s">That</a>  doesn't really say much to me.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1616.587s">That's</a>  something that the city engineer wrote in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1618.689s">So</a>  I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1623.292s">Typically,</a>  we do all our own paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1626.454s">Typically,</a>  we repave the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1629.476s">Sometimes</a>  if it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1633.739s">But</a>  in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1638.29s">Therefore,</a>  you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1645.62s">Or</a>  I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1649.385s">If</a>  we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1657.084s">Okay,</a>  and the way I read it is a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1660.146s">I</a>  read it is the city will determine how these streets will be put back and not just whether Comcast will do the work of the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb center line to curb in the city will make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1674.792s">And</a>  I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1683.996s">And</a>  do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1689.598s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1690.799s">And</a>  if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1693.82s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1694.64s">So</a>  I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1708.284s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1709.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1710.305s">Councilor</a>  Dyke. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1712.366s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1713.997s">Very</a>  difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1726.985s">And</a>  the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1732.208s">But</a>  the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1736.851s">But</a>  before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1739.472s">I</a>  mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1742.114s">We</a>  need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1744.476s">We've</a>  entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Medford, where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1752.221s">But</a>  we don't know what the construction schedule is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1754.262s">Now,</a>  it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1757.484s">I</a>  think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1761.128s">I</a>  think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1774.881s">We</a>  need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Medford Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1782.428s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1789.674s">And</a>  I'd like to see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1792.356s">You</a>  know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1795.279s">I</a>  mean, we want to see the curbs paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1797.36s">We</a>  want to see it paved curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1798.761s">That's</a>  been something we've been hounding on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1801.023s">It's</a>  a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighbourhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1808.987s">Sometimes</a>  it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighbourhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1822.034s">So</a>  that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1823.955s">Certainly,</a>  I think it's a noble cause and I think it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1827.438s">and</a>  a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1831.161s">I'm</a>  just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.013s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1846.373s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1847.434s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1852.02s">A</a>  couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1868.876s">First,</a>  let me say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1871.728s">I</a>  think this is a good measure, we need it in the square, and Comcast needs to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1878.792s">They're</a>  the primary provider here in the city of Medford, and people need this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1886.616s">I'm</a>  looking at the language in this petition, and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone, and she's doing something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1899.32s">is</a>  going to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets, and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1915.889s">And</a>  if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1922.352s">And</a>  I think we need to have a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1925.213s">an</a>  amendment to this paper that the city council understands that the language herein, this petition for this public hearing and to have this work done is saying that the city engineer of the city of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb that Comcast understands that and will fund <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1954.449s">the</a>  City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1963.836s">Traffic</a>  plans, traffic, digging up sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1971.756s">10</a>  of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1979.222s">We</a>  had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1991.178s">not</a>  engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2004.045s">We</a>  had several private contractors over the years advise the cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2008.687s">The</a>  plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2017.592s">And</a>  one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2020.498s">from</a>  citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2031.363s">And</a>  one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2048.688s">Salem</a>  Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2054.092s">And</a>  let them find another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2055.934s">Let</a>  them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2063.379s">So</a>  if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2075.429s">Let's</a>  let's look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2077.454s">Let's</a>  let the engineering department and the community development department <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2085.023s">experiment</a>  with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2092.646s">And</a>  I think the citizens of Medford will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2095.187s">They're</a>  going to benefit from getting this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2097.548s">Hopefully,</a>  they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2103.57s">And</a>  Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.631s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2107.991s">With</a>  that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2109.272s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2111.815s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2112.696s">Thank</a>  you, my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2113.477s">I</a>  think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2117.982s">I</a>  appreciate Dave from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2119.943s">I</a>  don't believe Comcast has any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2124.628s">I</a>  have any issues with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2125.869s">I</a>  think you've done your due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2127.711s">I</a>  think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've made <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2134.017s">echo</a>  this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2154.314s">you</a>  put forth as your company, I think that's been very receptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2158.195s">But</a>  I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying, which is the biggest point is City Engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2167.138s">We</a>  can talk going back and forth about voting or not voting, but I think that my recommendation would be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the City Engineer <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2178.882s">to</a>  get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2182.483s">Traffic</a>  plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2196.007s">But</a>  understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2209.376s">I</a>  don't want to delay this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2210.738s">I</a>  want to push it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2211.779s">But</a>  at the same time, I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2220.349s">So</a>  I want to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2224.733s">for</a>  our businesses and our community, but at the same time, I think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2250.382s">making</a>  sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2265.434s">If</a>  I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2273.359s">Well,</a>  then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2283.265s">I</a>  don't want to delay it so it does fall into construction questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2287.347s">but</a>  moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2305.879s">with</a>  what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2321.262s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2322.523s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2323.203s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2326.743s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2327.964s">I</a>  just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2328.844s">I</a>  understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2334.913s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2336.755s">And</a>  if I if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2340.478s">We</a>  just need to know if we if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2344.982s">And</a>  then I would be able to give you a schedule, the point of information if I can.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2348.626s">I'm</a>  sorry, this is the frustration frustrating part. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2351.869s">This</a>  is something that the engineer that we should have had from the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2355.152s">This</a>  is something that you as the contract of <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2358.615s">for</a>  Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2362.261s">So</a>  that's my frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2363.603s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2372.305s">If</a>  it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare and one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2379.231s">But</a>  if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans for the week.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2386.457s">I</a>  do have a traffic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2387.778s">I</a>  did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2391.301s">And</a>  I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2393.963s">Is</a>  this it, Dick?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2396.065s">No,</a>  this isn't the traffic.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2397.806s">This</a>  is what you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2398.647s">That's</a>  the traffic.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2399.447s">Yeah,</a>  that's the traffic.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2404.435s">So</a>  again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2408.218s">I</a>  mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2412.161s">But</a>  I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2415.264s">And</a>  if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2419.928s">And</a>  I have it, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2421.669s">I</a>  was looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2422.29s">It</a>  didn't look like the directions aren't on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2424.672s">But</a>  it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2428.975s">So</a>  I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2434.233s">My</a>  last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2442.899s">I</a>  know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curve-to-curve from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curve-to-curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2456.549s">So</a>  I just think we need to figure out a way that, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2459.076s">figure</a>  out what we want as a group, collectively, of going forward for all utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2465.62s">So</a>  we do it fairly, and we require the same thing from every single company. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2469.823s">And</a>  I think we're on track with, obviously, making our streets be repaired much better than they have been, and where things are sinking and dipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2481.031s">So</a>  I think we're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2482.331s">I</a>  just think we need to have a discussion in <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2485.413s">in</a>  committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2491.948s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2493.569s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2496.131s">I</a>  think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2500.133s">I</a>  think that we've held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2501.794s">We've</a>  heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2506.837s">I</a>  think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2521.046s">to</a>  the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2522.507s">So</a>  we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2533.296s">So</a>  if the permit can be approved, provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2538.441s">Just</a>  an option, just a way for us to maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2541.283s">move</a>  this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2541.983s">I</a>  don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2544.144s">As</a>  I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2547.665s">We</a>  could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2555.148s">And</a>  upon our approval, the permit will be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2557.208s">But</a>  we don't need to bring the gentleman back. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2558.549s">I</a>  don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2560.709s">We</a>  can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.008s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2567.988s">Mr.</a>  President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2579.514s">If</a>  we accept this amendment, we've clarified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2582.476s">We</a>  want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2587.906s">discussions</a>  over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2604.246s">And</a>  it seems to me the way I read this language <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2608.15s">here</a>  in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2613.411s">And</a>  I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2625.915s">So</a>  if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2635.518s">Quite</a>  frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2636.738s">I'm</a>  not qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2638.1s">I'm</a>  not an engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2639.642s">I'm</a>  not a construction person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2641.705s">I</a>  can't shovel snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2643.408s">I'm</a>  pretty good with leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2645.872s">Every</a>  morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2652.647s">That's</a>  the scope of my construction skills, but the engineer and her staff understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2660.372s">This</a>  is their profession, and it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked, and I think we should allow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2669.758s">I</a>  don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2677.663s">I</a>  think that the construction people need to be aware that National Engineers had some serious problems historically in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2686.929s">So</a>  I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2691.613s">And</a>  as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2701.921s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2714.788s">As</a>  I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2725.936s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a motion on the table, if you want to present it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2729.979s">If</a>  I can, I would present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2731.34s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo's initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2736.043s">I</a>  think that, again, my biggest concern is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2742.022s">What</a>  we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that and move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2749.737s">will,</a>  what's the timeline for the construction and whether making sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally, I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Method Square and to help our business owners and the, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2776.96s">the</a>  neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2786.245s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2787.206s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2788.186s">So</a>  as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2804.615s">And</a>  that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2809.077s">And</a>  the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2820.441s">And</a>  the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2827.203s">the</a>  proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2830.726s">Summarized</a>  perfectly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2834.069s">I</a>  think somebody else would like to speak.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2838.534s">Name</a>  and address on the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2840.67s">Dave</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockblind Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2843.693s">One</a>  of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2847.957s">I</a>  think that Councilor Lungo-Koehn is 100% right as well as Councilor Marks and a few others. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2854.984s">My</a>  recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up with a comprehensive <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2865.816s">engineer</a>  and, you know, project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2875.541s">So</a>  in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2889.048s">So</a>  I kind of, I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from two and three patches to five and seven patches. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2897.871s">So</a>  I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curve based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2913.116s">So</a>  it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2918.737s">And</a>  I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2924.022s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2934.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2935.992s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2939.676s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2941.437s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2941.978s">Geron</a>  Colostos, 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2947.58s">I</a>  understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards, and we have to hold somebody accountable for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2957.407s">So</a>  I'm not gonna disregard as being not important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2961.27s">It</a>  is, it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2963.131s">But</a>  my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Avenue, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2971.697s">Now,</a>  I went 30 years without anything but DSL. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2976.615s">Now</a>  we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2981.756s">But</a>  at this point, they're the only game in town for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2985.397s">So</a>  whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2989.878s">I</a>  do have Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2992.239s">Comcast</a>  has done their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=2994.379s">They</a>  signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3000.181s">And</a>  the savings is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3002.17s">So</a>  what I don't want to see happen is, as much as all these details are important, I don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like a tug of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3013.418s">Well,</a>  we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3019.422s">And</a>  in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for our expenditure to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3029.133s">Whatever</a>  the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval, and then if you're satisfied with what they submit, move forward and not come back to another public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3042.308s">So</a>  please, let's move this along as quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3045.272s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3046.513s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3047.735s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3051.859s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli has a motion to take.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3053.641s">I</a>  believe I rescinded and move on to the recommendations of Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3058.945s">Move</a>  for approval as amended.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3060.146s">A</a>  motion by Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3064.669s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3065.965s">Please</a>  call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3066.806s">Before</a>  you call the roll, just as a B paper, if we could set up a meeting within the next month to discuss standards and guidelines, I think that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3075.732s">David</a>  hit it on the head.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3078.595s">I</a>  would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3081.057s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3082.538s">I</a>  do believe we had that meeting already. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3083.819s">We</a>  posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3090.164s">I</a>  think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3095.081s">And</a>  I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3099.024s">And</a>  I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3102.026s">And</a>  I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3109.632s">And</a>  I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.316s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.636s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3114.896s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3147.018s">I</a>  know we have a paper that's been tabled 17-593. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3152.181s">I</a>  believe that Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC, High Street, the position High Street and Hillside Ave for intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3165.249s">I</a>  believe that we're waiting on a question that maybe could be answered to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3171.112s">I</a>  believe the question was that we were asking for <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3175.973s">If</a>  we can't take it off the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3178.254s">Motion</a>  by Councilman Scott Felde to take this up 17-593 off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3182.876s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3183.996s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3184.417s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3185.677s">Councilman</a>  Scott Felde.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3186.417s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3187.378s">Again,</a>  I apologize for jumping the gun, but I believe we're asking <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3193.168s">some</a>  clarification on this paper that we asked Comcast to report back to us to see if that job could be curb-to-curb also paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3203.218s">So</a>  if you haven't, can you respond to that?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3205.801s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3209.164s">I</a>  thought it was half centerline.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3222.584s">My</a>  recollection is curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3279.941s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3281.542s">It</a>  was tabled based on a roll call vote for in the affirmative, three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3287.485s">I</a>  believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3292.928s">But</a>  it doesn't say that, it just says upon motion to table a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3298.471s">And</a>  it's not reflecting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3300.692s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3303.133s">I</a>  happen to recall the discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3307.355s">from</a>  three, four weeks ago, even though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3313.499s">I</a>  do recall that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3316.181s">And</a>  at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3326.028s">So</a>  we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3331.993s">So</a>  I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked another utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3343.381s">So</a>  I don't know if this gentleman for the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3346.223s">a</a>  high street project which is going into the armory. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3348.964s">I</a>  believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3356.066s">So</a>  maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3761.016s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn, there was a reason why it took so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3764.657s">There</a>  was an absentee landlord who subsequently moved to Hawaii. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3769.245s">And</a>  during that time, we were in the process of contacting a management company, which took quite a while, and what ended up happening, we had to put a lien on the house, and it took several, after the lien was put on, the vendor took several months to give us his invoice, and then once we got the invoice, we had to wait another several months for the attorney that closed on the property to give us a check for the lien that we had placed on the property.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3877.632s">I</a>  expected to have it all read, so I am going to summarize it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3882.657s">This</a>  is a request for $348,336 from Free Cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3884.879s">The</a>  information you typically request is there in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3887.0s">The</a>  first $256,000 is to upgrade the lights at the Andrews School to controllable LED lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3902.313s">This</a>  is a natural next step after the other work that we've done in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3906.235s">You</a>  might be aware that last winter we did the Curtis Tosta LED lights interior. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3911.038s">We</a>  did some of the hallways and some other LED light projects at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3915.16s">This</a>  is the direction that the industry is moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3917.981s">Our</a>  DPW was built with all LED lights as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3923.304s">This</a>  particular project is being, I'm asking for this money to do this project at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3928.706s">because</a>  this will serve as the city's match to a grant the state and B2Q Consulting received from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3937.95s">So</a>  the lighting project on its own makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3941.751s">It'll</a>  save the city about $22,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3945.392s">But</a>  if we do it at this time, we can use it as our share on this grant project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3951.735s">The</a>  grant is to do electricity peak demand reduction, and it's a pilot for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3958.367s">So</a>  basically the state gave B2Q and the city money to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3963.769s">The</a>  grant itself is $478,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3966.951s">And</a>  as well, National Grid is very interested in how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3972.693s">And</a>  they have committed $125,000 of technical assistance time on this specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3980.456s">And</a>  the project would actually run in the Andrews School and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=3985.557s">We'll</a>  get additionally, they'll be upgrading the controls in the schools and the DPW to be able to control the lights in both of those buildings through our computer system, as well as doing additional upgrades to the heating and cooling system and their controls, how we run it, energy efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4004.07s">It</a>  is also likely that we would get revenue from the demand response program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4008.553s">The</a>  amount of that revenue is very dependent on <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4011.795s">The</a>  whole process, we're still doing the feasibility part of it that determines how much electricity we would actually produce through these programs during peak demand time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4023.364s">That's</a>  one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4024.785s">The</a>  other part of the money is $83,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4028.42s">that</a>  would serve as a match for another grant that we received from the Department of Energy Resources that would add battery and the ability to run solar off-grid to the DPW and the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4042.169s">And</a>  as you know, we're in the process of putting solar on the DPW, so this adds battery to that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4047.993s">Can</a>  you repeat the figure you just said?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4050.035s">So,</a>  which, okay.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4051.976s">The</a>  amount awarded by the grant from the Department of Energy?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4054.298s">So</a>  the first grant is, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4058.363s">$478,688.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4058.383s">The</a>  second grant, I'm asking for $83,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4067.458s">I</a>  can be more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4068.898s">$83,336</a>  serves as a match. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4069.819s">It</a>  is 10% of the grant amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4071.299s">Hold</a>  on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4072.659s">Because</a>  we have it as $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4073.74s">No,</a>  the grant is $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4074.58s">Yes,</a>  so the grant is an $833,000 and change grant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4076.64s">And</a>  so our match is 10% that we need to have in hand as we begin the project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4095.436s">So</a>  battery is very, very expensive to pair with solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4099.678s">And</a>  we believe it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4101.299s">It'll</a>  allow us to run these buildings off grid when the electricity is down. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4106.481s">And</a>  the grant will pay for this battery that would go with both the solar systems, the one we're in the process of, and the one that is planned that will be coming eventually our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4118.627s">We</a>  have to redo the roof at the Andrews School before we come forward with a solid proposal on solar for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4125.212s">So</a>  that's the whole package altogether.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4127.793s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4128.414s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4129.314s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4130.175s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4131.535s">And</a>  thank you for this report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4134.237s">Hunt</a>  and Superintendent Bellison. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4136.998s">I</a>  think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4139.7s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this here type of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4144.282s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regards to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4153.461s">Right,</a>  so the lighting project, it would be our intention to do it second shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4158.785s">So</a>  they would be in there 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4161.587s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4162.768s">in</a>  order to do that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4165.55s">Solar,</a>  if and when we are able. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4168.151s">So</a>  we'll need to do a new roof and solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4170.913s">My</a>  hope is that we could get something lined up for next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4174.96s">But</a>  that is still the chunk to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4178.381s">The</a>  battery piece of it would actually be completely out of the way in the back area, not where students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4186.283s">There's</a>  a separate entrance into the electrical rooms where we have generators and HVAC equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4192.385s">So</a>  the contractors, when they do do work, could work in that area without ever having to go into the main portion of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4201.247s">Or</a>  they could go in through the main portion, check in with the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4204.788s">with</a>  the security, but then they would just traverse through the building and be in that back area and never have to actually be in student areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4214.11s">I</a>  also know the superintendent is here to speak to some of this as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4219.472s">If</a>  I may, what would be the duration of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4222.192s">How</a>  long would it take to replace all the lights?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4225.912s">A</a>  couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4227.333s">So</a>  I will tell you that this is a large project, so it would have to be bid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4231.035s">And</a>  part of the bidding out process is to ask the contractors, how long will it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4235.857s">Because</a>  some contractors will put one crew on and do it over many weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4240.559s">Other</a>  contractors will say, I have 10 crews, and I'll get it done in three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4245.262s">So</a>  because it's going to be a project that would be bid out, I cannot tell you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4251.825s">And</a>  I can't bid it out until we're at that stage of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4255.943s">is</a>  when we would have to schedule.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4258.163s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, so it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4265.285s">Will</a>  all the workers be quarried and whatnot?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4268.786s">If</a>  there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.228s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.528s">So</a>  we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4286.472s">make</a>  sure that we're doing everything we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4289.497s">This</a>  is a pretty big project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4292.16s">There'll</a>  be a lot of people in the building, so we just want to make sure we're protecting our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4295.645s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4302.568s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4304.85s">Alicia,</a>  regarding the paired battery storage, will we be able to accept additional electricity from the current windmill and also provide that to the battery storage?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4321.522s">The</a>  wind turbine is actually connected to the McGlynn School, not the Andrews School, so it would not be connected to this battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4332.387s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4332.567s">But</a>  we couldn't connect one to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4334.928s">I</a>  mean, the schools are on the same property, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4349.295s">The</a>  wind turbine doesn't make as much electricity compared to what a solar installation does to make it worth the amount of electrical work you would have to do to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4358.477s">There</a>  would also be a lot of changes to the control system in order to take in that separate, very different input. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4368.512s">And</a>  I hope that at some point in the future, we'd be able to do a similar project at the McGlynn School, and at which point we would have the wind turbine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4376.836s">We</a>  would also have the benefit of having done this project at the Andrew School first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4383.178s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4386.0s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4388.2s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4390.381s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4390.602s">Hunt,</a>  thank you very much for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4392.302s">I'm</a>  looking at this paper and reading what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4397.187s">grant</a>  for this, grant for that, grant for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4399.509s">And</a>  I know that those grants didn't write themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4401.47s">And</a>  I think that they deserve a lot of credit for going out there and finding the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4405.953s">So</a>  thank you very much for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4407.874s">And</a>  looking at this paper, I mean, we have $265,000 to upgrade the LED lights at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4415.199s">My</a>  math, as spooky as it is, would come back and show that we have about <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4419.982s">12-year</a>  return on our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4422.164s">We're</a>  going to save about $22,000 a year if we convert to the LED lighting, and we'll be able to capture this investment within a period of about 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4431.211s">I</a>  also understand that this $83,000 is a 10% match on the battery, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4433.433s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4433.693s">And</a>  if you add the $265,000 and the $83,000, we come up with a figure of $348,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4444.673s">So</a>  this appropriation is for $348,000, but we're also looking at $100,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4446.855s">A</a>  $478,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.156s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.256s">A</a>  $125,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4447.476s">So</a>  the $100,000 is</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4461.275s">There</a>  are two different numbers for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4463.696s">One</a>  is an incentive for the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4467.497s">So</a>  the lighting project is actually more expensive than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4470.498s">So</a>  that comes in to offset the cost of the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4474.359s">And</a>  the other is that National Grid will put technical assistance in to this project, which honestly, I feel is very notable that they've actually said that this project is interesting enough to them that they want to put that much of their own <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4489.577s">into</a>  the project to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4493.52s">But</a>  it's the equivalent of $125,000 in national grid time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4498.204s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4499.145s">So</a>  in looking at all the grant money or the matching funds that have been awarded to the city, how much money are we talking here?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4510.735s">I</a>  have not done that math. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4512.737s">But</a>  we're looking at like 833 and 478, so that's <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4518.42s">close</a>  to one plus the $100,000, on the order of $1.3 million of money that'll be coming into city buildings.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4526.805s">So</a>  this evening you're asking for us to make an investment of $348,000 so that we can get a return on that investment of over a million dollars?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4533.889s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4534.41s">I'm</a>  comfortable voting for this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4536.111s">Thank</a>  you very much for your work, Mr. President, and for approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4540.173s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4541.013s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4542.694s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4544.035s">Hentwell,</a>  we have you before us, and we're talking about the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4547.422s">Can</a>  you give us an update on the test borings that were done very close to there and whether or not they were done behind the Andrews School, any results that may be coming back?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4556.264s">Right,</a>  so I do believe that there is a response in your packets that is from the motion prior about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4564.966s">I'm</a>  happy to speak to it for a minute or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4567.067s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4569.25s">I</a>  don't have the response that went to you in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4573.733s">But</a>  we did the test scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4575.654s">We</a>  found that there were two locations that had very high levels deep down. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4582.678s">One</a>  was, oh my gosh, my brain is going to stop on that, lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4587.38s">And</a>  the other was very unusually, threw me for a loop, I believe it was zinc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4591.723s">Is</a>  that right that's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4594.244s">And</a>  I didn't even know prior that could be contaminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4597.918s">And</a>  so those two locations, we need to do, so we did testing in the grid, and two spots showed up with high levels, and now we need to, oh, thank you, I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4615.703s">I</a>  did not refresh myself on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4619.846s">Yes,</a>  zinc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4621.567s">Sorry,</a>  it's such an odd thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4623.989s">I</a>  was not aware that zinc at a high level could be a soil contaminant until we got involved in this project, so I always question myself when I say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4633.002s">So</a>  those two spots are very high and actually either have to be removed or we have to do extensive room reporting and testing to the state that would be extremely costly to removing those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4645.508s">So</a>  we need to do testing around those locations to find out exactly so we know where there is a problem and we know these areas where there isn't and we want to test in closer to see how small of an area can we deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4659.555s">So</a>  it might be that we put <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4661.398s">you</a>  know, a bench and a paved area and a bench over the zinc location, or it may be that we dig a hole and dig it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4670.826s">And</a>  we need to, in order to do one of those things, do a little bit more testing to understand those locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4677.032s">We</a>  haven't yet tested on the other side of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4681.395s">The</a>  lead level is actually very close to the sidewalk, and so as part of narrowing that, we are gonna need to go on the other side of the sidewalk <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4689.202s">and</a>  do that testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4691.163s">But</a>  we'd sort of been waiting to get it all done at the same time and not do that separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4698.244s">There</a>  were two areas that had petroleum and PCBs, which we also have to do some further examination to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4707.587s">The</a>  other thing that was notable that I mentioned in here, one of the other properties, they have had a problem with their groundwater that they are very aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4717.335s">And</a>  one of the questions that had come up to me, and what prompted this testing partially in part was, was this problem in the groundwater under our property? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4728.649s">And</a>  we did not find any of that under our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4733.505s">So</a>  additionally, some of the area within the fence belongs to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4740.749s">That</a>  area has been delineated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4742.55s">We</a>  have not been doing testing on that area, but we are in close contact with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4746.912s">I,</a>  in fact, discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4749.733s">with</a>  them today, and they're very interested in working with us to be able to do a solution that provides safety and protection to everybody, but is as minimal expense and actually impact to the area as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4766.644s">And</a>  with their extensive experience in these sorts of problems, I think we're going to be able to do things a little bit better because they're going to be a partner with us on this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4778.07s">Thank</a>  you very much for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4779.512s">We</a>  do have it in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4781.693s">There</a>  are a number of parents that have been asking me questions, you know, so I wanted you to state it publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4786.357s">And</a>  just so I have it clearly, after reading it and after your explanation, test pourings were done at the clippership part section. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4792.842s">The</a>  lead and the zinc were found. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4795.18s">But</a>  there will be, as requested by the council, there will be some pourings on the other side of the walkway, which is behind Andrews, where the children play soccer and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4804.892s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4805.292s">So</a>  I do not anticipate that we would go up onto the soccer field. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4809.738s">We</a>  were able to find the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4812.421s">So</a>  when those schools were built, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4814.458s">They</a>  found arsenic in that area, and the area was low enough that they were legally allowed to close the site without doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4823.273s">But</a>  they came in and put clean fill over that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4828.362s">But</a>  it was after the fact that the area was closed with the state as being acceptable as is, but then the city came in and put the clean fill on anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4840.605s">So</a>  the records on that and exactly the locations are a little different, but it's pretty clear to the eye that where the soccer field raises up is part of that area with the clean fill on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4852.747s">and</a>  which makes us very comfortable about that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4855.428s">And</a>  it's just the part that slopes down to the pathway where you might say, well, that doesn't look like there's clean fill on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4864.213s">And</a>  so that's where some of these borings are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4867.395s">And</a>  then can you just, lastly, just give us a time frame so we know when to request an update?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4873.878s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4875.535s">So</a>  I'm hoping to do that over the next four to six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4879.856s">Some</a>  of it is scheduling with the equipment that is necessary to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4886.338s">And</a>  finalizing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4888.579s">We've</a>  been waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4889.279s">Honestly,</a>  our point of contact at the state <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4893.345s">The</a>  Environmental Protection Office has been out for three weeks on leave, and we really wanted him to see our most recent report and discuss it with him, and he returned from leave yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4904.058s">So</a>  before I schedule the borings, I do want to review with him the results of our first round of borings.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4948.805s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4949.91s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4950.671s">Just</a>  if we could, if we can also, while we have Alicia here, if you can give us just a brief update on where we stand with the lighting in the square.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4959.478s">So</a>  the lighting of the square has been folded in with our larger city lighting project, and I actually spoke with our consultants at Lane Thomp, oh my gosh, on Monday, yesterday, about the history of those lights, what are in those various fixtures, what we're looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4980.107s">Based</a>  on what I've said and the observations, and I'd love feedback, but my impression is that most people are happy with the light levels at the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4991.773s">Those</a>  are the same fixtures, but much brighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4995.175s">And</a>  so I believe that we'll be able, through this project, to install equivalent light bulbs, basically, from what's in the Peace Garden into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5007.827s">For</a>  technical reasons, under an energy efficiency project, I could never put those in because it would be increasing the electricity that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5017.25s">And</a>  that would fall outside of any kind of grant money I could do, or I would have to put that out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5023.493s">Under</a>  our larger lighting project, it's probably the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5028.035s">And</a>  that will increase the electricity usage on those lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5033.037s">But</a>  at this point, I think most people would agree that's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5037.579s">And</a>  we'll be decreasing the light, the electricity usage throughout the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5043.948s">So</a>  that is our tentative plan, and I've asked them to get me that information concretely as quickly as possible to move that forward faster than the main project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5055.494s">But</a>  I'm not sure what the timing on that would be and whether there's an appetite for coming forward with a request for just that chunk of money separate from the main lighting project.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5067.52s">Originally,</a>  it started off as a standalone project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5069.941s">Yes,</a>  it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5070.842s">And</a>  we were trying to make it an energy efficiency project that we could procure through energy, through the Green Communities Act at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5080.266s">And</a>  you can't do it in an energy efficient manner and fix the light levels there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5085.408s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5086.288s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5087.129s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5088.389s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5090.91s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5398.996s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5399.436s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Council President and councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5402.577s">My</a>  name is Brian Dugdale, again from Wilson and Storrs, on behalf of the owner of the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5407.978s">We're</a>  here in connection with a request for extended hours at the mall, which is located in the city's industrial zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5413.942s">We</a>  have a detailed application on the record that goes through in detail each of the criteria for a special permit and how this request meets that criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5423.386s">So</a>  what I'd like to do is just give a very quick introduction before Art from Wegmans comes back up to give his explanation about Wegmans, its request, and to answer any questions the council might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5435.053s">So</a>  this request, which is to extend by just one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, was submitted in connection with substantial rehabilitation of the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5445.0s">New</a>  England Development is extremely excited that this fall we'll be bringing forward not only Wegmans, but also Petco, Dick's Sporting Goods, to support the existing coals and marshals that are located at the Meadow Glen Mall today. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5462.886s">New</a>  England Development is very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5464.328s">The</a>  whole purpose of that redevelopment project was to bring forward tenants of the highest quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5469.415s">And</a>  Wegmans, if anybody's been to a Wegmans, you know that that supermarket is really top of the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5476.424s">So</a>  we came before the city council on August 15th, at which time we were instructed to engage in further discussions with our immediately abutting neighbors to the east at the Mystic River Park condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5489.109s">We</a>  immediately engaged with the condo and had what we believe turned out to be productive conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5497.031s">NED,</a>  together with Wegmans, as part of those discussions committed to do, we heard their concerns about overnight loading, in particular, at evening hours, so New England Development and Wegmans committed to no overnight loading, sealed loading docks, a landscape buffer, fencing, and other funds for the condo to put even more landscape buffering on their side of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5520.243s">In</a>  addition, there will be protocols for security and a designated representative at the shopping center to handle any concerns from any of the residents of the condo or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5530.792s">So</a>  we're confident that the community overall, as well as our neighbors, are going to be happy with the changes that have come to fruition here at the Meadowland Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5539.619s">And</a>  we're very excited to have Whiteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5540.96s">So</a>  with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Perez. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5544.182s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5549.521s">Thank</a>  you, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5550.442s">As</a>  Mr. Dugdale just presented, we're here for the application once again for extension of the hours of operation specifically, and a special use permit modification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5562.215s">And</a>  with that, currently it's allowed, as the council knows, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5565.9s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5567.261s">With</a>  consideration of the weather in the Northeast, of the states here obviously, as well as the traffic in the area, we're seeking an extension on either end by simply one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5579.829s">That</a>  being allowing 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5582.29s">till</a>  midnight hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5585.272s">Hours</a>  of operation meaning allowing the store to be open for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5590.455s">With</a>  that, understanding and speaking to the residents, more specifically the residents of Mystic Condos right behind us, as noted by the council on the 8th, 15th, the question I think was raised, have we reached out? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5605.383s">And</a>  in fact, we had reached out and had communications prior to that to a representative of the condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5610.705s">As</a>  of today, we've had conversations with representatives of the condo, recognizing their adjacent neighbors, being a good neighbor, and in the culture of a community partner, both on the business level, where we've reached out, even as of recent of August 15th, we've invited and had a special meeting with local leaders of the community, the school superintendent, United Way Food Bank, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5635.178s">Food</a>  Bank, et cetera, recognizing that we are part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5640.119s">We</a>  are in this fine community and are very respectful for that and are involved across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5650.722s">So</a>  as we are engaged with the community through the community leaders, we are also respective of our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5656.743s">Therefore,</a>  the reach out, once again, prior to the August 15th and up as of late yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5663.685s">And</a>  as Mr. Dugdale noted, we will self-restrict overnight deliveries, mimicking the hours of operations for the board to grant the application request. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5674.551s">With</a>  that, I'd be glad to address any questions from the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5679.034s">Councilwoman</a>  O'Connor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5680.155s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5681.275s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, if you or Brian could go over the no overnight loading deliveries, scale loading, landscaping, if you could just go into more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5693.262s">Because</a>  the only complaints or questions that I've received from the residents that live behind there are worries about overnight deliveries, the noise, obviously, how the property looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5708.436s">But</a>  other than that, I really haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5709.718s">I</a>  want to just make sure those are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5711.82s">If</a>  you could just give hours.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5714.162s">So</a>  it's very simplistic here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5717.985s">The</a>  application, and that's the beauty of it, we're currently 7 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5721.967s">Store</a>  operations allowing our customers to come into the store with consideration of many families have two of the adults working in the family, school activities, and just a desire to get into the store and do their shopping on the way to work or after work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5740.255s">It</a>  allows them that flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5742.356s">So</a>  here again, the key point is hours of operations of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5746.578s">Tied</a>  in with that, we will self-restrict out of consideration to the neighbors and not have tractor-trailer deliveries at the rear of the store from midnight till 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5756.06s">in</a>  the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5758.301s">As</a>  far as the property here again, New England Development has committed to, as evidenced by Mr. Dugdale's statements there, that they are committed to a number of additional landscaping treatments at the rear of the store, the property line, the fencing, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5774.664s">including</a>  access across the driveway to the condo development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5779.708s">As</a>  far as the site overall itself, I think that speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5783.171s">As</a>  Mr. Dugdale had made presentation, it's a very beautiful upgrade from what the development had been. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5791.537s">I</a>  hope that addresses your question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5794.299s">Vice</a>  President Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5796.535s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5797.916s">And</a>  by no way am I speaking on behalf of the residents of Mr. Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5804.799s">However,</a>  the phone calls that I received from residents mainly were regarding the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5814.483s">And</a>  there's roughly 132 units that directly face the rear of your establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5824.185s">And</a>  I would say within approximately 200 feet from the rear of where deliveries will take place, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5833.788s">And</a>  I think the concern that I've been hearing from residents is, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying no overnights, but when a truck rolls up at 11, 11.30, quarter or 12, to me, that's a late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5848.951s">Or</a>  when it rolls up at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5850.772s">in</a>  the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5853.415s">That's</a>  an early hour, and I can appreciate the fact that you have sealed loading docks, and you're taking steps to minimize the noise impact of the Mystic condo residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5867.879s">However,</a>  in my opinion, in order for this to be acceptable to Wegmans, who we welcome you to the community, I look forward to shopping in Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5877.842s">I</a>  currently have to go up to Burlington now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5880.033s">to</a>  shop at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5881.674s">And</a>  we welcome you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5883.095s">The</a>  residents that I've spoken with in the condos also are eager to shop in your facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5889.98s">But</a>  the concern is the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5892.701s">And</a>  I would ask that the deliveries be limited not to just your hours of operation, but to hours that are acceptable to, even though you're in a commercial zoned area, to residential abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5909.392s">And</a>  that would be my first point, if you're willing to make a concession on those particular hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5917.161s">And</a>  knowing that, you know, that's the heart of a business, deliveries, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5923.484s">So</a>  that would be my first. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5924.984s">The</a>  second point residents have noticed that I spoke with was having nothing to do with delivery trucks, but the exhaust unit on top of your building, which is the size of a small bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5939.673s">And</a>  recently that exhaust unit has been functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5943.118s">I</a>  don't know if they're testing it or what's going on, but it emits a rather loud and frequent noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5951.77s">And</a>  I was wondering if there's any consideration to put additional buffers <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5957.277s">I</a>  know with other business establishments, we just had something on Riverside Ave, Smashburger, and a few other establishments that had something similar, not to the size that you have for exhaust, and they were able to put noise buffers to mitigate some of the noise for area residents that were roughly in the same proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5977.001s">I</a>  was wondering if you could speak on that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5979.162s">So</a>  it would be limiting the delivery hours, not to just your hours of operation, but to extend it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5985.883s">and</a>  also the exhaust on top of the building.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5988.765s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5989.305s">Let</a>  me work backwards on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5990.526s">Certainly,</a>  as far as the rooftop units, we use state-of-the-art units. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=5995.008s">We</a>  offer to this council and certainly to the building department and any professionals they have on staff, we can certainly review with the town engineer or, again, through you, with you, the specific specifications of those units and if there's the possibility to look at possible mitigation measures on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6013.439s">As</a>  far as the deliveries, we are not speaking a large number of tractor trailers from 11 to midnight, or between 11 and midnight, and 6 AM in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6023.604s">We're</a>  talking one, two at the extreme, and the standard time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6028.707s">And</a>  that's once seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6032.789s">So</a>  we're talking one tractor trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6034.95s">the</a>  anomaly of two at that one hour at the extreme and one hour in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6039.392s">And</a>  here again, we're, we will be in compliance, we're committed to as we are in all communities being compliance with town codes, city codes or noise ordinances in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6050.336s">And</a>  we have the city council has that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6054.709s">if</a>  you will, that safeguard to come to us and saying you're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6060.054s">But</a>  quite frankly, before that happens, we'll be the first to hear in our store operations, our store managers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6066.1s">This</a>  is not the first store we're adjacent to a residential unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6070.904s">We</a>  have at least a dozen of them in our chains. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6073.386s">And</a>  we have worked through any issues, if there were issues to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6077.73s">And</a>  that's where we would offer, here again, self-restricted overnight deliveries, but keep up to midnight, with the understanding that it would be one, two, at the extreme as far as the anomaly, and that is in that particular hour, at the end and at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6095.002s">And</a>  here again, it comes to, if we <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6097.944s">It</a>  does come down to the basics of the weather and transportation and the overload of the highways. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6104.848s">These</a>  tractor trailers are coming from Rochester, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6107.269s">It's</a>  six plus hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6109.27s">So</a>  we have the, as folks that are familiar or in the business themselves, I'm not telling them anything new, the logistics on getting stuff from a warehouse into a truck <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6122.399s">300</a>  miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6128.122s">There's</a>  six hours away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6129.723s">It's</a>  very difficult, and it's a challenging month of flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6133.985s">That</a>  will allow us as a free board, and where we can, we will try to keep it to 11 and not 5 to 12 or 11.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6142.83s">Our</a>  intent is not to push it to the limits, but give a little latitude to remain a flexible, productive, successful business for the benefit, obviously, our business and then the community.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6157.687s">So</a>  from what I'm hearing from you, and I appreciate the flexibility, but not at the expense of the residents that live within 200 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6166.997s">And</a>  I appreciate the fact that these trucks are going to be coming from Rochester, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6171.442s">The</a>  fact that there's New England weather involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6174.465s">and</a>  so forth, and that makes me even feel more comfortable with my decision not to go right to midnight, because I think what we're going to end up seeing, and I've been doing this for a number of years, is that we're going to see the later deliveries, and we're going to see the 11, 30, 12 o'clock, a truck shows up at midnight, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6196.343s">or</a>  10 past midnight with $300,000 worth of filet mignon, I'm sure you're going to unload it.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6203.166s">I</a>  can commit to Mr. Councilman and to this council and to the community, we would self-restrict on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6209.449s">We</a>  start hearing those concerns, our tractor-trailer drivers, if that starts happening, we will be the first to reign that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6217.472s">And</a>  adjusted accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6218.753s">But</a>  that's where we're asking for that flexibility under the recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6222.474s">We</a>  are a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6223.895s">We</a>  are a community neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6226.716s">We</a>  ask for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6229.623s">And</a>  we will not be doing the 12 o'clock, 1145. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6231.584s">It</a>  will not be creeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6232.684s">If</a>  that happens, we'll be the first to cut back on it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6248.13s">And</a>  you realize this is a special permit, so even the fact that you understand code and noise ordinances, you're asking to work outside of the operating parameters of the current... No, actually, what I'm saying is an overlay on that.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6261.359s">I'm</a>  respectful of what we're saying is... <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6263.881s">that</a>  certainly understand that, yes, and I'm not trying to end around the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6268.626s">I'm</a>  recognizing that we understand the rules and regulations just as throughout the construction that we have to abide by, you know, building codes, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6278.195s">The</a>  same thing once we're up and operating, we understand and respect, quite frankly, and understand and we will comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6285.342s">if</a>  not self-restricted, if there's little missteps, we are the first to react to the positive in reaction to the community, more specifically the town and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6295.63s">You</a>  have our commitment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6297.892s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, and I know some residents are probably going to want to speak from the Mr. Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6305.638s">My</a>  support for any special permit tonight, and I just want the gentleman who I respect and <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6311.937s">thank</a>  the business for coming into our community, that my stance is going to remain the same, that the hours of operation for delivery should at the very least coincide with current ordinances and not the extended permit which you're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6329.064s">And</a>  if that is something that you can work with and compromise, then as a member of the council, you'll have my vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6336.847s">Otherwise,</a>  I think, at least from my standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6340.977s">I</a>  can't support it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6342.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6343.858s">Mr.</a>  Ferris, you have a store in Chestnut Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6346.859s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6347.96s">That</a>  has apartments that are closer than what are here in Midwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6352.762s">How</a>  have you dealt with that situation?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6356.803s">Here</a>  again, we're committed as we are in this community to that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6359.865s">And</a>  it's restricted from midnight to 6 AM.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6363.046s">And</a>  you've had no problems in Chestnut Hill?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6366.047s">That's</a>  my understanding, correct.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6370.525s">If</a>  I can, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6372.727s">I</a>  know in the past this council has looked at different concerns and issues like this and not holding Wegmans back, but could we do a 90-day <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6386.367s">trial</a>  period and move from there to see if that, in that 90 days, if those 200 abutters feel that we report back to those neighbors, and if it's something that it has been a distraction, that we re-evaluate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6408.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6410.004s">Councilor</a>  Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6410.964s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6413.705s">This</a>  is a situation that is very similar to the situation we faced at the last meeting, where we had a business that was seeking a special permit that directly abutted a residential property that was multi-family use. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6428.128s">Now,</a>  we have Wegmans, and Wegmans has been a great partner of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6430.948s">I'm</a>  not going to say they haven't been. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6432.228s">Wegmans</a>  has done a great job in redeveloping their parcel and giving it a new, fresh look from that old, tired, and drawn-out look that was the Meadowbrook Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6441.371s">But</a>  we also have an opportunity this evening to protect the quality of life of 132 residents whose homes face this building and face this street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6450.99s">I,</a>  for one, am a little concerned about an application for a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6456.092s">And</a>  Wegmans coming here and asking us to offer it when they really haven't been in operation for too long, as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6462.514s">And</a>  the residents, the 132 residents that units face this property, haven't really gotten the full picture of what it's going to be like when Wegmans is in operation, whether or not the hours of operation is 7 in the morning till 11 at night or 6 in the morning till midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6477.699s">One</a>  of the concerns that I might have is, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6480.105s">We</a>  say, OK, here's your special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6482.466s">You</a>  guys can go until 12 o'clock at night, and you can deliver until 12 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6486.247s">Something</a>  I'm not too crazy about at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6489.988s">And</a>  what happens is the residents come back and say Wegmans has been in operation now for 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6495.589s">And</a>  over the last 180 days, at 930 at night, 55 trucks pull up, and they make more noise than we could ever deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6501.891s">We</a>  have the opportunity, because this is a special permit, to put certain restrictions and certain parameters on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6508.03s">Some</a>  of those restrictions that we could put in would be that signs are posted visibly at the access points that say no loading after certain hours or during certain hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6515.714s">And</a>  those hours can be whatever this council sees fit, whatever this council deems appropriate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6520.676s">Whereas</a>  this is a special permit, and I believe it's <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6523.938s">Governor,</a>  under Chapter 48 of the General Law, Section 9, we have 90 days to act on the request once it's perfected and comes to our body. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6530.622s">And</a>  I think it might make sense for us to table this matter and wait 90 days and see what happens with Wegmans when they're in operation so that the residents have a better idea of what it is that they're dealing with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6540.047s">Ultimately,</a>  we're in a situation right now where we have a new, fresh business in the community, and they're a great partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6544.169s">They</a>  are a great partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6545.469s">But</a>  I think that the first job that we have in the City Council, number one, is to keep our streets safe, and number two is to protect the integrity and the quality of life of the taxpaying residents that reside here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6554.812s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us to recognize the fact that the condo market in the city of Medford is, through the roof, skyrocketing hot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6562.375s">The</a>  residents in these condominiums pay a ton of money in taxes, as does Wegmans, Mr. President, as does Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6567.517s">But</a>  I think that the residents have to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6569.958s">And</a>  I think that this is something that needs a longer and hotter look, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6573.099s">We</a>  need to determine what the impact is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6575.5s">And</a>  maybe we should look at that impact in the first 90 days of their operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6578.881s">Right</a>  now, we have a permit that's in front of us that's saying, you let us be open longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6583.183s">Why</a>  don't we say, well think about it, let's see what happens over the next 90 days, as opposed to putting contingencies and parameters on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6590.03s">Why</a>  don't we see what happens over the next 90 days, let these residents get a taste of what's going on over there, so when they come back to us with their concerns, they have a little bit more of an informed opinion and a little bit more of an understanding of what it's really like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6602.162s">so</a>  that they can tell us what it's really like, because none of us live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6604.783s">They</a>  live there every day, and they're the ones that are going to have to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6607.904s">So,</a>  well, you know, the partnership in the community is excellent, and we certainly appreciate the fundings that they've donated for the Clippership Connector and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6615.487s">It's</a>  the people that live in this community that make this community great, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6618.428s">We</a>  need to protect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6619.769s">So</a>  my recommended course of action would be tabling this matter for 90 days, as outlined by the general laws, which is well within our scope and authority, and seeing what happens over the next <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6630.413s">two</a>  or three months during the regular hours of operation of 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6633.758s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6634.939s">so</a>  that we can determine whether or not there are additional parameters that need to be put on the special permit outside of the 11 o'clock hour, never mind granting it until 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6642.991s">Maybe</a>  they come for a special permit and say we want our hours of operation to be X, Y, and Z. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6646.896s">But</a>  all the residents are very upset that the deliveries that happen at a certain time, during jeopardy, I don't know, for whatever reason, whatever problems that the residents have with deliveries happening, whether the volume is high, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6657.02s">We</a>  have an opportunity to protect these residents, Mr. President, and I think that the proper course of action this evening would be to table the matter.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6665.783s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6667.223s">I'd</a>  just be interested in hearing from the residents, if anybody would like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6672.334s">And</a>  they have made concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6673.855s">Wegmans</a>  has made concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6675.556s">There's</a>  been suggestions on the floor, but I think it's important to hear from those that live there.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6680.558s">If</a>  any residents would like to speak on this matter, please step forward.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6687.321s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6688.402s">Hi,</a>  Bill Barabino. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6689.582s">I</a>  live at 390 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6691.303s">And</a>  I can say, I joined the community <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6698.048s">commerce</a>  there in supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6700.509s">I</a>  think this is gonna be, Wegmans is a beautiful building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6703.851s">It's</a>  amazing on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6705.612s">I</a>  myself and my wife went to the Burlington store just to check it out because we got the Wegmans fever. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6712.855s">And</a>  I've met the owner, not the owner, but the store manager, Kevin, he was here a minute ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6721.599s">Very</a>  kind, very, very nice people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6724.438s">So</a>  however, I think Wegmans, as it stands right now, as it's set up, it's gonna be damaging and it's gonna be simply destructive to 39020 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6739.956s">In</a>  particular, I think what you find is the west facing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6743.66s">So,</a>  and the reason why is basically, and I have a packet in front of you, I don't know if you've gotten to it, but essentially what you have is a 390-20 Mystic Valley Parkway is a very large 11-story, 265 units, I know you're familiar with it, but it's large and it's brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6760.327s">And</a>  then you have Wegmans, and the whole Mystic Valley Parkway Mall, and what that is is also a very large brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6768.99s">building,</a>  or it's cement or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6773.013s">What</a>  you have, it develops as an echo chamber, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6776.796s">It's</a>  an echo chamber in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6778.418s">And</a>  in fact, they've even made another road, which has sort of taken out some vegetation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6784.923s">So</a>  it's probably even slightly even louder than it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6788.706s">But</a>  what you have is now an echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6791.008s">And</a>  the shipping lanes are in that echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6796.874s">So</a>  everything you hear about the trucks is spot on, spot on, everybody who has mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6802.779s">Yes,</a>  it's a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6804.481s">So</a>  the shipping lanes, the reason why this place is defective is because the shipping lanes go right through the back, right in between that echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6814.69s">For</a>  example, when something travels in between, it's loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6818.094s">For</a>  example, trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6819.316s">Trucks</a>  have to go through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6820.257s">They</a>  go through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6821.278s">Trucks</a>  are loud for all the reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6823.101s">The</a>  gate drops, the doors shut, and the engines, the brakes go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6830.97s">But</a>  the biggest thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6833.67s">The</a>  biggest thing is when the reverse lights go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6837.712s">So</a>  as you're probably well aware, and it's probably come up before, the reverse alarms, when a truck, any truck reverses, the alarms go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6846.675s">It's</a>  federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6847.355s">They</a>  have to have those alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6848.736s">They</a>  make a loud noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6853.085s">Those</a>  alarms that you hear, first of all, at night, it's dead quiet there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6858.446s">At</a>  night, you don't even hear the traffic unless you're out front. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6861.667s">But</a>  in that echo chamber, you hear those alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6865.308s">And</a>  those alarms, those reverse alarms, most pungent, those are at about between 97 and 112 decibels. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6874.96s">That's</a>  how loud they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6876.04s">That's</a>  basically the study show. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6879.361s">97</a>  between 112. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6880.161s">Now,</a>  to give you an example of decibels, a turboprop airplane taking off at 200 feet away is 118 decibels on takeoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6893.764s">So</a>  it's that explosive, that noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6896.764s">And</a>  I don't think that's taking into consideration the echo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6899.82s">Now,</a>  what happens when those alarms go off? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6903.902s">I</a>  wake up, and so when I wake up, I can't sleep, or I at least get up for a period of time, and then when I get up, if I can't sleep there, then the whole purpose of my home is no longer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6917.469s">And</a>  what I have is now, I own a piece of brick, and I own some sheet rock in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6922.552s">I</a>  don't own a home, because I can't live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6925.315s">Fortunately</a>  for me, and I think for some of the people here, is I know that the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6934.913s">can't</a>  protect my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6937.033s">And</a>  I know I can possibly have a partner here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6940.474s">And</a>  that is because in 2014, I came before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6944.435s">I</a>  just happened to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6945.975s">It</a>  was exactly the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6947.575s">It</a>  was a special permit in Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6950.456s">Kohl's,</a>  because it's a special permit, and you can put conditions on it, I simply came up and said, you know, there's a couple trucks and the reverse alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6959.597s">And</a>  because I think Kohl's at the time, they wanted just to operate 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6964.916s">And</a>  that's essentially what Wegmans is to us, because I think the most part, if it's during any time you're sleeping, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6971.098s">But</a>  what they want in 2014 is just to operate six days, 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6977.54s">And</a>  right here, right at the podium, I was so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6980.061s">I</a>  hadn't been in one of these before. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6982.581s">We</a>  solved it right there with the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6984.282s">And</a>  you guys, ladies and gentlemen, both came in and said, we sat there, went back and forth, and eventually you put a prohibition. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6991.484s">You</a>  said, listen, 11 to seven, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=6994.539s">you're</a>  not driving trucks, and you also put some, I think, some police presence and different things, which hadn't even come to my mind, but in the knowledge and wisdom of the board, you addressed it, you protected the community, you protected me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7010.85s">Now,</a>  fortunately, as Councilor Knight had mentioned, people don't know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7018.282s">There's</a>  been construction, the construction dude's been pretty good, and I've gone out and talked to them, and there's been some missteps, well at least I can tell you, I don't know if they're missteps, but I can tell you at least three events in the last two months that document in my affidavit, and also give you some supporting evidence, but I can tell you that, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7040.315s">We</a>  don't really know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7041.736s">The</a>  building's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7042.716s">It's</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7043.417s">We</a>  haven't seen a truck, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7045.157s">I</a>  mean, you've got some pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7047.919s">We're</a>  not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7048.619s">So</a>  I know you've saved certainly my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7055.523s">And</a>  I think it's going to be a lot in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7057.104s">I</a>  think it's going to be a lot different now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7061.946s">I'm</a>  asking for three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7063.867s">So</a>  I'm asking for three things, and I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7068.418s">we</a>  can coexist with Wegmans, and I think embrace them and have a great welcoming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7075.043s">And</a>  those three things are, which have somewhat been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7078.706s">One</a>  is that you limit the operation of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7083.429s">So</a>  that's really, I think, is going to be the operation of the back of Wegmans, the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7088.613s">So</a>  that's number one, the operation of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7092.916s">When</a>  those alarms go off, I think it's fair, we want, I think you need to get eight hours of sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7097.585s">If</a>  we know that they're gonna, you've acknowledged to me before that they can be bothersome, we're gonna restrict them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7103.356s">So</a>  we should give at least eight hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7106.672s">So</a>  I'm suggesting, I've talked to the attorney, the morning hours are more important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7112.535s">Personally,</a>  I get up at 6.30, I don't wanna speak for everyone else, but my sense is, start at seven, or even six, but let's just get to bed, because you gotta go to sleep to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7124.904s">And</a>  I know for me, I go to bed at 9.30, and as counsel has mentioned, I'm not sure exactly who, but when we were talking about it before, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7136.163s">I</a>  would be, when they start operating, I would be sitting, waiting, because I go to bed about nine, 30, 10, I would be sitting waiting for them to stop operations to go to sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7147.987s">That's</a>  what I would be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7149.408s">So</a>  to think one's rolling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7151.468s">Now,</a>  so I said one, the hours of operation, two, the other thing is they also have 24 hour, they also have 24 hour trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7161.972s">Now,</a>  that's an accelerated noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7164.513s">It's</a>  actually as you get the reverse lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7166.634s">24</a>  hours, it's minus 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7168.475s">I've</a>  talked to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7170.596s">The</a>  building department, they're allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7172.837s">That</a>  24, that is a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7174.958s">438,</a>  I've been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7176.399s">I</a>  talked to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7177.259s">Apparently,</a>  they're allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7179.42s">And</a>  it just scrapes the two, right, the metal right off. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7182.162s">I</a>  mean, there's nothing else to do but go over there because I'm awake. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7186.469s">I've</a>  talked to Kevin, and this is an important point, and I think he's mentioned it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7192.774s">The</a>  question is, we want to partner with weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7194.775s">We</a>  don't want to interfere with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7196.236s">I</a>  can tell, and I know, Mr. President, you were very supportive and you've been very communicative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7202.02s">You've</a>  answered as best as you can all my concerns, and everybody has, and I acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7208.145s">I</a>  have not been ignored by anybody, and I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7212.288s">But</a>  the last thing I have is oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7215.45s">Because</a>  whatever restriction you have, that restriction has to be like, that is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7221.778s">And</a>  you don't get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7222.739s">And</a>  I feel bad for some person driving from Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7226.849s">But</a>  we need to know that that's it, that's bedtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7230.713s">That's</a>  the rules, that's bedtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7232.315s">My</a>  suggestion, six, seven, whatever it is they start, but let us get to bed and you have to give us eight hours of sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7242.006s">Now,</a>  the only thing I mentioned and I'm gonna close is, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7245.572s">I've</a>  spoke to, in terms of controlling deliveries, I took time off of my schedule and I went to the alcohol meeting and now the question was, they wanted special permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7256.238s">Now</a>  you, I listened to the questions and it was very probing questions of all the councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7261.941s">They're</a>  gonna have end caps, they're gonna have, they're gonna sell alcohol at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7265.642s">They're</a>  gonna have I think something like 10,000 square feet.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7986.94s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7988.72s">Maybe</a>  we could get addressed the trash pickup.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=7997.417s">Good</a>  evening, Elaine Mastracola, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8001.963s">I</a>  live on the ninth floor overlooking Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8005.106s">I'm</a>  delighted that they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8007.449s">I</a>  was thinking of going for a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8009.792s">I</a>  don't know if they hire old ladies, but I'm delighted they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8015.51s">But</a>  I respectfully submit that I would request we keep the status quo with the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8023.035s">And</a>  if Whiteman really cares about community, they will adhere to the 7 to 11 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8028.239s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8038.817s">Firstly,</a>  I'd like to express our appreciation for all the accolades from the various individuals that just came up before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8046.624s">As</a>  far as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8048.346s">Councilwoman,</a>  I'd be glad to address a number of the questions that were raised beyond the trash collection, if you'd like, but starting specifically that we do not have overnight pickup of refugees at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8060.657s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8061.097s">And</a>  I'd be glad to go down and, from my best recall, address it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8065.901s">I'm</a>  sorry, maybe not a pickup, but do they have a compactor that works?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8071.205s">Our</a>  compactor is up against the building and enclosed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8074.667s">We</a>  feed it from the inside of the store.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8077.129s">So</a>  there is no noise.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8077.97s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8078.57s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8080.232s">And</a>  once again, Mr. President, if you'd like, I can go down the list the best I can recall of the number of comments and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8089.116s">So</a>  we just answered the refuge. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8090.458s">There</a>  is no overnight refuge or pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8094.203s">As</a>  far as the security, we do have, in fact, a very intensive security staff supplementing <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8104.957s">Police</a>  Department that are in this parcel on the site for Wegmans specifically from 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8111.241s">to</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8111.881s">So</a>  here again and one just one other factor where Wegmans is helping the community out in the area of security well beyond just being here as a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8125.45s">In</a>  addition to that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8130.122s">The</a>  backup alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8131.383s">I</a>  mean, there is technology out there that you have more of a swish thing rather than the high audible that was referred to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8137.931s">That's</a>  something that we can certainly look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8140.374s">And</a>  if it's available, which I believe the technology there, we can incorporate that into our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8147.749s">As</a>  far as condo values, our experience is whether we're there before or after, when people know there's a wetness, the property values typically are increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8158.594s">We've</a>  never had any indication in the 93 stores we have that there's been a decrease in the values of real estate, more specifically residential, against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8168.218s">In</a>  fact, we've had places that we've been building, the condos came up after the fact, and they jumped in price, realizing that road use is coming into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8177.898s">As</a>  far as the use, obviously, we're a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8182.041s">We</a>  understand that in an industrialized zone, a more intensive use than is technically permitted on this parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8188.084s">We</a>  ask that that be a very key consideration in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8195.189s">We</a>  need to remain competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8203.354s">As</a>  you've probably read in the papers, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8206.135s">The</a>  grocery business is becoming more and more competitive for a number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8211.257s">And</a>  this here is another factor that allows us to remain competitive and remain more flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8216.68s">We've</a>  heard all the comments, and we respect very sincerely and deeply the comments made by councilmen and women, as well as the residents about the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8225.883s">And</a>  that's here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8226.744s">I</a>  cannot overemphasize our commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8229.645s">to</a>  be in compliance with code, noise ordinance or otherwise, should there be an issue, we respect and expect and will deal responsibly to the town officials, whether it be here again the council or building inspector, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8247.335s">And</a>  we will have ongoing dialogue with the neighbors and take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8253.245s">The</a>  overall conclusion, though, in all of this, hearing the potential scenarios that were offered by both council as well as citizens, we ask that, at minimal, focusing on the central application, that we have the store open and operating from 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8272.0s">till</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8272.661s">We</a>  ask that be the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8274.762s">Should</a>  there be a desire to have some kind of restriction beyond our self-restriction of no overnight deliveries, then we bring the deliveries from 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8284.17s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8287.351s">So</a>  this is a consideration for the board out of appreciation to all the comments and not to extend the meeting to the wee hours of the morning for the sake of obviously the council and the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8300.537s">But</a>  here again, one indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8302.277s">But</a>  to remain successful in a competitive market, we need to remain flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8306.499s">We</a>  have to have the hours of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8308.3s">It's</a>  very critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8309.56s">And</a>  there's no guarantee that just because we're Wegmans that we're successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8314.082s">Rochester</a>  knows very well the implications of not remaining competitive, not staying ahead of the eight ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8320.366s">Kodak</a>  has come and gone for all practical purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8323.428s">Bausch</a>  & Lomb is fighting for its life. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8326.09s">Xerox</a>  has been split up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8328.211s">Here's</a>  the point, you always have to be in front of the game, ever flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8334.153s">With</a>  respect for the community, so you can give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8338.295s">There</a>  is no guarantee that we could be here if we're not successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8342.497s">So</a>  it's a benefit to them all, to the community, and certainly to our business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8346.698s">I'll</a>  be glad to address any of the questions that I haven't been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8354.049s">As</a>  far as, here again, one other point that store manager Kevin Russell pointed out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8359.272s">If</a>  a trucker comes there and he's outside the hours or close to the hours, then he should not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8364.695s">Because</a>  we're going to dictate, if we do have the 11 to 12, you cannot come at 10 minutes of 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8370.879s">You</a>  cannot be there a quarter of, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8373.6s">You</a>  have to leave the site now, go back to the throwaway, and station it there, wherever that way station is, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8380.3s">Number</a>  two, when our trucks come here, our cabs are turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8385.663s">So</a>  that engine is not running. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8387.303s">I</a>  know there's some people who have thought and we've heard expressed concerns about the cab running. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8391.766s">That</a>  engine is turned off as it comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8394.587s">The</a>  refrigeration units, when they're there, yes, they're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8397.308s">But</a>  they are no different than the refrigeration units that are on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8400.91s">So</a>  in essence, it's the same mechanical operation that's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8405.112s">And</a>  I go back to the initial concern that was expressed by Mr. Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8409.214s">about</a>  the units on the HVAC units. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8411.957s">I'm</a>  not sure which particular unit that the individual is concerned about or which one the noise emanating has come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8419.383s">We</a>  will certainly work with the city, look at it, look at the specs, and if there's a mitigation measure, we would incorporate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8425.228s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8427.31s">Councilor</a>  Falwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8428.451s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8429.191s">I'm</a>  just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8430.533s">As</a>  far as when the trucks come to make deliveries, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8433.703s">Will</a>  they be coming all in one direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8436.226s">Will</a>  they be coming from Locust Street or the parkway? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8438.969s">Which</a>  way would they be approaching the back of the building?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8442.233s">Quite</a>  frankly, I don't know if we have that specific on that, but Kevin might have more detail.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8447.699s">Hi</a>  folks, Kevin Russell, store manager at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8451.343s">What</a>  I envision, and I'm not a professional truck driver, but looking at the property, I would say the one that makes the most sense would come off Locust and go around the side of Marshalls and come across the back in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8463.157s">I'm</a>  not sure if they're on the Mystic Valley Parkway, if they could really turn a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8466.782s">It's</a>  pretty sharp. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8468.183s">And</a>  again, these folks are professionals and they might be able to get it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8472.287s">I</a>  couldn't do it, but I think it'll come around the backside. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8475.19s">And</a>  if we say that's the way you have to come, that's the way you come. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8477.272s">When</a>  I was the store manager in Burlington, and I don't know if anybody's been up there and seen the third item project, but we said, let's not have trucks come in on first, second, or third. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8484.959s">We'll</a>  come in on fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8486.64s">And</a>  that way, they're able to navigate and negotiate much easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8489.623s">And</a>  it's easier on the pavement, too, in an area like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8494.938s">That's</a>  what we do there.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8496.519s">I'm</a>  just thinking if you come around that side of the building, it probably might get a little bit quieter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8501.362s">But,</a>  um, so thank you for answering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8504.403s">With</a>  regard to the compactor, um, I believe the compactor has some sort of, uh, I think when you hit the button, it starts to compact. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8513.128s">And</a>  is that pretty loud? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8514.389s">Or</a>  I used to work in a store when I was back in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8517.451s">I</a>  knew that seemed to be pretty loud, but I don't know.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8520.777s">I</a>  personally don't believe that it's loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8522.679s">I've</a>  worked with wagons 31 years and used the compactor, I don't even know how many, probably hundreds of thousands of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8529.584s">It's</a>  louder on the inside because you're actually there with the mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8533.167s">When</a>  you hit that button, there's a big ram that pushes out and compacts the garbage. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8538.571s">On</a>  the outside, it's much different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8540.918s">And</a>  last question.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8542.419s">We</a>  could certainly restrict the hours on that operationally wise.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8549.083s">Yeah,</a>  typically overnight, we'll have grocery stocking that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8553.306s">And</a>  they're really generating cardboard, not waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8555.888s">So</a>  that goes inside a bale or inside the building that you wouldn't even know existed from the outside.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8560.37s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8560.51s">And</a>  as far as, actually, you already answered the question.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8571.999s">Can</a>  you address the gentleman's comment, Mr. Cipriani's comment about the truck coming in at 3.05 this morning?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8581.145s">I'm</a>  not aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8581.846s">That's</a>  the first I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8583.307s">That's</a>  definitely a road tractor trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8587.649s">I'd</a>  be surprised if we don't have a receiver that early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8593.252s">We're</a>  not up in operation now, so I can't speak to who that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8596.413s">I</a>  know we did receive a number of complaints in talking to our construction folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8600.455s">We</a>  had received it from a number of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8602.976s">But</a>  my understanding is those were construction vehicles as part of the overall site construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8608.958s">But</a>  I can assure you again that there are roads in this particular case, especially coming down to the line with Peck opening up and decks and, you know, we're coming down to the wire. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8618.704s">But</a>  that's an anomaly that something that, here again, if we hear something like that, it'll be shut down very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8625.568s">It'll</a>  be addressed immediately.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8627.992s">I</a>  also wanted to mention that so the property really isn't turned over to us yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8632.013s">Yes,</a>  it will be us as of November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8634.594s">We'll</a>  run that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8636.175s">As</a>  you know, New England Development was the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8638.836s">EMJ</a>  actually runs that construction site. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8641.617s">May</a>  have been something that they ordered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8643.458s">But</a>  as Art said, we don't have a receiver on that property until 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8648.648s">They</a>  may have had 28 cash registers come in from North Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8652.511s">They</a>  got here early, thought it was OK to park behind the store, pulled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8655.973s">I</a>  don't know if that unit continued to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8657.815s">I</a>  know nothing about that delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8659.736s">But</a>  I can guarantee you that if we say we won't have folks after 11 or before 6, it won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8667.021s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8670.884s">Further</a>  comments from the audience? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8673.986s">Yes,</a>  you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8676.656s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8677.657s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8681.319s">Patiently,</a>  I've been listening, and I'd like to offer a few words, knowing that you can never satisfy all the people all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8691.106s">However,</a>  I believe that is still an industrial zone, not residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8696.89s">And</a>  also, the old saying goes, competition usually makes better business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8702.542s">So</a>  the more competition, it would definitely be better for the consumer, I presume, lowering the prices, maybe stopping shop or lower the usury prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8713.366s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it might be a great idea to, instead of the 490 unit proposed development across the street, which is tied up in two or three lawsuits, that market basket goes in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8730.835s">And</a>  then we could really lower some prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8733.596s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8735.437s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8744.141s">Come</a>  on down, Frank.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8746.001s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8748.623s">My</a>  name is Frank Bankey. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8750.063s">I</a>  am a trustee, and I happen to be chairman of the board of trustees at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the abutting property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8760.787s">I</a>  do not profess to speak for everybody in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8765.642s">Nobody</a>  can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8766.645s">Nobody</a>  has that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8768.685s">I'm</a>  here to speak for myself, but I'll say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8771.506s">I</a>  don't think anybody can dispute the fact that I get around the building probably more than anyone else because I happen to be retired and I know a lot of people, and I do speak with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8781.249s">I</a>  can honestly say I have never had anybody say to me that they were against waiters. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8787.351s">Welcome</a>  them with open arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8788.752s">We're</a>  excited to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8790.512s">But</a>  there are some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8792.893s">And</a>  some of those concerns would affect me because I am on the side that abuts the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8800.58s">Now</a>  today, the Honorable President of the Board made reference that one of the members of the Board of Trustees met with people from Wegmans, and that happened to be me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8813.619s">We</a>  did have, I thought, a very productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8818.487s">Many</a>  of the things, like we've heard about the great contributions that Wegmans has made to the community at large, but I'll tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8825.969s">They</a>  were more than happy to support a resolution that the president of this city council is going to propose at the next meeting that I'm asking for his support. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8837.399s">And</a>  that is, I think the people who live in our building can appreciate the poor condition of the sidewalk in front of our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8846.528s">It's</a>  particularly that section that leads from our driveway over to Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8852.44s">There's</a>  a lack of adequate lighting, and the trees are overhanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8857.743s">Now,</a>  I today contacted the office of Senator Pat Jalen, who I've known for a long time, and I said that I would like to get some support from the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8867.649s">And</a>  your president here, the boy, jumped right on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8870.071s">He</a>  said, be glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8871.191s">I'll</a>  sponsor it for you at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8873.333s">And</a>  the people from Wegmans, when I spoke with them, glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8878.419s">That's</a>  what we want to be, is we want to be good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8880.982s">We</a>  want it to be a two-way street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8882.623s">We</a>  want to be able to go over and speak with the people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8886.367s">A</a>  couple of other issues that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8890.592s">You</a>  people are going to have, when I say you people, I mean Wegmans, is going to have 24-hour security. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8896.571s">Now</a>  that bolsters our security. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8899.835s">First</a>  day I took office as the chairman, I ordered the security guards at nighttime to make rounds of the building so that we have increased visibility with the security people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8911.687s">And</a>  now if we have the, I understand that the people from <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8916.878s">Brinkman's</a>  are going to be outside as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8919.099s">So</a>  that gives us another degree of security, I think, at least on that side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8924.301s">There</a>  have been some pretty good issues here raised tonight about the picking up of trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8927.842s">And</a>  it is loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8928.742s">It</a>  is loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8930.603s">And</a>  I'm talking about the compressor that we have on our own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8934.224s">Certainly</a>  something can be done to probably abate that, whether there's some kind of muffler systems or whether <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8942.019s">We</a>  could have scheduled pickups during normal business hours, not through the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8945.983s">I</a>  understand that these types of things, according to the law, they're able to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8950.947s">I</a>  know in Somerville that they have problems with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8953.289s">They</a>  can come in commercial people and empty dumpsters at all times of the day and night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8960.516s">I</a>  came here tonight with the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8963.514s">you</a>  know, expectation that you people were going to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8967.476s">I</a>  have no problem with going with the normal scheduled hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8971.277s">I</a>  heard Councilor Knight come up with what I thought was a pretty good proposal and that was to put it on, I don't know if the correct term was to put it on the table or hold it in abeyance for a period of time so that if there are particular complaints, certainly people in my building are not bashful about expressing their complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8990.392s">uh...</a>  they would contact either hopefully they would let us know on the board but they would also contact Wegmans as well but I'm one person who is extremely excited and grateful to have this new business coming into our neighborhood they've done a heck of a job on the front of that building and when you think of what's left there are no disparaging calls but the way the brick and mortar stores are going I don't know how much longer Kohl's is going to last <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9017.097s">And</a>  if that falls under, and we didn't do anything about bringing Wegmans in, we'd have a dust bowl over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9022.799s">We'd</a>  probably have cops down there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9025.28s">Speaking</a>  of which, and I worked for the Somerville police for 28 years, if ever there was a violation of any kind that somebody suspects, they should call the police and the police will come down and stop the delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9040.926s">And</a>  also, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9042.467s">When</a>  the police department responds to a call, they are required to keep a record of that call, so that if we came back in 30 days or 90 days, it's very simple to go down to the police station, any one of us, and ask for a copy of the calls that were received by the police for the response they had to May 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9065.112s">So</a>  I don't want to be here and frustrate Wegmans from coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9069.876s">I</a>  think everybody here really is for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9072.338s">And</a>  I think with your cooperation, your guidance, I'm sure we can have a great relationship with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9078.584s">I</a>  know that I've spoken with them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9080.125s">They're</a>  going to do some <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9082.787s">shrubbery</a>  work for us, and they're going to help us out with some property concerns that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9088.674s">Again,</a>  I'm excited about getting this front sidewalk fixed and the trees trimmed and adequate lighting, and it's going to be safe for people to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9098.505s">And</a>  in closing, I do want to thank you very much, Mr. President, and all the honorable members of the board for allowing us to come here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9107.512s">A</a>  little tough there during the beginning there, you know, with the long hearings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9112.917s">But</a>  this was productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9114.518s">It</a>  was worth the wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9115.219s">But</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9117.28s">Being</a>  a former select one, I think, you know, I was in this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9120.643s">I</a>  know how boring that is.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9129.415s">Mr.</a>  President and council members of I white. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9131.879s">So</a>  we've heard a lot tonight from obviously the council and the neighbors here again back to the original application asking for hours of operations 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9142.375s">to</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9142.996s">We</a>  asked that that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9144.836s">We</a>  voted on with consideration that we will not only self-restrict overnight, but if the board chooses to restrict deliveries between 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9155.619s">and</a>  6 p.m., that we feel <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9162.656s">We</a>  feel that that is a situation where it's very clear in its cast and stone where we heard the resonance, we respected the resonance primarily at the end of the night, end of the day, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9176.933s">Albeit,</a>  it restricts us in the, quite frankly, I'll tell you the challenges now, again, and not to belabor it, with the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9182.415s">Ideally,</a>  we'd get both together, hours of operations, 6 to midnight, and deliveries, because the weather, and it's not something that I fabricate this, but we feel it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9193.46s">possibly</a>  with the weather and traffic, and then we don't want the frustration with the neighbors, the council, and certainly us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9199.482s">But</a>  with that said, we'd appreciate an offer if they would, 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9203.963s">to</a>  midnight for hours of operation, and then concurrent with that, a restrict of deliveries of tractor trailers in the back from 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9211.064s">till</a>  6 a.m.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9214.025s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9215.245s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9216.946s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9218.166s">Sir,</a>  can you please explain to me a little bit more about what Mr. Bakey was discussing, some of these contingencies and some of these commitments that you've made to the Condo Association over there, so we have a better understanding?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9228.57s">Yeah,</a>  I'll have to defer to Mr. Dugney. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9230.531s">I</a>  believe he's referring to site improvements, that New England development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9233.672s">That's,</a>  once again, it's a tenant, so that was New England development.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9243.855s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9245.056s">Again,</a>  Brian Dugdale from Goulston Stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9248.84s">After</a>  the development, there were commitments that have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9252.664s">I</a>  think we went through a lot of them previously in terms of there'll be sealed loading docks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9257.909s">In</a>  terms of the landscape offer, there will be additional planting that's done between <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9262.965s">the</a>  mall property and the condo property, as well as a fence that's going to gate off. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9268.527s">There's</a>  a, I don't want to get too lost in the weeds, but there's a driveway that leads right in between the two properties, and there's an entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9275.11s">That's</a>  going to be gated off to ensure that there'll be no truck access from the condo side. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9280.332s">Everything</a>  will be coming through the mall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9283.433s">We've</a>  agreed to give additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9284.854s">The</a>  amount's still to be determined, but that funding's going to be used to plant an additional layer of shrubs, buffer-type landscaping improvements on the condo side of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9295.12s">In</a>  terms of security, I'm not sure that exactly it's going to be 24-hour security, but there is going to be security both through Wegmans and the mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9302.124s">There's</a>  going to be two layers of security, and there will be monitoring, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9306.166s">And</a>  Wegmans, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but 24-7 with cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9310.208s">And</a>  again, the other commitment the two other things that were discussed there will be a designated representative so it's gonna be very easy to get in touch with both the ownership of the mall as well as Wegmans for to address any of these issues and then the other thing that we were talking about earlier is just the condition of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9327.434s">Mr.</a>  Bakey was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9328.714s">It's</a>  along Mystic Valley Parkway, which unfortunately is owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9334.636s">So</a>  we don't have the ability to actually do those improvements, but we would be more than happy to support any sort of a resolution of this council or any actions taken by Mr. Bakey himself to try to get some sort of funding and attention on that matter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9351.369s">The</a>  reason I ask, Mr. Dungill, is because I think that based upon what we're hearing from the residents, that they want to be a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9358.735s">They</a>  want to be a partner with Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9360.817s">And</a>  I think they realize that Wegmans is going to be there for a long time, provided that they have tools to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9369.403s">concessions</a>  that have been made, I think, are very important to gaining the support of the residents of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway and their efforts to be in favor of extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9379.826s">And</a>  I was hoping maybe that we could get these criteria outlined so that we could include them as conditions in the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9387.067s">Because</a>  the way that I'm looking at it, I think, is that people don't seem to have too much concern over the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9392.529s">They're</a>  not too worried about the hours of operation being six o'clock in the morning till midnight in the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9397.01s">The</a>  concerns are really on the loading in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9399.311s">And,</a>  you know, the request that's before us this evening is to allow a 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house and allow a 6 to 11 o'clock at night operation in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9408.984s">I,</a>  for one, am a little bit more comfortable with the status quo operation in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9414.71s">and</a>  with the 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9417.671s">But</a>  I think it would be very important that we get these criteria included. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9420.412s">I'd</a>  make the motion, Mr. President, to support the special permit, provided that there are restrictions that are placed upon it, one of them being that these special conditions and concessions that have been made by the developer and the condominium association are included as an addendum to the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9440.24s">that</a>  the hours are restricted for deliveries from status quo 7 to 11 in the back, and that we allow the permit to go forward for 6 to 12 in the front for the operations of the house, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9450.345s">I</a>  also have a concern about the permit being issued in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9455.287s">And</a>  I think that there should be a review placed on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9457.468s">And</a>  I also think that the permit should go with the petitioner and not the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9462.15s">So</a>  those are some of the concerns that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9463.791s">And</a>  I think that with these parameters, I'd be comfortable voting for this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9470.609s">I</a>  think they're more concerned, it's probably the beginning hours more than the back hours for deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9479.532s">Because</a>  most of their break and things like that are all coming in the morning versus in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9485.393s">So</a>  I think they're concerned it's more of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9489.034s">The</a>  front of the hour versus the back of the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9493.576s">I</a>  don't know if they want to address that.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9496.357s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't want to speak for awakens, but just to be clear, we're happy to accommodate any of those conditions as part of the conditional special permit, with that exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9504.8s">I</a>  think, again, I don't want to speak for awakens, but I think I heard that 6 to 11 is what their request is now in terms of the length. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9511.103s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9515.523s">If</a>  I could, just a point of clarification on Councilor Knights, if I may, Mr. President, Chair, to Councilor Knights' summation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9526.289s">Now,</a>  I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Weidman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with 6 to 11 in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9541.657s">And</a>  your suggestion was that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9545.232s">remains</a>  status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9545.873s">That</a>  we have a review? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9547.274s">That</a>  your suggestion is status quo? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9549.737s">That</a>  we have a review? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9552.3s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9552.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9553.641s">At</a>  what point? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9554.402s">30</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9555.203s">30</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9555.844s">30</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9557.245s">And</a>  that we have, that it's tied only to weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9563.752s">Only</a>  to weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9564.213s">And</a>  not to the property.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9565.093s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9567.445s">Do</a>  I have those three points? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9568.786s">Those</a>  three points are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9569.826s">Hours</a>  6 to 12 in the front of the house, 7 to 11 in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9572.687s">The</a>  permit goes with the petitioner and not with the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9575.209s">And</a>  then the criteria that have been outlined and agreed upon between the two parties would be attached as an addendum to the special permit so that we know what's expected.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9582.032s">And</a>  with a 30-day review, we can look at this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9584.213s">30-day</a>  review, provided there's no problems with the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9586.594s">Maybe</a>  we can look at extending the hours of deliveries and the hours of operation in the back of the house, provided that there's no problems from the deliveries during the status quo hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9596.558s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9597.739s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9598.359s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9599.981s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9600.301s">I</a>  just also like it noted on the as a condition to make sure there's no trash pickup in the back during the evening hours, the night hours from at least 11 to 6 in the morning.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9613.551s">You</a>  would want to address that the developer because there are three of the four other companies <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9619.187s">uh,</a>  besides waiting, there's a pickup trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9621.248s">Um,</a>  wagons are saying that they will not have any trash pick up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9625.669s">That</a>  doesn't address the dicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9627.889s">Marshall's</a>  calls.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9628.869s">You're</a>  not before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9629.89s">Wait,</a>  wait, wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9631.29s">They</a>  said they will not trash pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9633.271s">And</a>  if we can make that a condition to make sure that stays that way,</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9640.477s">And,</a>  Mr. President, if I might, back to the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9642.839s">hours</a>  of operation to midnight hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9645.46s">We</a>  still, once again, request that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9647.922s">And</a>  then back to the deliveries, to the point of being freshness here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9651.644s">We're</a>  trying to get product, fresh product there, out there before our customers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9657.087s">And</a>  that extra hour goes a long way to allow us to get it private. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9661.33s">And</a>  I think it was made mention that my ears heard, because I think some counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9665.452s">folks</a>  that the residents seem to support the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9669.314s">They</a>  definitely did not like the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9672.055s">We</a>  heard that very loud and clear, not speaking for each and every one of the residents, but I thought that's what I heard, and it's on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9679.578s">So</a>  we ask that that be modified for consideration of a 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9684.42s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9685.58s">for</a>  the deliveries.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9688.842s">Through</a>  the chair, would you be willing to go to 10 p.m.? ?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9693.159s">That's</a>  taking a step backwards and really being problematic for operations to put them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9697.982s">We</a>  already have had, at least even last week, I've had conversations with our distribution transportation groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9704.745s">They</a>  are reconsidering all of Massachusetts and all the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9707.946s">That's</a>  how strapped we are with the tight program of 7-Eleven. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9714.649s">That</a>  would be more than problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9717.978s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9719.659s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, I think the compromise that the gentleman is stating from 6 to 11 is a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9730.187s">As</a>  Councilor Knight mentioned about putting a 30-day review <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9735.29s">And</a>  I'd like to see maybe a 30-, 60-, or 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9737.251s">I'd</a>  like to see them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9739.691s">And</a>  then we could take a look at it to talk to the residents of Mr. Condos to see how it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9747.193s">And</a>  the condition is only based on the reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9752.354s">So</a>  if within 30 days, sir, if we get a number of complaints about the trucking and so forth, we can withdraw the extensive</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9765.712s">I'm</a>  not overstating my welcome, but any operation up and running, it takes time to get some of the bugs out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9774.639s">We</a>  have truckers coming into the site that haven't been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9780.163s">We'd</a>  ask further out than 30 days, whether it be 60 or 90, but just from a more practical up and running sort of thing, versus out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9789.35s">Hydronaline</a>  is obviously a here, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9792.592s">We're</a>  going at a mile a minute sort of thing, with consideration of that factor, that we're going from zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9798.573s">And</a>  I trust you'll find from our other experiences with stores, it'll be very successful, thanks to the community, and hopefully, obviously, our customers, including the condo residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9809.956s">It</a>  will be going 100 miles an hour, all aspects of the operations, internal and external. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9816.097s">So</a>  we ask that, whether it be 60 or 90, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9819.918s">30-day,</a>  we certainly respect the ultimate goal, but that's, from a very practical point of view, a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9826.761s">But</a>  at the same time, we're not surrendering at all the recognition that we have to be in compliance.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9832.804s">Cops</a>  on night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9834.685s">This</a>  brings me back to my initial point, Mr. President, when I first spoke on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9838.547s">We</a>  don't know what to expect down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9840.328s">So</a>  now we want to go from 7 to 11 to 6 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9844.75s">He</a>  just says, we're going to be going 100 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9846.971s">The</a>  first 30 days, it's probably going to be bumpy.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9849.37s">No,</a>  I didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9850.711s">I</a>  said it's always a challenge and be very realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9855.174s">I</a>  don't think in any kind of event, any kind of exercise, that giving due process consideration of practical time is somebody's up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9865.681s">It's</a>  just a recognition of reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9868.583s">We</a>  are very successful in what we do, but I didn't want to have the town get a false read why anomalies without liars. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9877.588s">That's</a>  my point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9878.729s">And</a>  I think as you give a little beyond 30 to 60, we're not trying to duck away from any responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9884.933s">We're</a>  trying to fine tune our machine from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9888.055s">And</a>  we're not rated number one in the industry because we're <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9892.253s">slack</a>  at what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9893.353s">We</a>  are very good across the board, but I think from the practical point of implementation, that's all I'm asking for a little free board there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9901.976s">We</a>  respect everything else that goes with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9904.216s">And</a>  if it's 30 days, it's 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9905.937s">Certainly,</a>  in the end, we respect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9908.378s">But</a>  that's all I'm asking for that point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9910.458s">So</a>  if I might, from our point of view, if you could, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9913.439s">Again,</a>  summarizing, I think, what I've said, to make sure I'm clear, is that 6 to midnight for operations, in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9919.564s">I</a>  like how you put that, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9921.685s">The</a>  back is 6 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9923.867s">And</a>  then we ask, if not, if it's 60 or 90 would be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9928.951s">But</a>  certainly, if 30 is 30, that's what it is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9931.173s">Well,</a>  why don't we do both, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9932.634s">Because</a>  the residents are going to have to live there for the 30 days, and they're going to have to put up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9936.416s">So</a>  why don't we bring them in at 30 and at 90? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9938.518s">So</a>  we can see if the kinks have worked out, if any issues are raised within 30 days that may be attributable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9944.72s">A</a>  30-day review and a 90-day review.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9946.841s">60</a>  and six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9947.841s">We</a>  could do that too, but I mean... Let's do three reviews.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9950.942s">I'm</a>  all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9953.343s">All</a>  for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9954.763s">Do</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9955.103s">I</a>  just want the flexibility to be able to address the residents' concerns and not have to wait 60 or 90 days to get the main evidence.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9963.258s">Once</a>  again, our preference is other, but certainly we respect the ultimate vote on the board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9968.981s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that we have this correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9970.782s">The</a>  front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9972.754s">will</a>  be able to operate from 6 to midnight, 6 to 12, correct?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9976.057s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9976.858s">And</a>  the rear of the house for the deliveries will be 6 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9983.203s">The</a>  review for the back of the house will be in the 30 days, another review in 60 days, and a third review in 90 days.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9990.39s">And</a>  again, that's the review of the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9992.291s">The</a>  back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9993.052s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9993.713s">Thanks</a>  for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9995.074s">Back</a>  of the house.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9995.554s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could point out, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=9998.837s">a</a>  special permit solely to the company of weapons, not to the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10004.239s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10005.159s">And,</a>  like I said... And the trash, President Langelkorn, without any trash... Maybe the term we should use is no loading or unloading.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10014.961s">Yeah,</a>  there'll be no trash pickup during those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10017.302s">This</a>  is 30 days from when they start the... This will be 30 days from when the store opens, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10023.744s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10024.524s">Mr.</a>  President, also a review of any potential mitigation regarding the exhaust, which the gentleman already said that they would review the exhaust on top of the building.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10035.592s">And</a>  as far as guidelines tonight, I mean, we can start with specifications, show that it's a state-of-the-art, and we can provide that to the council through engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10044.959s">What's</a>  your preference on that?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10047.501s">I'm</a>  in particular mitigation regarding noise mitigation.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10052.464s">That's</a>  what I'm saying.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10053.265s">I'm</a>  sure the unit is state of the art. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10055.146s">I'm</a>  sure it's up to code.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10057.647s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10057.947s">And</a>  so the point is, what is triggering the mitigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10061.009s">Because</a>  what's the threshold? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10062.53s">I</a>  guess that's what I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10063.511s">So</a>  we'll comply with ordinance of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10067.013s">And</a>  I don't know if it's how specific it is, quite frankly, because we haven't been asked to review that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10071.555s">But</a>  we'll take a look at that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10073.116s">I</a>  would say the mitigation is regarding any additional steps <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10076.934s">And</a>  our building department would be aware of this, like we did on Riverside Ave, which is right around the corner from your current establishment, when we had a few food establishments go in that had a similar, actually much smaller, exhaust, and they were able to put some type of barrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10094.275s">around</a>  the particular system, the system was state-of-the-art, it was very efficient, but this barrier helped with alleviating some of the noise potential.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10104.859s">So</a>  I would ask that that be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10106.88s">We</a>  certainly will review it, yes, and we'll present that to the Council through them, however you prefer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10111.862s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10113.263s">Move</a>  approval on the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10121.202s">The</a>  motion will be the front of the House 6 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10126.504s">Back</a>  of the House 6 to 11 with a review of the 6090 days to be no rubbish pick up and there will be a review of also of the ventilation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10135.726s">This</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10137.567s">I</a>  have everything in the system.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10140.648s">And</a>  the president is restricted to wagons only. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10143.168s">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10147.329s">Everything.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=10150.063s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11516.191s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11516.971s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11518.292s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11519.112s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for co-sponsoring this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11523.954s">As</a>  the Council mentioned, there's been a lot of activity over the last several months there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11529.217s">and</a>  residents in the area are concerned what's going on, and naturally with the track record we have as a community on upkeeping our facilities, they're concerned that this building not fall into disarray. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11544.349s">So,</a>  that is why we offer this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11547.79s">We</a>  have a number of needs in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11550.732s">Councilor</a>  Scott Peli will tell you, with the new addition of a recreation department, this may be a great location for Method Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11559.575s">We</a>  currently don't have a home for Method Arts or Method Art Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11563.797s">That</a>  would be a great location, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11566.679s">in</a>  that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11568.5s">And</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that it was only roughly about a year, year and a half ago when the city administration sent a paper to this council requesting that we sell off the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11582.772s">And</a>  it was this council that stood up and said, Wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11586.074s">First</a>  of all, we leased this building out for $1. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11589.823s">And</a>  the stipulation was if it was no longer gonna be used for the intended purpose, which was to assist people with disability, that it would revert back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11601.151s">So</a>  it was this council that halted the process, and thanks to City Solicitor Mark Rumley, we were able to get control back of the building, which in my opinion was a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11613.599s">Now</a>  we have to figure out what we're gonna do with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11616.08s">So</a>  I support this resolution wholeheartedly, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11618.862s">and</a>  hope we can get an answer on this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11708.117s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11712.361s">Ultimately,</a>  we spend lots and lots of money in this community on plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11716.064s">And</a>  we get plans and reports back, but <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11718.671s">One</a>  thing that I think we're not so strong at is implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11721.953s">And</a>  this right here, Mr. President, is a measure that was outlined in the Medford Square Draft Master Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11727.677s">And</a>  it calls for the establishment of Medford Square Historic District. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11732.379s">And</a>  I think that this is going to be a catalyst, Mr. President, in generating some interest in foot traffic down through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11738.663s">I</a>  think it's going to be something that's going to help us revitalize that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11744.646s">I</a>  don't wanna say blighted business district, but business district in need of some resuscitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11749.628s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'm asking my council colleagues to support the resolution asking for the Medford Historic District Commission to exercise their power established under the general laws and by city ordinance to provide the mayor with an analysis on the implementation thereof so that it can come to the council and then we can move forward on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11767.055s">In</a>  looking at this, Mr. President, and thinking about the situation in Medford Square and the status of the certain requests that come before this council, I also want to put forth a B paper asking that the Medford City Council place a moratorium on sign variances in the proposed Medford Square Historic District until the analysis is completed by the Medford Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11788.623s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my colleagues to support the A paper and the B paper moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11801.98s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11803.32s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11804.621s">I</a>  think on the main motion, I think this is definitely a great resolve by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11808.961s">I</a>  think it's important that we get input from the Historic District Commission on which areas they believe should be designated historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11817.463s">I'm</a>  hoping that there's not obviously many changes and definitely not eliminations to any of our current historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11825.645s">And</a>  I don't think that's the premise of the resolution, although I did get a concerned citizen calling me about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11832.146s">Otherwise,</a>  I think it's a good resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11833.708s">I</a>  think a moratorium is something that probably just needs a little bit more discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11837.512s">It's</a>  a late hour, and I just would like to lay that B paper laid on the table for a week so we can wrap our minds around it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11847.988s">And</a>  if I may, Mr. President, the reason that I bring the B paper forward is because if we're going to take a serious look at preserving the historic character of Medford Square and the sub squares that have been identified in the master plan, then I think one thing that we need to do is make sure that we have some continuity and some compliance with our locally established ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11868.184s">We've</a>  been giving a lot of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11869.786s">The</a>  property, 5 High Street, comes to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11871.967s">We've</a>  had how many requests for sign variances at that one property? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11874.609s">That's</a>  one of the keystone buildings in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11877.091s">And</a>  the more times we issue permits for non-conforming use of signs, the less and less character we have down there, the less and less historic feel that we have down there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11889.72s">So</a>  I think that it is time to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11891.921s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with Councilor Longo's recommendation that we deal with it at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11896.264s">However,</a>  it's something that I think is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11897.885s">I</a>  think it's very important to the revitalization of our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11900.326s">I</a>  think it's very important to the aesthetic feel of our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11903.467s">And</a>  I think it's very important to us preserving our historic landmarks in the square and those items that people recognize from afar and have recognized from afar for many a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11913.731s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11916.712s">I'll</a>  reintroduce that paper at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11918.593s">And</a>  I ask to move for approval on the A paper.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11960.043s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11961.484s">The</a>  only reason why I can speak somewhat to this, my fellow council, that both the recreation and the assistant recreation director's position has been posted with the traffic engineer's position has been posted, and they're now accepting resumes <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11981.151s">for</a>  all three positions, which is very exciting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11984.333s">Mr.</a>  President, just just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11987.414s">No,</a>  I think that that's great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=11990.056s">I'm</a>  glad to hear it, and I think it's extremely important, especially with the new plans or potential plans for Method Square, Mystic Ave and a number of other locations within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12000.582s">And</a>  we need traffic engineer for the entire city complaints all the time about traffic, and definitely it's a needed position. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12007.245s">So</a>  it's good to hear that it has been posted.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12010.027s">Mr.</a>  President, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12012.365s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12012.985s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12014.847s">As</a>  everyone knows, this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12017.388s">We've</a>  sponsored a number of resolutions regarding a traffic engineer that was supported by this board unanimously, and I'm happy that it's been included in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12025.513s">And</a>  I've been on top of this with regard to, I mean, we really want to see this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12030.436s">And</a>  in the police community meetings that we have monthly, traffic always comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12039.687s">we</a>  have a meeting in, traffic is always the number one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12042.929s">So</a>  I've been in contact with the Chief of Staff on a regular basis just to get updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12047.11s">And</a>  what I can tell you is, just to give you a little bit more specifics, is that it's been posted on the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12054.513s">Municipal</a>  Association website, as well as the City of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12058.335s">They've</a>  gone out to different colleges, WPI, University of Lowell, UMass Boston, Bentley, and so it's on numerous college <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12066.798s">websites</a>  and boards and they've also gone out to three engineering associations as well to post a position and they are currently screening resumes and people can still apply but it's definitely something that I know that they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12081.709s">Like</a>  I said, this is near and dear to my heart and I know I've been curious about it as well and that's just to give you an update with regard to where they are with regard to the hiring process. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12092.136s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12093.277s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12095.797s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Kerr. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12099.799s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12101.479s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12102.5s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12103.08s">Motion</a>  is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12105.001s">17-641</a>  offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that a citywide reverse 911 call be made alerting residents where to find contact info regarding airplane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12117.066s">Additionally,</a>  that the city create boilerplate noise complaint letters on the city website for residents to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12123.488s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12125.241s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12126.262s">I</a>  had the opportunity to attend the September 11th meeting at the South Medford Fire Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12134.409s">And</a>  I just want to put out a special thank you to Luke Presner and Peter Hulk, who are the appointees to the MCAC, which is Massport Community Advisory Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12147.861s">And</a>  they've done yeoman's work over the last several months and organizing and also having a seat at the table when decisions are being made at Massport to make sure that method is well represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12161.034s">And</a>  I can say unequivocally that is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12164.717s">which</a>  didn't happen for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12167.76s">But</a>  it was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12169.642s">There</a>  probably was 80 to 100 people stuffed into that small room, and there was a number of issues discussed, a number of concerns raised by residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12181.355s">And</a>  two particular ones that I raised tonight, Mr. President, is <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12185.259s">that</a>  unless you've been following the issue, most residents that are experiencing this particular noise from airplanes on a consistent basis, early and both late in the evening, are unaware where to file complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12202.403s">they're</a>  unaware what the next step is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12204.785s">And</a>  I would ask that the city take its reverse 911 option and alert the 58,000 residents of Method where they can get this information and how to go about filing a complaint with Massport regarding the noise, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12222.615s">Also,</a>  it was recommended that let us be written to our congressional delegation and also to Massport regarding the noise and some of the other communities like Milton and other communities that have been very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12238.417s">in</a>  kind of altering the air traffic over their communities have created these boilerplate letters that rather than having a citizen sit down and try to craft their own letter, they can go online and just pick out a letter, Mr. President, and send it to the congressional delegation or the Mass Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12257.513s">So</a>  I would ask that our city put on our website right now some boilerplate letters on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12266.4s">There</a>  is currently, what we heard that night, MIT is currently doing a study that the city of Medford will be able to use as an impact study on the air traffic over our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12280.546s">And</a>  I found it very interesting that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12284.267s">Some</a>  of the modifications that could be made to decrease the noise of our community is to have flight patents go out over the water rather than over the major communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12297.064s">And</a>  from what we heard from Peter and Luke, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12299.667s">is</a>  that sometimes these are decisions that are made by the actual pilot and not Logan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12306.693s">Logan</a>  may recommend they go some way, but it's only a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12310.896s">And</a>  maybe if we're able to put some teeth in these patents, flight patents, we'll be able to divert some of this traffic out over the ocean where there'll be less of an impact on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12324.286s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, because East Boston and Winthrop and Revere have such an impact, when planes take off from Logan Airport, they're going at a much slower rate of speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12336.419s">And</a>  that lessens the impact of noise to East Boston, Winthrop, Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12343.046s">However,</a>  once they take off at that slower rate of speed, to reach the altitude they need, they have to start picking up speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12350.669s">And</a>  that's when they're coming over the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12352.97s">And</a>  that's when we're hearing the rumbling that these large jets are trying to pick up altitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12360.514s">And</a>  if they were able to take off a little quicker at Logan Airport, we may be able to alleviate some of the noise <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12367.717s">that</a>  we're considering, however, that'll be more of an impact on East Boston and Winthrop and Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12374.119s">So</a>  the MIT study is taking all this into consideration, flap deployment, modified acceleration, and a number of other issues, Mr. President, but <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12385.663s">It's</a>  fair to say that this is not an issue that's going to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12389.485s">It's</a>  an issue of grave concern in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12392.687s">And</a>  I would ask that the reverse 911 call go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12396.99s">I</a>  get calls for every particular road race and everything under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12401.292s">And</a>  this is an impact issue that affects the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12405.354s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate we use our reverse 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12408.796s">and</a>  also to create the boilerplates to make it easier to file a complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12414.239s">I</a>  looked up the complaints over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12416.7s">It'll</a>  list all 60 or 70 communities that filed complaints, and I found it interesting month after month, Method was in the top one, two, or three for number of complaints filed every month consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12431.228s">So</a>  I think it shows you that this is an issue, Mr. President, and hopefully with the new representation we have now on the Community Advisory Committee, we're gonna be able to get some results.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12444.939s">I'd</a>  like to concur with Vice President Mox, that Peter and Luke, from having no representation, these two gentlemen, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12455.868s">in</a>  nine months have done more work than anyone can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12459.431s">I'll</a>  tell you, the knowledge that they've brought and the slides and the work they've done is just overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12466.558s">I</a>  think that if you listen to the people of Milton and these other cities that were there, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12474.704s">And</a>  the people from the MIT study says, you know, you have to stay on top of the FAA because the federal government allow the FAA to do these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12485.948s">So</a>  again, you know, you can send all the stuff you want to Massport and everywhere else, but it's our federal officials are the only ones who can stop this, and those are the ones <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12497.274s">that</a>  we really need to hound to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12499.715s">And</a>  let's see, we had some great representation there tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12502.875s">I</a>  was there, Councilor De La Ruzo, Councilor Falco, Vice President Marx, we were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12509.457s">So</a>  we had good representation from our council to keep everybody abreast of what's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12516.539s">And</a>  again, Peter and Luke, those two men deserve a tremendous amount of respect in this community for the work that they've done in nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12526.971s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12528.191s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12530.272s">I</a>  too was very, very impressed with the amount of expertise that they've developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12536.794s">It's</a>  clear that the work of making headway with the FAA is going to be through contact <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12551.175s">and</a>  petition to our federal delegation, to our representatives, to the House of Representatives, and also to our Senators, and through work at their offices, with the cooperation of Mask Watch at the FAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12569.966s">Because</a>  it seems to me from their presentations that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12575.668s">There's</a>  not going to be elimination of this noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12578.73s">There's</a>  going to have to be a way to find an equitable distribution of who's going to get some of the noise, some of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12592.73s">And</a>  that's what we're going to have to live with, if I understood their presentations correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12600.293s">But</a>  our efforts have to be focused, as you mentioned, on the federal level.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12606.275s">Councilor</a>  Belco. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12607.055s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12608.216s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12612.778s">The</a>  meeting that Peter and Luke put on was a great meeting, great presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12618.102s">They</a>  did one earlier in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12620.324s">Very</a>  informative, and it's nice to see that there are many people that are attending these meetings because it's a quality of life issue that impacts pretty much all the neighborhoods throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12631.813s">But</a>  the most important thing that I really took out of this is really that it's a federal issue, and we really need to make sure that we contact <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12641.232s">You</a>  know, Senator Markey, Senator Warren, Congresswoman Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12644.295s">I</a>  mean, it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12646.056s">And</a>  they need to be involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12648.839s">And</a>  we need to make sure that, you know, we have many people sending them letters so they know how we feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12654.924s">This</a>  is an issue that impacts all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12658.187s">Like</a>  I said, it's a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12659.788s">I</a>  think the boilerplate letters are a great idea, and it makes it easier for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12665.974s">So</a>  I support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12668.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12670.975s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Bach, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12675.336s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12676.136s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12676.716s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12678.076s">I</a>  don't want to fall down the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12682.197s">Just</a>  really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12682.997s">Sharma</a>  Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12685.118s">A</a>  couple of important takeaways from that meeting for me were that we need to keep filing the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12689.919s">The</a>  volume of complaints are what our elected officials, our representatives, our senators use to show that our community is impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12697.861s">So</a>  while it's great to write letters to our federal delegation, and I encourage you to write to Elizabeth Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12702.804s">She</a>  is our representative on the Quiet Skies Caucus. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12705.766s">So</a>  that's in the federal level for making the skies quieter and more livable for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12711.269s">We</a>  need to keep filing the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12712.73s">Those</a>  are the numbers that they refer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12714.851s">If</a>  the complaints go down, that's how Milton got action was that their complaints were up, unique complaints, multiple complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12721.935s">And</a>  that's what they're going to use for leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12723.856s">So</a>  we need to keep filing those complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12725.517s">So</a>  I hope that reverse 9-1-1, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12727.415s">will</a>  get us some unique complaints.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12745.09s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12747.412s">I</a>  put this on because as you drive through neighboring cities and towns, you always look at different ways that <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12756.022s">Cities</a>  and towns are trying to curb, obviously, speeding and create safer streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12762.769s">So</a>  I've had an interest in the last couple months since I've been seeing the flashing stop signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12767.734s">It</a>  definitely brings more attention to a stop sign, and it worked great from what I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12772.579s">I</a>  was at the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12775.942s">There</a>  are a number of issues on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12777.563s">One</a>  specifically was on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12779.564s">There</a>  are a number of residents that are concerned with the traffic and the pedestrians crossing from the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12786.828s">There</a>  are three or four different crosswalks from both sides of South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12792.211s">And</a>  I suggested this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12793.711s">I</a>  said, have we looked into flashing stop signs, especially at the stop sign at Walnut and South, where you have hundreds of people going into the square and coming <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12804.935s">heading</a>  into South Medford, crossing that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12807.337s">It's</a>  been busy the last, especially in the summer months. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12812.122s">And</a>  the chief of police said to me, stated to the residents that that's just something that needs to be, there needs to be funding allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12819.809s">The</a>  traffic commission can't just vote to put a flashing stop sign in without the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12824.334s">So</a>  I then put it on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12828.017s">Because</a>  I think it would be a great pilot program along with speed bumps and various crosswalks that we've been talking about for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12835.506s">But</a>  if we could investigate, see how much these flashing stop signs are and pilot them in a number of different highly trafficked areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12843.732s">busy</a>  intersections where there are a number of accidents, I think it would go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12848.696s">And</a>  I think it's just an addition to the new radar guns that we've all fought for and that we've received and are being put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12855.842s">I</a>  believe new laser guns, new speed monitoring signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12859.344s">This</a>  is just another way to curb traffic, slow people down, make them realize there is a stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12864.629s">You</a>  need to stop for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12866.21s">You</a>  need to stop, obviously, for safety reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12869.21s">And</a>  this is a way I think that will definitely help. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12871.553s">So</a>  if we could roll call vote on this and purchase, look into purchasing and purchase 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12878.719s">blinking</a>  stop signs, I think it will go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12881.96s">You</a>  can see how it does.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12883.46s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12883.841s">What</a>  a wonderful measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12884.881s">And</a>  I was pleased, I forget what venue it was in, but recently at some point this summertime, I believe I heard the mayor announce that she was pursuing this, this exploration and was working on it as an effort for traffic calming measures.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12904.667s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12906.027s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12907.108s">Mr.</a>  President, I find this to be a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12909.71s">I</a>  hope the councilor doesn't mind if I amend it and give 10 recommended intersections that we can place flashing stop signs at. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12917.556s">No,</a>  in all seriousness, this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12920.218s">It's</a>  something that the community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12922.64s">I</a>  was just sitting on Woburn Street the other day, and I watched five cars in a row going 35 miles an hour blow through a four-way stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12929.986s">Just</a>  one after another. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12930.807s">Boom,</a>  boom, boom, boom, boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12933.089s">So</a>  it's getting to the point now where the cut through traffic is not only becoming a problem with congestion, but they're also getting pretty familiar and bold and almost have a contempt now for the rules of the road that we have here in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12947.097s">So</a>  I think this is a great measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12948.278s">Anything</a>  that can raise awareness to drivers and bring some more controls to the area for pedestrian safety is something that I'll always support. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12958.985s">This</a>  is a great resolution.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12961.441s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12963.422s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12965.562s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Piano for bringing this resolution forward, especially when in 2001, I believe, we had a large meeting with the neighborhood crime watch at the old train station, I believe, on Washington Street, former Redskins building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12986.289s">And</a>  that's when the new schools were opening, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=12991.891s">police,</a>  if he could get installed a push-button stoplight so the children could cross Riverside Avenue onto the newly created Freedom Way, the two schools, Tucker Andrews and McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13010.997s">And</a>  basically, his reply, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13017.962s">And</a>  I said, well, basically, I'm just asking for a push-button stop, not a full-fledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13022.863s">It</a>  cost $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13023.723s">So</a>  nothing has ever been put there except a crosswalk, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13029.764s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, not long ago, within 12 months, on High Street, they put something in real quick when the child was almost hit by a car, they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13041.886s">And</a>  it's on High Street in front of this book school, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13046.82s">I</a>  would like to confide with Councilor Knight also, if I could have a request to put it there, because that crosswalk, the dangerous street, Riverside Avenue, and furthermore, it's used 12 months a year, not just for the school year, because of the park, footpath, bike paths, partial bike paths, soccer fields, et cetera, Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13074.189s">request.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13074.731s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13076.976s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13079.583s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13080.766s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Kurd for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13084.383s">I've</a>  been talking about traffic calming initiatives in this city for the better part of a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13091.648s">But</a>  needless to say, Mr. President, I agree with this, but I think procedurally we have a commission that is responsible for signage in any traffic calming initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13104.755s">markings</a>  on roads, that is the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13108.258s">So</a>  I would respectfully ask my council colleague if we can send this to the traffic commission, let them review the need for these particular flashing stop signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13120.548s">And</a>  then the requests be sent to the administration for the purchasing based on their recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13127.031s">So</a>  I think this is kind of putting the cart before the horse, asking to purchase signs and not go through the appropriate body first. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13134.994s">So</a>  that's the only change I'd make. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13137.555s">I</a>  support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13139.816s">I</a>  like the flashing signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13141.097s">I</a>  like raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13143.118s">I</a>  like, you know, cutouts, bump outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13146.279s">I</a>  like all that traffic calming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13148.62s">approaches.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13149.181s">So</a>  that was that was the one thing I'd ask my council colleague if she would amend it and send it to the Traffic Commission for us for their input.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13156.485s">I</a>  think maybe we could do both at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13158.407s">I</a>  think that's a good resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13160.288s">Ask</a>  the administration to look into pricing and send it to the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13165.231s">When</a>  I was there on Tuesday, they said that it seemed like that was something they would definitely want to implement but didn't have the funding for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13172.135s">So</a>  I think sending it to the Traffic Commission and having them <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13175.086s">figure</a>  out where the locations would be, because we'd all probably fight over, we'd want 100 of them, between the seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13183.085s">But</a>  if we could have them designate where these 10 spots would be, or more if we can afford it, and have the administration try to figure out how much they would cost, and what funding we have, and how many we could purchase, I think we could collectively be able to implement it within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13199.27s">So</a>  are you going to amend it to send it both to the administration and the traffic commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13203.951s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13204.431s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13205.912s">On</a>  the motion that we send this vote to the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13211.398s">in</a>  the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13213.96s">Motion</a>  has been on the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Langlois-Carron. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13220.024s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13220.885s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13221.485s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13222.345s">17-6.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13222.886s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, not to have any confusion, but I think we have to word it a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13229.47s">If</a>  we're going to send the Mayor a request to look into purchasing flashing stop signs, we're certainly not going to ask the Traffic Commission to look into purchasing <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13238.525s">Flashing</a>  stop signs, but we're going to ask them to look into the feasibility of... In locations.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13244.55s">Feasibility</a>  in location. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13249.777s">If</a>  we could amend that, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13251.078s">Mr.</a>  President, I think this is where it becomes important that we get the traffic engineer on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13256.383s">We</a>  get the traffic engineer on the payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13259.366s">Because</a>  the traffic engineer is probably going to be the one that's going to be able to determine where the best locations are and where we're going to get the most bang for our buck and the most impact.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13266.732s">I</a>  think that's what Chief Sacco was saying.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13268.754s">And</a>  I think Chief Sacco is on the right track when he talks about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13271.696s">I</a>  mean, Chief Sacco, I think, is more excited than anybody to have a traffic engineer come on board here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13277.341s">for</a>  the last 20-some odd years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13278.661s">He's</a>  been the one that's been wearing the badge that says this is where the stop sign goes, this is where the do not enter sign goes after the deliberations from the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13289.904s">So</a>  I think this traffic engineer is going to add some professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13292.905s">It's</a>  going to allow us to have some data-driven decision making, Mr. President, as opposed to some reactionary decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13298.606s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13299.607s">But</a>  I think this, again, is a great resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13301.787s">I</a>  mean, we can ask the Traffic Commission to implement, but the locations, I think, really should be up to them and the traffic engineer, the people that have the ability to make data-driven decisions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13313.93s">All</a>  right, so as amended there, we'll change the wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13320.452s">All</a>  right, 17-643, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13323.451s">that</a>  the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Deacon Mark Rumley on his recent assignment to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13329.353s">Raphael's</a>  Parish by Archbishop Sean O'Malley. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13334.135s">It</a>  was announced a couple weeks ago that our city solicitor, Deacon Rumley, will be joining the staff at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13341.598s">Ray's,</a>  and I just wish him good luck on his new assignment there, and I know the people in the community were also excited about having him there also. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13350.022s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13351.102s">We</a>  see a motion to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13353.836s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13357.459s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13358.259s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13358.98s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13361.041s">17-638</a>  offered by Councilor Lococo and be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13363.883s">that</a>  the Medford City Council provide the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and how one can get a video aired on TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13372.885s">Councilwoman</a>  Locren.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13374.326s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13375.766s">I'm</a>  actually asking that we be provided the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and get a video aired. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13383.668s">I</a>  think it's, people are very excited about TV3, it's opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13388.364s">And</a>  people also have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13390.269s">There's</a>  been scuttlebutt of whether or not you need a court report filled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13395.044s">I</a>  think that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13396.583s">obviously</a>  something that may be needed because it is located within the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13400.926s">So</a>  that's obviously understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13403.808s">But</a>  if we could just get a list of what is going to be required, is it going to be a contract that's going to need to be signed? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13409.552s">How</a>  long will it take to be quarried? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13411.373s">When</a>  can you get a video aired? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13412.874s">And</a>  how will you be able to get a video aired? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13415.856s">I</a>  think that's important for the public to know now that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13419.398s">We</a>  have a new station, people really want to get involved, and it's just common information that probably should be posted and figured out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13427.904s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13430.266s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13431.206s">Ben</a>  Brown, station manager, City of Medford, Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13436.35s">I</a>  brought with me tonight the form for how to get a show on the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13442.374s">It</a>  is several pages, and I apologize if it wasn't in your packet ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13448.423s">Simply,</a>  to fill out, to get a show on the air, there is this form. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13451.484s">Once</a>  it's filled out, it does require a QWERTY form also to be submitted the first time the resident submits programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13461.366s">And</a>  after that, they can submit programming as many times as they like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13464.366s">As</a>  far as becoming a member goes, we're going to have an open house on October 15th from 10 to noon. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13471.128s">And</a>  we'll be signing members up then in a more official way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13476.589s">October</a>  15th, 10 to noon? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13478.371s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13480.672s">And</a>  if I may, through the chair, the CORI form, once one does come in and fill it out, how long is the process to get that back and approved?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13489.739s">It's</a>  not long.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13491.381s">24</a>  hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13491.601s">Yeah,</a>  usually.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13492.962s">We</a>  normally wouldn't start airing programming the same hour that programming came in anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13498.826s">We</a>  usually air schedules on a weekly basis, so if you came in on Monday, it may not air until Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13505.931s">That's</a>  just logistically the timing to get the programming in and started. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13510.073s">That's</a>  not to say it wouldn't happen faster than that, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13513.675s">Go</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13515.857s">And</a>  it does look like there's a contract here, producer agreement and indemnification form. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13521.68s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13522.841s">Who</a>  drafted that?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13524.402s">That</a>  is city policy.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13527.682s">So</a>  City Hall?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13528.603s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13532.888s">And</a>  once that's signed, who's going to keep hold of that?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13537.333s">That</a>  comes to me, and then I file them and put them on the computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13541.337s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13544.007s">I</a>  think we're just getting this, so I think that's, how can somebody, do they have to come in and apply to be a member, apply in person, or will this be online?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13553.413s">It</a>  will be online once the media center has a website, but that's a couple weeks-ish away. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13562.538s">But</a>  if anyone wants to email me, I'm happy to send it back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13566.08s">And</a>  I have sent it back to a few people.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13569.444s">So</a>  have you had anybody sign the agreement and become members yet?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13572.888s">I've</a>  had one come back to me that's been fully signed, and I have a few others that are out now.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13587.345s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13588.246s">Councilor</a>  Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13589.65s">Ben,</a>  welcome aboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13590.931s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13591.311s">We've</a>  had the opportunity to see you at your finest hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13594.693s">We</a>  had a couple of council meetings over there in the media center, and things went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13598.194s">It's</a>  certainly a lot cooler in there than it is in here, and the lights aren't as bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13602.336s">But</a>  with that being said, can you tell us a little bit about your experience so far being there, based upon where you've been in the past and where you are now, what you think the direction the media center can go in, and what we should expect?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13616.192s">Sure,</a>  so I'm coming to Medford from the town of Brookline. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13622.117s">I</a>  was there for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13623.317s">Previous</a>  to that, I was in the city of Northampton. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13626.88s">In</a>  both the media centers that I worked in in the past, they've had a long record of being the media center for all three of the channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13636.867s">And</a>  Medford used to be known as TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13640.59s">Now</a>  I've been asked to help support all three of the channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13646.173s">And</a>  as part of that, we decided on the name Medford Community Media, as opposed to just TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13652.698s">And</a>  going forward, I would hope that we could work to be a model of media centers around the state and around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13662.037s">providing</a>  media training and education, providing some media literacy education, and as well as the normal public access programming that everyone has known and loves.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13676.224s">And</a>  in terms of programming right now, obviously the TV Guide right now.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13683.597s">Yeah,</a>  so there is... I'm a big Three Stooges fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13687.499s">There</a>  is some programming on the channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13689.4s">It's</a>  all educational programming and public domain movies. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13693.881s">There</a>  was one form that came back to me today that is a resident who makes both an English language and a Russian language program, interview program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13704.906s">That'll</a>  be on within the next couple days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13709.468s">There</a>  is a cooking show that has been requested be aired. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13716.074s">I</a>  haven't gotten the form back. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13717.315s">There's</a>  a music program that's been made in the city of Medford that's been requested, but I haven't received the form yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13728.441s">And</a>  other programming would be things like NASA TV and other news programs from around the country.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13736.804s">And</a>  where can an individual find out what's playing and when?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13740.485s">So</a>  right now, you can't because we don't have a website. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13743.986s">Once</a>  there's a website, it'll all be on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13746.407s">My</a>  hope would be that in the future, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13751.408s">There</a>  is a push for Comcast and Verizon to include the media centers as part of the electronic program guide, and I would hope that we could adopt that in Medford soon, though it's a complex issue at the Comcast and Verizon level.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13764.957s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13765.217s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13765.718s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13766.378s">Keep</a>  up the good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13766.978s">The</a>  place looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13767.659s">I</a>  think you're doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13770.801s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13771.141s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13772.502s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13777.658s">President.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13779.399s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13782.24s">This</a>  question is for Ben. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13783.4s">Ben,</a>  I just had a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13788.882s">What</a>  involvement did you have in putting together this particular application?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13794.565s">So</a>  there are some standard forms that are used in other centers around the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13804.189s">You</a>  know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13805.815s">took</a>  that and submitted it to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13810.376s">So,</a>  you know, the original language is from me, but I'm not an attorney and I don't represent one as the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13817.078s">So</a>  I couldn't venture to say that that's my writing, I think.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13822.3s">So</a>  just if I can understand better, what was the discussion or thoughts regarding first time submitters will be required to fill out a core reform?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13833.359s">I</a>  believe that has to do with the location of the media center.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13837.9s">So</a>  the fact that the media center is located at the high school, we're requesting core reforms?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13845.082s">I</a>  believe so, yes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13846.543s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13847.323s">And</a>  I was under the impression that this had a separate entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13851.984s">I</a>  was under the impression that the new media center would be used on off hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13861.343s">Is</a>  that not correct?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13863.406s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13865.888s">We</a>  are planning on having hours outside of the school day, yes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13869.672s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13870.613s">Because</a>  I really have a concern with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13874.418s">And</a>  let me tell you what my concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13876.98s">That</a>  if the requirement of a quarry is based on the fact that this is housed <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13883.215s">here</a>  at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13885.257s">And</a>  the fact that we have outside non-resident organizations that are renting out school facilities, and as far as I know, not required to fill out core reforms that are occupying our school buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13905.945s">How</a>  would that be any different than someone coming up here from the community that's in a room that's dedicated for that purpose, with no access, the way I understand it, into the high school, then be required to fill out a core reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13920.692s">But</a>  if I live in Lexington, I can come up here on a Saturday, spend hours in the building, bring in rolling luggage with me, occupy classrooms under lock and key, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13934.957s">in</a>  a building that houses our students without a quarry check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13938.238s">And</a>  this question may not be for you, it may be for the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13943.66s">I</a>  just, I wanna better understand why we're requiring a quarry for local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13949.842s">And</a>  if what you're telling me is because it's up at the high school, but then we have people renting out these buildings, numerous people renting out these buildings, and not requiring a quarry to be inside these buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13965.844s">I</a>  have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13967.585s">I</a>  want to know what's going on here.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13969.266s">I</a>  unfortunately can't speak directly to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13971.827s">I</a>  can only speak to the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13974.729s">Um,</a>  and, you know, the form states that because it's located in the high school, that's why the court check is being requested.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13982.453s">So</a>  maybe the superintendent schools, I don't want to put you on the spot, Mr. Belson, but maybe maybe if you can answer that, you stay to the late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13990.457s">So</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13992.835s">So</a>  I'm here, Mr. Vice President, as tonight's security, because you were concerned about that, as I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13999.379s">Oh,</a>  you're providing the security. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14000.62s">I'm</a>  wearing blue, so.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14003.362s">It's</a>  good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14004.523s">It's</a>  good to know.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14005.563s">Feel</a>  safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14008.385s">We'll</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14008.845s">What's</a>  your answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14009.586s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14011.147s">So</a>  we do quarry checks on everyone who has unsupervised contact with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14018.011s">And</a>  that's anyone who works here, a contractor, anyone who comes in like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14026.284s">dedicated</a>  door that you can't go from the studio into the high school once it's fully operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14032.771s">Obviously</a>  we're still using it with students so they can go during the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14037.095s">But</a>  there are any number of activities that students have that people coming up here in the afternoon might interact with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14045.322s">And</a>  so I think that the city, and I don't have an objection to taking the extra step in making sure that anyone who might be up here frequently, who is moving around that area outside of the studio into the area, might find their way into the front door at a given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14063.29s">we</a>  check it out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14065.733s">As</a>  far as other groups go, we've rented properties for years, and we haven't required it because generally they're under the supervision of people, and the people there are on a volunteer basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14076.564s">So,</a>  it really isn't exactly the same thing, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra measure of precaution.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14083.59s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out, Mr. Superintendent, if this is a new standard that we're implementing because the media centers up here at the high school, or for that reason, any other building, then why does it not trickle down to organizations that have full access to these buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14104.159s">And</a>  why wouldn't we want to secure our buildings to that extent? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14109.162s">And</a>  are you willing to make that commitment?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14116.94s">Our</a>  students are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14118.421s">So</a>  if we had a coach, and they were coaching on the field, they'd be quarried. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14122.405s">If</a>  we have a rental out there, they're not our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14127.99s">So</a>  it's not unsupervised contact with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14131.653s">That's</a>  the requirement of the court.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14133.235s">Right,</a>  but they have access to our building.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14137.058s">Yeah,</a>  but access to the building isn't the standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14139.14s">There</a>  are people who have access to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14141.062s">A</a>  parent comes up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14144.825s">They're</a>  checked in, but they're not quarried. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14146.546s">So</a>  access to the building is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14148.507s">The</a>  standard for quarrying is unsupervised contact with students.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14153.989s">So</a>  for instance, on Saturdays, you know there's a program up here on Saturdays where hundreds of people, mostly from outside this community, come in and use the classrooms, use the facilities, use the cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14167.835s">And</a>  in my opinion, you might say they're supervised by their own staff, not by our staff, by their own staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14176.599s">Why</a>  wouldn't that then trigger off this new requirement of being in a building unsupervised that, you know, could have a potential risk?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14187.664s">Look,</a>  you can have a person walking on the street and have them contact with someone who's inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14195.167s">In</a>  this building, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14196.833s">When</a>  we have a rental, and we have a situation where people, let's say the Japanese language school, because that's the sanity reference you're making, they have their own students, they have their own people, they have their own coverages, they supervise their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14212.033s">We're</a>  not responsible for their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14215.365s">But</a>  anyone who works with our students, if we had an athletic team, if we had a club that met on the weekend, whoever is a supervisor has a quarry check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14224.368s">And</a>  on top of that, most instances has a fingerprint check.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14227.269s">But</a>  wouldn't we have a responsibility, Mr. Superintendent, to our students that attend the public schools, that whoever we're letting into the building, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14237.461s">rental,</a>  or whatever other purpose, that we know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14241.364s">And</a>  the reason why you're requesting a quarry is to check the background of someone that's coming into the building, that's using the media center, and that you want to know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14253.474s">And</a>  you want to make sure that the quarry, because the quarry's for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14258.377s">You</a>  know, you're doing a background investigation on the person, but then again we're saying, we'll allow hundreds of people up here with luggage, wheeled in luggage, and access to every classroom in this community, in this school, and not have the same type of requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14277.987s">I</a>  just don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14279.288s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out what the policy and procedure is.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14282.749s">But</a>  you're making two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14284.069s">So,</a>  for example, on parents night, parents come up for curriculum night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14287.49s">We</a>  don't quarry every parent who comes in the door.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14290.511s">I'm</a>  not talking about parents.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14292.072s">But</a>  they could.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14293.032s">Byron</a>  is a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14294.955s">I'm</a>  not talking about, you're talking about something that I'm not talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14299.14s">I'm</a>  talking about the renting of our facilities.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14302.064s">You're</a>  talking about a type of person in the building, but there's all kinds of people who come into this building who are not chlorinated.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14308.271s">Right,</a>  so if we're going to require a quarry for someone using a particular room, a media room, that doesn't have access to high school, maybe we should require a quarry for people that are coming into the building, that are renting the building, and not just this high school as you know, other school facilities, and make it so that we have a responsibility to safeguard our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14332.417s">because</a>  in my opinion, Mr. Superintendent, there's no way that we're supervising what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14339.141s">We're</a>  relying on people that are renting to make sure it's a secure atmosphere and make sure that our students are safe come Monday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14347.946s">And</a>  that is a concern I have, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14350.567s">I</a>  understand what you're saying, but that's not the standard of Corey. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14355.79s">The</a>  Corey check requires when a person has unsupervised contact, a frequent visitor kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14363.176s">So</a>  if a person's going to use the media studio, and they're going to come up here more than once, I assume they're going to try to use the studio more than once, they're not becoming a member to only have one production or one activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14374.466s">So</a>  they're a frequent action person up here, and so it doesn't hurt to know who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14380.169s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14380.769s">Right,</a>  but it would be supervision, correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14383.15s">Is</a>  that studio lift unmanned? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14384.411s">They</a>  won't be supervising students? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14386.712s">No,</a>  no, I'm talking if someone's gonna come up here and use the media center, is there not, Dan, someone that's gonna be supervising, or will that be unmanned? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14397.016s">They</a>  could. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14397.616s">I'm</a>  asking with all due respect to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14401.99s">Does</a>  your facility go unsupervised?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14403.792s">It</a>  will not go unsupervised to an extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14407.054s">I</a>  think the point is that they could walk out of the media center by accident, right?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14414.58s">They</a>  could walk into the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14416.781s">They</a>  go out the main door of the studio.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14420.264s">So</a>  similar to the hundreds of people that come in here every Saturday, could walk into any area of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14428.91s">generally</a>  at that time they're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14431.011s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, I don't want to belabor the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14433.833s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out if this is a new policy or procedure, based on the fact that people coming up to the high school or any of our schools, I think it should be carried out across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14443.718s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14445.559s">Check</a>  every parent who walks in the building too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14448.38s">Now</a>  you're getting back to the parents again, and I'm talking about rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14452.802s">I</a>  don't know how I can lay that out any easier.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14455.945s">You</a>  can't tell who's who's a problem on a given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14458.507s">It</a>  could be anybody.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14469.835s">Well,</a>  it doesn't seem like much thought went into this quarry process. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14475.777s">It</a>  seemed like it was just isolated to the media center, and that's all I'm bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14480.498s">I</a>  just want to know what the thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14482.439s">I</a>  wasn't involved in creating this, so I just want to know what the thoughts are.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14485.48s">I</a>  don't think it's unreasonable if a person is going to be up here frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14492.348s">have</a>  access to a particular area of the building.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14495.409s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14495.59s">So</a>  the rentals we have are frequent rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14499.351s">And</a>  some of these organizations have been renting for, I'd venture to say, 10, 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14506.675s">I</a>  don't know how much more frequent you can get than that, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14510.276s">It</a>  may be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14511.637s">And</a>  I never see a request to have other people storied that are using our buildings.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14517.26s">They're</a>  not working with our students directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14519.301s">They're</a>  working with their population.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14522.342s">And</a>  someone going to the media room is not working with our students directly either. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14526.183s">They</a>  could.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14526.763s">All</a>  right, look, it's obviously a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14531.305s">Right,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14532.585s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14534.285s">Just</a>  one suggestion, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14536.846s">Motion</a>  that the city solicitor be sent this question <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14543.448s">as</a>  to how this questionnaire developed and what the standard was used to institute the query and ask for an answer from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14559.999s">This</a>  way we can get an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14562.44s">rather</a>  than be swallowed up by endless speculation and debate.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14568.202s">What</a>  I'll do is respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14569.703s">It's</a>  not speculation and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14571.763s">And</a>  if the gentleman had students in the public schools, he would be looking out for the safety of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14578.126s">And</a>  that's what my concern is, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14582.855s">Ben,</a>  if you could tell me, the Cori check is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14585.938s">What</a>  if the Cori check does not come back clean? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14587.9s">Is</a>  the person now precluded from being able to utilize the studio, or is it just so that you know that there is someone in there that might have a questionable background that needs to be monitored more closely?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14597.329s">The</a>  way the policy is written, they would be precluded from using the studio.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14601.594s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14608.228s">My</a>  name's Robert Pentez, Zero Summit, Rowan-Benton Mass, former member of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14612.949s">When</a>  we talk about security, again, you can walk into this building tonight, there's no security here at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14617.97s">This</a>  is not the first time this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14620.011s">And</a>  I know it's been a pet peeve of Councilman Locke's relative to the security of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14624.151s">So</a>  that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14625.012s">Number</a>  two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement, the demarcation bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14633.634s">Have</a>  you been query checked? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14636.113s">Did</a>  you pass? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14637.633s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14638.834s">He</a>  speaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14641.214s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14642.434s">The</a>  question becomes this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14644.735s">He's</a>  running the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14645.775s">He's</a>  corporate checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14647.115s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14648.236s">But</a>  I think if you ask the question of surrounding cities and towns, they don't have this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14652.157s">And</a>  the question boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14664.17s">Councilor</a>  Falco, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School, and I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will become quarry checked, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14677.573s">So</a>  if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were and were they quarry checked and did they pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14686.819s">You</a>  know, just making the comment is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14689.84s">And</a>  the superintendent is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14692.56s">You</a>  guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14697.261s">This</a>  is public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14698.522s">This</a>  is a Medford City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14700.902s">It's</a>  public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14702.043s">The</a>  people can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14703.303s">They</a>  can come in and they can talk the same way you can, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14708.004s">So</a>  you've got to follow the same rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14710.985s">You,</a>  in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14716.627s">Now</a>  when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14730.839s">Okay,</a>  we'll give you a grant to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14733.962s">But</a>  if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you gonna play it without having the quarry checked? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14749.456s">If</a>  I can't answer it, I would have to go back to the city and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14753.697s">And</a>  that's where the problem begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14755.818s">You</a>  have to go back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14757.538s">Here's</a>  the gentleman who's the manager of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14759.918s">And</a>  these questions should be all readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14762.439s">You</a>  know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14767.28s">It</a>  talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14779.763s">Well,</a>  I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14786.766s">They</a>  did all those things to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14789.567s">And</a>  now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14792.749s">Because</a>  there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14796.67s">And</a>  there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities, and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14807.276s">There</a>  I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14819.025s">There's</a>  also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14832.502s">If</a>  you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it, or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14841.187s">But</a>  if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14852.974s">That's</a>  what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14861.083s">I</a>  really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14871.896s">They</a>  may want to come in and, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever, just a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14881.07s">And</a>  for that one shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in at non-school hours, you're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14891.718s">Now</a>  Councilor Marks, you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14893.399s">You</a>  really need to know the genesis behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14895.24s">No</a>  city and town around this has this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14898.363s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14899.844s">This</a>  is not making any sense at all as to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14902.906s">Because</a>  this is going to really stifle free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14905.548s">This</a>  is going to stifle your election coming up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14909.195s">for</a>  reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a carving check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14917.687s">Now,</a>  you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14919.63s">You've</a>  served all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14922.482s">And</a>  now you have to submit a Corby check to get into your local public access channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14927.465s">It</a>  makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14929.227s">To</a>  me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14932.729s">I</a>  don't think the administration has the right to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14935.931s">I</a>  think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14940.854s">And</a>  the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this is the issuing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14946.498s">And</a>  who is the issuing authority? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14948.139s">It's</a>  the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14953.93s">because</a>  you are on public access right now and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14964.418s">But</a>  to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a quarry check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14973.045s">And</a>  that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14978.129s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14979.63s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14981.992s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14984.129s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14985.633s">Hey,</a>  my name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, and I just rushed here from band practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14991.402s">We</a>  play once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14993.183s">Inside</a>  this phone's one of the best bands in New England, my band. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14996.904s">And</a>  the key here is this, more than the Corey check, which is laughable, when I called Access Station and read it to them, they laughed, they fell over laughing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15008.307s">I've</a>  been in Access Television since 1979. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15010.067s">In</a>  America, I'm one of the oldest producers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15014.208s">I</a>  produce over in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15015.509s">Ben</a>  Brown has five of my shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15017.509s">So</a>  he played Steve Katz's from Arlington, great show. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15020.93s">But</a>  he's hemming and hawing about playing my show, and it's like, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15024.772s">You</a>  know, I've got Gilbert Gottfried on, and Ray Manzarek at the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15028.034s">So</a>  you want me to go down with thousands of people I've had on? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15030.435s">You</a>  know, tomorrow I've got Gentle Giant, a band that opened for Jethro Tull. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15034.357s">Last</a>  week I had Jethro Tull's Martin Barron. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15037.379s">So</a>  I'm a famous rock critic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15040.111s">But</a>  I do community work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15042.051s">So</a>  my great community work for the Kitty Connection, which I do a lot of work for Marie, and I'm going to continue to, is stifled not only by the Corey check, but there's another element to that contract which threatens to sue you if, oh, someone thinks you've intimidated a witness, and God knows I prevailed in court over that when someone fraudulently sued me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15064.414s">You</a>  know, that's the kind of thing that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15066.035s">So</a>  if you do a show and someone doesn't like that, you say, oh, I saw the city council president skip out on a vote to pay the part, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15073.959s">If</a>  you say that on TV, the city council president could probably sue me because he doesn't like what I said, but he'd be wrong in doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15080.663s">It's</a>  my free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15081.984s">So</a>  then you have to pay for your attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15084.205s">And</a>  in the contract, you must pay for the city hall's attorney if my reading is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15089.228s">What</a>  planet are we on? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15090.83s">I'm</a>  one of the oldest producers in the history of friggin' public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15095.054s">Pardon</a>  my friggin' French. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15096.936s">And</a>  I've seen many a producer's indemnification agreement and this is wholesale censorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15103.783s">And</a>  may I quote the city solicitor, I would find the city squelching free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15110.543s">Repugnant.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15112.044s">Mr.</a>  Rumley, you're the author of censorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15114.245s">What</a>  are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15115.426s">Now,</a>  I believe in public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15119.168s">So</a>  if a grandma wants to do a cooking show, you insult her by cory-checking her. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15124.891s">Who's</a>  she gonna hurt? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15125.932s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15126.993s">Number</a>  two, to have a grandma sign this thing, and if someone's just deciding they're gonna be a bully, and they don't like her grandson or her husband, and they sue her, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15138.583s">That</a>  poor family has to go through what I've gone through, paying thousands of dollars in legal bills, because I've fought for public access harder than any person in Medford for the past 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15149.265s">And</a>  the 600 grand we have came because I kept the fight alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15153.666s">And</a>  then a city councilor came in, and Doreen Wade came in, and we brought down TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15158.587s">And</a>  that's why the 600 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15160.468s">You</a>  want to talk about someone who's really upset? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15162.968s">Because</a>  I've given a quarter of my life to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15167.855s">And</a>  I've given thousands of dollars in legal bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15170.156s">And</a>  I win. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15170.716s">I</a>  won against the TV station manager in Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15174.857s">I</a>  got a restraining order on the next manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15177.298s">And</a>  if I have to file restraining orders on the mayor and the new manager, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15181.999s">My</a>  show has to be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15183.479s">You</a>  have my show. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15185.14s">I've</a>  done nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15186.3s">I'm</a>  a good human being. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15187.601s">How</a>  dare you? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15188.961s">How</a>  dare you not play my show in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15192.799s">My</a>  God, I have sweat blood for public access TV, and I will not be intimidated and bullied and dragged into court by people who aren't even fit to shine my shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15205.988s">And</a>  I will see them in court in another venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15208.43s">Now,</a>  I want the access, I want it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15211.072s">The</a>  candidates running for office are being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15216.096s">They</a>  were denied the primary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15218.397s">So</a>  all the incumbents came in, including Mrs. Cuno, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15223.238s">But</a>  the people that don't get the traction did not get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15228.32s">While</a>  I've been fighting day after day after day to get public access in this city, I will not stand for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15235.823s">And</a>  if I had to sue a smirking Dello Russo, I will sue him. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15240.024s">I'm</a>  tired, I'm fed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15242.479s">You,</a>  Mr. Dello Russo, said we need a young man to do access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15245.241s">No,</a>  Mr. Dello Russo, I'm the authority here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15248.283s">You</a>  know about undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15249.443s">I</a>  know about public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15251.144s">I</a>  am the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15252.245s">We</a>  need an older person that knows public access, that knows the rules, and that wants to facilitate programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15258.389s">That's</a>  his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15259.809s">Outreach</a>  is his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15261.851s">And</a>  that contract, that indemnification agreement, is the antithesis of outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15267.454s">I</a>  just played in one of the best rock and roll bands in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15271.274s">just</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15271.694s">And</a>  I have to come over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15272.715s">Johnny</a>  Byers called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15274.035s">That</a>  poor kid wants to put his sports show on the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15276.437s">We</a>  are denying him now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15278.178s">Anyone</a>  who subscribes to this is denying him now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15283.04s">This</a>  has to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15284.601s">It</a>  has to end now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15285.622s">And</a>  if I have to file an injunction, so help me God, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15290.584s">I'm</a>  pretty good in the courtroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15293.6s">as</a>  someone here knows very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15296.803s">And</a>  I will not stand for this and the smirking and the censorship at this very city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15301.648s">So</a>  let's have access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15303.47s">If</a>  Ben Brown can't answer the questions, he should just quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15306.793s">He</a>  couldn't tell me how a Verizon contract works. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15310.537s">So</a>  I sent him to Hingham and I sent him Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15313.099s">I'm</a>  only music director over in, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15316.342s">I'm</a>  Malden's live on tape, and I'm music director over at Boston Free Radio, and I do my show in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15322.424s">So</a>  why should I be denied a show when I do it in Somerville, when I have six memberships, when you could learn so much from me, young man, you could learn so much from me, but you'd rather take the blood money and censor us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15335.607s">So</a>  that's what I have to say tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15337.787s">You</a>  want to know about AXS TV, give me a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15340.088s">You</a>  know where I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15341.538s">We're</a>  going to have access to TV, we're not going to have censorship, and Stephanie Burke will be held accountable if this nonsense continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15349.683s">So</a>  help me God.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15351.804s">Mr.</a>  President, a couple of questions for the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15354.125s">It</a>  sounds like, based upon the presentation, that you haven't signed the producer in indemnification form. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15360.129s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15360.789s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15361.71s">And</a>  if you did, you'd be subjecting yourself to a Corey check, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15366.46s">Well,</a>  the Cori check, who cares?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15368.122s">What</a>  I'm more concerned about, sir... Just bear with me for a minute.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15372.166s">City</a>  Hall has my Cori, come on.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15373.567s">Just</a>  bear with me for a second, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15376.39s">You'd</a>  have to take a Cori check if you signed up for the producer identification form, right?</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15380.154s">Who</a>  cares?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15380.414s">It's</a>  not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15381.275s">Can</a>  you pass the Cori check? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15383.787s">Of</a>  course I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15384.467s">You</a>  can, Mr. Corry.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15386.328s">Unlike</a>  you, Mr. Knight, I think I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15388.028s">I'm</a>  worried about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15388.728s">I'm</a>  not worried about you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15389.768s">I'm</a>  concerned about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15390.809s">I</a>  actually worked for the school department for a couple of years.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15392.929s">I</a>  know you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15393.469s">I've</a>  actually passed the Corry check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15394.65s">I</a>  think, you know, when people put signs against bus stops, people should be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15399.831s">You</a>  break the rules, I play by the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15401.531s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15402.091s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Brianna Longo-Curran for putting this on the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15405.292s">But</a>  the thing that concerns me is not the Corry check and you trying to embarrass people all the time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15409.393s">Mr.</a>  President, I do believe I have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15410.413s">You</a>  ignorant person.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15411.634s">I</a>  do believe I have the floor, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15413.594s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor, Mr. Biglioni. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15416.238s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor at the particular moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15418.801s">Was</a>  he congratulating someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15420.483s">Or</a>  did someone die?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15421.244s">I'm</a>  congratulating you on your excellent presentation this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15423.847s">I</a>  do appreciate you coming out here this evening.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15425.409s">It's</a>  been very enlightening.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15427.352s">What</a>  are they called?</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15429.15s">We're</a>  called Love and Flame, and we were one of Boston's five best bands in Playboy magazine, 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15434.212s">That's</a>  a good year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15435.652s">That's</a>  the year I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15439.453s">Well,</a>  I know a little bit more about dancing on stage, too, so I think I gave a pretty good performance here tonight, after I sang all Lou Reed's songs on my own.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15446.075s">Sounds</a>  like you had a good night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15447.396s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15448.076s">I</a>  really do.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15448.436s">The</a>  band is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15450.057s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15450.457s">It's</a>  nice of you to come up here and put that aside to come up here and share with us, so I do appreciate that, Mr.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15454.658s">You</a>  know, I wish I could teach you how to talk in a mic, too, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15458.081s">Linda.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15458.542s">You</a>  talk way too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15459.743s">You</a>  have to articulate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15463.885s">Mr.</a>  President, this is bringing me to my point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15468.468s">I</a>  fail to see how this is helping move Medford forward.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15471.409s">I'll</a>  move Medford forward with Kitty Connection and with all the personality stuff I do with people on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15476.872s">I</a>  want to help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15478.313s">I</a>  want to help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15479.414s">I</a>  don't congratulate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15480.534s">I</a>  work hard for people.</p>

    <p>[_ILL_rSpLCY_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15481.895s">Keep</a>  it up.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15482.815s">I</a>  congratulate you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15484.156s">The</a>  thing that worries me is not the quarry check as much as the legal aspect of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15488.839s">That</a>  is the thing that worries me, Mr. Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15491.26s">The</a>  quarry check, City Hall has my quarry. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15493.041s">Who's</a>  Skidding Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15494.162s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15494.803s">I</a>  was just asking a question.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15496.044s">I</a>  was in court with someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15497.165s">Of</a>  course they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15498.145s">But</a>  that doesn't worry me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15499.366s">What</a>  worries me, what concerns me, is more lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15502.209s">Because</a>  you shouldn't go to Axis and be sued like TV3 did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15504.951s">And</a>  that's what Mrs. Burke is setting up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15507.333s">And</a>  it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15508.133s">And</a>  I'm trying to facilitate programming for 60,000 people in Medford, and I want to help the candidates out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15513.037s">Mr.</a>  McKillip, Cheryl Rodriguez, Ray Scarfo, they all deserve Axis TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15517.621s">What</a>  else is happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15518.421s">The</a>  quarry thing is kind of like a stumbling block</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15524.417s">I</a>  don't find it to be scary either. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15525.478s">That's</a>  why I was just trying to get a little bit more clarification.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15528.501s">I</a>  really don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15529.262s">I</a>  can't speak for 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15543.495s">It</a>  doesn't scare me, you, but it would scare the community, and that's not right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15546.617s">It</a>  doesn't sound very scary to me, but I do appreciate Councilman Longocare bringing this matter forward, and I do appreciate Mr. Brown for being up here this evening as well, because I think he did a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15555.122s">So</a>  thank you very much, Mr. Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15557.824s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15560.566s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15566.069s">I</a>  guess you just gave it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15571.293s">Basically,</a>  I had a couple of conversations with Ben Brown, and a couple of really great conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15580.517s">I</a>  believe that Ben has a long road ahead of him in the respect of trying to get TV3 up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15586.719s">I</a>  agree with him in one respect, that there should be some modicum <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15593.242s">independence</a>  from the city, although it can't be completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15596.864s">It</a>  should be a non-profit organization with a board of directors and I believe hopefully someday we'll get there and that will help in that respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15605.069s">As</a>  far as the Corey check goes, the conversations that Ben and I had, because I believe all candidates, both incumbent and ones that are running for positions, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15615.415s">are</a>  very excited about the opportunity of Medford Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15620.696s">Am</a>  I saying it correct, Ben? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15622.136s">Medford</a>  Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15624.117s">I</a>  think everybody should be excited about it, as well as the community itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15628.277s">However,</a>  when I had those conversations, what I was asking Ben is, how do we get involved in it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15633.718s">How</a>  do we get to be a part of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15635.639s">The</a>  first conversation was based off of this contract that City Solicitor Rumley had <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15642.6s">Ben</a>  did call me and tell me that he finally got it in his hands, whatever that timeframe was. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15646.722s">And</a>  then in the next question I asked, quite specifically, how can candidates get involved now that we have some leeway? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15655.727s">And</a>  the first response was, my plan is, Dave, to try to get all the candidates to submit <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15666.333s">a</a>  film stating what they would like to project for their candidacy, and that way there he could air it the first two weeks in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15674.925s">My</a>  first question was, my God, that's so many candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15677.768s">Are</a>  you going to be able to pull this off starting the end of this week, hopefully? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15682.102s">And</a>  then my next question was specifically, well, what happens, and I'm sorry if I throw you under the bus, Councilor Marks, but what happens if Michael Marks asks, how do I get myself on TV and do a call-in show or something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15697.131s">And</a>  there was a little hemming and hawing because he wasn't quite sure of the answer as of that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15702.114s">Nowhere</a>  in that conversation did it state a Corey check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15704.816s">I</a>  think everybody here, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15706.797s">If</a>  I'm wrong, please correct me, but I think that everybody knows that a CORI check takes some time, not 24 hours, maybe not even a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15716.003s">24</a>  hours for sure? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15716.784s">Okay,</a>  so then I stand corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15720.827s">So</a>  again, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15722.228s">But</a>  that would be, you know, the first step is to get that out of the way and get everybody up and running because... <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15729.085s">If</a>  you are going to submit a copy, and we all have to be quarried on that, and we're not even in the building, that doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15737.708s">But</a>  if we are coming into the building, and it is a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15740.449s">I</a>  don't see candidates coming in once a week to start a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15745.89s">I</a>  just think it's a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15747.391s">They</a>  want to come in, and they want to present their case in the respect of how they'd like to see Medford move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15754.321s">I</a>  think that Medford has to be better than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15756.503s">I</a>  think that this hemming and hawing about Medford media has got to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15763.351s">I</a>  mean, let's just move it forward now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15765.393s">Let's</a>  stop this constant trying to find a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15770.378s">figure</a>  out how it's going to delay the process a little bit longer, a little bit longer, a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15775.379s">I</a>  think we have somebody that really wants to move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15777.9s">His</a>  vision seems in my mind to be a progressive vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15781.681s">He</a>  believes that, you know, the technology has to come to a different level. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15785.021s">There's</a>  a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15785.922s">But</a>  in the same respect, it's got to be launched and it's got to be launched now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15789.482s">And</a>  I think it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15790.903s">And</a>  I think all of the including the mayor would probably want to see everyone be able to use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15797.364s">And</a>  I and I would ask Mayor Stephanie Burke to <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15800.685s">make</a>  a comment that she can't wait to see us all get on here as well because that's really what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15806.608s">I</a>  think everybody should be able to use this and be able to show the people in Medford that may not be able to come to different events and different venues that want to sit at home or can't do anything but sit at home but want to listen and want to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15821.276s">And</a>  one of the things that surprised me more than anything else <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15824.137s">and</a>  Ben can attest to this, is how fascinating the fact that Medford residents love to watch this media. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15833.884s">They</a>  absolutely love watching it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15835.885s">So</a>  it is viable, it's incredibly important, it needs to move forward, it needs to move forward now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15841.509s">So</a>  now that we've got the contracts and anybody that wants to get involved, let's get this ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15845.692s">That's</a>  really all I can say.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15853.852s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 4th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15864.625s">So</a>  I'm not afraid of my Cori check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15866.388s">I</a>  get it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15868.41s">a</a>  very active volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School, and I'm fortunate enough to be a stay-at-home mom and able to go into the school during the school day to submit my CORI. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15877.136s">My</a>  husband, Alex, works outside the home, and he usually has to work from home or something if he wants to get his CORI. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15884.728s">because</a>  it's only offered during the school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15886.589s">So</a>  I'm concerned about possibly hours that people will be able to do quarries. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15890.291s">I'm</a>  not sure if everyone knows that you do have to submit a quarry in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15894.032s">You</a>  have to show a physical copy of your ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15897.174s">So</a>  if we wanna make sure that this is accessible, there needs to be multiple hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15903.077s">I'm</a>  not sure why if you're not coming in the building, you would need one, but just logistically speaking, it can be difficult for people to do the quarries in person if there are not evening hours, weekend hours, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15914.755s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15918.678s">President,</a>  let me just make a couple quick comments on CORI so everyone understands how CORIs work, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15924.461s">First</a>  of all, a CORI check is very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15926.603s">You</a>  fill out the paperwork, you bring in your material, obviously identification is required to ensure that you are actually the person who is being CORI checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15937.269s">That's</a>  just a safeguard. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15939.271s">You</a>  get it back in about 24 hours or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15942.332s">It's</a>  that quick, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15944.153s">Now,</a>  if you're denied employment or volunteer status on a Cori check, what happens is you then can be told why you're denied, and you have a right to appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15957.764s">Now,</a>  I can't share a Cori. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15960.165s">If</a>  I get a Cori, and I'm the person who reviews Coris in the school department, I can't share that Cori with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15965.61s">I</a>  have to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15968.171s">I'll</a>  give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15969.052s">Typically,</a>  DUI. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15971.924s">insurance</a>  violation, failure to register your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15974.886s">There's</a>  a lot of those things that show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15977.008s">Those</a>  things are not terribly important to me unless, in fact, you're driving a bus or you're doing something that might be related to the particular offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15985.734s">Obviously,</a>  substances, things of that type. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15988.697s">And</a>  when it happened, how it happened, did it happen last week, last year, or did it happen 20 years ago when you were a kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15994.921s">I</a>  mean, those things are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15997.043s">Obviously,</a>  you look at those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15998.704s">But</a>  let's say you're denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16000.501s">You</a>  have a right to get your Cory check. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16002.922s">You</a>  have a right to make it public yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16005.543s">And</a>  if you're denied for something stupid or something you think is discriminatory, you can make that public. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16011.686s">I</a>  can't, but you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16013.667s">So</a>  any issuing authority has to keep it quiet, has to look at it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16019.61s">But</a>  an individual who's affected by it has every right to protest. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16023.91s">that,</a>  in fact, that Corey was denied for some superficial reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16028.894s">So</a>  it's important to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16030.736s">So</a>  you can't discriminate just simply because, you know, I don't like you because you're a person who says things that I don't like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16037.682s">It</a>  has to be a substantive reason or a person has a right to appeal it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16042.446s">And</a>  oftentimes, people come in and they say, you know, that happened so many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16047.049s">I've</a>  been this way for so many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16048.851s">Can</a>  you give me a chance? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16050.652s">That</a>  happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16052.155s">So</a>  I just want you to understand how that process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16054.958s">Now</a>  within the school system, everybody has to be fingerprinted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16059.221s">It's</a>  an FBI job. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16061.503s">Not</a>  volunteers, but people who are employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16064.406s">Fingerprinted.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16065.827s">So</a>  there's a whole series of things that have to go on in our world. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16071.376s">It's</a>  the nature of society today. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16073.178s">People</a>  are very concerned about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16074.839s">They're</a>  very concerned about who's there, who's in contact with their young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16079.724s">And</a>  there's a lot of steps involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16080.945s">But</a>  you do have a right to protest an adverse decision on your car for each other.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16089.854s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16091.175s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16092.816s">I</a>  know it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16094.849s">If</a>  we could just get an update, I want to thank Ben for being here and answering questions as well as the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16101.071s">If</a>  we could just get an update with regards to outreach to the public to let people know that there is a process in place, how they can apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16110.413s">A</a>  lot of people don't really know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16112.654s">We've</a>  kind of bring it to light tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16116.199s">There</a>  was word that there might be a candidates clip that you're going to accept, so obviously reach out to the candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16122.001s">But</a>  with regards to the general public, if they want to become a member, if they want to do a show, want to put a tape in, what type of outreach will you be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16129.824s">Will</a>  there be a reverse 911 call?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16132.332s">So</a>  as far as the open house goes, we're going to invite the delegation from the school committee and the city council, as well as the mayor's office and other people that we can get off of lists from around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16151.307s">After</a>  that, we'll hold several nights for different groups of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16155.83s">We'll</a>  hold a night for nonprofit organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16158.012s">We'll</a>  hold a, you know, just meet and greet nights where I do plan on working with the Arts Council as well as the Chamber of Commerce to try to get the word out there as much as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16173.582s">And</a>  yeah, my hope is that that will generate enough organic <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16181.9s">response.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16182.681s">I</a>  just, as a resolve, I'd just like to see if we could put out a reverse 911 call before the open house and let people know that applications can be submitted either at the open house or in person anytime and with the hours of operation of TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16197.593s">So</a>  we can get this up and running and help Ben with his endeavor.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16418.258s">They</a>  will be adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16419.34s">My</a>  question, hopefully, is indeed inside the minutes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16424.547s">It</a>  is inside those minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16425.528s">Are</a>  you sure of that, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16426.95s">I</a>  would hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16429.874s">Clerk</a>  Finn does a very good job with his records. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16432.776s">If</a>  it's not, I'm sure, Councilor Lungo-Koehn will, I think she, Councilor Lungo-Koehn is reviewing it right as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16442.705s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16444.987s">You</a>  have another question, Mr. Castagnetti?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16447.409s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16447.849s">The</a>  rules are suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16449.711s">Can</a>  I address the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16450.892s">I</a>  wanted to make, I actually wanted to say, Honorable Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16460.328s">While</a>  I have this moment, I would like a minute to congratulate all of the seven city councilors and the seven council challengers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16470.873s">I</a>  wish you all good luck, and more importantly, good health before and after seven of the 14 are elected in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16481.498s">Also,</a>  I'd like to give a heartfelt thanks to my 499 people who voted for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16495.549s">It</a>  did me no favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16498.65s">Because</a>  now I'm in a real good place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16529.852s">This</a>  is my five key priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16533.495s">That</a>  is, number one, improve public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16545.023s">Three,</a>  encourage fiscal responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16549.406s">Four,</a>  promote responsible development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16553.568s">And</a>  my baby, number five, reduce real estate tax burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16559.485s">for</a>  unoccupied homelands by adopting the full 35% undone message of the federal law, under 59 section 5C, as it's done in the formidable Walden area, and all across the other area communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16577.991s">Finally,</a>  provide some long overdue tax relief for homelands. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16582.652s">And</a>  now I have a sixth, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16608.929s">Thank</a>  you for your attention, assistance, and public spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16611.85s">Now</a>  back to my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16616.732s">Was</a>  the question in the records, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16618.693s">Yes,</a>  it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16619.233s">Thank</a>  you very much for listening.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16621.414s">It</a>  is 17607, Mr. Kessinger. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16624.135s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16624.815s">Mr.</a>  President, while we're on to suspension, I've been asked to make the following announcement by the leaders of the <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16636.383s">There</a>  are a series of public forums coming up for surveys and input into the community preservation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16648.545s">The</a>  committee forums will be on Wednesday evening, October 4, 2017 from 7 to 9 at the Medford High School Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16657.267s">And</a>  Saturday morning, October 14, from 11 to 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16666.512s">at</a>  the Medford Senior Center, 101 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16670.115s">And</a>  to take the survey, and for further information, go to www.preservemedford.org.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16679.723s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16680.564s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16682.005s">17-644.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16682.085s">Motion</a>  to table my next four.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16685.508s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Landau-Kernan to table 17-644, 17-645, 17-646, and 17-647.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16710.483s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to be heard for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16713.445s">I've</a>  been here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16715.547s">I've</a>  been here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16717.308s">And</a>  three motions on the agenda tonight, I stayed to answer them, and they just got tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16723.353s">So</a>  I'd like to be given the courtesy of making a couple of comments, if I can, because I've issued you a couple of reports that the school committee received. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16732.319s">Maybe</a>  some people don't want to hear the facts, but nevertheless, here they are.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16735.742s">No,</a>  Mr. Superintendent, you gave them to us at 10 o'clock for us to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16740.696s">Why</a>  10 o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16741.417s">I</a>  saw you give them to Larry, the answers, at 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16746.684s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16747.005s">Can</a>  I have an opportunity to review them before my own resolution?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16749.849s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16751.21s">Your</a>  resolution was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16753.293s">I</a>  came here and stayed here.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16754.575s">But</a>  if you were here all night, why didn't you give them to us at 10 o'clock?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16757.385s">Because</a>  I gave it to everyone, but I thought you wouldn't listen to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16761.426s">I'm</a>  not going to trade with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16762.927s">But</a>  I'd like a moment as a citizen to be able to address the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16766.527s">We</a>  will not, uh, Councilor Laguna has pulled those motions, but you are free to address the council.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16773.049s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16774.53s">Just</a>  want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16775.69s">There</a>  are three reports on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16778.351s">The</a>  school committee received these reports last night, or received the update last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16785.953s">Let</a>  him speak.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16787.98s">Are</a>  we in public participation or are we in suspending the rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16793.366s">Motion</a>  to suspend the rules by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Falco, I mean by Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16800.454s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16803.077s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16803.538s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16806.798s">Tonight,</a>  on the agenda, there were items that dealt with enrollment and real estate development, and the impact upon class size, the impact upon enrollment in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16819.525s">And</a>  I think it's important that you hear this, and you are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16823.927s">I</a>  gave you reports tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16825.928s">One</a>  report was done at the beginning of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16828.89s">The</a>  second report was done this week and given to the school committee, and they had a discussion on it last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16835.853s">And</a>  I think it's important that you know this because there are some things flying around the community that are just patently not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16842.138s">And</a>  I think it's important that you know it so that when you're asked these questions in public, you can answer them truthfully and you have the statistics in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16850.765s">I'm</a>  gonna refer to the report that was given last night because I think that's the most relevant one right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16857.03s">It</a>  talks about the impact of real estate development on class size, class enrollment in the Metro Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16866.1s">And</a>  we picked eight units or eight different developments in the city with 150 or more units in it and looked at the class size impact, looked at the impact of student enrollment by school, by grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16887.454s">by</a>  different development to give you an idea of what the impact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16892.436s">And</a>  if you read it closely, you'll find that there's 105 students in eight developments that come to our public schools, 105. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16901.681s">Two</a>  of them are in outside placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16905.903s">Two</a>  of them are in outside placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16908.204s">And</a>  if you spread them out and look at it, the average class size in the elementary schools is 18.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16916.229s">That's</a>  the best in the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16917.93s">Almost</a>  the best in the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16919.731s">You</a>  should be proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16920.612s">You</a>  support the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16921.933s">The</a>  school committee supports the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16923.574s">You</a>  should be proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16925.815s">Because</a>  you've got good class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16927.136s">Because</a>  you've asked the question about class size over and over again at the various meetings that I've attended on budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16933.86s">So</a>  I think you should have that as you go into the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16936.462s">I</a>  think you should know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16938.231s">But</a>  there is a rumor going around that somewhere development is overrunning the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16944.677s">The</a>  schools are overwhelmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16945.899s">It's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16947.779s">It's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16948.5s">Go</a>  over the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16949.44s">I'm</a>  not going to go over it with you now because it's late and you can read. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16952.923s">But</a>  I think it's important that you know this as you move around the city and people ask you about development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16959.288s">Development</a>  is important to support the various initiatives, to reduce the tax rate, to do all the things that you want to do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16967.094s">And</a>  at the same time, it's a legitimate concern to determine whether or not it's going to cost you more money in your public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16973.739s">Well,</a>  right now, we're doing just fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16976.892s">Right</a>  now, you could add 155 seats to the elementary schools and still be below 20 students in a class, on average. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16986.959s">Sorry,</a>  it's a flashlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16988.961s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16989.921s">Your</a>  light? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16990.842s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16991.442s">It's</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16992.503s">I</a>  just had it so I could see. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16995.724s">you</a>  could add 500 seats and still have decent class size at this particular point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17002.31s">Now,</a>  there may be some need for some looking at distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17006.054s">One</a>  school maybe has a little bit less than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17008.656s">That's</a>  always the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17009.898s">You</a>  work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17011.599s">But</a>  you should know as a city council, you should know as the people that help to fund the budget and do development in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17020.28s">that</a>  your schools have sufficient capacity to handle additional students right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17026.244s">And</a>  we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17027.765s">You</a>  should also know that our schools are doing just fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17032.109s">And</a>  you're part of the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17033.049s">There's</a>  a lot of great programs going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17035.351s">And</a>  then you're here tonight in this auditorium, which has been renovated in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17040.955s">You're</a>  going to see any number of other additional renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17043.997s">Last</a>  night, the school committee received a report <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17047.282s">on</a>  the merger between the high school and the vocational school and the exciting programs that are taking place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17053.765s">And</a>  we welcome the opportunity when the new Bistro 49 is there to have you there and to see that and to see how the youngsters use the new resources that you have helped to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17065.23s">Last</a>  spring I came to you and I asked you to support the submission of an SOI to the School Building Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17071.953s">The</a>  School Building Authority will be in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17075.792s">on</a>  October 5 to begin their site visit to determine whether or not we can receive funding for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17082.819s">So</a>  we can look at that as another possibility of developing our schools, our programs, and moving things forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17089.783s">So</a>  a lot of good is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17091.485s">And</a>  I welcome the opportunity to share that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17093.846s">But</a>  I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell you that the discussion about overwhelmed numbers in the schools are not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17103.132s">It's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17104.633s">Look</a>  at the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17105.834s">Happy</a>  to answer any questions you have. <a

informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17117.467s">So</a>  I appreciate the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17119.168s">Thank</a>  you, and have a good night.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17127.69s">The</a>  public know that I am not one to be spreading rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17131.071s">My</a>  point of the resolutions that I'll put forward next week is that we plan and get the answers like we did tonight at 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17139.775s">I</a>  would like to just review them and hopefully I'll be able to thank whoever produced them for us next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17146.378s">But</a>  to get something at 10 when you're trying to concentrate on people in the audience, on people at the podium, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17151.858s">It's</a>  a little hard to review what you were given. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17153.719s">I</a>  have not been spreading that rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17156.32s">I</a>  believe two of our schools are close to or at capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17160.402s">That</a>  was proven this year when two classrooms had to be moved from the Roberts to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17165.745s">All</a>  I'm asking for, or I will ask for next week, is just a plan, the numbers, so that we can plan accordingly.</p>
