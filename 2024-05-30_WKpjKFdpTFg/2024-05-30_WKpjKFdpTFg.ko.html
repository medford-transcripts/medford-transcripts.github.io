    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=0.089s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 대부분 그럴 위험이 있습니다.
 그래서 약간의 역사적 맥락이 있습니다.
 많은 흑인 및 갈색 커뮤니티가 주거 분리의 대상이 되었습니다.
 이것은 여러분에게 새로운 소식이 아니지만 여러분이 읽어 볼 기회를 갖기를 원했을 뿐이며 이로 인해 자원이 줄어들고 인프라가 부적절해졌습니다.
 그래서 숫자를 보면 흑인 아이들이 천식을 앓을 가능성이 두 배 이상 높습니다.
 흑인 어린이는 천식으로 사망할 확률이 7.6배 더 높습니다.
 그리고 2021년에는 7,200만 명의 유색 인종이 오존 및/또는 입자 오염 수준이 높은 지역에 살고 있습니다.
 그래서 우리가 시리즈를 개최하는 이유와 기후 변화의 영향, 그리고 메드포드 시, 예방 사무국, 기획, 개발 및 지속 가능성 사무국에서 하는 작업 사이를 연결하면 됩니다.
 나는 항상 PDS가 무엇을 의미하는지 기억해야 합니다.
 따라서 홍수에서 폭염에 이르기까지 흑인과 갈색 어린이는 기후 관련 건강 결과의 더 큰 위험에 처해 있습니다.
 그리고 이 부서에는 건강 형평성 위원회도 있습니다. 기후 계획 담당자인 Brenda Pike가 Medford 커넥터, Charbel, Lizette, 여기에 없는 Samia, 그리고 가상의 Natasha와 함께 팀을 이끌고 있습니다.
 따라서 기후 평등(Climate Equity)은 이전에 메드포드(Medford) 시에서 제대로 대표되지 않았던 집단의 이익을 대표하는 데 초점을 두고 기후 행동 계획의 이행에 대해 도시에 조언하는 임시 위원회입니다.
 그럼 어떻게 도와드릴까요?
 환경 정의 문제에 대해 배우고 참여하고 계속 참여하십시오.
 계속해서 참여할 수 있습니다.
 우리는 이 풀업 배너를 가지고 있으며 QR 코드를 사용하여 계속 참여하거나 나 자신이나 Brenda에게 연락하여 시청에서 우리와 연결할 수 있습니다.
 그리고 그게 다입니다.
 그럼 브리타 룬드버그 박사님이 가실 거에요.
 그녀는 교통이 끔찍해요.
 그녀는 뒤처져 있기 때문에 오늘 밤 우리의 연설자로 나서 천식이 어린이에게 미치는 영향에 대해 더 깊이 있게 설명할 것입니다.
 그러니 조금만 기다려 주시기 바랍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=156.144s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 확신하는.
 응.
 좋아요.
 그래서 시간이 좀 있는 동안 나중에 저쪽에 있는 작은 시연 공간으로 오시면 거기에 휴대용 인덕션 쿡탑이 있는데, 바로 전기 쿡탑입니다.
 그리고 이것의 가장 큰 장점 중 하나는 천식에 대한 이점 외에도 몸에 열을 가하지 않는다는 것입니다.
 스토브 상단과 그 주변 영역은 팬 자체에 열을 집중시키기 때문에 전자기장을 생성합니다. 따라서 자석이 부착되는 금속 팬이 있으면 작동할 것입니다. 냄비를 데우고 나중에 보여드릴께요
 전원을 켜고 손을 얹을 수 있습니다. 금속만 가열하기 때문에 손이 데지 않습니다.
 수건을 깔고 그 위에 냄비를 올려놓고 수건으로 익히면 팬에 열이 집중되기 때문에 수건이 타지 않아요.
 따라서 믿을 수 없을 만큼 에너지 효율적이며, 에너지와 비용을 절약하고, 화재 위험도 줄여줍니다.
 그리고 천식 결과도 개선됩니다.
 그래서 그것은 큰 이점입니다.
 일반 요리 스토브와 같은 풀 사이즈 장치는 기존 스토브보다 가격이 더 비쌉니다.
 여기 이 휴대용 쿡탑은 100달러예요.
 비교적 간단합니다.
 그리고 저는 1년 동안 대부분의 요리를 이 하나로 요리했습니다.
 그리고 그것은 정말 훌륭했습니다.
 직접 시험해 보고 싶다면 메드퍼드 공공 도서관에 두 개의 인덕션 쿡탑이 있는데, 휴대용으로 사용할 수 있습니다. 도서관에서 몇 주 동안 사용해 보고 관심 있는 것이 있는지 확인할 수 있습니다. .</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=324.48s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 사람들이 관심이 있다면 커피와 핑거 푸드도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=344.099s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 하지만 기다리는 동안 알 수 있을 것 같아요.

 응, 알았어, 알았어.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=625.638s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 아까 말했듯이 오늘 아침에 보니 30분쯤 됐네요.
 그리고 저는 좀 더 바빠질 거라는 걸 알아요.
 40분 정도 걸릴 수도 있습니다.
 그리고 나는 그것에 대해 매우 현명하려고 계속 노력했습니다.
 그리고 매번 저는 적어도 몇 분 정도는 걸렸습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=639.987s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 그다지 빨리 진행되지는 않았습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=774.349s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  Sophie, how do I change the slides?
 I can change it for you.
 Oh, I can just say next slide.
 First of all, thank you all so much for coming out on a Wednesday night to hear about air pollution and climate justice and the health impacts of childhood asthma in black children, because I think this is such an incredibly important topic, and I am so glad to be here.
 Next slide.
 So just a few words about what is asthma.
 And I'm sorry, these slides are kind of far back, but I think you can see them OK.
 So it essentially is a hyper-reactivity of the airways that causes swelling, difficulty breathing.
 I'm sure that many of you in this room, I as a parent and the parent of two kids with asthma, I'm sure a lot of you
 are involuntary experts about asthma.
 And so I probably don't need to tell you too much.
 But what I do need to tell you is that there are several triggers for asthma.
 There are triggers that we can do things about, and there are triggers we can't do things about.
 The triggers we generally can't do so much about include cold air, exercise,
 viral infections, you know, that your kids are going to be exposed to or that you are exposed to.
 But tonight I'm going to talk about the things we can do things, something about.
 And I'm going to talk about who this disease is most common in.
 So it turns out, and actually it was really a pleasure to me to prepare and a bit of a shock, I have to say,
 to prepare this talk because it was somewhat of an eye-opener to me.
 I did not know all of these statistics, so I'm just going to share with you some pretty sobering statistics that I wasn't aware of.
 So as many of you know, black children have a higher risk of developing asthma than children of other racial groups.
 Black children have more than double the asthma rate, 12% versus 5.5% in other groups.
 Emergency use is much higher.
 And there's an increased asthma fatality rate.
 Now, these data are for across the country.
 They're not for Massachusetts.
 Massachusetts, it's a little lower.
 But in general, the asthma fatality rate is almost eight times higher in black children.
 Next slide.
 So that list of triggers that I put up there in the slide before this mentioned a whole bunch of triggers, mold, allergens, pollen, as I said, exercise and whatnot.
 And it mentioned smoke, but it doesn't mention what we're gonna talk about tonight, which is air pollution.
 I really feel like the NIH should list air pollution as a trigger and cause of asthma because
 the data tell us that it is.
 Air pollution in Massachusetts, according to a 2019 study by Boston College professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, showed that 15,000 cases of asthma in 2019 are due to air pollution in our state, and they're disproportionately affecting communities of color.
 But air pollution isn't just a cause and a trigger of asthma.
 It's a cause of a lot of other stuff.
 It's a cause of IQ loss in children.
 It's a cause of low birth weight among newborns.
 And, importantly, it's a cause of death.
 Worldwide, it accounts for 3 million deaths.
 It's the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world.
 And in our state, it accounts for 2,800 deaths a year, at least in this 2019 study.
 The important thing to note is that those deaths occur in every single community in Massachusetts, regardless of income, regardless of race, but they disproportionately occur among communities of color.
 And so, and the other important thing about that study is that it turns out that the
 level of particulate matter that the EPA believes is protective turned out not to be protective in that study.
 The levels that they saw health effects at were much, much lower, leading the authors to recommend much, much lower levels of pollution that should be allowed.
 Now if I just asked you what the number one trigger is in terms of houses about what the trigger for childhood asthma is, I put it on the slide, I should have asked the slide before, but actually the number one trigger
 for pediatric asthma is gas stove use in the house.
 And so that is what I'm gonna focus my talk on, but I thought I'd mention outdoor air pollution right at the get-go also.
 Next slide, please.
 Again, just reinforcing what I just said, there are disparities around who's exposed to air pollution.
 On average, nationally, people of color are exposed to 38% higher levels of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide.
 It's just a common air pollution pollutant.
 And we in the Northeast, ironically, you know, we...
 I grew up thinking, oh, we're so much more enlightened.
 No, no, no, not when it comes to air pollution.
 Actually, the disparities in the Northeast are some of the worst in the country.
 And one of the top 10 cities in terms of those disparities is Boston.
 And one of the two top 10 states in terms of locating
 sources of air pollution including things like hazardous waste facilities and biomass incinerators and natural gas infrastructure like compressor stations and oil and gas pipelines and that kind of thing.
 There are two top states in the country for that.
 One is Wisconsin and one is Massachusetts.
 So that's distressing.
 Next slide please.
 So it's important to talk about childhood asthma, because there are three really important reasons why children are more susceptible to air pollution provoked asthma.
 First of all, they breathe at a higher rate, so they take those pollutants in at a higher rate.
 Second, because they're smaller, they have a higher lung to body weight surface area, and so they absorb more of those pollutants.
 And second, they have very immature developing respiratory systems, and so they're just not equipped to handle that level of pollution.
 I was asked to speak about the interaction between climate justice and asthma, and in fact, there's a very powerful interaction.
 Climate change, whether caused by wildfire smoke, as you see on the left, or flooding, bottom right, or
 drought, any of the commonly occurring things with climate change, all increase the respiratory disease and they compound racial disparities.
 The driver of climate change is fossil fuels and oil, gas, coal, infrastructure that produces all of this air pollution that then is a driver of climate change.
 And the interesting thing is that the fossil fuels don't just cause the climate change, they also are a direct provoker of asthma themselves.
 Next slide.
 Now the great news here is that cutting air pollution has immediate effects.
 I mean, really almost immediate.
 So we see asthma rates, heart attack rates, they fall rapidly.
 Babies are born healthier.
 Next slide.
 And how do we know that?
 So this is just a bunch of studies showing this effect.
 I'm just going to focus on the second one down.
 You might remember at the Atlanta Olympics, they really limited driving and transportation
 And they made all of the local, anyone who produced any local sources of air pollution, to really ramp it down so that the air quality would be better for the Olympics.
 And a bunch of physicians thought, well, this is interesting.
 Why don't we look at asthma at the same time?
 With all of this air pollution falling, we would expect it to get better.
 It plummeted.
 And that within weeks.
 So within 17 days, they had decreased emergency room visits for childhood asthma, decreased hospitalizations.
 And it wasn't just the Atlanta Olympics.
 They saw the same thing for the Beijing Olympics, because China did the same thing.
 And they really got very, very strict about their air pollution standards.
 And they actually looked at some of the data in lung tissue, and they saw decreased inflammatory markers.
 and decreased incidence of asthma exacerbations and inflammation.
 And so seeing all that data, we can just finish up and go home, right?
 Because we've got all the answers here.
 The answer is to decrease air pollution.
 Well, unfortunately, it's not that easy.
 Next slide, please.
 This is an article that I wrote in collaboration.
 They left off my co-author, Dr. Adrian Allen, who is
 Awesome, and they, anyway, I have to bother them about this, because I just noticed this when I pulled up the article.
 They've rebranded as Commonwealth Beacons, so when they were Commonwealth, she was on there, and now she's not.
 But it's just an article about pollution inequality in the state of Massachusetts, and all the roadblocks that we have been running into in terms of communities of color being
 disproportionately impacted by locating polluting infrastructure in them, like the Peabody Peeker plant, right in a community that's a disalready
 overburdened by too much polluting infrastructure, the Weymouth Compressor Station.
 Two success stories that I should mention since Governor Healey came into office are the Long Meadow Pipeline that the DEP put the kibosh on, and a biomass incinerator in Springfield.
 So we've had some victories, but by and large,
 Regulating outdoor air pollution is a real challenge.
 So that is why I'm going to focus on indoor air pollution.
 Next slide.
 Because this is something we as individuals can do something about.
 Next slide.
 Now, you might not know this, but indoor air quality is often much, much worse than outdoor air quality.
 And that is an important thing to think about because we spend up to 90% of our time indoors, right?
 That said, the EPA has said that indoor air pollution can be anywhere from two to five to 100 times worse than outdoor air quality.
 And homes with gas stoves emit 50 to 400 times as much of a very powerful air pollutant called nitrogen dioxide that we'll talk about in a minute than homes with electric stoves.
 Next slide.
 This is an important thing to know, because asthma is the second most common chronic illness in Massachusetts.
 One in eight children in Massachusetts have it.
 And 15% of that is attributable to gas stove use next.
 That's a problem, because gas stove usage is widespread in our state.
 Over 50% of over half of the houses in Massachusetts use gas to cook, houses and apartments.
 And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, this was a study in 2017 from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health showing that gas stoves are the number one trigger for indoor asthma, number one trigger indoors for childhood asthma exacerbations.
 As we mentioned before about outdoor air pollution, this too is an equity issue.
 Lower income households are at higher risk of exposure and illness.
 Why is that?
 Because their houses and apartments tend to be smaller.
 Their ventilation, they might be older homes, they don't have as fantastic ventilation.
 Also, frankly,
 With an effort to try to get houses tighter in terms of not leaking as much and being climate friendly and that kind of thing, by making the envelope of the house tighter, you therefore cut down on the ventilation too.
 And that's another factor that isn't on the slide in terms of increasing.
 Sometimes households use that stove or oven to supplement heat.
 They're also disproportionately exposed to outdoor air pollution.
 All of that adds up to a greater asthma burden.
 Next slide.
 So some people ask me, well, why haven't I ever heard about this?
 When we first passed a policy at the Massachusetts Medical Society to just raise awareness in the general community about asthma and childhood asthma and gastrofuse, I remember going to a party after this passed.
 It was just a holiday party, and mentioning that this happened.
 And someone looked at me, and they were like, what?
 What are you talking about?
 You're the first person in the world who has ever said anything to me about this.
 Now, I have to say that since that time, that was 2019, and since doctors have started speaking up about this issue, the number of articles in the popular press has just increased exponentially.
 It was like no one talked about it before, and therefore, no one did much about it either.
 And why?
 Well, the same reason sort of is the same as what happened with cigarettes.
 The cigarette companies knew since the 1950s that smoking cigarettes was bad for people's lungs, and they also knew that it was bad for other people in the household, so-called secondhand smoke.
 Well, it was the same thing with this issue.
 This has been extensively studied since about the 1980s.
 We have had really good data showing that gas stove use is not good for people's health.
 And yet, it hasn't gotten out there.
 When the Massachusetts Medical Society passed that resolution to let the public be more aware of this association, I was actually approached by a former EPA official who thanked me for bringing this to light because she said it had just been so concerning for such a long time and it wasn't getting enough attention.
 Next slide.
 So this is just a list of the different health organizations that have now recognized the association between gas stove pollution and childhood asthma, the AMA, the American Public Health Association, Mass Medical Society.
 Next slide, please.
 So why are gas stoves a health hazard?
 And why am I calling them like the secondhand smoke of our time?
 Well, it turns out that just like cigarette smoke, they actually emit the same really powerful pollutants that cigarettes do.
 Really interesting.
 Next slide, please.
 So they produce, as cigarettes,
 Many more things than the three things I've listed here, but I'm gonna focus on these, because they actually produce hundreds of different pollutants.
 But the big ones are something called PM2.5, which is particulate matter.
 It's an air pollutant.
 It's associated with asthma, COPD, heart attack, stroke.
 Also, nitrogen dioxide, another air pollutant and respiratory irritant, and carbon monoxide,
 which many people know from carbon monoxide poisoning, which can happen in the house, but it happens whenever you light up a cigarette, you can get some carbon monoxide, and it also happens when you cook on your stove.
 Next slide, please.
 I love to talk about, I think particulate matter is super interesting.
 So what you see at the bottom of the slide there is a shaft of your hair.
 30 particles of particulate matter of this size, 2.5 microns,
 They're so small that 30 of them can fit into the diameter of a shaft of hair.
 So that's the size of pollution we're talking about.
 Why are we concerned about it?
 Because when you inhale it, it can penetrate deep into the lung where it triggers things like asthma, and then it can cross into the bloodstream from the lung
 where it can go to the heart and cause inflammation and cause things like heart attack.
 It can go up to the brain and cause inflammation and cause things like stroke.
 The important thing, it's associated with pneumonia and high blood pressure.
 The things to remember, children are especially vulnerable.
 It's especially at high levels, at stroller level.
 So when you're pushing a child along the street, that's where the particulate matter is the highest.
 And the other important thing to know is that, as I've mentioned before, risk exists at any level.
 So the EPA has given a cutoff level of what they call satisfactory, but it turns out that we see health effects down to the very lowest level.
 Next slide.
 Nitrogen dioxide.
 This is just a slide showing that the more nitrogen dioxide you have in the air, the more severe asthma reaction you're going to have.
 It's interesting that you start to get effects at about a level of 10 parts per billion.
 The safe cutoff for our EPA is 100.
 So you're allowed to be exposed to a hundred parts per billion But as you can see you get symptoms far below that and it also just lists where gas stoves versus electric stoves Tend to emit.
 I find that the most interesting thing about nitrogen dioxide when I was at a medical conference years ago one of my pulmonologist colleagues brought a really interesting contraption into the conference and I
 and he had collected some really polluted air outside, just right outside the convention center, the air that we had been breathing until we walked in to go to this seminar.
 And he brought it into the convention center, and he said, I have this really cool machine where I breathe it in, and then when I exhale, it can show all the different pollutants that are in the air that I've just breathed out.
 So you guys can see the pollution in the air that I'm breathing in, and then in the air that I'm breathing out.
 And actually, this data has been around since the 1960s.
 There's an article in Nature that shows this happening back then, too.
 And so he breathed in this extremely polluted air from outside.
 And when he breathed out, how much nitrogen dioxide was in what he breathed out?
 Nothing.
 And what does that mean?
 That means it's all in your lungs.
 So he was nicely filtering it for the rest of us.
 So think about that.
 And that's why these kids are so affected.
 They're really little.
 They're breathing in all of these super irritants, and they're staying in their lungs.
 Next slide.
 So, it's sort of a recurrent theme now.
 Children are exposed both to outdoor and indoor air pollution.
 So, they're cumulative and that's something to remember too.
 And again, the predominant source indoors is your gas stove.
 Next slide.
 And often, indoor emissions from gas stoves exceed outside, outdoor regulatory standards.
 Incredibly, there are no indoor air pollution standards for any pollutant whatsoever.
 It isn't regulated.
 Next slide, please.
 Very important slide.
 Gas stoves, if you don't use ventilation, if you have a house or an apartment that's less than 1,500 square feet, the nitrogen dioxide in your house is going to exceed regulatory standards 83% of the time.
 If you have a home or an apartment less than 1,000 square feet and you don't use ventilation, it's going to exceed regulatory standards
 all the time, 100% of the time.
 Next slide.
 Does cooking with gas increase asthma risk?
 Yes, it does, 42%.
 Next slide.
 And the other really important thing to know, that just again, this data is just fresh from the last year, is that even when the stove isn't turned on, gas stoves leak.
 And they leak bad stuff.
 They don't just leak methane.
 There was an article in the Boston Globe the other day about a woman
 She lived in Dorchester and her little dog was lying on the sofa and it died because her gas stove was leaking methane and methane is an asphyxiant gas.
 You go to Wikipedia and it says methane is an innocuous asphyxiant gas and I was like, well, innocuous means not harmful and asphyxiant means that you die from not being able to breathe and so you can't really say that it's both.
 But it leaks.
 Do you want me to wrap up?
 Is it, okay, okay.
 So another, so in addition to methane, which is an asphyxiant, killed the poor little puppy, but they don't just leak methane, they leak other stuff.
 They leak something called benzene, which is a known cause of cancer.
 It, like particulate matter, there's no safe level, it affects the nervous system, can cause birth defects, and it also leaks a bunch of other chemicals.
 Next slide.
 And by the way, it doesn't matter how expensive your stove is.
 The cheapest stoves and the most expensive stoves leak.
 And this is just an interesting slide.
 So some people say, well, how do I know that I won't get all of these pollutants if I cook on an electric stove?
 So this is a study showing whenever you burn anything, you're going to get some particulate matter.
 But it's interesting that when you cook with gas, you get a lot more particulate matter, and you also get all those other pollutants, the nitrogen dioxide, the VOCs, which is benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide.
 Next slide.
 The health cost, asthma costs on the order of like $80 billion in the US annually.
 If you break that down to a per person per family cost for what you'll spend on asthma in a year, it comes out to some like $3,200 a year.
 What's the cost of an electric stove?
 Like $500 to $1,000.
 So when you think about the health cost to society versus the cost of changing out that stove, maybe it's something to think about when your stove's ready to die.
 Next slide.
 I just thought I'd quote a bunch of interesting data that just came out like two weeks ago from a really great article in Science from both Harvard and Stanford researchers.
 And they looked at both, because many people, there's another article that I quoted in there that I wrote a couple years ago.
 People wrote to me afterwards saying, but what about propane gas?
 Because we cook with propane gas, and is that as bad as methane gas, which most of us have?
 And it turns out, yes, it is.
 And they looked at the US as a whole, and they found that the pediatric asthma cases due to the nitrogen dioxide from gas and propane stoves is like 50,000 a year across the US.
 But if you look at all the pollutants we just talked about, the benzene and the carbon monoxide and the nitrogen dioxide, it's more like 200,000 cases of pediatric asthma a year.
 So that is a whopping number.
 Mortality, they made a mortality estimate.
 They said up to 19,000 adult deaths annually from gas stove use in the U.S.
 pretty a whopping, and what's the mortality cost of that?
 They said on the order of a billion dollars a year in the US, and actually then they broke it down to communities of color, and they found that the price tag was even higher.
 The most concerning thing actually to me about this study was that they didn't just look at levels of these pollutants in the kitchen.
 They went all over the house and they found that the levels of pollutants in the bedrooms were equally as elevated and they stayed elevated for hours after the gas stove was used.
 So something else to think about.
 Next slide.
 So what can we do about it?
 Does ventilation help reduce nitrogen dioxide levels?
 And the answer is a definite maybe.
 It works if you use it.
 I'm one of those people who, I didn't know this data till I was, till about 2017 or later.
 And so in the winter when my kids were little, I used to put,
 my ventilation like leaked like a sieve and you know this is Massachusetts it's cold so I've thought I was being really smart and I covered it with plastic, so that I wouldn't get a ton of cold air coming right through the vent from the outside.
 And then my kids got asthma, and then I started reading about this data, and I thought, gosh, you know, I'm gonna take the cover, all that plastic I put on in the winter, off of my vent.
 And I didn't even run it that much, but because it created a constant draft, at the end of, my son was a big runner, and at the end of his cross country season, I was like, you know, I'm never at the end of the race, so I haven't seen you using your inhaler,
 How many times did you use it this season?
 And he was like, I didn't use it this season.
 But the problem with ventilation is people don't like to use it.
 I found at the end, right before our gas stove died, and I became more and more concerned.
 I have to let you know that one of the researchers who carried out that Harvard study I mentioned, she uses an N95 mask when she cooks on her gas stove.
 I don't think I could do that, because anyway, I don't think I could do that.
 But I did start running my fan every single time I ran my gas stove.
 And I noticed that the whole kitchen just cleared out.
 Like I wanted quiet in the kitchen and I just turned on that fan, my husband was gone, the kids were gone, no one was in the kitchen, no one likes using the fan.
 So that's a real problem is compliance.
 People just don't use it, they don't like it, it's annoying, it's loud.
 But it does work as long as it vents to the outside.
 If it doesn't vent to the outside, if it's one of those fans that just recirculates things in the kitchen, those ones can actually end up with levels of pollution higher than what you started out with.
 So those are really not good.
 And then if you don't have a fan that goes to the outside, open a window.
 Opening a window works great.
 Next slide.
 And so this is just a whole bunch of recommendations to install a carbon monoxide detector.
 I recommend getting a pretty expensive one.
 I didn't get an expensive one.
 And our heat exchanger on our gas furnace died and melted.
 And we ended up having carbon monoxide all over the house.
 And our monitor never picked it up.
 I smelled the weird burning smell, and I called the gas company.
 And my family was like, what's the problem?
 Well, the levels were really, really high.
 That was the problem.
 Opening a window, cooking on the back burners, using other electric appliances like a toaster oven or a kettle, a plug-in induction stove, and then ultimately, when you can and if you can, switching to an electric or an induction stove.
 Next slide.
 So the proof in a lot of medical studies is, well, when you take whatever you think is causing a medical condition away, does it get better?
 This is a really nice study in Ecuador showing that replacing gas stoves with induction stoves reduced markedly emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
 Next slide.
 And right now, there was also a study in the Bronx that showed the same thing.
 And now we have a study ongoing in collaboration with the BU School of Public Health in Dorchester, where they are looking at the environmental and health effects of replacing a gas stove with an electric one.
 Now I should just mention, it's very interesting in the Bronx study, I don't have the data up here,
 But it only reduced the air pollutants in the air by about 30%.
 But I showed you in the earlier slide of gas stoves versus electric stoves, you know, when you go to an electric stove, it should take all of those air pollutants out.
 And I think
 that tells us that the problem is in communities of color, if you take away the indoor air pollution, you still have the problem, which is that the outdoor air pollution didn't go away.
 And so this gets at some of the problem, but we still have to face that whole problem.
 Next slide.
 So just a few takeaways.
 Now you know gas stoves are the number one trigger for asthma and an indoor trigger in the state of Massachusetts.
 And communities of color are disproportionately and unfairly burdened by that.
 What can we do to stop those negative health effects?
 You can vent your stovetop emissions, but remember, they have to vent outside.
 You can't just recirculate them.
 Open your windows.
 Keep the children, elderly people, people with asthma away from the stove while you're cooking.
 I think a really important part of this, too, obviously is going to happen at the policy level.
 This isn't mentioned much, but one thing I'm kind of passionate about is, you know,
 There's external ventilation required for hot water heaters and your gas dryer.
 You wouldn't think of venting that inside, right?
 Or your gas furnace.
 You wouldn't think of venting that inside.
 Gas stoves used to vent outside.
 And at some point,
 In the last 40 years, that changed.
 And so I feel very strongly that gas stoves should vent outside.
 I think putting a warning label on stoves.
 There's a warning label on my hairdryer, like do not drop this into a tub when you're using it because there's a risk of electric shock.
 I don't think 19,000 people die every year in the US because they've dropped their hair dryer in a bathtub and gotten an electric shock, and yet there's a label on it.
 But 19,000 people a year die from gas stove exposure and there's no label on it.
 Where does that square up?
 Dozen.
 And then, obviously, replacing a gas stove with an electric or an induction when you need a new one.
 And then, most importantly, I think, is regulating air pollution, outdoor air pollution.
 Because yes, you can get rid of indoor air pollution, but if you don't regulate the outdoor one, and say, enforce the roadmap law that was just passed in Massachusetts a year and a half ago,
 saying that we shouldn't be locating dirty incinerators and power plants, et cetera, in communities of color that are already overburdened by all of those.
 It's time to make that all happen.
 And that's all I have.
 I have some resources, next slide.
 And then next slide, more resources.
 So I'm happy to share those with you afterwards.
 I don't, I should have brought a handout, but I didn't.
 And I'm happy to take any questions.
 You're all probably in shock.
 You're like, oh no, the gas stove.
 I love the gas stove.
 I love gas stoves too.
 But you get used to electric.
 Yes.
 So do you want to take her the mic?
 Yeah.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2874.514s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 가스렌지와 천식에 미치는 영향에 대해 말씀하셨는데요.
 난방 시스템은 어떻습니까? 그리고 때로는 대부분의 집주인이 업데이트하지 않고 그을음으로 가득 찬 파이프도 있습니다.
 실제로 환풍기 상단에서 먼지가 퍼지는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그래서 그것은 또 다른 문제입니다.
 큰 아들인 저는 이 문제로 고통받았습니다. 저는 이 문제가 있는 아파트에 살았는데 그의 눈 주위에 다크서클이 나타났습니다.
 의사들이 환기장치에 관련된 사항을 언급했지만 확답도 마음에 들지도 않았으며,
 이 아파트에서 이사하는 데 필요한 일이라면 무엇이든 먼저 시작하세요. 아시죠?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2928.187s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 네, 확실히 큰 문제인 것 같아요. 가스렌지뿐만 아니라 가스난로도 마찬가지니까요.
 가스 난로가 있었는데 아마 새는 것 같았어요
 깨닫기 전까지 6개월 동안 일산화탄소를 복용했는데, 저는 두통이 전혀 생기지 않았고 매일 두통이 생겼다는 걸 깨달았습니다.
 나, 내 눈, 내 눈의 흰자위가 주사를 맞은 것 같았고, 빨개졌는데, 이상하게도, 난, 알다시피, 나는 항상 피곤했고, 결코 피곤하지 않았습니다.
 그리고
 나중에 깨달았습니다. 맙소사, 내 가스 난로에서 이 모든 물질이 방출되었기 때문에 만성적인 일산화탄소 노출로 고통받고 있었습니다.
 가스 난로는 스토브에서 누출이 발생하는 것처럼 누출될 수 있습니다.
 온수기 역시 마찬가지다.
 그들은 또한 매사추세츠 전역의 주택에서 가스 누출에 대한 연구를 하고 있는데, 저번에 연구의 일환으로 누군가 집에 왔는데, 그 사람이 모니터를 온수기 위에 올려 놓았고, 가스 냄새가 났어요. 온수기에서, 그리고 물론,
 가스가 새고 있어서 수리받았습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2990.671s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2994.014s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 다른 질문이 있나요?
 부끄러워하지 마세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3002.02s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 그래서 백버너 사용에 관해 질문이 생겼습니다.
 당신이 더 멀리 떨어져 있기 때문이고 환기가 그것과 관련이 있습니까?
 집에 있는 게 아니라 밖에 나가는 거야?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3019.427s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 내 추측으로는 무엇보다도 오염 물질로부터 멀리 떨어져 있기 때문에 제대로 이해하지 못하는 것 같습니다.
 둘째, 스토브 위에 후드가 달린 통풍구를 사용하면 위로 올라갑니다.
 그들은 더 잘 작동합니다.
 백 버너에서 더 잘 작동합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3039.717s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 다른 질문이 있나요?
 내 질문은 그렇지 않다 이다
 그것은 매사추세츠뿐만 아니라 모든 곳에서 우리가 가지고 있는 가스 스토브의 양입니다.
 훨씬 더 큽니다. 전기 스토브보다 훨씬 더 큽니다.
 가격 때문이 아닌가?
 전기가 가스보다 비싸다?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3064.654s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 아마도 그것과 관련이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니까?
 또한,
 하지만 그게 전부는 아니죠?
 이야기의 다른 부분은 무엇입니까?
 그것은 많이 판매되었습니다.
 제가 막 결혼했을 때 친구들과 이야기를 나누고 있었는데 모두가 '오'라고 말했던 기억이 납니다.
 셰프들이 모두 나와서 '아, 가스로 요리하는 게 훨씬 맛있다'고 하더라고요.
 그리고 그들은 누구에게서 돈을 받았나요?
 미국가스협회.
 그래서 어느 시점에는 가격대가 있었을 수도 있습니다.
 전기 스토브와 가스 스토브의 차이점과 스토브 작동에 드는 비용이 실제로 다르다고 말할 수는 없습니다.
 응, 하지만 병원비가 얼마나 절약되는지 생각해봐.
 응.
 응.
 한때는 그랬을 수도 있겠지만 지금은 효율성이 높아지고 있는 것 같아요.
 내가 말했듯이, 나는 최신 모델을 가지고 있지만 그렇지 않습니다. 인덕션은 매우 효율적이고 매우 효율적이며 전자기파를 사용합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3171.211s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 예, 이와 같은 인덕션 쿡탑은 기존 전기 스토브로 작동하는 데 드는 비용의 약 절반 정도라고 덧붙이고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3180.374s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 그리고 스토브 전체를 구입할 필요는 없습니다.
 당신은 그녀가 바로 거기에 전시되어 있는 단일 버너를 구입할 수 있습니다.
 그렇게 하면 가스레인지를 사용하지 않고도 얼마나 많은 일을 할 수 있는지 놀라울 정도입니다.
 응.
 다른 질문이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3202.212s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 응.
 마이크를 사용해야 해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3207.232s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 나는 이것이 유색 인종 공동체에 대한 경제적 부담과 같은 맥락이라고 생각합니다.
 그럼 자원은 어떻게 있나요?
 가스 스토브에서 전기 스토브로 업그레이드하는 데 비용이 얼마나 들까? Dorchester 시와 BU에서 공중 보건을 위한 프로그램이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 그럴 만한 자원이 있을까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3228.056s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 훌륭한 질문입니다.
 저는 정부 프로그램, 매사추세츠 프로그램, 대량 할인, 인덕션이나 전기 스토브 또는 인덕션 구매 시 500달러 할인이 있다고 믿습니다.
 좋아요.
 응.
 그렇습니다.
 그리고 실제로 난방 방식을 전기 방식으로 바꾸고 싶다면 열 펌프로 바꾸는 것도 좋습니다.
 거기도 할인이 있어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3260.573s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 감사합니다.
 정말 훌륭한 프레젠테이션이었습니다.
 귀하와 Brenda에게 인덕션 가격과 MassSave 프로그램 작동 방식에 대해 이야기해 주실 수 있나요?
 따라서 바로 구매하고 싶거나 MassSave를 통해 진행하려는 경우.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3275.584s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 감사해요.
 네, 그래서 이런 휴대용 인덕션 쿡탑의 가격은 100달러가 조금 넘습니다.
 인덕션 쿡탑을 갖춘 풀사이즈 스토브는 일반 스토브보다 가격이 더 비쌉니다.
 $1,000 더 비쌀 수 있지만 $500의 대량 절약 리베이트를 적용하면 $500 더 비쌉니다.
 이렇게 휴대용 인덕션 쿡탑으로 1년 동안 요리를 했어요.
 여러 개의 버너를 사용해야 할 때 가끔 가스레인지를 백업용으로 사용했지만 거의 1년 동안만 이 작업을 수행할 수 있었습니다.
 아, 이건 Amazon에서 샀는데 Home Depot이나 Best Buy 같은 곳이나 죄송해요, Best Buy 같은 곳에서 꽤 살 수 있을 것 같아요.
 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3337.317s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 좋은 질문입니다.
 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3341.139s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 또 다른 질문이 있습니다.
 예.
 요리를 위해 특별한 냄비를 구입해야 합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3346.602s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 그것도 좋은 질문이고, 브렌다가 그것에 대해 더 자세히 말해 줄 수 있을 거라 확신합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3351.404s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 응.
 죄송합니다. 그냥 서 있어야겠습니다.
 따라서 냄비는 자성을 띠어야 합니다. 왜냐하면 이것이 작동하는 방식은 냄비 안의 금속만 가열하는 자기장을 생성하기 때문입니다.
 따라서 스테인레스 스틸, 주철, 내부에 금속과 같은 세라믹이 있으면 작동합니다.
 하지만 구리나 유리 같은 것에는 작동하지 않습니다.
 하지만 기본적으로 조리기구를 시험해 볼 수 있습니다.
 자석이 있으면 조리기구를 테스트해 보세요.
 붙어 있으면 작동합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3384.55s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 정말 좋은 질문이에요.
 그래서 우리는 실제로 인덕션이 아닌 전기를 선택했습니다. 왜냐하면 남편은 제가 가장 좋아하는 냄비를 자석으로 테스트했는데 자석이 아니어서 포기하지 않을 거라 하더군요. 그래서 네, 정말 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3424.537s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 감사합니다, 룬드버그 박사님.
 인덕션 스토브 사용법을 배우고 싶다면 Brenda가 바로 와서 사용법을 알려드릴 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3514.278s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 응, 물론이지.
 네, 기본적으로 저희 웹사이트에 올려두었고 여러분이 저희와 소통할 수 있도록 공개되어 있습니다.
 그건 나중에 줄게요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3526.563s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 전적으로.
 응, 응.
 어때요?
 엄청난.
 그렇다면 당신은 USDA와 협력합니까, 아니면 그렇습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3586.032s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 응, 내가 무슨 방해를 받고 있는 거지?
 내 말은, 당신은 무엇을 할 건가요?
 잠깐, 뭐?
 그리고 그것은 큰 문제도 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3602.101s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: QR 코드, 거기에도 코드가 있나요?
 응, 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3615.849s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 하지만 부모님이 가스를 갖고 계시기 때문에 그 정보를 얻고 싶습니다.
 그리고 나는 어-어.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3626.094s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 그것이 내가 말하는 것입니다.
 100달러 정도지만 가족이 있어요.
 가스는 어떻게 구하실 건가요?
 이건 정말,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3714.309s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 실제 진행 중인 작업을 지원해 주시길 바랍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3744.594s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 난 모두가 자기 일을 하길 바랐어요. 아시죠?
 게다가 나처럼 모든 사람에게 말해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3786.271s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 나는 갈 필요가 없습니다.
 네, 알아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3855.234s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 사랑해요.
 사랑해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3936.488s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 그래서 저는 단지 점들을 연결하고 있는 것뿐입니다.
 나는 진실을 말하고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4012.694s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4037.542s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4038.262s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4067.441s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 너희들은 정말 멋지다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4103.891s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 알고 보니 그곳은 대도시였다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4135.36s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4163.72s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 제가 사람들처럼 느껴지기 때문에 시리아만 말하면 그곳에 가지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4169.123s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 그러나 그들이 특별히 그들을 향한 것이라면 그들은 심지어 그것에 대해 이야기할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4172.365s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 아시다시피, 그곳은 더 좋은 지역입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4175.186s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 아시다시피, 그것은 일반 대중에게 보내는 좋은 메시지입니다.
 나도 그러고 싶지만 보통 여성이라면 나에게 다가와서 '우리에겐 시리아가 있고, 우리는 그 일을 하고 있다'고 말할 것입니다.
 지금부터 10년?
 조금씩, 사람들이 그것에 대해 이야기하기 시작할 것이기 때문입니다. 특히 지금처럼 말이죠.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4206.691s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 사람들은 내년부터 그것에 대해 이야기하기 시작할 것입니다.
 우리는 더 많은 사람을 갖게 될 것입니다.
 그게 내가 가진 전부입니다.
 딱 한 줄 외웠어요.</p>
