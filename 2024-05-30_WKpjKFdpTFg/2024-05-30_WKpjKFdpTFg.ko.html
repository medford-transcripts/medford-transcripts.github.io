    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=0.089s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 대부분 위험합니다.
 역사적 맥락이 있습니다.
 많은 흑인과 갈색 커뮤니티가 주거 분리의 대상이되었습니다.
 이것은 당신에게 뉴스가 아니지만, 자원의 감소와 부적절한 인프라에 대한 기회를 얻을 수있는 기회를 원했습니다.
 따라서 숫자를 볼 때 흑인 어린이는 천식이있을 가능성이 두 배 이상입니다.
 흑인 아이들은 천식으로 사망 할 확률이 7.6 배 더 높습니다.
 그리고 2021 년에는 7,200 만 명의 색채가 높은 수준의 오존 및 입자 오염 지역에 살고 있습니다.
 따라서 우리가 시리즈를 개최하는 이유와 기후 변화의 영향과 Medford시, 예방 사무소 및 계획, 개발 및 지속 가능성 사무소에서하는 일 사이를 연결할 때.
 나는 항상 PDS의 의미를 기억해야합니다.
 따라서 홍수에서 열파에 이르기까지 흑인과 갈색 어린이는 기후 관련 건강 결과의 위험이 더 큽니다.
 또한 우리는 또한이 부서에서 우리의 기후 플래너 인 Brenda Pike 인 Health Equity Council을 보유하고 있습니다. 기후 플래너 인 Brenda Pike는 Medford 커넥터, Charbel, Lizette, Samia, 여기에없는 Natasha와 함께 그 팀을 이끌고 있습니다.
 따라서 기후 형평성은 Medford시의 이전에 과소 평가 된 그룹의 이익을 나타내는 데 중점을 둔 기후 행동 계획의 이행에 대해 도시에 조언 할 임시위원회입니다.
 그래서 어떻게 도울 수 있습니까?
 환경 정의 문제에 대해 배우고 참여하고 계속 참여하십시오.
 당신은 계속 참여할 수 있습니다.
 우리는이 풀업 배너를 가지고 있으며 QR 코드를 사용하면 그와 약혼하거나 나 자신이나 Brenda에게 연락을 취하고 시청에서 우리와 연결할 수 있습니다.
 그리고 그게 다야.
 그래서 나는 브리타 룬드버그 박사가 그녀의 길에있을 것입니다.
 그녀는 교통량이 끔찍하다.
 그녀는 뒤에서 달려 가고 있지만 오늘 밤 우리의 화자가 될 것이며 천식이 아이들에게 미치는 영향에 대해 더 깊이 갈 것입니다.
 그래서 나는 단지 약간의 인내를 요구할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=156.144s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 확신하는.
 응.
 좋아요.
 그래서 우리는 시간이있는 동안, 당신이 나중에 저기 우리의 작은 데모 영역에 오면 당신이 당신이 나중에, 우리는 전기 요리사 인 휴대용 유도 쿡탑이 있습니다.
 그리고 천식의 이점과 더불어 그것에 대한 가장 큰 장점 중 하나는 그것이 가열하지 않는다는 것입니다.
 스토브 상단과 주변의 영역은 팬 자체에 열을 초점을 맞추기 때문에 전자기장을 만들기 때문에 자석이 부착 될 금속 팬이 있으면 그 일에만 작동합니다. 냄비를 데우면 나중에 보여줄 수 있습니다.
 나는 그것을 켜고 손을 입을 수 있습니다. 금속 만 가열하기 때문에 손을 태우지 않습니다.
 나는 수건을 내려 놓고 수건 위에 냄비를 넣고 수건을 통해 요리 할 수 ​​있으며 팬에 열을 집중하기 때문에 수건을 태우지 않습니다.
 따라서 엄청나게 에너지 효율적이며, 에너지를 절약하고, 돈을 절약하며, 화재의 위험을 줄입니다.
 그리고 천식 결과도 향상됩니다.
 그래서 그것은 큰 이점입니다.
 일반 쿡 스토브와 같은 풀 사이즈 유닛은 전통적인 스토브보다 비싸다.
 이 휴대용 쿡탑은 $ 100입니다.
 비교적 간단합니다.
 그리고 나는 1 년 동안 요리의 대부분을 위해 요리했습니다.
 그리고 정말 좋았습니다.
 직접 시도해 보려면 Medford Public Library에는 두 개의 유도 쿡탑이 있습니다. .</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=774.349s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  Sophie, how do I change the slides?
 I can change it for you.
 Oh, I can just say next slide.
 First of all, thank you all so much for coming out on a Wednesday night to hear about air pollution and climate justice and the health impacts of childhood asthma in black children, because I think this is such an incredibly important topic, and I am so glad to be here.
 Next slide.
 So just a few words about what is asthma.
 And I'm sorry, these slides are kind of far back, but I think you can see them OK.
 So it essentially is a hyper-reactivity of the airways that causes swelling, difficulty breathing.
 I'm sure that many of you in this room, I as a parent and the parent of two kids with asthma, I'm sure a lot of you
 are involuntary experts about asthma.
 And so I probably don't need to tell you too much.
 But what I do need to tell you is that there are several triggers for asthma.
 There are triggers that we can do things about, and there are triggers we can't do things about.
 The triggers we generally can't do so much about include cold air, exercise,
 viral infections, you know, that your kids are going to be exposed to or that you are exposed to.
 But tonight I'm going to talk about the things we can do things, something about.
 And I'm going to talk about who this disease is most common in.
 So it turns out, and actually it was really a pleasure to me to prepare and a bit of a shock, I have to say,
 to prepare this talk because it was somewhat of an eye-opener to me.
 I did not know all of these statistics, so I'm just going to share with you some pretty sobering statistics that I wasn't aware of.
 So as many of you know, black children have a higher risk of developing asthma than children of other racial groups.
 Black children have more than double the asthma rate, 12% versus 5.5% in other groups.
 Emergency use is much higher.
 And there's an increased asthma fatality rate.
 Now, these data are for across the country.
 They're not for Massachusetts.
 Massachusetts, it's a little lower.
 But in general, the asthma fatality rate is almost eight times higher in black children.
 Next slide.
 So that list of triggers that I put up there in the slide before this mentioned a whole bunch of triggers, mold, allergens, pollen, as I said, exercise and whatnot.
 And it mentioned smoke, but it doesn't mention what we're gonna talk about tonight, which is air pollution.
 I really feel like the NIH should list air pollution as a trigger and cause of asthma because
 the data tell us that it is.
 Air pollution in Massachusetts, according to a 2019 study by Boston College professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, showed that 15,000 cases of asthma in 2019 are due to air pollution in our state, and they're disproportionately affecting communities of color.
 But air pollution isn't just a cause and a trigger of asthma.
 It's a cause of a lot of other stuff.
 It's a cause of IQ loss in children.
 It's a cause of low birth weight among newborns.
 And, importantly, it's a cause of death.
 Worldwide, it accounts for 3 million deaths.
 It's the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world.
 And in our state, it accounts for 2,800 deaths a year, at least in this 2019 study.
 The important thing to note is that those deaths occur in every single community in Massachusetts, regardless of income, regardless of race, but they disproportionately occur among communities of color.
 And so, and the other important thing about that study is that it turns out that the
 level of particulate matter that the EPA believes is protective turned out not to be protective in that study.
 The levels that they saw health effects at were much, much lower, leading the authors to recommend much, much lower levels of pollution that should be allowed.
 Now if I just asked you what the number one trigger is in terms of houses about what the trigger for childhood asthma is, I put it on the slide, I should have asked the slide before, but actually the number one trigger
 for pediatric asthma is gas stove use in the house.
 And so that is what I'm gonna focus my talk on, but I thought I'd mention outdoor air pollution right at the get-go also.
 Next slide, please.
 Again, just reinforcing what I just said, there are disparities around who's exposed to air pollution.
 On average, nationally, people of color are exposed to 38% higher levels of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide.
 It's just a common air pollution pollutant.
 And we in the Northeast, ironically, you know, we...
 I grew up thinking, oh, we're so much more enlightened.
 No, no, no, not when it comes to air pollution.
 Actually, the disparities in the Northeast are some of the worst in the country.
 And one of the top 10 cities in terms of those disparities is Boston.
 And one of the two top 10 states in terms of locating
 sources of air pollution including things like hazardous waste facilities and biomass incinerators and natural gas infrastructure like compressor stations and oil and gas pipelines and that kind of thing.
 There are two top states in the country for that.
 One is Wisconsin and one is Massachusetts.
 So that's distressing.
 Next slide please.
 So it's important to talk about childhood asthma, because there are three really important reasons why children are more susceptible to air pollution provoked asthma.
 First of all, they breathe at a higher rate, so they take those pollutants in at a higher rate.
 Second, because they're smaller, they have a higher lung to body weight surface area, and so they absorb more of those pollutants.
 And second, they have very immature developing respiratory systems, and so they're just not equipped to handle that level of pollution.
 I was asked to speak about the interaction between climate justice and asthma, and in fact, there's a very powerful interaction.
 Climate change, whether caused by wildfire smoke, as you see on the left, or flooding, bottom right, or
 drought, any of the commonly occurring things with climate change, all increase the respiratory disease and they compound racial disparities.
 The driver of climate change is fossil fuels and oil, gas, coal, infrastructure that produces all of this air pollution that then is a driver of climate change.
 And the interesting thing is that the fossil fuels don't just cause the climate change, they also are a direct provoker of asthma themselves.
 Next slide.
 Now the great news here is that cutting air pollution has immediate effects.
 I mean, really almost immediate.
 So we see asthma rates, heart attack rates, they fall rapidly.
 Babies are born healthier.
 Next slide.
 And how do we know that?
 So this is just a bunch of studies showing this effect.
 I'm just going to focus on the second one down.
 You might remember at the Atlanta Olympics, they really limited driving and transportation
 And they made all of the local, anyone who produced any local sources of air pollution, to really ramp it down so that the air quality would be better for the Olympics.
 And a bunch of physicians thought, well, this is interesting.
 Why don't we look at asthma at the same time?
 With all of this air pollution falling, we would expect it to get better.
 It plummeted.
 And that within weeks.
 So within 17 days, they had decreased emergency room visits for childhood asthma, decreased hospitalizations.
 And it wasn't just the Atlanta Olympics.
 They saw the same thing for the Beijing Olympics, because China did the same thing.
 And they really got very, very strict about their air pollution standards.
 And they actually looked at some of the data in lung tissue, and they saw decreased inflammatory markers.
 and decreased incidence of asthma exacerbations and inflammation.
 And so seeing all that data, we can just finish up and go home, right?
 Because we've got all the answers here.
 The answer is to decrease air pollution.
 Well, unfortunately, it's not that easy.
 Next slide, please.
 This is an article that I wrote in collaboration.
 They left off my co-author, Dr. Adrian Allen, who is
 Awesome, and they, anyway, I have to bother them about this, because I just noticed this when I pulled up the article.
 They've rebranded as Commonwealth Beacons, so when they were Commonwealth, she was on there, and now she's not.
 But it's just an article about pollution inequality in the state of Massachusetts, and all the roadblocks that we have been running into in terms of communities of color being
 disproportionately impacted by locating polluting infrastructure in them, like the Peabody Peeker plant, right in a community that's a disalready
 overburdened by too much polluting infrastructure, the Weymouth Compressor Station.
 Two success stories that I should mention since Governor Healey came into office are the Long Meadow Pipeline that the DEP put the kibosh on, and a biomass incinerator in Springfield.
 So we've had some victories, but by and large,
 Regulating outdoor air pollution is a real challenge.
 So that is why I'm going to focus on indoor air pollution.
 Next slide.
 Because this is something we as individuals can do something about.
 Next slide.
 Now, you might not know this, but indoor air quality is often much, much worse than outdoor air quality.
 And that is an important thing to think about because we spend up to 90% of our time indoors, right?
 That said, the EPA has said that indoor air pollution can be anywhere from two to five to 100 times worse than outdoor air quality.
 And homes with gas stoves emit 50 to 400 times as much of a very powerful air pollutant called nitrogen dioxide that we'll talk about in a minute than homes with electric stoves.
 Next slide.
 This is an important thing to know, because asthma is the second most common chronic illness in Massachusetts.
 One in eight children in Massachusetts have it.
 And 15% of that is attributable to gas stove use next.
 That's a problem, because gas stove usage is widespread in our state.
 Over 50% of over half of the houses in Massachusetts use gas to cook, houses and apartments.
 And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, this was a study in 2017 from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health showing that gas stoves are the number one trigger for indoor asthma, number one trigger indoors for childhood asthma exacerbations.
 As we mentioned before about outdoor air pollution, this too is an equity issue.
 Lower income households are at higher risk of exposure and illness.
 Why is that?
 Because their houses and apartments tend to be smaller.
 Their ventilation, they might be older homes, they don't have as fantastic ventilation.
 Also, frankly,
 With an effort to try to get houses tighter in terms of not leaking as much and being climate friendly and that kind of thing, by making the envelope of the house tighter, you therefore cut down on the ventilation too.
 And that's another factor that isn't on the slide in terms of increasing.
 Sometimes households use that stove or oven to supplement heat.
 They're also disproportionately exposed to outdoor air pollution.
 All of that adds up to a greater asthma burden.
 Next slide.
 So some people ask me, well, why haven't I ever heard about this?
 When we first passed a policy at the Massachusetts Medical Society to just raise awareness in the general community about asthma and childhood asthma and gastrofuse, I remember going to a party after this passed.
 It was just a holiday party, and mentioning that this happened.
 And someone looked at me, and they were like, what?
 What are you talking about?
 You're the first person in the world who has ever said anything to me about this.
 Now, I have to say that since that time, that was 2019, and since doctors have started speaking up about this issue, the number of articles in the popular press has just increased exponentially.
 It was like no one talked about it before, and therefore, no one did much about it either.
 And why?
 Well, the same reason sort of is the same as what happened with cigarettes.
 The cigarette companies knew since the 1950s that smoking cigarettes was bad for people's lungs, and they also knew that it was bad for other people in the household, so-called secondhand smoke.
 Well, it was the same thing with this issue.
 This has been extensively studied since about the 1980s.
 We have had really good data showing that gas stove use is not good for people's health.
 And yet, it hasn't gotten out there.
 When the Massachusetts Medical Society passed that resolution to let the public be more aware of this association, I was actually approached by a former EPA official who thanked me for bringing this to light because she said it had just been so concerning for such a long time and it wasn't getting enough attention.
 Next slide.
 So this is just a list of the different health organizations that have now recognized the association between gas stove pollution and childhood asthma, the AMA, the American Public Health Association, Mass Medical Society.
 Next slide, please.
 So why are gas stoves a health hazard?
 And why am I calling them like the secondhand smoke of our time?
 Well, it turns out that just like cigarette smoke, they actually emit the same really powerful pollutants that cigarettes do.
 Really interesting.
 Next slide, please.
 So they produce, as cigarettes,
 Many more things than the three things I've listed here, but I'm gonna focus on these, because they actually produce hundreds of different pollutants.
 But the big ones are something called PM2.5, which is particulate matter.
 It's an air pollutant.
 It's associated with asthma, COPD, heart attack, stroke.
 Also, nitrogen dioxide, another air pollutant and respiratory irritant, and carbon monoxide,
 which many people know from carbon monoxide poisoning, which can happen in the house, but it happens whenever you light up a cigarette, you can get some carbon monoxide, and it also happens when you cook on your stove.
 Next slide, please.
 I love to talk about, I think particulate matter is super interesting.
 So what you see at the bottom of the slide there is a shaft of your hair.
 30 particles of particulate matter of this size, 2.5 microns,
 They're so small that 30 of them can fit into the diameter of a shaft of hair.
 So that's the size of pollution we're talking about.
 Why are we concerned about it?
 Because when you inhale it, it can penetrate deep into the lung where it triggers things like asthma, and then it can cross into the bloodstream from the lung
 where it can go to the heart and cause inflammation and cause things like heart attack.
 It can go up to the brain and cause inflammation and cause things like stroke.
 The important thing, it's associated with pneumonia and high blood pressure.
 The things to remember, children are especially vulnerable.
 It's especially at high levels, at stroller level.
 So when you're pushing a child along the street, that's where the particulate matter is the highest.
 And the other important thing to know is that, as I've mentioned before, risk exists at any level.
 So the EPA has given a cutoff level of what they call satisfactory, but it turns out that we see health effects down to the very lowest level.
 Next slide.
 Nitrogen dioxide.
 This is just a slide showing that the more nitrogen dioxide you have in the air, the more severe asthma reaction you're going to have.
 It's interesting that you start to get effects at about a level of 10 parts per billion.
 The safe cutoff for our EPA is 100.
 So you're allowed to be exposed to a hundred parts per billion But as you can see you get symptoms far below that and it also just lists where gas stoves versus electric stoves Tend to emit.
 I find that the most interesting thing about nitrogen dioxide when I was at a medical conference years ago one of my pulmonologist colleagues brought a really interesting contraption into the conference and I
 and he had collected some really polluted air outside, just right outside the convention center, the air that we had been breathing until we walked in to go to this seminar.
 And he brought it into the convention center, and he said, I have this really cool machine where I breathe it in, and then when I exhale, it can show all the different pollutants that are in the air that I've just breathed out.
 So you guys can see the pollution in the air that I'm breathing in, and then in the air that I'm breathing out.
 And actually, this data has been around since the 1960s.
 There's an article in Nature that shows this happening back then, too.
 And so he breathed in this extremely polluted air from outside.
 And when he breathed out, how much nitrogen dioxide was in what he breathed out?
 Nothing.
 And what does that mean?
 That means it's all in your lungs.
 So he was nicely filtering it for the rest of us.
 So think about that.
 And that's why these kids are so affected.
 They're really little.
 They're breathing in all of these super irritants, and they're staying in their lungs.
 Next slide.
 So, it's sort of a recurrent theme now.
 Children are exposed both to outdoor and indoor air pollution.
 So, they're cumulative and that's something to remember too.
 And again, the predominant source indoors is your gas stove.
 Next slide.
 And often, indoor emissions from gas stoves exceed outside, outdoor regulatory standards.
 Incredibly, there are no indoor air pollution standards for any pollutant whatsoever.
 It isn't regulated.
 Next slide, please.
 Very important slide.
 Gas stoves, if you don't use ventilation, if you have a house or an apartment that's less than 1,500 square feet, the nitrogen dioxide in your house is going to exceed regulatory standards 83% of the time.
 If you have a home or an apartment less than 1,000 square feet and you don't use ventilation, it's going to exceed regulatory standards
 all the time, 100% of the time.
 Next slide.
 Does cooking with gas increase asthma risk?
 Yes, it does, 42%.
 Next slide.
 And the other really important thing to know, that just again, this data is just fresh from the last year, is that even when the stove isn't turned on, gas stoves leak.
 And they leak bad stuff.
 They don't just leak methane.
 There was an article in the Boston Globe the other day about a woman
 She lived in Dorchester and her little dog was lying on the sofa and it died because her gas stove was leaking methane and methane is an asphyxiant gas.
 You go to Wikipedia and it says methane is an innocuous asphyxiant gas and I was like, well, innocuous means not harmful and asphyxiant means that you die from not being able to breathe and so you can't really say that it's both.
 But it leaks.
 Do you want me to wrap up?
 Is it, okay, okay.
 So another, so in addition to methane, which is an asphyxiant, killed the poor little puppy, but they don't just leak methane, they leak other stuff.
 They leak something called benzene, which is a known cause of cancer.
 It, like particulate matter, there's no safe level, it affects the nervous system, can cause birth defects, and it also leaks a bunch of other chemicals.
 Next slide.
 And by the way, it doesn't matter how expensive your stove is.
 The cheapest stoves and the most expensive stoves leak.
 And this is just an interesting slide.
 So some people say, well, how do I know that I won't get all of these pollutants if I cook on an electric stove?
 So this is a study showing whenever you burn anything, you're going to get some particulate matter.
 But it's interesting that when you cook with gas, you get a lot more particulate matter, and you also get all those other pollutants, the nitrogen dioxide, the VOCs, which is benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide.
 Next slide.
 The health cost, asthma costs on the order of like $80 billion in the US annually.
 If you break that down to a per person per family cost for what you'll spend on asthma in a year, it comes out to some like $3,200 a year.
 What's the cost of an electric stove?
 Like $500 to $1,000.
 So when you think about the health cost to society versus the cost of changing out that stove, maybe it's something to think about when your stove's ready to die.
 Next slide.
 I just thought I'd quote a bunch of interesting data that just came out like two weeks ago from a really great article in Science from both Harvard and Stanford researchers.
 And they looked at both, because many people, there's another article that I quoted in there that I wrote a couple years ago.
 People wrote to me afterwards saying, but what about propane gas?
 Because we cook with propane gas, and is that as bad as methane gas, which most of us have?
 And it turns out, yes, it is.
 And they looked at the US as a whole, and they found that the pediatric asthma cases due to the nitrogen dioxide from gas and propane stoves is like 50,000 a year across the US.
 But if you look at all the pollutants we just talked about, the benzene and the carbon monoxide and the nitrogen dioxide, it's more like 200,000 cases of pediatric asthma a year.
 So that is a whopping number.
 Mortality, they made a mortality estimate.
 They said up to 19,000 adult deaths annually from gas stove use in the U.S.
 pretty a whopping, and what's the mortality cost of that?
 They said on the order of a billion dollars a year in the US, and actually then they broke it down to communities of color, and they found that the price tag was even higher.
 The most concerning thing actually to me about this study was that they didn't just look at levels of these pollutants in the kitchen.
 They went all over the house and they found that the levels of pollutants in the bedrooms were equally as elevated and they stayed elevated for hours after the gas stove was used.
 So something else to think about.
 Next slide.
 So what can we do about it?
 Does ventilation help reduce nitrogen dioxide levels?
 And the answer is a definite maybe.
 It works if you use it.
 I'm one of those people who, I didn't know this data till I was, till about 2017 or later.
 And so in the winter when my kids were little, I used to put,
 my ventilation like leaked like a sieve and you know this is Massachusetts it's cold so I've thought I was being really smart and I covered it with plastic, so that I wouldn't get a ton of cold air coming right through the vent from the outside.
 And then my kids got asthma, and then I started reading about this data, and I thought, gosh, you know, I'm gonna take the cover, all that plastic I put on in the winter, off of my vent.
 And I didn't even run it that much, but because it created a constant draft, at the end of, my son was a big runner, and at the end of his cross country season, I was like, you know, I'm never at the end of the race, so I haven't seen you using your inhaler,
 How many times did you use it this season?
 And he was like, I didn't use it this season.
 But the problem with ventilation is people don't like to use it.
 I found at the end, right before our gas stove died, and I became more and more concerned.
 I have to let you know that one of the researchers who carried out that Harvard study I mentioned, she uses an N95 mask when she cooks on her gas stove.
 I don't think I could do that, because anyway, I don't think I could do that.
 But I did start running my fan every single time I ran my gas stove.
 And I noticed that the whole kitchen just cleared out.
 Like I wanted quiet in the kitchen and I just turned on that fan, my husband was gone, the kids were gone, no one was in the kitchen, no one likes using the fan.
 So that's a real problem is compliance.
 People just don't use it, they don't like it, it's annoying, it's loud.
 But it does work as long as it vents to the outside.
 If it doesn't vent to the outside, if it's one of those fans that just recirculates things in the kitchen, those ones can actually end up with levels of pollution higher than what you started out with.
 So those are really not good.
 And then if you don't have a fan that goes to the outside, open a window.
 Opening a window works great.
 Next slide.
 And so this is just a whole bunch of recommendations to install a carbon monoxide detector.
 I recommend getting a pretty expensive one.
 I didn't get an expensive one.
 And our heat exchanger on our gas furnace died and melted.
 And we ended up having carbon monoxide all over the house.
 And our monitor never picked it up.
 I smelled the weird burning smell, and I called the gas company.
 And my family was like, what's the problem?
 Well, the levels were really, really high.
 That was the problem.
 Opening a window, cooking on the back burners, using other electric appliances like a toaster oven or a kettle, a plug-in induction stove, and then ultimately, when you can and if you can, switching to an electric or an induction stove.
 Next slide.
 So the proof in a lot of medical studies is, well, when you take whatever you think is causing a medical condition away, does it get better?
 This is a really nice study in Ecuador showing that replacing gas stoves with induction stoves reduced markedly emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
 Next slide.
 And right now, there was also a study in the Bronx that showed the same thing.
 And now we have a study ongoing in collaboration with the BU School of Public Health in Dorchester, where they are looking at the environmental and health effects of replacing a gas stove with an electric one.
 Now I should just mention, it's very interesting in the Bronx study, I don't have the data up here,
 But it only reduced the air pollutants in the air by about 30%.
 But I showed you in the earlier slide of gas stoves versus electric stoves, you know, when you go to an electric stove, it should take all of those air pollutants out.
 And I think
 that tells us that the problem is in communities of color, if you take away the indoor air pollution, you still have the problem, which is that the outdoor air pollution didn't go away.
 And so this gets at some of the problem, but we still have to face that whole problem.
 Next slide.
 So just a few takeaways.
 Now you know gas stoves are the number one trigger for asthma and an indoor trigger in the state of Massachusetts.
 And communities of color are disproportionately and unfairly burdened by that.
 What can we do to stop those negative health effects?
 You can vent your stovetop emissions, but remember, they have to vent outside.
 You can't just recirculate them.
 Open your windows.
 Keep the children, elderly people, people with asthma away from the stove while you're cooking.
 I think a really important part of this, too, obviously is going to happen at the policy level.
 This isn't mentioned much, but one thing I'm kind of passionate about is, you know,
 There's external ventilation required for hot water heaters and your gas dryer.
 You wouldn't think of venting that inside, right?
 Or your gas furnace.
 You wouldn't think of venting that inside.
 Gas stoves used to vent outside.
 And at some point,
 In the last 40 years, that changed.
 And so I feel very strongly that gas stoves should vent outside.
 I think putting a warning label on stoves.
 There's a warning label on my hairdryer, like do not drop this into a tub when you're using it because there's a risk of electric shock.
 I don't think 19,000 people die every year in the US because they've dropped their hair dryer in a bathtub and gotten an electric shock, and yet there's a label on it.
 But 19,000 people a year die from gas stove exposure and there's no label on it.
 Where does that square up?
 Dozen.
 And then, obviously, replacing a gas stove with an electric or an induction when you need a new one.
 And then, most importantly, I think, is regulating air pollution, outdoor air pollution.
 Because yes, you can get rid of indoor air pollution, but if you don't regulate the outdoor one, and say, enforce the roadmap law that was just passed in Massachusetts a year and a half ago,
 saying that we shouldn't be locating dirty incinerators and power plants, et cetera, in communities of color that are already overburdened by all of those.
 It's time to make that all happen.
 And that's all I have.
 I have some resources, next slide.
 And then next slide, more resources.
 So I'm happy to share those with you afterwards.
 I don't, I should have brought a handout, but I didn't.
 And I'm happy to take any questions.
 You're all probably in shock.
 You're like, oh no, the gas stove.
 I love the gas stove.
 I love gas stoves too.
 But you get used to electric.
 Yes.
 So do you want to take her the mic?
 Yeah.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2874.514s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 그래서 당신은 가스 스토브와 천식에 미치는 영향을 언급했습니다.
 난방 시스템은 어떻습니까? 때로는 대부분의 집주인이 업데이트하지 않고 그을음으로 가득 차 있으며 때로는 때때로
 실제로는 인공 호흡기의 꼭대기에서 먼지를 퍼뜨리는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.
 나는 이것으로 고통을 겪었고, 나의 더 큰 아들, 나는이 문제가있는 아파트에 살았고 그의 눈 주위에 어두운 서클을 발견했다.
 의사들은 환기 시스템과 관련된 것을 언급했지만 확인하거나 좋아하지 않았습니다.
 이 아파트에서 이동하는 데 필요한 것을 시작하십시오.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2928.187s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 예, 가스 스토브가 아니라 가스 용광로이기 때문에 큰 문제라고 생각합니다.
 나는 아마도 새는 가스 용광로를 가지고 있었다
 6 개월 전에 일산화탄소를 깨닫기 전에 일산화탄소는 두통이 생기지 않는 것을 알았고 매일 두통이 생겼습니다.
 나, 내 눈, 내 눈의 백인은 일종의 주사 였고, 그들은 붉어졌고, 나는 그게 이상했다. 나는 이상하다. 나는 아시고, 나는 항상 피곤했다. 나는 결코 피곤하지 않았다.
 그리고
 나중에, 나는 오 세상에, 나는 가스 용광로 가이 물건을 모두 방출하고 있기 때문에 만성 카르스로 일산화탄소 노출로 고통 받고 있다는 것을 깨달았습니다.
 가스 용광로는 스토브가 새는 것처럼 누출 될 수 있습니다.
 뜨거운 온수기도 마찬가지입니다.
 그들은 또한 매사추세츠 주 전역의 주택에서 가스 누출에 대한 연구를하고 있으며, 다른 날에 연구의 일환으로 누군가가 집에 도착했고, 그는 그의 모니터를 뜨거운 온수기에 올려 놓고 가스를 냄새 맡았습니다. 뜨거운 온수기에서 충분히
 가스가 누출되어 고정되었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2990.671s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=2994.014s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 다른 질문?
 부끄러워하지 마십시오.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3002.02s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 그래서 백 버너 사용에 대한 질문이있었습니다.
 당신이 더 멀리 떨어져 있고 환기가 그것과 관련이 있기 때문입니까?
 집에서 반대되는대로 밖에 나가?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3019.427s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 내 생각에, 우선, 당신은 오염 물질에서 멀리 떨어져 있으므로 얼굴에 바로 그것을 얻지 못한다는 것입니다.
 그리고 두 번째로, 스토브 위에있는 후드가있는 벤트를 사용할 때는 들어 올립니다.
 그들은 더 잘 작동합니다.
 그것은 백 버너에서 더 잘 작동합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3039.717s">[SPEAKER_01]</a>: 다른 질문?
 내 질문은 그렇지 않습니다
 그것은 우리가 가지고있는 가스 스토브의 양입니다. 저는 매사추세츠 만 말하지 않고 모든 곳에서 말합니다.
 훨씬 더, 전기 스토브보다 훨씬 큽니다.
 가격 때문이 아닙니까?
 전기가 가스보다 비싸나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3064.654s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 아마 그것과 관련이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니까?
 또한,
 그러나 그것은 전체 이야기가 아닙니다.
 이야기의 다른 부분은 무엇입니까?
 그것은 크게 판매되었습니다.
 나는 방금 결혼했을 때를 기억하고 모든 친구들과 이야기하고 있었고 모두와 같았습니다.
 모든 요리사가 나와서 가스로 요리하는 것이 훨씬 좋습니다.
 그리고 그들은 누구에 의해 지불 되었습니까?
 미국 가스 협회.
 그래서 어느 시점에서 거기에는 가격대가 있었을 것입니다.
 전기 스토브와 가스 스토브와 스토브를 운행하는 데 드는 금액을 실제로 알 수는 없습니다.
 예,하지만 병원 청구서에서 저축하는 것을 생각하십시오.
 응.
 응.
 한 시점에 있었을 수도 있지만 이제는 더 효율적이라고 생각합니다.
 내가 말했듯이, 나는 새로운 모델을 가지고 있으며, 유도는 매우 효율적이고 매우 효율적이며 전자기파를 사용합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3171.211s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 그렇습니다. 이와 같은 유도 쿡탑은 전통적인 전기 스토브로 작동하는 비용의 약 절반이라고 덧붙입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3180.374s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 그리고 당신은 전체 스토브를 구입할 필요가 없습니다.
 그녀가 바로 전시 한 단일 버너를 구입할 수 있습니다.
 그리고 그렇게 할 수있는 방법으로, 가스 스토브를 사용하지 않는 것이 얼마나 놀랍습니다.
 응.
 다른 질문?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3202.212s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 응.
 마이크를 사용해야합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3207.232s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 나는 그것이 유색 지역 사회에 대한 경제적 부담과 같은 정맥에 있다고 생각합니다.
 그렇다면 어떻게 자원이 있습니까?
 나는 도체스터시와 BU가 가스 스토브에서 전기 스토브로 업그레이드하는 데 드는 비용과 같은 공중 보건에 대한 프로그램이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니까?
 그것에 대한 자원이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3228.056s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 그것은 훌륭한 질문입니다.
 나는 정부 프로그램, 매사추세츠 프로그램, 대량 저장, 유도 또는 전기 스토브 또는 유도 구매 500 달러가 있다고 생각합니다.
 좋아요.
 응.
 그래서 있습니다.
 또한 가열의 형태를 전기로 변경하려면 히트 펌프로 변경합니다.
 할인도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3260.573s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 감사합니다.
 그것은 훌륭한 프레젠테이션이었습니다.
 귀하와 Brenda에게 유도의 가격대와 Masssave 프로그램의 작동 방식에 대해 이야기 할 수 있습니까?
 따라서 그냥 구매하고 싶거나 마스 웨이브를 통과하고 싶다면.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3275.584s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 감사해요.
 예, 이와 같은 휴대용 유도 쿡탑은 100 달러가 넘습니다.
 유도 쿡탑이있는 풀 사이즈 스토브는 표준 스토브보다 비싸다.
 1,000 달러가 더 비싸지 만 대량 사소한 리베이트는 $ 500의 경우 $ 500 더 비쌉니다.
 나는 1 년 동안 이와 같은 휴대용 유도 쿡탑에서 요리했습니다.
 나는 때때로 여러 버너를 사용해야 할 때 가스 스토브를 백업으로 사용했지만 거의 1 년 동안 거의 독점적으로 할 수있었습니다.
 오, 나는 이것을 아마존에서 샀지 만, 나는 그것이 Home Depot 's 또는 Best Buy's 또는 죄송합니다, Best Buy 's와 같은 것들에서 꽤 구할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3337.317s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 좋은 질문.
 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3341.139s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 우리는 또 다른 질문을 받았습니다.
 예.
 요리하려면 특별한 냄비를 사야합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3346.602s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 그것은 또한 좋은 질문이기도합니다. Brenda가 그것에 대해 더 많이 말할 수 있다고 확신합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3351.404s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 응.
 죄송합니다. 그냥 서 있어야합니다.
 따라서 냄비는 자성이어야합니다. 왜냐하면 이것이 작동하는 방식이기 때문입니다. 냄비의 금속 만 가열하는 자기장을 생성합니다.
 스테인레스 스틸, 주철, 내부에 금속과 같은 세라믹이 있으면 효과가 있습니다.
 그러나 그것은 구리 나 유리 또는 그런 것들과 함께 작동하지 않을 것입니다.
 그러나 기본적으로 조리기구를 테스트 할 수 있습니다.
 자석이 있다면 조리기구를 테스트하십시오.
 그것이 붙어 있으면 작동합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3384.55s">[SPEAKER_09]</a>: 정말 좋은 질문입니다.
 남편이 내가 좋아하는 냄비를 포기하지 않을 것 같았 기 때문에 우리가 실제로 전기와 유도가 아닌 이유입니다. 우리가 자석으로 테스트 한 냄비를 포기하지 않을 것 같았으므로 자석이 아니 었으므로 그래요, 정말 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3424.537s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 감사합니다, Lundberg 박사.
 유도 난로를 사용하는 방법을 배우려면 Brenda가 바로 끝나고 사용 방법을 보여줍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3514.278s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 예, 물론.
 예, 우리는 기본적으로 우리 웹 사이트에 그것을 넣고 당신이 우리와 상호 작용할 수 있도록 열려 있습니다.
 나중에 줄게.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3526.563s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 전적으로.
 그래, 그래.
 그게 어때?
 엄청난.
 그렇다면 USDA와 함께 일합니까, 아니면 그렇습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3586.032s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 예, 내가 무엇을 중단하고 있습니까?
 내 말은, 당신은 무엇을 할 건가요?
 잠깐, 뭐?
 그리고 그것은 큰 문제도 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3602.101s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: QR 코드, 코드도 거기에 있습니까?
 그래, 그래.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3615.849s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 하지만 부모님은 가스가 있기 때문에 그 정보를 얻고 싶습니다.
 그리고 나는 어, 어.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3626.094s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 그게 내가 말하는 것입니다.
 하지만 100 달러이지만 가족이 있습니다.
 가스를 어떻게 얻을 건가요?
 이것은 정말로</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3714.309s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 나는 당신이 진정한 일을 진행하는 것을 지원하기를 바랍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3744.594s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 나는 모두가 그들의 일을하기를 원했다.
 게다가, 나처럼, 나는 모두에게 말합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3786.271s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 갈 필요가 없습니다.
 그래, 알아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3855.234s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 사랑해요.
 사랑해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=3936.488s">[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 그래서 나는 단지 점을 연결하고 있습니다.
 나는 진실을 말하고있다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4012.694s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4037.542s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4067.441s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 너희들은 화려하다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4103.891s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 나는 그것이 큰 도시라는 것을 알고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4135.36s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4163.72s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 사람들처럼 느끼기 때문에 시리아 만 말할 때 그들은 가지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4169.123s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 그러나 그들이 구체적으로 그들을 향한 경우, 그것에 대해 이야기 할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4172.365s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 알고 있기 때문에 좋은 지역입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4175.186s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 알다시피, 그것은 일반 대중에게 보내는 좋은 메시지입니다.
 나는 좋아하지만, 평범한 여성은 나에게 걸어 가서 우리에게 시리아가 있고, 우리는 그것에 있다고 말할 것입니다.
 지금부터 10 년?
 사람들은 특히 지금처럼 그것에 대해 이야기하기 시작할 것이기 때문에 조금씩.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/WKpjKFdpTFg&t=4206.691s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 사람들은 내년에 그것에 대해 이야기하기 시작할 것입니다.
 우리는 더 많은 사람들이있을 것입니다.
 그게 내가 가진 전부입니다.
