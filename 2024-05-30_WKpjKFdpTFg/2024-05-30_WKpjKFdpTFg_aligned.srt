1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,630
are mostly at risk for that.

2
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:10,353
So there's some historical context.

3
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:14,695
Many black and brown communities have been subject to residential segregation.

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:25,000
This is not news to you, but I just wanted you to get a chance to read it, which propelled to the reduction of resources and improper infrastructure.

5
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:34,500
So when we look at the numbers, black children are more than twice likely to have asthma.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,004
Black children are 7.6 times more likely to die from asthma.

7
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:49,613
And in 2021, 72 million people of color live in areas of high level of ozone and or particle pollution.

8
00:00:53,368 --> 00:01:06,205
So when we make the connection between why we're holding the series and the effect of climate change and also the work that we do in the city of Medford, our Office of Prevention and also the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

9
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,274
I always have to remember what PDS stands for.

10
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:18,578
So from floods to heat waves, black and brown children are at greater risk of climate-related health outcomes.

11
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:32,484
And we also have the Health Equity Council in this unit, which is Brenda Pike, our climate planner, is leading that team with our Medford Connectors, Charbel, Lizette, Samia, who's not here, and Natasha, who is virtual.

12
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:45,605
So the Climate Equity is an ad hoc committee that will advise the city on the implementation of the Climate Action Plan with a focus on representing the interests of previously underrepresented groups in the city of Medford.

13
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,359
So how can you help?

14
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,984
Learn about environmental justice issues, get involved and stay engaged.

15
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,626
You can stay engaged.

16
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:09,058
We have this pull-up banner and with a QR code, you can stay engaged with that or reach out to either myself or Brenda and just connect with us at City Hall.

17
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,126
And that's it.

18
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,949
So I will Dr. Britta Lundberg is on her way.

19
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,929
She is traffic is terrible.

20
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:28,032
She's running behind so but she will be our speaker tonight and she'll go more in depth with on the effect of asthma on children.

21
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:31,353
So I will I'm just asking for a little patience.

22
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:36,404
Sure.

23
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:37,105
Yeah.

24
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:37,905
OK.

25
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:52,897
So while we have some time, one of the things if you if you come over to our to our little demonstration area over there later, we have a portable induction cooktop there, which is an electric cooktop.

26
00:02:53,457 --> 00:03:04,005
And one of the great things about that, in addition to the benefits with asthma, is that it doesn't heat up the

27
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:29,786
The stove top and the area around it as much it just focuses the heat on the pan itself so it's there's a it makes a electromagnetic field it So if you have a metal pan that a magnet will attach to it will work on that and it just heats up the pot So I can I'll show you later

28
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:37,450
I can turn it on, put my hand on it, it won't burn my hand because it will only heat up metal.

29
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:48,917
I can put a towel down and put the pot on top of the towel and cook through the towel and it won't burn the towel because it's just focusing the heat on the pan.

30
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:56,302
So it's incredibly energy efficient, it saves you energy, it saves you money, and it reduces the risk of fire.

31
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:00,816
And it improves asthma outcomes as well.

32
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,217
So it's a great benefit.

33
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:10,723
The full-size units, like the regular cook stoves, are more expensive than a traditional stove is.

34
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,965
This portable cooktop here, it's $100.

35
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,286
It's relatively simple.

36
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:22,110
And I cooked on one for the majority of my cooking for a year.

37
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,132
And it was really great.

38
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:41,243
If you want to try it out for yourself, the Medford Public Library has two induction cooktops, portable ones like that, that you can check out of the library to try it for a couple of weeks and see if it's something that you are interested in.

39
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:44,079
So there's coffee and some finger foods, if folks are interested.

40
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,881
But I think while we wait, we can tell.

41
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,182
Good, how are you?

42
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:47,703
Hello.

43
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:38,624
Good, good.

44
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,719
We're building up to that.

45
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:30,327
Thank you.

46
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,557
Okay, so they can see this, they can't see that.

47
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,563
Hi, how are you?

48
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,063
Really good.

49
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,224
Good, I'm Kevin from Equity Community Media, helping with all that.

50
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,281
Okay, fantastic.

51
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,062
We got your microphone here.

52
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:02,382
Let me run to the back and get reset.

53
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:06,724
And did Lisa mention the handheld mic so the audience is back there too?

54
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,744
Yes, okay, good.

55
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:28,560
As I said, it was half an hour when I looked this morning.

56
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,822
And I was like, I know it'll be a little busier.

57
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:33,163
It may be 40 minutes.

58
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:35,745
And I kept trying to be very smart about it.

59
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:39,847
And just every time, then I was like, at least it took it to be a couple of minutes.

60
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,308
It didn't go very fast.

61
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:44,689
I'm so happy to see people come out.

62
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,850
We have some stuff on opening night.

63
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,463
and she would hang out with him every summer.

64
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,811
All right, so we're back.

65
00:11:52,831 --> 00:12:01,536
I just wanted to introduce Dr. Lundberg, who will be our speaker for this evening.

66
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:09,961
She is a trained infectious disease physician and former assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University.

67
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:19,168
She is the CEO and founder of the Health Equity Institute and Lundberg Health Advocates, which is a patient advocacy group.

68
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:26,093
The Health Equity Institute offers advocacy education and funding for program advocacy services for patients in need.

69
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:37,243
Dr. Lundberg is an active member of Climate Code Blue, a physician led advocacy group dedicated to increasing public awareness of the health effects of climate change.

70
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:49,914
She is a former chair of the board and active member of the Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility and a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society's Environmental and Occupational Health Committee.

71
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,596
I will pass on the mic to Dr. Lundberg.

72
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,629
Sophie, how do I change the slides?

73
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,690
I can change it for you.

74
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,110
Oh, I can just say next slide.

75
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:18,734
First of all, thank you all so much for coming out on a Wednesday night to hear about air pollution and climate justice and the health impacts of childhood asthma in black children, because I think this is such an incredibly important topic, and I am so glad to be here.

76
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:19,974
Next slide.

77
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,533
So just a few words about what is asthma.

78
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:32,617
And I'm sorry, these slides are kind of far back, but I think you can see them OK.

79
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:42,526
So it essentially is a hyper-reactivity of the airways that causes swelling, difficulty breathing.

80
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:49,313
I'm sure that many of you in this room, I as a parent and the parent of two kids with asthma, I'm sure a lot of you

81
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,849
are involuntary experts about asthma.

82
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,551
And so I probably don't need to tell you too much.

83
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:59,856
But what I do need to tell you is that there are several triggers for asthma.

84
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:04,941
There are triggers that we can do things about, and there are triggers we can't do things about.

85
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:11,127
The triggers we generally can't do so much about include cold air, exercise,

86
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:17,452
viral infections, you know, that your kids are going to be exposed to or that you are exposed to.

87
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:22,077
But tonight I'm going to talk about the things we can do things, something about.

88
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:28,963
And I'm going to talk about who this disease is most common in.

89
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:35,769
So it turns out, and actually it was really a pleasure to me to prepare and a bit of a shock, I have to say,

90
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:39,070
to prepare this talk because it was somewhat of an eye-opener to me.

91
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:45,831
I did not know all of these statistics, so I'm just going to share with you some pretty sobering statistics that I wasn't aware of.

92
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:53,693
So as many of you know, black children have a higher risk of developing asthma than children of other racial groups.

93
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:58,474
Black children have more than double the asthma rate, 12% versus 5.5% in other groups.

94
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:03,217
Emergency use is much higher.

95
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,021
And there's an increased asthma fatality rate.

96
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,004
Now, these data are for across the country.

97
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:09,246
They're not for Massachusetts.

98
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:10,788
Massachusetts, it's a little lower.

99
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,916
But in general, the asthma fatality rate is almost eight times higher in black children.

100
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:17,477
Next slide.

101
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:34,365
So that list of triggers that I put up there in the slide before this mentioned a whole bunch of triggers, mold, allergens, pollen, as I said, exercise and whatnot.

102
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:42,089
And it mentioned smoke, but it doesn't mention what we're gonna talk about tonight, which is air pollution.

103
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:48,052
I really feel like the NIH should list air pollution as a trigger and cause of asthma because

104
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:51,135
the data tell us that it is.

105
00:15:51,775 --> 00:16:08,594
Air pollution in Massachusetts, according to a 2019 study by Boston College professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, showed that 15,000 cases of asthma in 2019 are due to air pollution in our state, and they're disproportionately affecting communities of color.

106
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:14,698
But air pollution isn't just a cause and a trigger of asthma.

107
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:16,580
It's a cause of a lot of other stuff.

108
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,621
It's a cause of IQ loss in children.

109
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:24,985
It's a cause of low birth weight among newborns.

110
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:28,367
And, importantly, it's a cause of death.

111
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,550
Worldwide, it accounts for 3 million deaths.

112
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,112
It's the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world.

113
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:41,155
And in our state, it accounts for 2,800 deaths a year, at least in this 2019 study.

114
00:16:45,558 --> 00:17:02,071
The important thing to note is that those deaths occur in every single community in Massachusetts, regardless of income, regardless of race, but they disproportionately occur among communities of color.

115
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:10,798
And so, and the other important thing about that study is that it turns out that the

116
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:19,149
level of particulate matter that the EPA believes is protective turned out not to be protective in that study.

117
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:29,655
The levels that they saw health effects at were much, much lower, leading the authors to recommend much, much lower levels of pollution that should be allowed.

118
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:47,114
Now if I just asked you what the number one trigger is in terms of houses about what the trigger for childhood asthma is, I put it on the slide, I should have asked the slide before, but actually the number one trigger

119
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:51,758
for pediatric asthma is gas stove use in the house.

120
00:17:52,519 --> 00:18:00,686
And so that is what I'm gonna focus my talk on, but I thought I'd mention outdoor air pollution right at the get-go also.

121
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:01,807
Next slide, please.

122
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:08,932
Again, just reinforcing what I just said, there are disparities around who's exposed to air pollution.

123
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:17,739
On average, nationally, people of color are exposed to 38% higher levels of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide.

124
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,681
It's just a common air pollution pollutant.

125
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,564
And we in the Northeast, ironically, you know, we...

126
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,547
I grew up thinking, oh, we're so much more enlightened.

127
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,728
No, no, no, not when it comes to air pollution.

128
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,873
Actually, the disparities in the Northeast are some of the worst in the country.

129
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:43,857
And one of the top 10 cities in terms of those disparities is Boston.

130
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:49,641
And one of the two top 10 states in terms of locating

131
00:18:51,242 --> 00:19:05,710
sources of air pollution including things like hazardous waste facilities and biomass incinerators and natural gas infrastructure like compressor stations and oil and gas pipelines and that kind of thing.

132
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,212
There are two top states in the country for that.

133
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,313
One is Wisconsin and one is Massachusetts.

134
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:13,294
So that's distressing.

135
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,115
Next slide please.

136
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:28,692
So it's important to talk about childhood asthma, because there are three really important reasons why children are more susceptible to air pollution provoked asthma.

137
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:34,596
First of all, they breathe at a higher rate, so they take those pollutants in at a higher rate.

138
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:44,942
Second, because they're smaller, they have a higher lung to body weight surface area, and so they absorb more of those pollutants.

139
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:53,985
And second, they have very immature developing respiratory systems, and so they're just not equipped to handle that level of pollution.

140
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:05,732
I was asked to speak about the interaction between climate justice and asthma, and in fact, there's a very powerful interaction.

141
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:12,616
Climate change, whether caused by wildfire smoke, as you see on the left, or flooding, bottom right, or

142
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:28,567
drought, any of the commonly occurring things with climate change, all increase the respiratory disease and they compound racial disparities.

143
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:43,640
The driver of climate change is fossil fuels and oil, gas, coal, infrastructure that produces all of this air pollution that then is a driver of climate change.

144
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:54,269
And the interesting thing is that the fossil fuels don't just cause the climate change, they also are a direct provoker of asthma themselves.

145
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:55,509
Next slide.

146
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,411
Now the great news here is that cutting air pollution has immediate effects.

147
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,992
I mean, really almost immediate.

148
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:11,432
So we see asthma rates, heart attack rates, they fall rapidly.

149
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,193
Babies are born healthier.

150
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:13,693
Next slide.

151
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,575
And how do we know that?

152
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:22,339
So this is just a bunch of studies showing this effect.

153
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,642
I'm just going to focus on the second one down.

154
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:32,891
You might remember at the Atlanta Olympics, they really limited driving and transportation

155
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:45,302
And they made all of the local, anyone who produced any local sources of air pollution, to really ramp it down so that the air quality would be better for the Olympics.

156
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,384
And a bunch of physicians thought, well, this is interesting.

157
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:51,327
Why don't we look at asthma at the same time?

158
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,449
With all of this air pollution falling, we would expect it to get better.

159
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:55,730
It plummeted.

160
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,810
And that within weeks.

161
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:05,432
So within 17 days, they had decreased emergency room visits for childhood asthma, decreased hospitalizations.

162
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:07,732
And it wasn't just the Atlanta Olympics.

163
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:12,093
They saw the same thing for the Beijing Olympics, because China did the same thing.

164
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:17,614
And they really got very, very strict about their air pollution standards.

165
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:25,096
And they actually looked at some of the data in lung tissue, and they saw decreased inflammatory markers.

166
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:33,119
and decreased incidence of asthma exacerbations and inflammation.

167
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:37,701
And so seeing all that data, we can just finish up and go home, right?

168
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,101
Because we've got all the answers here.

169
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,162
The answer is to decrease air pollution.

170
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,083
Well, unfortunately, it's not that easy.

171
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:43,723
Next slide, please.

172
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:49,785
This is an article that I wrote in collaboration.

173
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:53,907
They left off my co-author, Dr. Adrian Allen, who is

174
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:58,558
Awesome, and they, anyway, I have to bother them about this, because I just noticed this when I pulled up the article.

175
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:03,903
They've rebranded as Commonwealth Beacons, so when they were Commonwealth, she was on there, and now she's not.

176
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:19,718
But it's just an article about pollution inequality in the state of Massachusetts, and all the roadblocks that we have been running into in terms of communities of color being

177
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:31,928
disproportionately impacted by locating polluting infrastructure in them, like the Peabody Peeker plant, right in a community that's a disalready

178
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:37,155
overburdened by too much polluting infrastructure, the Weymouth Compressor Station.

179
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:53,986
Two success stories that I should mention since Governor Healey came into office are the Long Meadow Pipeline that the DEP put the kibosh on, and a biomass incinerator in Springfield.

180
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:58,329
So we've had some victories, but by and large,

181
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,734
Regulating outdoor air pollution is a real challenge.

182
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,638
So that is why I'm going to focus on indoor air pollution.

183
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,199
Next slide.

184
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:11,728
Because this is something we as individuals can do something about.

185
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:12,209
Next slide.

186
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:23,290
Now, you might not know this, but indoor air quality is often much, much worse than outdoor air quality.

187
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:30,460
And that is an important thing to think about because we spend up to 90% of our time indoors, right?

188
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:42,715
That said, the EPA has said that indoor air pollution can be anywhere from two to five to 100 times worse than outdoor air quality.

189
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:57,619
And homes with gas stoves emit 50 to 400 times as much of a very powerful air pollutant called nitrogen dioxide that we'll talk about in a minute than homes with electric stoves.

190
00:24:58,379 --> 00:24:58,839
Next slide.

191
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:08,670
This is an important thing to know, because asthma is the second most common chronic illness in Massachusetts.

192
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,171
One in eight children in Massachusetts have it.

193
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:16,052
And 15% of that is attributable to gas stove use next.

194
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,795
That's a problem, because gas stove usage is widespread in our state.

195
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:29,817
Over 50% of over half of the houses in Massachusetts use gas to cook, houses and apartments.

196
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:51,885
And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, this was a study in 2017 from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health showing that gas stoves are the number one trigger for indoor asthma, number one trigger indoors for childhood asthma exacerbations.

197
00:25:55,174 --> 00:26:00,678
As we mentioned before about outdoor air pollution, this too is an equity issue.

198
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:05,341
Lower income households are at higher risk of exposure and illness.

199
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:07,022
Why is that?

200
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,644
Because their houses and apartments tend to be smaller.

201
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:19,490
Their ventilation, they might be older homes, they don't have as fantastic ventilation.

202
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:20,871
Also, frankly,

203
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:38,327
With an effort to try to get houses tighter in terms of not leaking as much and being climate friendly and that kind of thing, by making the envelope of the house tighter, you therefore cut down on the ventilation too.

204
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:42,171
And that's another factor that isn't on the slide in terms of increasing.

205
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:48,320
Sometimes households use that stove or oven to supplement heat.

206
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,246
They're also disproportionately exposed to outdoor air pollution.

207
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:56,133
All of that adds up to a greater asthma burden.

208
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:56,714
Next slide.

209
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,561
So some people ask me, well, why haven't I ever heard about this?

210
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:17,084
When we first passed a policy at the Massachusetts Medical Society to just raise awareness in the general community about asthma and childhood asthma and gastrofuse, I remember going to a party after this passed.

211
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:20,945
It was just a holiday party, and mentioning that this happened.

212
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,026
And someone looked at me, and they were like, what?

213
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:25,678
What are you talking about?

214
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:29,700
You're the first person in the world who has ever said anything to me about this.

215
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:42,966
Now, I have to say that since that time, that was 2019, and since doctors have started speaking up about this issue, the number of articles in the popular press has just increased exponentially.

216
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:48,189
It was like no one talked about it before, and therefore, no one did much about it either.

217
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,370
And why?

218
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,711
Well, the same reason sort of is the same as what happened with cigarettes.

219
00:27:56,211 --> 00:28:05,533
The cigarette companies knew since the 1950s that smoking cigarettes was bad for people's lungs, and they also knew that it was bad for other people in the household, so-called secondhand smoke.

220
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:08,294
Well, it was the same thing with this issue.

221
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:12,155
This has been extensively studied since about the 1980s.

222
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:17,636
We have had really good data showing that gas stove use is not good for people's health.

223
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,190
And yet, it hasn't gotten out there.

224
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:41,863
When the Massachusetts Medical Society passed that resolution to let the public be more aware of this association, I was actually approached by a former EPA official who thanked me for bringing this to light because she said it had just been so concerning for such a long time and it wasn't getting enough attention.

225
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:42,443
Next slide.

226
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:57,732
So this is just a list of the different health organizations that have now recognized the association between gas stove pollution and childhood asthma, the AMA, the American Public Health Association, Mass Medical Society.

227
00:28:58,753 --> 00:28:59,414
Next slide, please.

228
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:04,654
So why are gas stoves a health hazard?

229
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:09,558
And why am I calling them like the secondhand smoke of our time?

230
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:19,067
Well, it turns out that just like cigarette smoke, they actually emit the same really powerful pollutants that cigarettes do.

231
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:19,948
Really interesting.

232
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:20,789
Next slide, please.

233
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:27,735
So they produce, as cigarettes,

234
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:36,880
Many more things than the three things I've listed here, but I'm gonna focus on these, because they actually produce hundreds of different pollutants.

235
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,861
But the big ones are something called PM2.5, which is particulate matter.

236
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,362
It's an air pollutant.

237
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:47,603
It's associated with asthma, COPD, heart attack, stroke.

238
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:56,025
Also, nitrogen dioxide, another air pollutant and respiratory irritant, and carbon monoxide,

239
00:29:57,226 --> 00:30:09,002
which many people know from carbon monoxide poisoning, which can happen in the house, but it happens whenever you light up a cigarette, you can get some carbon monoxide, and it also happens when you cook on your stove.

240
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:10,745
Next slide, please.

241
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:17,298
I love to talk about, I think particulate matter is super interesting.

242
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:22,720
So what you see at the bottom of the slide there is a shaft of your hair.

243
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,862
30 particles of particulate matter of this size, 2.5 microns,

244
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:34,449
They're so small that 30 of them can fit into the diameter of a shaft of hair.

245
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:37,953
So that's the size of pollution we're talking about.

246
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,075
Why are we concerned about it?

247
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:50,587
Because when you inhale it, it can penetrate deep into the lung where it triggers things like asthma, and then it can cross into the bloodstream from the lung

248
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:55,251
where it can go to the heart and cause inflammation and cause things like heart attack.

249
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:59,315
It can go up to the brain and cause inflammation and cause things like stroke.

250
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:04,759
The important thing, it's associated with pneumonia and high blood pressure.

251
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,942
The things to remember, children are especially vulnerable.

252
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:12,386
It's especially at high levels, at stroller level.

253
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:17,451
So when you're pushing a child along the street, that's where the particulate matter is the highest.

254
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:23,134
And the other important thing to know is that, as I've mentioned before, risk exists at any level.

255
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:31,338
So the EPA has given a cutoff level of what they call satisfactory, but it turns out that we see health effects down to the very lowest level.

256
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:32,018
Next slide.

257
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,319
Nitrogen dioxide.

258
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:48,272
This is just a slide showing that the more nitrogen dioxide you have in the air, the more severe asthma reaction you're going to have.

259
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:58,036
It's interesting that you start to get effects at about a level of 10 parts per billion.

260
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:05,098
The safe cutoff for our EPA is 100.

261
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:18,220
So you're allowed to be exposed to a hundred parts per billion But as you can see you get symptoms far below that and it also just lists where gas stoves versus electric stoves Tend to emit.

262
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:31,203
I find that the most interesting thing about nitrogen dioxide when I was at a medical conference years ago one of my pulmonologist colleagues brought a really interesting contraption into the conference and I

263
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:42,631
and he had collected some really polluted air outside, just right outside the convention center, the air that we had been breathing until we walked in to go to this seminar.

264
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:54,979
And he brought it into the convention center, and he said, I have this really cool machine where I breathe it in, and then when I exhale, it can show all the different pollutants that are in the air that I've just breathed out.

265
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:00,403
So you guys can see the pollution in the air that I'm breathing in, and then in the air that I'm breathing out.

266
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:03,809
And actually, this data has been around since the 1960s.

267
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:08,190
There's an article in Nature that shows this happening back then, too.

268
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,731
And so he breathed in this extremely polluted air from outside.

269
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:18,912
And when he breathed out, how much nitrogen dioxide was in what he breathed out?

270
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:20,852
Nothing.

271
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:22,893
And what does that mean?

272
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:26,236
That means it's all in your lungs.

273
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:30,400
So he was nicely filtering it for the rest of us.

274
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,882
So think about that.

275
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:34,585
And that's why these kids are so affected.

276
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:36,107
They're really little.

277
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:40,712
They're breathing in all of these super irritants, and they're staying in their lungs.

278
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:41,533
Next slide.

279
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:46,819
So, it's sort of a recurrent theme now.

280
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,163
Children are exposed both to outdoor and indoor air pollution.

281
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:55,447
So, they're cumulative and that's something to remember too.

282
00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,031
And again, the predominant source indoors is your gas stove.

283
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:00,492
Next slide.

284
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:11,378
And often, indoor emissions from gas stoves exceed outside, outdoor regulatory standards.

285
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:18,460
Incredibly, there are no indoor air pollution standards for any pollutant whatsoever.

286
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
It isn't regulated.

287
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:21,481
Next slide, please.

288
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:26,336
Very important slide.

289
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:41,361
Gas stoves, if you don't use ventilation, if you have a house or an apartment that's less than 1,500 square feet, the nitrogen dioxide in your house is going to exceed regulatory standards 83% of the time.

290
00:34:42,142 --> 00:34:51,245
If you have a home or an apartment less than 1,000 square feet and you don't use ventilation, it's going to exceed regulatory standards

291
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:54,266
all the time, 100% of the time.

292
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:54,947
Next slide.

293
00:34:58,073 --> 00:35:00,857
Does cooking with gas increase asthma risk?

294
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,499
Yes, it does, 42%.

295
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:02,220
Next slide.

296
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:17,964
And the other really important thing to know, that just again, this data is just fresh from the last year, is that even when the stove isn't turned on, gas stoves leak.

297
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:20,366
And they leak bad stuff.

298
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:21,687
They don't just leak methane.

299
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:24,310
There was an article in the Boston Globe the other day about a woman

300
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:34,652
She lived in Dorchester and her little dog was lying on the sofa and it died because her gas stove was leaking methane and methane is an asphyxiant gas.

301
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:49,756
You go to Wikipedia and it says methane is an innocuous asphyxiant gas and I was like, well, innocuous means not harmful and asphyxiant means that you die from not being able to breathe and so you can't really say that it's both.

302
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:52,577
But it leaks.

303
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,237
Do you want me to wrap up?

304
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:04,880
Is it, okay, okay.

305
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:17,368
So another, so in addition to methane, which is an asphyxiant, killed the poor little puppy, but they don't just leak methane, they leak other stuff.

306
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:22,091
They leak something called benzene, which is a known cause of cancer.

307
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:32,699
It, like particulate matter, there's no safe level, it affects the nervous system, can cause birth defects, and it also leaks a bunch of other chemicals.

308
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:33,339
Next slide.

309
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,747
And by the way, it doesn't matter how expensive your stove is.

310
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:43,156
The cheapest stoves and the most expensive stoves leak.

311
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:47,646
And this is just an interesting slide.

312
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:53,849
So some people say, well, how do I know that I won't get all of these pollutants if I cook on an electric stove?

313
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:58,891
So this is a study showing whenever you burn anything, you're going to get some particulate matter.

314
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:12,917
But it's interesting that when you cook with gas, you get a lot more particulate matter, and you also get all those other pollutants, the nitrogen dioxide, the VOCs, which is benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide.

315
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:13,737
Next slide.

316
00:37:16,994 --> 00:37:23,963
The health cost, asthma costs on the order of like $80 billion in the US annually.

317
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:33,674
If you break that down to a per person per family cost for what you'll spend on asthma in a year, it comes out to some like $3,200 a year.

318
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,900
What's the cost of an electric stove?

319
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,342
Like $500 to $1,000.

320
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:55,393
So when you think about the health cost to society versus the cost of changing out that stove, maybe it's something to think about when your stove's ready to die.

321
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,334
Next slide.

322
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:09,634
I just thought I'd quote a bunch of interesting data that just came out like two weeks ago from a really great article in Science from both Harvard and Stanford researchers.

323
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:18,057
And they looked at both, because many people, there's another article that I quoted in there that I wrote a couple years ago.

324
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:22,060
People wrote to me afterwards saying, but what about propane gas?

325
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,285
Because we cook with propane gas, and is that as bad as methane gas, which most of us have?

326
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:30,347
And it turns out, yes, it is.

327
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:41,597
And they looked at the US as a whole, and they found that the pediatric asthma cases due to the nitrogen dioxide from gas and propane stoves is like 50,000 a year across the US.

328
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:59,849
But if you look at all the pollutants we just talked about, the benzene and the carbon monoxide and the nitrogen dioxide, it's more like 200,000 cases of pediatric asthma a year.

329
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:01,871
So that is a whopping number.

330
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,454
Mortality, they made a mortality estimate.

331
00:39:05,794 --> 00:39:11,859
They said up to 19,000 adult deaths annually from gas stove use in the U.S.

332
00:39:13,424 --> 00:39:16,788
pretty a whopping, and what's the mortality cost of that?

333
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:29,524
They said on the order of a billion dollars a year in the US, and actually then they broke it down to communities of color, and they found that the price tag was even higher.

334
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:40,008
The most concerning thing actually to me about this study was that they didn't just look at levels of these pollutants in the kitchen.

335
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:53,853
They went all over the house and they found that the levels of pollutants in the bedrooms were equally as elevated and they stayed elevated for hours after the gas stove was used.

336
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,474
So something else to think about.

337
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:56,734
Next slide.

338
00:39:58,624 --> 00:39:59,884
So what can we do about it?

339
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:06,305
Does ventilation help reduce nitrogen dioxide levels?

340
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,286
And the answer is a definite maybe.

341
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:10,806
It works if you use it.

342
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:20,488
I'm one of those people who, I didn't know this data till I was, till about 2017 or later.

343
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,789
And so in the winter when my kids were little, I used to put,

344
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:39,068
my ventilation like leaked like a sieve and you know this is Massachusetts it's cold so I've thought I was being really smart and I covered it with plastic, so that I wouldn't get a ton of cold air coming right through the vent from the outside.

345
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:50,581
And then my kids got asthma, and then I started reading about this data, and I thought, gosh, you know, I'm gonna take the cover, all that plastic I put on in the winter, off of my vent.

346
00:40:51,041 --> 00:41:06,825
And I didn't even run it that much, but because it created a constant draft, at the end of, my son was a big runner, and at the end of his cross country season, I was like, you know, I'm never at the end of the race, so I haven't seen you using your inhaler,

347
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:09,426
How many times did you use it this season?

348
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:12,108
And he was like, I didn't use it this season.

349
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,791
But the problem with ventilation is people don't like to use it.

350
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:26,767
I found at the end, right before our gas stove died, and I became more and more concerned.

351
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:36,010
I have to let you know that one of the researchers who carried out that Harvard study I mentioned, she uses an N95 mask when she cooks on her gas stove.

352
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,411
I don't think I could do that, because anyway, I don't think I could do that.

353
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:44,793
But I did start running my fan every single time I ran my gas stove.

354
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:48,334
And I noticed that the whole kitchen just cleared out.

355
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:57,161
Like I wanted quiet in the kitchen and I just turned on that fan, my husband was gone, the kids were gone, no one was in the kitchen, no one likes using the fan.

356
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,383
So that's a real problem is compliance.

357
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:02,146
People just don't use it, they don't like it, it's annoying, it's loud.

358
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:08,780
But it does work as long as it vents to the outside.

359
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:20,444
If it doesn't vent to the outside, if it's one of those fans that just recirculates things in the kitchen, those ones can actually end up with levels of pollution higher than what you started out with.

360
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,305
So those are really not good.

361
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:26,826
And then if you don't have a fan that goes to the outside, open a window.

362
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,867
Opening a window works great.

363
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:31,328
Next slide.

364
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:40,079
And so this is just a whole bunch of recommendations to install a carbon monoxide detector.

365
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:41,999
I recommend getting a pretty expensive one.

366
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,559
I didn't get an expensive one.

367
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,980
And our heat exchanger on our gas furnace died and melted.

368
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,961
And we ended up having carbon monoxide all over the house.

369
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,362
And our monitor never picked it up.

370
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,362
I smelled the weird burning smell, and I called the gas company.

371
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:58,223
And my family was like, what's the problem?

372
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,066
Well, the levels were really, really high.

373
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,327
That was the problem.

374
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:17,643
Opening a window, cooking on the back burners, using other electric appliances like a toaster oven or a kettle, a plug-in induction stove, and then ultimately, when you can and if you can, switching to an electric or an induction stove.

375
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:18,404
Next slide.

376
00:43:21,778 --> 00:43:33,027
So the proof in a lot of medical studies is, well, when you take whatever you think is causing a medical condition away, does it get better?

377
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:43,935
This is a really nice study in Ecuador showing that replacing gas stoves with induction stoves reduced markedly emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

378
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:44,556
Next slide.

379
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:53,071
And right now, there was also a study in the Bronx that showed the same thing.

380
00:43:53,831 --> 00:44:06,915
And now we have a study ongoing in collaboration with the BU School of Public Health in Dorchester, where they are looking at the environmental and health effects of replacing a gas stove with an electric one.

381
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:13,157
Now I should just mention, it's very interesting in the Bronx study, I don't have the data up here,

382
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:20,067
But it only reduced the air pollutants in the air by about 30%.

383
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:32,042
But I showed you in the earlier slide of gas stoves versus electric stoves, you know, when you go to an electric stove, it should take all of those air pollutants out.

384
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:33,484
And I think

385
00:44:34,178 --> 00:44:46,162
that tells us that the problem is in communities of color, if you take away the indoor air pollution, you still have the problem, which is that the outdoor air pollution didn't go away.

386
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:53,185
And so this gets at some of the problem, but we still have to face that whole problem.

387
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:53,725
Next slide.

388
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,235
So just a few takeaways.

389
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:06,219
Now you know gas stoves are the number one trigger for asthma and an indoor trigger in the state of Massachusetts.

390
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,643
And communities of color are disproportionately and unfairly burdened by that.

391
00:45:13,483 --> 00:45:16,065
What can we do to stop those negative health effects?

392
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:21,306
You can vent your stovetop emissions, but remember, they have to vent outside.

393
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:22,946
You can't just recirculate them.

394
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:24,607
Open your windows.

395
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:29,428
Keep the children, elderly people, people with asthma away from the stove while you're cooking.

396
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:35,389
I think a really important part of this, too, obviously is going to happen at the policy level.

397
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:41,350
This isn't mentioned much, but one thing I'm kind of passionate about is, you know,

398
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:49,837
There's external ventilation required for hot water heaters and your gas dryer.

399
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,220
You wouldn't think of venting that inside, right?

400
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,302
Or your gas furnace.

401
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,663
You wouldn't think of venting that inside.

402
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:58,145
Gas stoves used to vent outside.

403
00:45:58,566 --> 00:45:59,407
And at some point,

404
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:03,230
In the last 40 years, that changed.

405
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:08,575
And so I feel very strongly that gas stoves should vent outside.

406
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:11,878
I think putting a warning label on stoves.

407
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:19,646
There's a warning label on my hairdryer, like do not drop this into a tub when you're using it because there's a risk of electric shock.

408
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:30,751
I don't think 19,000 people die every year in the US because they've dropped their hair dryer in a bathtub and gotten an electric shock, and yet there's a label on it.

409
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:36,294
But 19,000 people a year die from gas stove exposure and there's no label on it.

410
00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:38,799
Where does that square up?

411
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:39,579
Dozen.

412
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:46,344
And then, obviously, replacing a gas stove with an electric or an induction when you need a new one.

413
00:46:46,964 --> 00:46:52,768
And then, most importantly, I think, is regulating air pollution, outdoor air pollution.

414
00:46:53,229 --> 00:47:02,555
Because yes, you can get rid of indoor air pollution, but if you don't regulate the outdoor one, and say, enforce the roadmap law that was just passed in Massachusetts a year and a half ago,

415
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:13,040
saying that we shouldn't be locating dirty incinerators and power plants, et cetera, in communities of color that are already overburdened by all of those.

416
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:17,322
It's time to make that all happen.

417
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:18,883
And that's all I have.

418
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:21,484
I have some resources, next slide.

419
00:47:22,504 --> 00:47:25,226
And then next slide, more resources.

420
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:29,008
So I'm happy to share those with you afterwards.

421
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:31,409
I don't, I should have brought a handout, but I didn't.

422
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:33,538
And I'm happy to take any questions.

423
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:37,880
You're all probably in shock.

424
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,940
You're like, oh no, the gas stove.

425
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,601
I love the gas stove.

426
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:42,221
I love gas stoves too.

427
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,742
But you get used to electric.

428
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:46,903
Yes.

429
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:50,584
So do you want to take her the mic?

430
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:50,844
Yeah.

431
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:57,615
So you mentioned the gas stove and the effect on asthma.

432
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:12,281
What about the heating system and, you know, the pipes that sometimes most landlords don't update and they are full of soot and, you know, sometimes

433
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:20,533
you can see it actually at the top of the ventilator spreading dust and you know, so that's another thing.

434
00:48:22,554 --> 00:48:32,401
I suffered from this, my older son, I lived in an apartment that had this problem and I noticed dark circles around his eyes.

435
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:41,487
Doctors mentioned something related to the ventilation system but they did not confirm or like,

436
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,906
initiate anything that you need to move from this apartment, you know?

437
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:54,575
Yeah, I think it's a huge problem, obviously, because it isn't just gas stoves, it's also gas furnaces.

438
00:48:54,595 --> 00:48:56,958
I had a gas furnace that was probably leaking

439
00:48:57,638 --> 00:49:06,603
carbon monoxide for a good six months before I realized it, and I noticed I never get headaches, and I was getting headaches every day.

440
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:15,727
I, my eyes, the whites of my eyes were kind of injected, they were red, and I was like, that's odd, I'm, you know, and I was tired all the time, I'm never tired.

441
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:16,488
And

442
00:49:17,508 --> 00:49:26,054
Later, I realized, oh my gosh, I was suffering from chronic carbon monoxide exposure because my gas furnace was releasing all of this stuff.

443
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:29,496
Gas furnaces can leak just like stoves leak.

444
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:31,217
So can hot water heaters.

445
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:46,768
They are also doing a study of gas leaks in houses across Massachusetts, and I had someone come to the house the other day as part of the study, and he just put his monitor over on the hot water heater, and I had smelled gas over at the hot water heater, and sure enough,

446
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:49,350
It was leaking gas and I got it fixed.

447
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:51,572
Thank you.

448
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:55,014
Other questions?

449
00:49:55,115 --> 00:49:55,895
Don't be shy.

450
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,723
So I had a question about using the back burners.

451
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:15,531
Is that because you're further away from and does the ventilation have anything to do with that?

452
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:18,606
it going outside as opposed to in the house?

453
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:25,470
My guess is that it is, first of all, you're farther away from the pollutants, so you're not getting it right in the face.

454
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,053
And second of all, when you're using a vent with a hood that's over the stove, then it lifts.

455
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:32,793
They work better.

456
00:50:33,274 --> 00:50:34,875
That works better on the back burners.

457
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:40,417
Other questions?

458
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:45,420
My question is, doesn't

459
00:50:47,082 --> 00:50:54,867
It's just the amount of gas stove that we have throughout, I mean, I don't say only Massachusetts, but everywhere.

460
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:59,010
It's much more, it's much greater than the electric stove.

461
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,652
Isn't that because of the price?

462
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,634
Electricity is more expensive than gas?

463
00:51:04,654 --> 00:51:12,559
Do you know that probably does have something to do with it?

464
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:12,879
Also,

465
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:17,186
But that's not the whole story, right?

466
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:19,229
Because what's the other part of the story?

467
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:21,551
It was heavily marketed.

468
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:29,199
I remember when I had just gotten married and I was talking to all my friends and everyone was like, oh.

469
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,283
All the chefs were coming out and saying, oh, cooking with gas is so much better.

470
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:38,824
And who were they being paid by?

471
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:41,045
The American Gas Association.

472
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:46,588
And so there at some point might have been a price point.

473
00:51:46,968 --> 00:51:53,831
I can't say that I really notice a difference with my electric stove versus my gas stove and the amount that it costs to run the stove.

474
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:27,608
Yeah, but think what you're saving in hospital bills.

475
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:28,889
Yeah.

476
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:33,898
Yeah.

477
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,443
It might have been at one point, but now I think that they're getting more efficient.

478
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:50,450
As I said, I have a newer model, and it doesn't, induction is very efficient, very, very efficient, and that uses electromagnetic waves.

479
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:59,217
Yes, I would just add that an induction cooktop like this is about half the cost to operate as a traditional electric stove.

480
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:01,976
And you don't have to buy the whole stove.

481
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,719
You can just buy the single burner that she has on display right there.

482
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:13,465
And that way you can, it's amazing how much you can get around not using your gas stove.

483
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:14,285
Yeah.

484
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:16,167
Other questions?

485
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:22,352
Yeah.

486
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:25,411
have to use the mic.

487
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:31,993
I think it's in that same vein with the economic burden on communities of color.

488
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:34,273
So how are there any resources?

489
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:45,036
I know there's like a program with the city of Dorchester and BU to the public health of like how much does it cost to upgrade from gas stove to electric stove?

490
00:53:46,315 --> 00:53:47,756
Would there be any resources for that?

491
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:50,057
That's an excellent question.

492
00:53:51,318 --> 00:54:02,885
I do believe that there is a government program, a Massachusetts program, Mass Save, $500 off buying an induction or electric stove or induction.

493
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:03,606
OK.

494
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:04,666
Yeah.

495
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:05,807
So there is.

496
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:15,990
And also to change to a heat pump, actually, if you want to change the form of your heating to an electric one.

497
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,811
There's a discount there, too.

498
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:20,893
Thank you.

499
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:22,234
That was a great presentation.

500
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:28,419
To you and Brenda, can you talk about the price points for the induction and how the MassSave program works?

501
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,382
So if you want to just purchase it outright or if you want to go through MassSave.

502
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:35,784
Thanks.

503
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:40,954
Yes, so a portable induction cooktop like this one is a little bit over $100.

504
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:51,683
A full-size stove with an induction cooktop is more expensive than a standard stove.

505
00:54:53,624 --> 00:55:00,409
It might be $1,000 more expensive, but with the mass-save rebate of $500, then it's $500 more expensive.

506
00:55:04,597 --> 00:55:08,259
I cooked on a portable induction cooktop like this for a year.

507
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:20,827
I occasionally would use my gas stove as a backup when I had to use multiple burners, but I was able to do this almost exclusively for a year.

508
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:33,655
Oh, I bought this on Amazon, but I think it's pretty available at like Home Depot's or Best Buy's or sorry, Best Buy's, things like that.

509
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:34,816
Yeah.

510
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:37,818
Good question.

511
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:38,418
Thank you.

512
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:41,920
We got another question.

513
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,120
Yes.

514
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,222
Do you have to buy a special pot to cook for the?

515
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:51,044
That is also a good question, and I'm sure Brenda could tell you more about that.

516
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:51,724
Yeah.

517
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:53,725
Sorry, I should just stay standing.

518
00:55:54,806 --> 00:56:02,870
So the pots do have to be magnetic because that's how this works is it creates a magnetic field that heats up just the metal in the pot.

519
00:56:03,504 --> 00:56:10,468
So stainless steel, cast iron, if you have ceramic with like metal inside of it, that would work.

520
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:14,870
But it wouldn't work with copper or glass or things like that.

521
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:17,611
But basically, you can test out your cookware.

522
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:20,293
If you have a magnet, just test your cookware.

523
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:22,494
If it sticks, then it'll work.

524
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,491
It's a really good question.

525
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:41,177
It's why we actually went with electric and not induction because my husband was like I'm not gonna give up on my favorite pots which we tested them with a magnet and they weren't magnetic so yeah Well, thank you all so much I

526
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,601
Thank you, Dr. Lundberg.

527
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:10,276
If you want to learn how to use an induction stove, Brenda will be right over and show you how to use it.

528
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,739
Yeah, absolutely.

529
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:43,542
Yeah, we basically put it on our website, and it's open for you to interact with us.

530
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:45,983
I'll give that to you later.

531
00:58:46,563 --> 00:58:47,704
Absolutely.

532
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,404
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,465
How's that?

534
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:51,205
Great.

535
00:58:51,245 --> 00:58:55,887
So is that, so do you work with the USDA, or is it?

536
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:53,857
Yeah, what am I being interrupted?

537
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:57,359
I mean, what are you gonna do?

538
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:59,060
Wait, what?

539
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,021
And it's not a big deal either.

540
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:07,284
The QR code, do we have the code up there too?

541
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:07,764
Yeah, yeah.

542
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:21,912
But I would love to get that info, because my parents have gas.

543
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:25,914
And I'm like, uh-uh.

544
01:00:26,094 --> 01:00:26,955
That's what I'm saying.

545
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:30,376
Like, $100, though, but then you have family.

546
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:31,877
How are you going to get gas?

547
01:00:56,259 --> 01:00:57,322
Thank you.

548
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:30,512
This is like really,

549
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,973
I hope you guys support a real work in progress.

550
01:02:24,594 --> 01:02:27,176
I wanted everyone to do their stuff, you know?

551
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,837
And plus, like, me, like, I tell everyone.

552
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:07,543
I don't have to go.

553
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:38,910
Yeah, I know.

554
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:15,954
I love you.

555
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:16,755
I love you.

556
01:04:54,538 --> 01:04:54,959
Thank you.

557
01:05:36,488 --> 01:05:38,990
So I'm just connecting the dots.

558
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,421
I'm telling the truth.

559
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:53,255
Thank you.

560
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:17,922
Yeah.

561
01:07:18,262 --> 01:07:18,542
Yeah.

562
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,441
You guys are gorgeous.

563
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,012
I know it's a big city.

564
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:55,661
Yeah.

565
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,803
Because I feel like people, when they say just Syria, they don't go to it.

566
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,325
But if they're specifically towards them, they'll even talk about it.

567
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:35,146
Because you know, it's more of a good area.

568
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:41,509
You know, that's a good message to send to the general public.

569
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:48,733
I would love to, but the average woman would walk up to me and say, you know, we have Syria, we're on it.

570
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:58,605
10 years from now?

571
01:09:58,645 --> 01:10:06,591
Little by little, because people will start talking about it, especially like now.

572
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:13,156
People are going to start talking about it next year.

573
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,497
We'll have more people.

574
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,020
That's all I got.

575
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,462
I just memorized one line.

576
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:08,295
Okay.

577
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:08,715
Yeah.

578
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:50,060
Thank you very much.
