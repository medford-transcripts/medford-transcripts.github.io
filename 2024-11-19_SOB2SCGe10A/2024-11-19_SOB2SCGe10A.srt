00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:10,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I, for one, am glad to see the storefront finally have somebody suitable to fill it.

110
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:13,486

111
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony might still be working there with you a little bit at the time.

112
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Or George, rather.

113
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,752
[SPEAKER_11]: George might be there with you.

114
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,094
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I'm glad to see someone was able to fill the storefront.

115
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:24,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish him the best of luck.

116
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And I move for approval of the paper.

117
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:27,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

118
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:28,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

119
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

120
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:31,459

[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Baxter.

128
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,422
[SPEAKER_17]: My question actually isn't for the petitioner.

129
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that we asked the city administration, you know, who provided the information that they could open before we- Mr. Clerk, if you want to make that part of the report, Councilor Baxter would like to know

130
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:01,440
[SPEAKER_07]: provided the gentleman with the information that he could open before he got his convictious license.

144
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:31,190

[SPEAKER_07]: A motion by Vice President Knight to revert back to regular business.

146
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:36,454
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

147
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:37,775
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

148
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:38,596

149
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,797

00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,300
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1, 4-1-3 offered by Councilor Marks.

151
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,564

152
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:50,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

153
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

154
00:06:54,311 --> 00:07:07,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I was contacted recently by a local resident that was very interested in obtaining a second meter for outdoor activities, water meter.

155
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:19,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And after doing a little research, Mr. President, it was found out that only those that have an underground irrigation system

156
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:28,016
[SPEAKER_09]: are allowed to benefit from the second meter, which does not add on the added cost for a sewer.

157
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:36,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And after looking at the actual application and reading the application, it seems to me

158
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,290
[SPEAKER_09]: the requirements by the city, Mr. President.

159
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:55,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, I'm going to respectfully ask that the Water and Sewer Commissioners meet again, Mr. President, to discuss opening up the second water meter to all residents.

160
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:59,297
[SPEAKER_09]: This irrigation program was established in 2010.

161
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:06,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first phase was to open it up to residential water meters

162
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,300
[SPEAKER_09]: strictly for underground irrigation.

163
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:19,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, it was stated, Mr. President, that this was going to be phase one of the program back in 2010.

164
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:25,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And here we are 11 years later, and there's never been another phase rolled out.

165
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a commercial property in the community, you are currently not eligible.

166
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are a property owner, that doesn't happen to have, like my property,

167
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:40,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an underground irrigation system, but I do use a hose.

168
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes I may do it by hand.

169
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:48,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I may put out one of those little devices that sprinkles water around.

170
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:53,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And like many of us, some people water their garden.

171
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:56,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people fill their pool up.

172
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, the same principle applies.

173
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,635
[SPEAKER_09]: If that water is not finding its way back into the sewer system,

174
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:16,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, you know, the whole idea of setting this up was to give taxpayers a relief, a rate relief from using water outside of their home.

175
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:23,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole intent was to provide that relief to those who do that, Mr. President.

176
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:40,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think expanding the program after 11 years, I think we have a good handle on how many people have taken advantage of this program and look at the metrics regarding how this is working out, what has been the cost, because there is a cost not only to the resident,

177
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:52,862
[SPEAKER_09]: that's putting in a second meter, but there's also a cost to those who pay water and sewer in the community, because as we all know, Mr. President, when the water comes into the community, it's meted.

178
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:55,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's giant meters that show how much water is coming in.

179
00:09:56,064 --> 00:10:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: The MWRA assesses us through what's coming into the community.

180
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So they don't look and say, well, you're using the water outside, using it inside.

181
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,172
[SPEAKER_09]: The MWRA doesn't care.

182
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:17,377
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Medford created that program which allows us to give people, if you want to call it a reduction or abatement, on the sewer for consumption outside.

183
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there is a cost to all of us regarding this meter program.

184
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:29,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think this program, Mr. President, in all honesty, should be expanded.

185
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:34,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to me, we should be looking at just people that have an underground irrigation system.

186
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:37,648
[SPEAKER_09]: we should be looking at anyone that uses outside water.

187
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:42,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I would like to do, Mr. President, I have a copy of the application.

188
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:47,753
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of residents aren't even familiar that there's a program that exists.

189
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:50,414
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's an irrigation meter application.

190
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:54,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The fee is $300 to fill out this fee.

191
00:10:54,957 --> 00:11:02,721
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it goes on to give you the guidelines for the residential irrigation installation.

192
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:15,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for edification, Mr. President, I think people should be aware if they are interested, the city allows irrigation meters on in-ground irrigation systems for residential accounts only.

193
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:21,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Applications are taken in order they are received and will be handled by the water division at their discretion.

194
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:34,973
[SPEAKER_09]: All applicants must pass a pre-installation inspection and follow the guidelines for basic residential irrigation meter installation and requirements as stated on the application.

195
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:44,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you can see from this particular guideline, you have to have an underground irrigation system.

196
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:48,736
[SPEAKER_09]: The first requirement is a licensed plumber must obtain a permit

197
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:53,307
[SPEAKER_09]: at the building department in order to install this meter.

198
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,948
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't install it yourself.

199
00:11:56,109 --> 00:12:01,673
[SPEAKER_09]: A certified and tested backflow device must be furnished at the customer's expense.

200
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:06,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Customers must maintain the backflow prevention assembly on the irrigation system

201
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,462
[SPEAKER_09]: to ensure protection of the portable water supply with yearly inspections.

202
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:19,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Backflow tests are conducted by the engineering division, and the current fee for inspection is $60 annually.

203
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:26,851
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a $300 charge for the meter itself, and then there's a $60 annual charge.

204
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:30,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't use a lot of outside water,

205
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:38,239
[SPEAKER_09]: depending on what you're using, it may not be worthwhile from a financial standpoint to partake in this program.

206
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So you really have to sit down and figure out how much watering you're doing outside in order if this makes financial sense.

207
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:51,608
[SPEAKER_09]: All irrigation systems must comply with all local and state landscape irrigation regulations.

208
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:55,270
[SPEAKER_09]: All pipes from the service through the irrigation meter

209
00:12:55,948 --> 00:13:00,771
[SPEAKER_09]: and three feet past the backflow preventer must be brass or copper material.

210
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,373
[SPEAKER_09]: No plastic galvanized or cast iron pipes are allowed.

211
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: New and existing dwellings may split the service connection for irrigation with backflow device that has a T or a Y split to separate domestic and irrigation water.

212
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:26,440
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Medford metering division is not responsible for pressure loss or consumption and volume issues resulting from the split connection.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,785
[SPEAKER_09]: The meter and the reading device are issued by the city and the price is included in the application fee.

214
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:42,851
[SPEAKER_09]: All pipes from the irrigation meter must be inspected to ensure that there are no cross connections between domestic and irrigation lines.

215
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:47,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You must install shut off valves before and after the new irrigation meter.

216
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:52,268
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty much what the rules and regulations are, Mr. President.

217
00:13:52,789 --> 00:14:14,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I would respectfully ask on behalf of the many hundreds, if not thousands of residents that water their lawn, that tend to their gardens, that fill their pool, and use a hose outside for a number of different reasons, that I respectfully ask the Water and Sewer Commission to expand the program currently to all residents

218
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:26,628
[SPEAKER_09]: if need be, Mr. President, and also go into phase two, which would allow for the commercial application of outside irrigation as well, Mr. President.

219
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So I respectfully put that in the form of a motion, and I thank you.

220
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:43,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, if you could amend that for me, if the Water Commission could look into the program that the City of Revere uses.

221
00:14:44,596 --> 00:15:01,830
[SPEAKER_07]: They have, for their residents, not a big user, but they have a meter that goes onto the spigot, they charge them a nominal fee to rent for the season, and you put it on your outside spigot, and at the end of the season, you turn it in and you pay

222
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: for the water that you use for your outside water.

223
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:11,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't cost any money for any plumbing or any of the, it doesn't cost $100 in plumbing fees to put it in.

224
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:17,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And they see it seems to be working well, but say it's just a, it's a meter that goes onto your outside spigot.

225
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the season, you bring it back, you turn it back in and they charge you for whatever water you use through that.

226
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:26,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'm not opposed to looking at that and amending the resolution.

227
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:30,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would respectfully add that in addition to my motion,

228
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:45,954
[SPEAKER_09]: that the Water and Sewer Commissioners look at the city of Revere and how they use an outside meter for residents that does not incur the cost of hiring a plumber, as well as other associated costs.

229
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate that.

230
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot easier for the residents to use.

231
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:51,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

232
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You make it this.

233
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't make it.

234
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:59,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So any further discussion?

235
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:04,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

236
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

237
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:08,566
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

238
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

239
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:13,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

240
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:28,577
[SPEAKER_07]: 21414, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford Fire Deputy Chief of Operations, Brian Conan, be congratulated on his retirement and for his commitment and dedication for serving the residents of Medford for over 40 years.

241
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:30,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

242
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

243
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I rise today with all due respect and honor for one of methods.

244
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:53,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Finest Brian Cronin for anyone that knows Brian has served this city with distinction for 42 years, Mr. President, over four decades of an impeccable record, uh, protecting the life and property of our citizens.

245
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,448
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't meet a kinder,

246
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:02,295
[SPEAKER_09]: gentle a person, Mr. President, everyone that I've spoken to that it has seen this on the agenda.

247
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:09,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the first words out of their mouth were we're sad to see such a man of character leave.

248
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:14,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm hoping, Mr. President, that he comes back in other capacities.

249
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:31,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just talking about, and I didn't mention this to Brian, but we were just talking about emergency preparedness and how that position for a number of years has been somewhat of a stipend side position that's gone unnoticed.

250
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's such an important role in this community.

251
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:39,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And respectfully, I'd love to see Brian come back as the emergency preparedness

252
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,280
[SPEAKER_09]: head in our community.

253
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:52,924
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, Mr. President, Brian is retiring as the Deputy Chief of Operations, a very high post within the Medford Fire Department.

254
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian came to us September 13, 1979.

[SPEAKER_09]: The woman was 34 weeks along in her pregnancy with her twins.

268
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:09,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Her water had broken and a breach delivery was imminent with a single leg presentational and umbilical cord wrapped around the left hip and leg.

269
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: The mother was placed in the delivery position and the right foot presented itself.

270
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:18,763
[SPEAKER_09]: The patient was allowed to push and the baby's torso delivered easily.

271

272
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:33,408
[SPEAKER_09]: The baby was suction dried, but was lethargic with the heartbeat and a severe respiratory distress close to cardiac arrest.

273
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:39,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Stimulation and additional suctioning of the baby's airway made some improvement.

274
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:43,676
[SPEAKER_09]: The baby was resuscitated with a bag valve mask.

275
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:56,041
[SPEAKER_09]: With paramedics now on the scene, this was accomplished with the umbilical cord still attached, with all personnel working in very close quarters, and the second baby beginning to crown.

276
00:20:57,282 --> 00:21:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: After several minutes of manual restitution, the baby began to breathe spontaneously.

277

00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:09,737
[SPEAKER_09]: With direction from chief and welcome assistance from the department members, improved EMS equipment and training shortly followed.

290
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:34,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian is a member of the Medford Fire Department Honor Guard, Secretary of the Medford Firefighters Relief Association from 2003 to present, and the Medford Firefighters Memorial Sunday Service Committee, 2002 to present, which many members of this council, along with the public, were present to honor deceased firefighters, Mr. President.

291
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,950
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally want to thank all our brave firefighters

292
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:55,214
[SPEAKER_09]: But in particular, Mr. President, the Deputy Captain of Operations, Deputy Chief Brian Cronin, who is not only a firefighter, Mr. President, he is a close friend to many.

293
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:57,858
[SPEAKER_09]: and he's gonna be sorely missed, Mr. President.

294
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:20,195
[SPEAKER_09]: His professionalism, the way he carried himself, the way he made every firefighter, no matter what position he served, all the way up to deputy chief, Mr. President, he made every firefighter, whether you're on the job for one day or on it for 40 years, like himself, he respected and made them all feel welcome and at home.

295
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:27,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And truly, it's firefighters like Brian Cronin that make the family of firefighters what they are today.

296
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:46,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask that on behalf of this council, that we honor Brian by giving Brian a council accommodation for his 42 years of dedicated service to the life and property of the Medford residents.

297
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:52,171
[SPEAKER_09]: and for conducting himself in a manner that we can all be proud of, Mr. President.

298
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you.

299
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:55,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

300
00:24:55,856 --> 00:24:58,638
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward.

301
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:05,584
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, uh, thank Brian Cronin for his years of dedication for over 40 years is quite an accomplishment.

302
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,547
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you heard from Councilor Marks, a very, very successful career.

303
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:16,493
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank him for his service to our community and thank him for answering all the questions that we've had through the years.

304
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:18,135
[SPEAKER_20]: I know he's always been there to answer questions.

305
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:26,351
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's always done a great job organizing the annual firefighters event at Oak Grove Cemetery.

306
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:30,315
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to thank Brian for his many years of service and wish him well in his retirement.

307
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:30,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

308
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:31,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Nate.

309
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

310
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Councilor Marks, for putting this resolution on this evening.

311
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:43,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian's someone I've grown to know and respect over the years in public service, and he's someone that's going to be sorely missed.

312
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:56,490
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go down to the South Medford Fire Station, for example, and you talk about the EMS procurement, you'll see Brian's handiwork right there, where they've set up a whole entire room dedicated to the materials and supplies that they purchase for EMS in first response.

313
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks also highlighted Brian's work with the Onagad.

314
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:09,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And there hasn't been an event in this community that hasn't had the metric fight of Amazon and God participating in one way or another, giving back to the community.

315
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:14,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I can't thank Brian enough for his four decades of service.

316
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,529
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to certainly be missed.

317
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish him all the best of luck in his retirement.

318
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:19,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

319
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

320
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:29,911
[SPEAKER_19]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and for also taking the time to read all those career highlights and accolades, which are much deserved.

321
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:39,016
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't had the fortune of knowing Deputy Chief Cronin as long as others, but in my short time of knowing him, I found everything Councilor Marks said to be true.

322
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:42,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Just be an incredibly kind, gracious, service-oriented person.

323
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:48,422
[SPEAKER_19]: And Medford has been lucky to have him for 40 years, and I thank him for his service for 40 years, and I wish him all the best in retirement.

324
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:50,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Scott belly.

325
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:56,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think Council marks bring this forward and it speaks volumes way.

326
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:09,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's talking about it so I all I can add is one thing I realized when I first joined the council and when I was coaching and we had issues and, and Mr. Cronin was involved.

327
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:11,386
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the fireman's fireman.

328
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've, I've met a fireman that loves being a fireman more than, uh, deputy chief Cronin.

329
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:29,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, um, and you could see it with his, with his efforts, you know, uh, not just with the emergency situations, but just the way he carries himself.

330
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:37,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, he's a great role model for these new, new firefighters that are starting off and, um, he will be missed.

331
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:43,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wish him luck after 40 years of, uh, uh, works in dedication city Medford.

332
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:51,441
[SPEAKER_04]: and it is time to enjoy retirement and he definitely did his service for the resident city of Medford.

333
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

334
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:53,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Best.

335
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:59,768
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward and all my fellow councilors for their kind words.

337
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:06,094
[SPEAKER_17]: I was really moving to hear from Brian at the memorial ceremony a couple Sundays ago.

338
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:24,591
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the introduction, I think you actually, I went through many of his awards and commendations that were mentioned in his introduction, but it was really clear to see the support and camaraderie he had with his fellow firefighters, which I think you can only gain through all the service that he's provided to our community.

339
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,134
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you again for bringing this forward and congratulations to Brian.

340
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:29,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

341
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And on behalf of myself,

342
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian is a true professional and a true gentleman.

343
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter when you see him, whenever you talk to him, he's just a great person.

344
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, Councilor Marks brought up his long record of accomplishments throughout the community.

345
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:53,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And our fire department is gonna miss a gentleman like him that has been there for four decades of service.

346
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:59,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope there's somebody that is able and has the qualifications to step into

347
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:03,430
[SPEAKER_07]: those shoes, because those are one big pair of shoes to fill.

348
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much.

349
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And Councilor MAXX, do you have a date on his retirement?

350
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say it's at the end of this month, but I don't have the exact date.

351
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will invite him up here for accommodation?

352
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:17,882
[SPEAKER_07]: If he'd like to come up, sure.

353
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,844
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to invite him up for accommodation, that'd be great.

354
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:20,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

355
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Councilor MAXX, seconded

356
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by Councilor Falco.

357
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

358
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:29,272
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

359
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

360
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1, 4-1-5 offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Marks being so resolved that the Medford City Council recognize Maria Ryanessa, owner and operator of Bella Scarpelli Salon on the momentous occasion of the business 15th anniversary.

361
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:48,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Senior Councilor Marks.

362
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, at this time, I will defer to Councilor Knight.

363
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

364
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

365
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. President, thank you.

366
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:59,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Just this past week, Bella Scarpelli celebrated their 50th anniversary.

367
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:08,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And Maria Ryan-Essar is someone that I've known for a very long time, a high school classmate of mine, who's been a very successful business owner in this city now for a decade and a half.

368
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:12,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that warrants a little bit of recognition, Mr. President.

369
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:18,811
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife has used their services, a number of occasions and she comes back looking more and more beautiful each time.

370
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:23,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't thank Maria and her staff enough for the work that they do down there.

371
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:28,737
[SPEAKER_11]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I would yield my time to Councilor Marks but congratulations to Maria and her staff.

372
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

373
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:39,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone that knows the INS of family know them as outstanding method residents.

374
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:49,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, a family that's been involved in this community for decades, giving of themselves at all different levels.

375
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:54,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Maria has been a tremendous business owner in this community

376
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,871
[SPEAKER_09]: giving back at many, many events.

377
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:06,237
[SPEAKER_09]: She is the first to step forward and make donations when necessary or when asked to, uh, go over and above the call of duty.

378
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:14,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria, INS is the first to volunteer, Mr. President, and I think that comes from her parents and the way she was brought up.

379
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:19,445
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm not mistaken, I also believe she's a proud vocational.

380
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:22,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe she went to the cosmetology

381
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:37,119
[SPEAKER_09]: at the method vocational technical high school, Mr. President, where she learned her craft and it's evident in the type of business that she runs and the product that she puts out.

382
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:44,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, anyone that comes out of there is coming out with a hairstyle that is second to none.

383
00:31:44,644 --> 00:31:45,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and

384
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:52,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to congratulate her on her 15 years and wish her another 50 years of success in our community.

385
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor MUX.

386
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:56,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:56,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

388
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:59,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thank you for my fellow Councilors bringing this forward.

389
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:08,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know the Inessa family, and when you talk about a Medford family and keeping their business in the community,

390
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: and thriving like it has and what they've given back to the community is a blessing and we share those celebrations with them and congratulate them.

391
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Two things though, I know that Councilor Knight's wife doesn't watch this, so it's impressive that he used such great compliments even though she's not watching.

392
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:29,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, they still couldn't do anything with my hairdo.

393
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've tried, if anybody knows a hair salon that can do anything with this, just let me know.

394
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

395
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,239
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:44,980
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

397
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:53,122
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's great to see someone that grew up in the community decide to open a business here in the community and a successful business at that.

398
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:59,563
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to wish them congratulations on their 50th anniversary and also wish them well for a successful future.

399
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:00,203
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

400
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

401
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:05,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I want to congratulate Maria.

402
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:12,027
[SPEAKER_07]: like Councilor Fletcher said, she grew up in the community, went to school in the community, and chose to operate a business here.

403
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:26,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor Marks is right, she gets her roots from her mother and father, who were long-time residents here, and I just want to thank her for her commitment to City of Method, and congratulations, and hopefully another 15 more years of business here.

404
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:27,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

405
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,894
[SPEAKER_11]: by me, seconded by Councilor Falco.

406
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,016
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

407
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:37,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

408
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:38,820
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

409
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:39,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Ayes have it.

410
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:44,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper 21416 offered by President Caraviello.

411
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:53,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council amend the current parking ordinance pertaining to private ways to allow resident only parking and allow the police to enforce it.

412
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

413
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

414
00:33:56,162 --> 00:34:08,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, for the neighbors who live down by the lakes, Pine Ridge, Oak Ridge, Sagamore, Pitcher, that whole area down there, every weekend,

415
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,567
[SPEAKER_07]: they get inundated with cars.

416
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:17,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not one or two cars, but hundreds of cars that it's barely passable for people to get by there.

417
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:23,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been going on for many years, but it seems over the last couple of years, it's gotten a lot worse than it has.

418
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:28,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not so much but the parking, but it's what's happening when people leave.

419
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,964
[SPEAKER_07]: They're leaving trash in people's yards.

420
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:33,665
[SPEAKER_07]: They're leaving trash all over the parkway.

421
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:38,775
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, diapers and everything, it's not fair to these people.

422
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:53,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's not just the residents of that end, but it's also the residents that live up by the fells, on Governor's Ave every weekend, they're inundated with the cars and people from, you know, going into the fells with bikes and everything.

423
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:02,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I guess that's the price we pay for having something, you know, as popular as the lake and the fells.

424
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:04,143
[SPEAKER_07]: But going back down to the,

425
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,837
[SPEAKER_07]: to the lakes and down that area.

426
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,722
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower lake is not supposed to be for swimming or anything.

427
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:18,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think at this point, we need to reach out to Representative Gobley.

428
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:29,400
[SPEAKER_07]: to have the environmental police come down there on the weekends to start patrolling that area and make them knock and say, you wanna use the beach?

429
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the beach area.

430
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,082
[SPEAKER_07]: But every year there's an accident up there.

431
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:41,166
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go through the woods, it's littered with cans and toilet paper and diapers.

432
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:42,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a mess.

433
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:47,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the opportunity to drive down there at 5.30 on Monday morning.

434
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:56,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole stretch of that Mystic Valley Parkway was just littered with cases of beer and bags of trash or anything.

435
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:57,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a shame.

436
00:35:57,997 --> 00:36:09,702
[SPEAKER_07]: But aside from that, we've had meetings down there with the residents, the mayor, the police, and I can't seem to come up with a solution.

437
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:10,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief doesn't want to do anything.

438
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:14,364
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't take it in tow because there's no signs posted.

439
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: and we don't have an ordinance to allow us to do that.

440
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:27,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So after the last meeting we had last week, it was suggested that city council have the solicitor

441
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,701
[SPEAKER_07]: draw up a language to amend the current private way parking ordinance they were having.

442
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,362
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the Kim, it's not that big of a deal.

443
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Two or three sentences get added on to that ordinance.

444
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can get it, hopefully get it out this week and get it back soon before the summer break, give these people that live in these neighborhoods some much needed help.

445
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:55,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I say, because it's not fair to them every Saturday and Sunday that they had to, you know, you drive through the Winchester end

446
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,282
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a car parked on that over there.

447
00:36:58,063 --> 00:37:03,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a shame that there's not more parking down that way.

448
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:09,453
[SPEAKER_07]: The DCR has land to maybe put some more parking down there, and maybe they should do that at some point.

449
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:14,218
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, it's just not fair that every week these residents have to suffer down there.

450
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm tired of going down there when I'm getting the calls and being a policeman for them.

451
00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:24,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I ask my fellow councilors to support this.

452
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's some people here that may want to speak on that.

453
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

454
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

455
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Council President Cavill for bringing this up.

456
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:35,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I've talked to a few neighbors and they're appalled.

457
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that changing this ordinance might help.

458
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:54,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that we should look into, I know Council Member Marks has brought this up for years, looking at our private ways in general in our community and the lack of funding we're losing because they're not being charged to our roads and streets here for federal reimbursement.

459
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that it's important that maybe we call for

460
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:12,005
[SPEAKER_04]: either a subcommittee, a committee of the whole soon to visit this ordinance in general, and look at the negatives of having that in place and trying to weigh the pros and cons.

461
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:21,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that might be the beginning, but I think that this has to be something that we reach out to the director of DCR as well.

462
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:23,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can't send him,

463
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:38,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who it is, they change them every month, but send out communications DCI director that enlightens them on what's going on in that area, because it's obviously it's being used for recreational purposes.

464
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:42,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And if those, you know,

465
00:38:44,687 --> 00:39:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: cars that are coming and families that are showing up and those parties that are throwing in our residential neighborhoods, if they're giving different outlets in different areas where they are approved to recreate and we can help them with that, that might be something we can move them along.

466
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think something has to be done because the neighborhood is failing it.

467
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:10,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that some of the music and the noise and

468
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: heard gunshots.

469
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: One person told me, I mean, it sounds like it's like the okay corral down there and it's something that we really have to stand up.

470
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:33,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Councilor Caraviello has been the active de facto sheriff and going down there, but it shouldn't be a city councilor that's going down to support and help our neighbors in that area.

471
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:33,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that

472
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:46,000
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to really get our state delegates involved and other state agencies to get involved to make sure that we find some solutions to move these these groups out of there because it's really deteriorating that neighborhood.

473
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

474
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:49,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

475
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

476
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:54,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank President Caraviello for bringing this forward tonight.

477
00:39:54,963 --> 00:39:58,765
[SPEAKER_20]: I have two received calls regarding this issue, and this needs to be addressed.

478
00:39:58,845 --> 00:39:59,786
[SPEAKER_20]: It's long overdue.

479
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:11,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I know Councilor Caraviello mentioned previously there was a meeting that the administration held, and I know that it was sponsored by the administration.

480
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,655
[SPEAKER_20]: We weren't invited to the meeting.

481
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:14,695
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish I knew about it.

482
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:18,498
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have loved to have been there, but we weren't invited to it.

483
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:20,199
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is an issue that needs to be addressed.

484
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:34,506
[SPEAKER_20]: There are many quality of life issues here with regard to noise, safety, when you talk about gunshots, I've heard about drug use, I've heard about trash, grills, the possibility of fire, people swimming where they're not supposed to be swimming.

485
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:39,588
[SPEAKER_20]: These are quality of life issues that are impacting residents and the residents should not have to deal with this.

486
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:43,750
[SPEAKER_20]: Not only the quality of life issues, these are public health issues.

487
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:50,003
[SPEAKER_20]: the people going to the bathroom in the woods from what I hear, this is just unacceptable.

488
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:51,704
[SPEAKER_20]: It needs to be dealt with.

489
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:59,406
[SPEAKER_20]: The administration needs to help out with either calling the state delegation or calling the environmental police or the state police at the very least.

490
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:03,747
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to amend the resolution to add that the

491
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,857
[SPEAKER_20]: state police step up their patrols on the weekends and make sure that this is dealt with immediately.

492
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:17,531
[SPEAKER_20]: I think as far as the ordinance being adjusted to allow resident only parking and allow the police to enforce it,

493
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:19,014
[SPEAKER_20]: I fully support that.

494
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:27,300
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it'd be nice to discuss it, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli said, just to see if there's any additional safeguards that we can place in this, but this needs to be dealt with.

495
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,360
[SPEAKER_20]: It's long overdue.

496
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:32,924
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said previously, the residents should not have to deal with this.

497
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:37,847
[SPEAKER_20]: So I second the resolution that was offered by Councilor, President Caraviello.

498
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:38,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

499
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:41,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Morell.

500
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:45,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you President Caravelle for bringing this forward.

501
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:48,944
[SPEAKER_19]: As Councilor Falco mentioned there's a number of issues going on here I have.

502
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:55,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Great concern with the public safety issues in public health between the trash and the swimming and the open fires.

503
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:59,759
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been reaching out to DCR probably as long as I've lived here about the trash in that area.

504
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:07,640
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems they have a carry and carry out policy, which essentially in practice is just carry and leave wherever you can find it in bags wherever else.

505
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,402
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a major issue and I would love to have our state delegation help and see what we can do there because you can see it with your own eyes.

506
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:16,842
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't something that can be ignored.

507
00:42:16,862 --> 00:42:20,003
[SPEAKER_19]: If anyone from DCR ever drives by, they can see all the challenges that are faced.

508
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:22,041
[SPEAKER_19]: public health, public safety, and otherwise.

509
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:27,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I do have concerns just about the private ways as far as enforcement.

510
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:38,924
[SPEAKER_19]: It's my understanding by state statute that because these aren't accepted as public ways, we can't use city money for the police to enforce parking on that.

511
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:43,705
[SPEAKER_19]: I support Councilor Scarpelli as far as moving to a committee of the whole and just exploring this.

512
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:49,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I would be interested in because the ideal way to do this is these streets become accepted as public ways,

513
00:42:50,418 --> 00:43:00,606
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could get just insight from this, the city engineer the traffic engineer, or the process of accepting these private ways as public ways so we can enforce them as such.

514
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:09,292
[SPEAKER_19]: And if there's a priority list, or you know any process that exists already for moving a number of these private ways that have a number of issues.

515
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:11,465
[SPEAKER_19]: And accepting them as public ways.

516
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:20,317
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do just want to read also from the Commission on parking and policy and enforcement, they did address this issue and one of the recommendations was.

517
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:26,625
[SPEAKER_19]: to consider a program where residents of private ways can enforce parking by towing, which is allowable by the state statute.

518
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:36,169
[SPEAKER_19]: This program would allow residents of private ways to file a permit notifying the city of the preferred tow company for that private way to tow away vehicles parked illegally on that private way.

519
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:38,830
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess this is a program that's done in Somerville.

520
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:48,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford isn't alone in having private ways, but we are specific to having very desirable private ways for parking for a number of resources within the city.

521
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,961
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would love to have that committee of the whole to really talk this through and address this.

522
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:53,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

523
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:57,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you recognize Councilor Bears?

524
00:43:58,223 --> 00:43:59,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

525
00:43:59,824 --> 00:44:01,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to my fellow councilors.

526
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:05,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear what Councilor Morell is saying about the legal issue.

527
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:10,088
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like Solicitor Scanlon to confirm that we are allowed to take this short-term step.

528
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,009
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like she thinks we are, which is good.

529
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:17,979
[SPEAKER_17]: I was driving through there on a Saturday recently, and it is bonkers.

530
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:21,220
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there are so many people down there, more than I've ever seen before.

531
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can really tell because there are multiple ice cream trucks up at Shannon Beach, and they're really taking advantage of it too.

532
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:32,924
[SPEAKER_17]: It took me 10, 15 minutes to get from the circle at High Street up into Winchester.

533
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:37,305
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a huge volume of people up there every weekend.

534
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,511
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what everyone has said is accurate.

535
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:54,577
[SPEAKER_17]: The piece that I really just wanna make sure we take on is even if we are able to implement the short-term solution, we can't forget the long-term solution and really addressing this larger issue of private ways, because at the end of the day, what Councilor Scarpelli said is correct.

536
00:44:54,637 --> 00:45:05,082
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna end up spending city resources on enforcing this issue, but not getting the money from Chapter 90, not getting the money back for the large volume of private ways that we have.

537
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:08,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly I support whatever we can do to address this immediately.

538
00:45:08,503 --> 00:45:16,787
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems like the situation is way out of hand and it got that way pretty quickly, but I agree with Councilor Morell.

539
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:23,270
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to have some sort of committee of the whole on the long-term situation with private ways in our community as well.

540
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:23,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

541
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:32,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

542
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:33,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

543
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:38,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda.

544
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I come from a little different train of thought, Mr. President.

545
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:56,827
[SPEAKER_09]: These are method streets and the fact that it may be a private way, in my opinion, has zero bearing on the responsibility of the city

546
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,291
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure public nuisance and public safety issues are not addressed.

547
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:09,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a cop-out to be quite honest with you.

548
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:13,653
[SPEAKER_09]: 40% of our 719 streets in this community are private way.

549
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:15,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we saying?

550
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:18,594
[SPEAKER_09]: 40% of our streets we can't enforce on.

551
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:20,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

552
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:24,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been talking about this issue for years.

553
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:26,016
[SPEAKER_09]: No one wants to discuss it.

554
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,872
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is an issue, Mr. President.

555
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:40,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as I'm concerned, if I was the CEO, which would have happened where there would have been signs posted all in those streets stating resident only.

556
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:49,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have had the tow trucks out there and the cops out there ticketing immediately and worry about it after the fact.

557
00:46:50,283 --> 00:46:56,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what we're doing is providing parking for people that want to use the DCR land.

558
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So we essentially become the parking lot.

559
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,436
[SPEAKER_09]: DCR's not providing parking.

560
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: We are.

561
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:08,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a cop-out to say, well, it's a private road.

562
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:10,011
[SPEAKER_09]: What benefit?

563
00:47:10,091 --> 00:47:10,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask any of the neighbors.

564
00:47:11,272 --> 00:47:13,452
[SPEAKER_09]: What benefit do you have living on a private road?

565
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:16,614
[SPEAKER_09]: You have zero benefit.

566
00:47:16,854 --> 00:47:20,636
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay the same tax as everyone else, and you get zero benefit.

567
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:25,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they're unable to give tickets on a private road, why are we plowing?

568
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:27,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's city money.

569
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,139
[SPEAKER_09]: That's city resources.

570
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,600
[SPEAKER_09]: We're allowed to plow?

571
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:34,902
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that has zero bearing.

572
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:40,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there was leadership in the community, they would have acted immediately, Mr. President.

573
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's no different as what's happening at the top of Governor's Ave.

574
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:46,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no difference.

575
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:52,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, it upsets me because I think the city should be the first to step up.

576
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:55,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Worry about the consequences after the fact.

577
00:47:56,694 --> 00:47:57,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a message.

578
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:58,696
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to tolerate it.

579
00:48:00,036 --> 00:48:02,278
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to allow you to invade our neighborhoods.

580
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:07,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to allow you to have cookouts in front of someone's home and leave debris behind.

581
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:12,299
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to allow you to change out of your bathing suit in front of our home.

582
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to allow public drinking.

583
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the message that has to be sent, not that we're worried if we give a ticket out because, oh, it's a private way.

584
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's baloney.

585
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That's absolute baloney.

586
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:33,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And to hide behind that, Mr. President, is shirking your duties, as far as I'm concerned.

587
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:36,684
[SPEAKER_09]: These residents, they're right.

588
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:39,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been going through this for years, for years.

589
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it takes an ordinance change, fine.

590
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's going to do it all, Mr. President.

591
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:49,481
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a serious issue with over the years, over the last 50, 60, 70 years,

592
00:48:51,593 --> 00:49:02,883
[SPEAKER_09]: when this city was being built up and so forth, that the city at the time allowed them to make private ways, Mr. President, because they didn't want to go through the acceptance process to accept a street.

593
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:09,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was done for a number of reasons, because some of these streets, Mr. President, didn't have the proper infrastructure.

594
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:13,572
[SPEAKER_09]: You go up the heights, a lot of them didn't have the proper drainage.

595
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,432
[SPEAKER_09]: and they tapped into the sewer system where they shouldn't have been.

596
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:28,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of these roads were created as paper roads and private ways because the city wasn't, for years, didn't really follow through on this, Mr. President.

597
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,144
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason why.

598
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:33,227
[SPEAKER_09]: If a road still wants to be a private way, fine.

599
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:39,433
[SPEAKER_09]: But we should send out a survey to everyone on private ways right now and ask them, would you like to change over?

600
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:45,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those that want to change over, we should move immediately to change over, Mr. President.

601
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:46,102
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a process.

602
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,587
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that want to keep it private, fine.

603
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:54,477
[SPEAKER_09]: But everyone should be receiving the same city services.

604
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:56,018
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay the same taxes.

605
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:58,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And police enforcement is a city service.

606
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Plowing is a city service.

607
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:02,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Your sidewalk being done is a city service.

608
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:04,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Your tree being trimmed is a city service.

609
00:50:05,225 --> 00:50:15,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no reason why 269 roads, which are thousands of homes and tens of thousands of residents, have to say, well, I live on a private way.

610
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not entitled to the same enforcement or the same upkeep on my street.

611
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

612
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:21,816
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

613
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:27,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So I support the president, Mr. President.

614
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:30,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I would ask that immediately enforcement take place.

615
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:35,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that request already happened through a neighborhood meeting.

616
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:40,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess those saw, those wooden saw horses were broken in half and people tossed them aside.

617
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:43,585
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need true enforcement there.

618
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:50,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we need to station someone there, Mr. President, have a police officer stationed in that area,

619
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,048
[SPEAKER_09]: then so be it.

620
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:56,249
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not Mayberry.

621
00:50:56,269 --> 00:51:11,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a city of 60,000 people, seven square miles, $190 million budget, and we can't tell residents that are paying tens of thousands of dollars in taxes, sorry, you live on a private website.

622
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,517
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd love to help you out, but we can't do it.

623
00:51:13,857 --> 00:51:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on a private road.

624
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:16,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Unacceptable.

625
00:51:17,058 --> 00:51:19,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, for bringing this issue up.

626
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:33,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to note that by I believe our current ordinance and our number of legal cases at the state level enforcement related to public safety is allowable and encouraged.

628
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:40,208
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a number of reasons related to public safety that the street, the police can enforce on private ways.

629
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:44,870
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think to Councilor Behr's point, there may be something easy we can do.

630
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,211
[SPEAKER_19]: The city solicitor can help us out with because this is a public safety issue.

631
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there was some towing that went on a couple of weeks ago because of that.

632
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:55,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Karygiela.

633
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:56,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks is right.

634
00:51:57,067 --> 00:52:12,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cop-out because I've been down there with the police, and they're saying—I was there last Sunday with Officer Montgomery, and as fast as Councilor Paul knows, he's telling them not to pull on there, saying, you can park here all we want.

635
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,682
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest issue is there's no posted signs on there.

636
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:21,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And but I agree with Council Marks, tow all the cars out of there, we'll deal with it later.

637
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:24,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, these are Medford residents' cars that you're towing.

638
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:26,964
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all out of city and out of state plates there.

639
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:35,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there, I'll tell you, last Sunday, in front of a neighbor's house, a pickup truck pulls up with six kayaks.

640
00:52:36,866 --> 00:52:37,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I says, well, what are you doing?

641
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:39,787
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, I'm parking my truck here.

642
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,707
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, it's a private property.

643
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I says, well, I'm telling you, your car's not gonna be here when you come back.

644
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:51,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, the tow trucks were there, the police were there, and Officer McGivery's standing there again.

645
00:52:51,426 --> 00:53:02,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been down there multiple Saturdays and Sundays with the police standing there, not able to do anything because we'll get the call from whoever's in charge that day, leave, nothing we can do, and run.

646
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:04,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Tow the cars out of there.

647
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see how fast, the people won't be back there the following week.

648
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the problems is it's not posted.

649
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can't enforce anything that's not posted.

650
00:53:14,235 --> 00:53:17,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Towing companies said they'd be more than happy to give you all the signs you want to put up there.

651
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, that's part of the ordinances.

652
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:20,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be posted.

653
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some signs up there quickly.

654
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Help these people out now, not at the end of the summer when it's too late.

655
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:27,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

656
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. President.

657
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:29,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

658
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:37,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have outside construction companies come into our community, post their own little handmade signs all over the neighborhoods.

659
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:38,993
[SPEAKER_09]: No parking or you'll be towed.

660
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:42,295
[SPEAKER_09]: But the city of Medford can't do that to help residents.

661
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,501
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes no sense, Mr. President.

662
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:53,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We allow outside utility companies to come in and invade our city and post these signs, but we can't do it.

663
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,266
[SPEAKER_09]: That should happen overnight.

664
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:57,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you, Mr. President.

665
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:59,028
[SPEAKER_09]: That should happen overnight, Mr. President.

666
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:01,009
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes no sense at all.

667
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We really need answers on this.

668
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:05,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

669
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Scapelli.

670
00:54:07,176 --> 00:54:10,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate everybody's comments.

671
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:22,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we had an issue on Equavia Road just recently during the pandemic where cars were parking from the fells and parking in the neighborhood.

672
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:31,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And the temporary signs that were put out there with the horses made it reasonable for towing.

673
00:54:32,032 --> 00:54:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I think they just did it just for the weekends because that's when the traffic air really started, no different than what we're seeing in this area.

674
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:52,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't see why we asked the chief and the traffic engineer to put out temporary signs in these areas on Friday afternoons through Sunday, so this could be policed properly.

675
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have to wait for a sign to be erected.

676
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:03,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been down there numerous times with the police, the traffic engineer, everybody.

677
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:07,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of offering solutions, they're offering excuses.

678
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:08,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really all it's done.

679
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:18,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mike, we need to demand this from the chief, the traffic engineer and the mayor's office that this is what's being done in other neighborhoods and it's worked.

680
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little confused with the, so I think that we make a motion that as part of the report that we asked for the temporary signs to be erected by DPW from the traffic department on Friday evenings and then taken down on Sundays.

681
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that would allow

682
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:45,151
[SPEAKER_04]: the police, the leverage to toe because I know it's not, it's not the officers on the streets.

683
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,111
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to do it.

684
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:46,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

685
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:47,912
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they, it's not them.

686
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:49,773
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting it from higher up.

687
00:55:49,813 --> 00:56:07,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to get really, uh, more clarity right now from the chief and get this taken care because, um, you know, until someone drowns out there and it's one of our firefighters that are going out there and one of our police officer going out there and jumping in the lake, trying to help a family that shouldn't have been out there and they lose their lives.

688
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:09,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's when

689
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:13,304
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to see some movement, and that's not what we all want to see.

690
00:56:13,364 --> 00:56:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's, we need to move on that immediately.

691
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:17,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

692
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:19,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

693
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:20,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:23,567
[SPEAKER_20]: And through you to President Caraviello.

695
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:27,028
[SPEAKER_20]: So you were at the meeting, and maybe it's the residents that may want to.

696
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:28,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the residents were there.

697
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:30,990
[SPEAKER_20]: If residents want to speak, I'd love to get their perspective.

698
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:38,832
[SPEAKER_20]: But so when you were at the meeting, could you tell us, did the administration promise any type of deliverables as to what they were going to do?

699
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:47,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, they offered solutions about, we need to change this, we need to change things, but again.

700
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:49,843
[SPEAKER_20]: No timetables or anything?

701
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:51,043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there was no timetable.

702
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:57,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the traffic engineer was there, a representative from the police department was there.

703
00:56:57,944 --> 00:57:04,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, every time we thought of a solution for an immediate action, oh, we can't do that, we can't do that.

704
00:57:04,565 --> 00:57:07,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to, again, Council Member Baxter's right.

705
00:57:07,786 --> 00:57:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Put the signs up there now,

706
00:57:10,873 --> 00:57:15,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, like he says, construction guys, they put signs up there and they take it in tow.

707
00:57:16,435 --> 00:57:21,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put the signs up there, at least for the season, and take it in tow.

708
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,658
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to go for a big expense.

709
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:30,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the tow company said they would give you all the signs you want to put up there, so when your car got towed, you'd know where they were going.

710
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:34,476
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking for immediate relief.

711
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen, Councilor Morell is right.

712
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:38,720
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need a long-term solution for this.

713
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, these people need help on the weekends.

714
00:57:42,704 --> 00:57:43,665
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't go out of the house.

715
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:48,009
[SPEAKER_07]: And Councilor Morell says, you've got the carryout stuff.

716
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they carry it out and leave it in front of their house.

717
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:52,513
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're doing with it.

718
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:55,056
[SPEAKER_07]: They are taking the carryout there, but they're leaving it on our streets now.

719
00:57:55,536 --> 00:58:01,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, these people need relief now, not in August and September, when it's going to be gone.

720
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You go on the Winchester side, there's no cars parked by there, they're running to the beach.

721
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:08,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they put up signs, nobody parks there, it's home away.

722
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:09,685
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a car there, it's gone immediately.

723
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:13,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, put the signs up, not that big of a deal.

724
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:18,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be done as early as this weekend.

725
00:58:19,248 --> 00:58:22,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll worry about the consequences that are laid, Dave, while this is working.

726
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:24,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put the signs up, get it done.

727
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:37,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. President, if you'd also please amend it that this be sent to the solicitor immediately and that the administration contact the environmental police.

728
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:41,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't say that the state police are down there.

729
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:44,310
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably tow 200 cars every Saturday and Sunday.

730
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: They're down there.

731
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:49,293
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing their best just to keep up with the parking down there.

732
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, let's get this done quick.

733
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:54,736
[SPEAKER_07]: These people need help.

734
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the beginning of the summer.

735
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:57,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only going to get worse.

736
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:02,841
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I want to thank Councilor Caraviello.

737
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:03,781
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree a hundred percent.

738
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:05,322
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this is not even July yet.

739
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,704
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still another eight to 10 weeks of summer.

740
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:09,305
[SPEAKER_20]: This needs to be dealt with right away.

741
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:10,766
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would agree with my colleagues.

742
00:59:10,786 --> 00:59:11,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We need excuses.

743
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we don't need excuses.

744
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:13,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We need action.

745
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:13,749
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

746
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,931
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd love to hear from some of the residents if you want to speak about it.

747
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:17,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

748
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:21,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Mr. D'Antonio from Yale Street.

749
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:25,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, sir.

750
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:29,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue, South Medford.

751
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I live down the other end.

752
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:42,565
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I used to go up for on the weekends to enjoy a sandwich or whatever, walk around that little area, uh, near Sandy beach or it used to be Sandy beach.

753
00:59:43,365 --> 00:59:45,626
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, it's disgusting.

754
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen things you can't believe.

755
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:51,909
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish we could have somebody in the board of health go down there.

756
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:59,932
[SPEAKER_21]: These people should be ticketed to dumping diapers, the water grown men defecating in the water.

757
01:00:00,736 --> 01:00:01,677
[SPEAKER_21]: It's true.

758
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:03,258
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't get anywhere.

759
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:06,300
[SPEAKER_21]: And these people that go down there, God bless them.

760
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,943
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of good families, but they're not all good people that go there.

761
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:13,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Believe me when I tell you, I don't know how these residents put up with it.

762
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:16,627
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd go out of my mind to be honest with you.

763
01:00:17,148 --> 01:00:18,629
[SPEAKER_21]: So they do need help.

764
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:21,511
[SPEAKER_21]: You got to find a way to do it and help them.

765
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,733
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I don't go there anymore.

766
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,554
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not enjoyable, you know?

767
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:27,315
[SPEAKER_21]: So they need the help.

768
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:28,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get going here.

769
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:29,797
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

770
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

771
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,152
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Lucy Chapman.

772
01:00:39,172 --> 01:00:40,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 1454 Mystic Valley Parkway.

773
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:45,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've lived there for a long time, roughly 25 years.

774
01:00:46,795 --> 01:00:51,777
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've really seen this whole situation evolve.

775
01:00:51,877 --> 01:00:55,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's been a problem for many years, but most of the cars

776
01:00:56,238 --> 01:01:03,044
[SPEAKER_16]: used to be up towards Sandy Beach, but now they've really gravitated down right in front of my house, actually.

777
01:01:03,124 --> 01:01:11,191
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, literally in front of my house, in front of Bill's house, and trash is left all over the place.

778
01:01:11,311 --> 01:01:12,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I didn't grow up that way.

779
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:19,178
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect people who want to hang out in the woods or have a picnic with their family or whatever, but

780
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:28,141
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I would literally carry out, or even when I was smoking cigarettes, I would butt them out and stick them in my pocket.

781
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:33,923
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't even leave that on the ground, even in my 20s, and it's very, very different now.

782
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:42,226
[SPEAKER_16]: I took pictures just today, just walking across the street, and I know most of you will not be able to see this, so I will describe it.

783
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,467
[SPEAKER_16]: So I walked across my street.

784
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:48,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Hang on one second.

785
01:01:51,718 --> 01:01:56,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is, people bag their trash.

786
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,580
[SPEAKER_16]: They did bag it.

787
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:09,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, well, at least they bagged it, but they don't even put it on the side of the road where somebody like could see it, could like pick it up and see it, you know, like a garbage collector or something.

788
01:02:10,004 --> 01:02:13,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Not like they do that, but they put it back in the woods.

789
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:18,269
[SPEAKER_16]: So they bagged the trash and then threw it back into the woods.

790
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:21,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are these like five giant trash bags in there.

791
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:25,416
[SPEAKER_16]: And as soon as you cross the street and you start walking the path, you see this.

792
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:33,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the telephone pole, there's another picture on there that is like a market basket bag.

793
01:02:33,678 --> 01:02:35,960
[SPEAKER_16]: with trash falling out of it.

794
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's just today, one day.

795
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:45,147
[SPEAKER_16]: And had I known I was gonna be here tonight, which I didn't at the time, I would have taken a lot more pictures.

796
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:48,970
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd have gone inside that woods and taken pictures for all of you to see.

797
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:57,157
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's a sad state of affairs and there are health issues and people come very early because they wanna park.

798
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:01,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, where do they go to the bathroom?

799
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:02,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

800
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,468
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, they're parked there all day long.

801
01:03:04,528 --> 01:03:08,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Now come on, and they're drinking and eating and cooking and grilling.

802
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:14,532
[SPEAKER_16]: And you go back near where the river meets the lower lake, and that whole area is like smashed bottles.

803
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:16,553
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's glass everywhere.

804
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:23,917
[SPEAKER_16]: My neighbor who walks her dog is afraid that her dog's gonna get cut on the glass that's out there.

805
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:25,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of problems.

806
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:29,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's just talking about,

807
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,193
[SPEAKER_16]: the lower Mystic Lake.

808
01:03:31,693 --> 01:03:44,301
[SPEAKER_16]: One other thing I wanted to throw out is for years, for a number of years now, I have seen the crew from the prisons come in, but they only clean the upper lake.

809
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:46,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is that?

810
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:48,543
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a state-related issue.

811
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:55,007
[SPEAKER_16]: I pay taxes like the Winchester people pay taxes, but they stop where the road is to the dam.

812
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:59,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And I saw that little truck with the guys in their orange suits

813
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:02,025
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad they're using them to do this.

814
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:03,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's good for those guys.

815
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,628
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's good for the community.

816
01:04:05,988 --> 01:04:08,991
[SPEAKER_16]: But I said, how come you don't come down to the lower lake?

817
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:13,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Because there's been trash there for years and the neighbors have been picking it up.

818
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:17,598
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot of people in our neighborhood who walk with a trash bag in their hand.

819
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:20,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And as they're walking, they put trash in the bag.

820
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:24,944
[SPEAKER_16]: But I asked, why didn't the prison guys come down to the lower lake and do that?

821
01:04:25,045 --> 01:04:26,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody has the answer to that.

822
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:27,787
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of,

823
01:04:28,786 --> 01:04:43,477
[SPEAKER_16]: inequities that I see happening between what happens in the Winchester end and what happens in the Medford end, including the curbing of the side of the road there where they put the nice curbing in, including the lights they put up.

824
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:45,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does it stop at Medford?

825
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:47,179
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get that.

826
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,341
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, maybe you guys understand that.

827
01:04:49,781 --> 01:04:52,864
[SPEAKER_16]: But just to speak to the private road thing as well.

828
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:54,945
[SPEAKER_16]: I live on a private road.

829
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:57,427
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like Beirut after the bombings.

830
01:04:58,024 --> 01:04:58,965
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what it looks like.

831
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:01,027
[SPEAKER_16]: There are holes everywhere.

832
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:10,074
[SPEAKER_16]: The city comes in and they patch the holes every year because the plows get under the lip of those patches, they end up on my lawn.

833
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:11,996
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where that tar ends up.

834
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:16,220
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're cleaning it out of our banks for the whole season.

835
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,141
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's what they come in.

836
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:20,804
[SPEAKER_16]: They come in and just do a patch job, just do a patch job.

837
01:05:20,844 --> 01:05:25,728
[SPEAKER_16]: We were so hoping when the gas company came in recently and put in all the new gas lines,

838
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,985
[SPEAKER_16]: that maybe they would pave that road.

839
01:05:28,445 --> 01:05:32,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not a private road, it's the only way you can access Pitcher Avenue is by going on Lakeview.

840
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:34,848
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't access it any other way.

841
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:39,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So if it's private, technically, people on Pitcher should not be using it.

842
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that's the way I look at it.

843
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care that they use it, I want the road paved.

844
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:46,513
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess I have a lot of issues.

845
01:05:48,413 --> 01:05:52,175
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm deciding, I don't come to many of these meetings, I'm throwing them all out there today.

846
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,240
[SPEAKER_16]: But the paving of the road is a huge one for me.

847
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And if making it public instead of private is the way to go to get the road paved, I'm all for it.

848
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:02,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

849
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:03,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

850
01:06:03,302 --> 01:06:03,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

851
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Schremer.

852
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:09,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, sir.

853
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:10,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, my name's Bill Darnell.

854
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:13,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 1466 Mystic Valley Parkway.

855
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:17,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've lived there for 22 years now.

856
01:06:17,726 --> 01:06:19,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last couple of years, I've definitely gotten

857
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:21,943
[SPEAKER_15]: 100 times worse.

858
01:06:23,884 --> 01:06:29,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that you can do the ticketing and the towing.

859
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:35,393
[SPEAKER_15]: But part of the problem, I think, might be that people, I'm also a board member of the Medford Boat Club.

860
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:37,855
[SPEAKER_15]: And the parking, they've been there since 1898.

861
01:06:37,895 --> 01:06:41,858
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've always used the parking area by the Tufts Boathouse.

862
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:48,803
[SPEAKER_15]: And to find a parking spot there today on the weekends, you're lucky if you can drive in and get out again.

863
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,111
[SPEAKER_15]: the parking is really getting bad for them as well.

864
01:06:53,232 --> 01:06:59,458
[SPEAKER_15]: So they ended up parking in the neighborhoods, members of the boat club, Medford residents.

865
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:10,650
[SPEAKER_15]: So we kind of, as a member of the Medford boat club, we're like, well, now we're gonna get screwed if we're getting towed, if you're not a resident of that street and you're getting towed.

866
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,452
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if there's a way to,

867
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:24,552
[SPEAKER_15]: look at someone with a Medford Boat Club sticker on the side streets and give them a little break because it's tough for everybody.

868
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:29,413
[SPEAKER_15]: But we definitely want to see this problem cleaned up.

869
01:07:30,073 --> 01:07:30,653
[SPEAKER_15]: It's terrible.

870
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:35,214
[SPEAKER_15]: I walk my dog across the street, and I'm afraid that he's going to cut his paws out.

871
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:39,315
[SPEAKER_15]: You see glass everywhere, toilet paper, all kinds of trash.

872
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,921
[SPEAKER_15]: And something has to be done, and I'm glad you're looking into it.

873
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:44,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

874
01:07:45,682 --> 01:07:46,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

875
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:46,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

876
01:07:47,922 --> 01:07:49,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

877
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:51,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll yield to the gentleman.

878
01:07:51,683 --> 01:08:02,986
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Richard Schultz, and I live at 1454 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is right on the corner of Lakeview, which is a private way, in Mystic Valley.

879
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is my wife.

880
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:19,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I move my car on a Sunday and I park on Lakeview, I have to put a trash can in the spot where when I come back, I won't have a parking space.

881
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:22,669
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is every Sunday.

882
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:24,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Additionally,

883
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:36,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I have had situations where I've said something to someone about parking on Lakeview and I get an earful from them.

884
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,140
[SPEAKER_12]: They're belligerent.

885
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:49,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Lakeview, when you cross the parkway, it leads to a path that takes you right down to where the river meets the lake.

886
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:54,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see hundreds of people

887
01:08:55,253 --> 01:09:00,359
[SPEAKER_12]: going down there on a weekend, carrying everything imaginable.

888
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:12,913
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you've heard, they leave all their trash behind, they defecate in the woods, and they have no respect for the environment.

889
01:09:13,633 --> 01:09:31,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, that area is not supposed to be for swimming and picnicking, and I don't understand why it isn't posted in that way, so that people would know that you have to go to the designated areas.

890
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:36,080
[SPEAKER_12]: This has become increasingly a big problem.

891
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:37,981
[SPEAKER_12]: In front of our house,

892
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:41,693
[SPEAKER_12]: And the front of our house is quite long.

893
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:45,216
[SPEAKER_12]: We have an old Victorian house.

894
01:09:45,536 --> 01:09:46,897
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay high taxes.

895
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:56,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And on Sundays, there's bumper to bumper in front of my house, people yelling, especially when they come back, making noise.

896
01:09:56,767 --> 01:10:00,010
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't sit on your porch and have your meal.

897
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,492
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to sit in the back porch to do that.

898
01:10:03,478 --> 01:10:08,761
[SPEAKER_12]: This, I'm glad that you're looking into this, but we need action.

899
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:13,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't need to deal, I don't need to deal with belligerency.

900
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:24,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't need to deal with having to put a trash can in my parking space so that if I go out, get some groceries, I can't find any place to park in my neighborhood.

901
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:30,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And the final thing I would add, and I said it before, we have a turn of the century Victorian.

902
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:32,354
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay a lot of taxes.

903
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,686
[SPEAKER_12]: That house is valuated high.

904
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:38,247
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not getting services for it.

905
01:10:41,428 --> 01:10:41,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

906
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:45,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

907
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Richard, for bringing that point up.

908
01:10:48,031 --> 01:10:48,371
[SPEAKER_07]: He's right.

909
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:51,432
[SPEAKER_07]: The neighbors shouldn't be down there fighting people.

910
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:57,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've been down there, I've argued with people, I see the other neighbors arguing with people, and they just don't care.

911
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, a couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go with

912
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Representative Garberly on a walkthrough of the lower lakes.

913
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:08,287
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower end there, what they're talking about?

914
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:15,192
[SPEAKER_07]: There's makeshift bathrooms with toilet paper dispensers hanging on the trees.

915
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:19,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, diapers everywhere, but it's just utter filth.

916
01:11:19,435 --> 01:11:20,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's right, I don't know why.

917
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,818
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll clean the upper part, they won't come down and clean the lower part.

918
01:11:24,338 --> 01:11:32,144
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not fair, and I ask for immediate action on this as soon as possible to help these people out.

919
01:11:32,879 --> 01:11:36,640
[SPEAKER_07]: before the summit even starts.

920
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:38,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

921
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:40,381
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

922
01:11:40,421 --> 01:12:00,005
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may, and the residents bring up a good point, if we could get a report back or maybe some answers from our representative Garbali as to why is the upper lake treated differently from the lower lake with regard to cleanliness and the state being proactive with regard to cleaning that area?

923
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:05,204
[SPEAKER_20]: There must be a reason, or maybe it's just being overlooked, but it needs to be addressed.

924
01:12:05,964 --> 01:12:09,346
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not fair that only one section is getting clean, but the rest they just don't care about.

925
01:12:09,806 --> 01:12:12,188
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we can get a report back from that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

926
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:15,189
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I can make that as an amendment, I'd appreciate it.

927
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:15,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

928
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:36,113
[SPEAKER_04]: my my comments earlier is for a motion that we call for a meeting uh to and bring in the stakeholders so um if we can you know one of the uh upcoming meetings i know we have finalized in the budget but

929
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:56,421
[SPEAKER_04]: having calling for a meeting with state delegates, a representative from the DCR, even somebody from the sheriff's office to answer these questions directly, as well as the traffic engineer and the police chief for the traffic department.

930
01:12:57,282 --> 01:13:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, I appreciate that, that Councilor Caraviello went out to this meeting and when I was told it wasn't a big deal,

931
01:13:06,777 --> 01:13:09,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just neighbors that were concerned and they were trying to bring it together.

932
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this has to be some answers and they have to be people sitting across the table to answer those questions.

933
01:13:18,682 --> 01:13:29,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can call that as a motion to call for an immediate meeting, not to say that we shouldn't try to do something this weekend, but what I'm saying is get some resolution quickly.

934
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:35,049
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know that Mr. Donnell brings up a good point, why penalize Medford residents?

935
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:47,476
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I'm gonna, from what I've heard, it's 99% of non-resident people that are just looking in that area because it is a beautiful area.

936
01:13:47,516 --> 01:13:59,322
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want it, spend millions of dollars and buy a huge colonial on the corner and they can have those rights, but I just wanna make sure that's on the record, thank you.

937
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:15,857
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, Scarpelli, Falco, Morell, Bears, Mox, Scarpelli, Caraviello, Falco, Scarpelli.

938
01:14:17,897 --> 01:14:18,658
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

939
01:14:19,178 --> 01:14:19,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

940
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:21,239
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

941
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:23,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing none, the motion passes.

942
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:31,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Paper 21417, offered by Councilors Bears and Morell.

943
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:56,202
[SPEAKER_11]: be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration work with the Medford Public Schools to issue a communication regarding the expanded child tax credit that will provide a maximum of $300 per month for each child under the age of six and $250 per month for each child between the ages of six and 17, for which I have two, Councilor Bears.

944
01:14:57,438 --> 01:14:58,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

945
01:14:59,118 --> 01:15:16,083
[SPEAKER_17]: With the American Rescue Plan Act, the federal government significantly expanded the child tax credit for families and specifically for children and providing additional resources for all of the different costs that a child has.

946
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:18,243
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a great expanded benefit.

947
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:22,364
[SPEAKER_17]: It's estimated that it will significantly help millions of families across the country.

948
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:26,165
[SPEAKER_17]: And right here in Medford, I'm sure thousands of families, however,

949
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:31,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Not a lot of people are fully aware that this benefit has passed and may not be taking advantage of it.

950
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:37,847
[SPEAKER_17]: So the intent of this resolution is that the city administration work with the public schools.

951
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:52,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to amend this to include the Medford Family Network to just notify families that this is an option, that these funds are out there and that they can help families and children across the city do better.

952
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:54,816
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've turned it over to Councilor Morell.

953
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:57,323
[SPEAKER_17]: who co-sponsored this.

954
01:15:57,944 --> 01:15:58,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

955
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Bears mostly covered it.

956
01:16:00,285 --> 01:16:12,250
[SPEAKER_19]: So this was actually, there was an article about this recently about, you know, those most likely to benefit from this are probably largely unaware of the program and some 53% of people may not know about this tax credit.

957
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:15,493
[SPEAKER_19]: So a resident brought this to our attention.

958
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:21,295
[SPEAKER_19]: So just getting this out there and also it may be beneficial just as a side comment.

959
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:30,618
[SPEAKER_19]: The board of health I know is working really hard as far as snap gap and identifying people who are not enrolling in benefits that they are eligible for.

960
01:16:30,698 --> 01:16:32,298
[SPEAKER_19]: So this seems like something similar to that.

961
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:41,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Perhaps the schools could reach out to the board of health to see how they're identifying and reaching out to people to ensure that they are enrolling in programs that they are eligible for.

962
01:16:41,582 --> 01:16:42,962
[SPEAKER_19]: So move approval.

963
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:48,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

964
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:51,445
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion, and Council Member Beall is in the room, I'll second it by Councilor Belco.

965
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:51,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

966
01:16:51,965 --> 01:16:52,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

967
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:52,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

968
01:16:52,465 --> 01:16:52,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

969
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:52,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

970
01:16:52,986 --> 01:16:53,086

Council Member Beall.

994
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:04,349
Aye.

995
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,190
Council Member Beall.

996
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:05,510
Aye.

997
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:06,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

998
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:06,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

999
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:06,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1000
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1001
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:07,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1002
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:07,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1003
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:08,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1004
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:08,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1005
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:08,771

[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1010
01:17:10,391 --> 01:17:10,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1011
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:11,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1012
01:17:11,272 --> 01:17:11,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1013
01:17:11,412 --> 01:17:12,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member Beall.

1014
01:17:12,392 --> 01:17:12,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye

1015
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

1016
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,601
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1017
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:19,985
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to congratulate the friends of the method family network for their efforts during the pandemic.

1018
01:17:20,765 --> 01:17:29,091
[SPEAKER_20]: They had to adjust and they had to usually they have a full range of fundraising activities that benefit the method family network.

1019
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:30,552
[SPEAKER_20]: And during the pandemic, they were limited.

1020
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:35,497
[SPEAKER_20]: but they adjusted and they moved forward and they had a lot of virtual events, virtual trivia nights.

1021
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:46,483
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a virtual ice cream social and they successfully raised money to make sure that there was programming moving forward all the time.

1022
01:17:46,543 --> 01:17:48,584
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is always, it's free programming.

1023
01:17:48,684 --> 01:18:00,850
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to thank them for the effort and, you know, constantly raising money and constantly being active in our community to ensure that there is always free programming for the Bedford Family Network

1024
01:18:01,472 --> 01:18:07,215
[SPEAKER_20]: and I want to congratulate them and invite them down to receive council accommodations.

1025
01:18:07,235 --> 01:18:07,695
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

1026
01:18:08,096 --> 01:18:08,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1027
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:13,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I could say thank you to Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

1028
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:19,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria and her group, a tremendous group of people.

1029
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: COVID did not

1030
01:18:21,676 --> 01:18:23,317
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't missed a beat on anything.

1031
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:30,700
[SPEAKER_07]: They continue to provide food, clothing, and everything for members of the community who really need it.

1032
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:35,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So they didn't need the COVID to slow them down.

1033
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:36,642
[SPEAKER_07]: They only stepped up.

1034
01:18:36,662 --> 01:18:38,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I want to thank them.

1035
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:47,127
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, when I talked last night, as I was going through the school budget, I was kind of shocked

1036
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: the amount of compensation Marie Cassidy receives for the tremendous amount of work.

1037
01:18:54,772 --> 01:19:02,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I happened to call Councilor Falco last night and asked him if that was the correct number, because I was just like, can I take him back?

1038
01:19:02,235 --> 01:19:06,996
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't pay Marie and her staff enough money for the amount of work they do.

1039
01:19:07,036 --> 01:19:09,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I wanna thank Councilor Falco for bringing that up.

1040
01:19:10,137 --> 01:19:13,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Now on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1041
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:14,999
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1042
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1043
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:16,939
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1044
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:17,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1045
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:19,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1046
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:22,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Move suspension of the rules to take public participation, Mr. President.

1047
01:19:23,232 --> 01:19:28,194
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, the suspension to take public participation.

1048
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:28,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by?

1049
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:31,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1050
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:31,915
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1051
01:19:32,255 --> 01:19:32,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1052
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:33,275
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1053
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:34,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1054
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:36,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Public participation.

1055
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a, hold on.

1056
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:41,998
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Anita D'Antonio on the agenda.

1057
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,598
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can find her paper here.

1058
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:46,559
[SPEAKER_07]: She was first.

1059
01:19:49,969 --> 01:19:50,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Anita's paper?

1060
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:55,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a second.

1061
01:19:58,575 --> 01:19:58,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1062
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:00,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1063
01:20:01,116 --> 01:20:04,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street, MFMS.

1064
01:20:04,118 --> 01:20:13,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Anita D'Antonio would like the opportunity to speak regarding the renaming of the Columbus School and the process of the renaming of the school.

1065
01:20:13,985 --> 01:20:14,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Anita.

1066
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1067
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:16,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, thank you.

1068
01:20:16,346 --> 01:20:17,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Anita D'Antonio.

1069
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,929
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 Yale Street, Medford.

1070
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:27,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, members of the city council, bear with me, I'm gonna read a statement rather than ad lib it tonight.

1071
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:36,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this is not a rehash or relitigation of this issue because the issue was not hashed or litigated in the first place.

1072
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:45,287
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the midst of a pandemic and this issue was given a priority that seemed to surpass the importance of getting children back into classrooms.

1073
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:49,020
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not the case, it certainly left that impression.

1074
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:57,709
[SPEAKER_00]: From the outset, the movement to remove the Columbus name and the renaming process have been divisive, yet ultimately revealing.

1075
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:05,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus is but one of the villains du jour in the midst of our own cultural revolution in Medford, served up by a national contagion.

1076
01:21:06,918 --> 01:21:09,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a name change was put on the agenda.

1077
01:21:10,007 --> 01:21:33,588
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no room for argument or discussion when it came to Columbus, not even for a professor emerita from Stanford University in the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology for nearly 20 years, Carol Delaney, PhD, author of Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem, and who I believe appeared before the school committee by Zoom and got a less than indifferent reception.

1078
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:40,616
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't fit the narrative, primary sources, Howard Zinn said so, and the acolytes followed.

1079
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,439
[SPEAKER_00]: And who passed the baton to Zinn?

1080
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:51,268
[SPEAKER_00]: In an article written by Jennifer Braceras entitled, The Intellectual Roots of the War Against Columbus, she states, and I quote,

1081
01:21:52,109 --> 01:22:06,856
[SPEAKER_00]: The war against Columbus is cloaked in the lexicon of diversity and the rhetoric of inclusion, but what many of its foot soldiers don't realize is that in fact it has its intellectual roots in the ideologies of Marxism and white supremacy."

1082
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:12,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Marx reviled Columbus because he saw him as the godfather of capitalism.

1083
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:18,346
[SPEAKER_00]: The KKK detested Columbus because of his association with Catholicism.

1084
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:21,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Strange bedfellows with a common purpose.

1085
01:22:22,877 --> 01:22:44,549
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no purity with regard to Columbus arguments pro or con, but wouldn't it have been a great learning experience for young minds and all of us to do what great educators do, encourage discussion, thought, challenge viewpoints, argue, listen to different opinions, and in the end, acquire knowledge.

1086
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:49,012
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the example that was set by some members of the school committee.

1087
01:22:49,912 --> 01:22:52,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Mines were made up long before it was put on the agenda.

1088
01:22:53,294 --> 01:23:00,837
[SPEAKER_00]: For some individuals on the school committee, the message seemed to be, if we want your opinion, we'll give it to you.

1089
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:07,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Objectivity was nonexistent, notwithstanding the effort to appear otherwise.

1090
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,542
[SPEAKER_00]: In the removal of the name, the selection of a new name in the final vote itself.

1091
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:22,121
[SPEAKER_00]: We were admonished again and again that this was all done in the name of equity, justice, wonderful positive change, signaling how loving, tolerant, open, and welcoming we are as a city.

1092
01:23:23,482 --> 01:23:28,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, Columbus was evil and his mere name traumatizes children.

1093
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:32,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did this process reveal to me?

1094
01:23:32,668 --> 01:23:42,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it exposed some virulent bigotry and bias directed toward those who did not want the name change, but then moved on to support a particular nominee to replace the name Columbus.

1095
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,445
[SPEAKER_00]: That nominee's reputation was even besmirched, disgraceful.

1096
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:59,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that what is old is new again, ethnic bigotry, whether it's 1921 or 2021, again, specifically directed at Americans of Italian descent.

1097
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:02,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us were even more special.

1098
01:24:03,266 --> 01:24:06,007
[SPEAKER_00]: We were old and our lifelong residents.

1099
01:24:06,992 --> 01:24:11,394
[SPEAKER_00]: There was even an attempt to stop speakers from stating they were lifelong residents.

1100
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:13,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, the attempt failed.

1101
01:24:14,135 --> 01:24:18,557
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does it say about a school committee member who would try to stifle free speech that way?

1102
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:38,852
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, according to one voice, the most racist, cruel, hateful humans in Medford, white supremacists, right-wingers, false narrative bearers, white self-admitted Italian-Americans who may have cheated by simply voting for our choice of nominee, and last but not least, the worst of the worst.

1103
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:49,925
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the change, if this is the progress, if this is what passes for making Medford a loving and welcoming and tolerant community, we are failing miserably.

1104
01:24:50,805 --> 01:25:01,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not stand by and allow anyone to violate or smear the character of my family, my parents, my grandparents, because we happen to be of Italian descent.

1105
01:25:02,008 --> 01:25:09,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I condemn those who prioritize their bigotries, cloak them in virtue signaling, trading one bigotry for another,

1106
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,631
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking they have the high moral ground and feeling justified in doing so.

1107
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:21,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who bellow about bullying and marginalizing have become the bullies, the marginalizers, and now even the new colonizers.

1108
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:25,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see a city that can grow positively for all.

1109
01:25:26,374 --> 01:25:33,156
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those who see a city that won't be right until it's made in their image, no matter how long or how briefly they have lived here.

1110
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:37,697
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we just experienced during the Columbus School renaming.

1111
01:25:38,377 --> 01:25:39,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will not end there.

1112
01:25:40,038 --> 01:25:48,043
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those who will adopt another city's or state's crises and try to include Medford in the same crisis.

1113
01:25:48,463 --> 01:25:52,365
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an example of injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.

1114
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:58,448
[SPEAKER_00]: That is destroying a city's character and uniqueness and driving it to a divisive and dead end.

1115
01:25:59,289 --> 01:26:02,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I would ask this city council

1116
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:11,975
[SPEAKER_00]: to vigorously condemn bigotry, and specifically the bigotry that has been directed to those of Italian descent.

1117
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:13,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for this time.

1118
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:14,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1119
01:26:19,621 --> 01:26:21,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further public discussion?

1120
01:26:25,466 --> 01:26:26,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And any other subjects?

1121
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:27,007
[SPEAKER_07]: No more further?

1122
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1123
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, thank you, Council.

1124
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:36,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President Caraviello.

1125
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:41,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Puccio, 11 Tanger Street, Medford, Mass.

1126
01:26:41,323 --> 01:26:42,143
[SPEAKER_03]: 42 year resident.

1127
01:26:42,923 --> 01:26:43,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1128
01:26:44,203 --> 01:26:48,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really, all I wanted to say was I can't say anything more than what Ms.

1129
01:26:48,865 --> 01:26:50,165
[SPEAKER_03]: D'Antonio has already stated.

1130
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:51,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1131
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:56,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank her for coming up and speaking on behalf of several residents.

1132
01:26:57,818 --> 01:27:13,343
[SPEAKER_03]: in Medford, there's a lot of people who are in favor of the change of the school, and I understand that, I accept that, but for every person that I hear about that is in favor, there are many that are not as vocal that approach me and thank me, and people like Anita and other people who continue this.

1133
01:27:14,844 --> 01:27:26,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wanna say resistance, because it's really not a fight or resistance, but it has to be made known that there are feelings that have been hurt, as well as, not just feelings, but there's just not, you know,

1134
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:33,929
[SPEAKER_03]: people's backgrounds feel, it feels like they were threatened and it can't continue.

1135
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:50,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope, and I echo what Anita says, that this council would take it upon themselves to condemn these acts of, not necessarily the changing of the schools acts of hate, but the ones that are following afterwards, people seem to think that

1136
01:27:51,166 --> 01:27:55,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't get over the fact that the school name changed, but there's so much more to it than that.

1137
01:27:56,909 --> 01:28:05,172
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fight for Italian heritage and what we believe in, and no one can change what people believe in.

1138
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,091
[SPEAKER_03]: the way they feel.

1139
01:28:08,812 --> 01:28:19,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, again, I want to thank Anita and I would again appreciate the council hopefully putting forward an act that would condemn this kind of bigotry.

1140
01:28:20,437 --> 01:28:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1141
01:28:21,197 --> 01:28:21,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

1142
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:28,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1143
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1144
01:28:30,273 --> 01:28:32,154
[SPEAKER_06]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1145
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:33,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council President.

1146
01:28:34,655 --> 01:28:44,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Just two minutes in a short time of walking the streets and meeting people, I find it very interesting, the undercurrent of how frustrated many, many, many people are.

1147
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:49,284
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've heard some people several times say, it's time to move on.

1148
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,925
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to move on from this situation.

1149
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:52,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to move on from this situation.

1150
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:56,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting is that the community did move on.

1151
01:28:56,147 --> 01:29:01,588
[SPEAKER_06]: The community decided collectively that, hey, we've got an opportunity to be part of a change of a name.

1152
01:29:02,268 --> 01:29:05,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And they took that opportunity, and they rose to the occasion.

1153
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:07,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were still ignored the second time.

1154
01:29:08,429 --> 01:29:11,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So this frustration can't be ignored anymore.

1155
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:12,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hurtful.

1156
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:13,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.

1157
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:17,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad that we have a community that's so divisive right now because of

1158
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:21,290
[SPEAKER_06]: because of a lack of education, really, more than anything else.

1159
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:25,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lack of education about the history of Italian-Americans and what they went through.

1160
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:37,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lack of education of exactly where these teachings are coming from and is there validity to any of these teachings?

1161
01:29:37,603 --> 01:29:46,648
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if you really want to go through history, if you really, really want to be upset, you have to be more upset about the Spanish Inquisition than you are about Columbus himself.

1162
01:29:47,108 --> 01:29:48,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be more upset about that.

1163
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:55,512
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really want to go back in history, you could go all the way back to Egypt and be upset about those folks and how they grew their civilization.

1164
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could just go on and on and on and on and on.

1165
01:29:58,394 --> 01:30:06,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real sad situation that we can't come together and figure out how collectively as a community we can move on from this, because there are certain specific people

1166
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:10,499
[SPEAKER_06]: that continue to agitate the situation.

1167
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I want to make very clear, Jean Barry Sutton made that school about community, about teachers, about parents, about children, and about love and caring.

1168
01:30:28,928 --> 01:30:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Our school committee made it about a name.

1169
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And people have to remember that.

1170
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a real sad situation.

1171
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,806
[SPEAKER_06]: in a very short period of time.

1172
01:30:39,306 --> 01:30:42,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think or I stand corrected.

1173
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:52,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to have been able to ask Jean Barry Sutton, how many kids came to her on the way to school and said, principal, I can't come to this school because the name hurts me.

1174
01:30:53,457 --> 01:30:54,437
[SPEAKER_06]: How many kids did that?

1175
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only imagine what the answer would be because she made it about them.

1176
01:31:02,519 --> 01:31:04,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't about anything else, not the politics of it.

1177
01:31:05,181 --> 01:31:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to pull back together.

1178
01:31:07,322 --> 01:31:10,645
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to come together somehow, because it's going for the Brooks School.

1179
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going for all the parks.

1180
01:31:14,267 --> 01:31:16,349
[SPEAKER_06]: The names are going to just continue on.

1181
01:31:16,469 --> 01:31:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we get proactive?

1182
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:24,514
[SPEAKER_06]: How does this community stop this movement or even have a voice to stop this movement?

1183
01:31:24,995 --> 01:31:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to look to someone for that leadership.

1184
01:31:26,996 --> 01:31:27,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And where do they go?

1185
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:29,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do they speak to?

1186
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:30,979
[SPEAKER_06]: We need help there.

1187
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:33,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand that we have that power in elections.

1188
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:48,745
[SPEAKER_06]: But further than that, how do we be proactive and be part of that conversation when it is time for everyone to decide it's the Brooks School, the name has to change, or it's the Columbus Park, the name has to change, or so on and so on.

1189
01:31:48,785 --> 01:31:52,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can go down the list how many streets are named after people that

1190
01:31:53,527 --> 01:31:55,349
[SPEAKER_06]: You can investigate anything about anyone.

1191
01:31:55,569 --> 01:32:01,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You can never look at history through today's lenses and expect a similar result.

1192
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:02,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You just can't.

1193
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:03,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1194
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:06,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1195
01:32:06,858 --> 01:32:09,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Just comment.

1196
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:10,441
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been

1197
01:32:11,345 --> 01:32:15,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been bothersome to me as a first generation Italian American.

1198
01:32:17,107 --> 01:32:20,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fortunate enough to be raised by a wonderful Italian family.

1199
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:29,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was taught lessons by probably one of the greatest men in the world, my dad, who studied in the Jesuit seminary.

1200
01:32:30,193 --> 01:32:39,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And he always told me as I started my journey as a school committee member and a Councilor, that no matter what the issue, put yourself on the other side.

1201
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:47,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was, you know, his saint was Padre Pio, and it meant a lot to our family.

1202
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:55,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hear the cries and I hear my neighbors that are upset.

1203
01:32:56,343 --> 01:33:06,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And the naming of the school, like my father would say, stepping aside, if it truly offended one person, it's something that we should look at.

1204
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it really needed to be changed,

1205
01:33:10,742 --> 01:33:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: we should look at that.

1206
01:33:12,723 --> 01:33:14,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm disgusted in the process.

1207
01:33:14,524 --> 01:33:28,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the process wasn't something that we heard everyone, but why I decided to speak tonight is very important for the fact that I'm very proud of who I am as an Italian American.

1208
01:33:29,874 --> 01:33:40,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I wear that with a badge of honor and what I'm hearing from my neighbors, especially my older neighbors that made Medford such a great, great community with,

1209
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:57,525
[SPEAKER_04]: with many other unbelievable nationalities is that they feel like they that they're being talked down to and they they've been thrown away and the heritage isn't what they brought to this community is not important.

1210
01:33:57,645 --> 01:34:05,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what that's what bothers me, because I think if my mother and father, my grandparents felt that way, I'm doing a major disservice by sitting in the seat by not saying something.

1211
01:34:06,426 --> 01:34:22,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So my comments aren't just to just talk about it and let you know where I stand, but one thing that my father taught me and the Italian culture taught me, especially in Medford, we always found a way to bring everybody together.

1212
01:34:23,337 --> 01:34:24,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Medford's screaming that.

1213
01:34:25,558 --> 01:34:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest with you, I think that most people on one side or the other, they feel the same way.

1214
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,143
[SPEAKER_04]: They really do.

1215
01:34:33,093 --> 01:34:36,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people on the other side, they're all not animals.

1216
01:34:37,317 --> 01:34:42,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides that, when you hear side to side, and the people on this side, you're not disgusting animals.

1217
01:34:43,863 --> 01:34:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's gotta be something this community can do.

1218
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother said to me, bring them all to a table, cook for them, let everybody sit at a table.

1219
01:34:58,587 --> 01:35:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: look across the table from each other and talk to each other.

1220
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:06,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And you realize how many things you have in common.

1221
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard new Medford, old Medford.

1222
01:35:11,353 --> 01:35:13,975
[SPEAKER_04]: That statement should be gone.

1223
01:35:14,395 --> 01:35:14,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Medford.

1224
01:35:15,575 --> 01:35:17,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We said this the other day when we lost Buddy Kelly.

1225
01:35:18,157 --> 01:35:21,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy Kelly had a way as the athletic director to bring our community together.

1226
01:35:22,659 --> 01:35:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: He made everybody feel like you were a Mustang.

1227
01:35:25,975 --> 01:35:29,917
[SPEAKER_04]: and you had one of the prerequisites of being a Mustang is that you had to have pride.

1228
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:38,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think everybody that comes to this community, whether you are new or old, you have prides for this community.

1229
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:47,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what we need to do as elected officials and we need to do with the mayor's office is try to find that common ground, find a way we can bring everybody together.

1230
01:35:48,724 --> 01:35:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something as a community event.

1231
01:35:51,996 --> 01:36:12,445
[SPEAKER_04]: that we bring everybody together and say, hey, let's sit down and let's just talk to each other and understand because some of my new neighbors I've talked to, they said, George, I'm just so disgusted with this group that doesn't understand that Columbus was a slave monger and it hurts people.

1232
01:36:13,566 --> 01:36:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And my discussions with those people and the understanding is that's really not the cry.

1233
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:37,885
[SPEAKER_04]: The cry is that what Columbus meant to the Italian Americans at a very difficult time, they gave them, that symbol gave them an understanding of what America was and made them feel part of America when they didn't have a country.

1234
01:36:38,665 --> 01:36:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Something very similar that a lot of people in this country are going through right now, whether you're Latino, whether you're Brazilian, whether you're Haitian Creole and you're moving to this country,

1235
01:36:49,756 --> 01:36:51,057
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to be in our country.

1236
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: They love our country.

1237
01:36:51,997 --> 01:36:53,398
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what makes America great.

1238
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:59,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, I know we're not supposed to comment.

1239
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:00,663
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not supposed to make motions.

1240
01:37:00,703 --> 01:37:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't

1241
01:37:01,912 --> 01:37:23,709
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't anywhere that we can do that, but as we move forward, I think that maybe this council can be creative enough to work together, all seven of us, and look at all of our groups that we work with and try to find a way with the office across the hall and maybe find a community event that brings everybody to the center of our town

1242
01:37:24,562 --> 01:37:29,464
[SPEAKER_04]: and celebrate it with cultural music and cultural foods and, and, and open tables.

1243
01:37:29,524 --> 01:37:45,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have round tables for everything, but I'm almost sure the people in this room haven't really sat down and talked to people on the other side of that social media blog that they're beating up because they, there's just no communication.

1244
01:37:45,829 --> 01:37:52,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone told me my best quality when I first started as a, as a coach was I

1245
01:37:53,448 --> 01:37:55,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a great job bringing people together.

1246
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:59,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I'm on account of a great group of people that want to bring people together.

1247
01:38:00,193 --> 01:38:08,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that as we move forward, when we can make motions and we can move forward, that we're creative enough to find something that'll help Medford heal.

1248
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so divided right now.

1249
01:38:12,422 --> 01:38:14,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not comfortable for me.

1250
01:38:15,364 --> 01:38:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not comfortable for my children.

1251
01:38:17,145 --> 01:38:20,348
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't what, this is how I wasn't raised.

1252
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:31,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love Medford for a reason, just like the people that just came in on Carberry and just bought an $800,000 home because they want to be part of Medford.

1253
01:38:31,885 --> 01:38:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to be part of this community.

1254
01:38:33,647 --> 01:38:36,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we have to find a way that we really work together.

1255
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:41,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can't belittle the opinions of Ms.

1256
01:38:41,473 --> 01:38:42,093
[SPEAKER_04]: D'Antonio.

1257
01:38:42,113 --> 01:38:47,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's how you feel and whether you like it or not, you still have to listen to those words.

1258
01:38:48,362 --> 01:38:49,803
[SPEAKER_04]: and vice versa.

1259
01:38:50,543 --> 01:38:58,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank you for bringing this topic forward just so I can let my feelings, you know, be told that I haven't really expressed.

1260
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:15,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, um, you know, when I sit back and talk to my dad, these are the stories he tells me is he would have told me is to find a way to bring everybody together and use our culture and our heritage to do what's been done for years.

1261
01:39:15,294 --> 01:39:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

1262
01:39:16,795 --> 01:39:17,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1263
01:39:20,075 --> 01:39:24,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We have someone from the audience, Mr. Giglio.

1264
01:39:24,437 --> 01:39:26,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, could you unmute him, please?

1265
01:39:28,398 --> 01:39:30,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Giglio, name and address of the record, please.

1266
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Wentworth Street.

1267
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,640
[SPEAKER_02]: What everybody said there is very true.

1268
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:41,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my question to the council is, what as a council can you

1269
01:39:42,258 --> 01:39:48,720
[SPEAKER_02]: do to put some sort of a restriction on major name changes like this being put on the ballot?

1270
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we, I mean, we know that the whole process was a farce.

1271
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:58,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think they believe their own BS, whatever they want to do.

1272
01:39:59,343 --> 01:40:08,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question is, in the future, if this same school committee does get reelected, hypothetically, they can now just go on to do the Brooks School and then so on and so forth.

1273
01:40:09,165 --> 01:40:11,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that the city can do

1274
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: where these major name changes can get put on the ballot.

1275
01:40:15,393 --> 01:40:27,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city, the community has more of an input, has more of a say, sort of the same way Wakefield just did with their mascot.

1276
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:30,305
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it on the ballot and it got voted down.

1277
01:40:30,365 --> 01:40:38,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that the council or the city can do, or is it the school only, only the school community has the jurisdictions for the schools?

1278
01:40:40,395 --> 01:40:48,340
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I, the understanding is that only the school committee has the jurisdiction for the schools.

1279
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:55,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the question with Wakefield, I think, with that on the ballot, that was an informational question also.

1280
01:40:56,625 --> 01:41:04,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So- Right, but it's still, it's still went on the ballot, you know, and in this, I'm, this is not gonna stop.

1281
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's gonna just continue.

1282
01:41:06,792 --> 01:41:08,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the community didn't have

1283
01:41:09,701 --> 01:41:12,562
[SPEAKER_02]: and input on the last one, we won't on the next one either.

1284
01:41:12,662 --> 01:41:15,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way it is, but thank you guys anyway.

1285
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:15,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1286
01:41:15,784 --> 01:41:17,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.

1287
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:22,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions or comments for public discussion?

1288
01:41:22,546 --> 01:41:24,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1289
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:24,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1290
01:41:25,527 --> 01:41:26,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1291
01:41:26,548 --> 01:41:36,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna thank the speakers tonight because I believe this council has tried to act over the last year to be a sounding board for residents that

1292
01:41:37,468 --> 01:41:39,870
[SPEAKER_09]: felt that their voice wasn't being heard.

1293
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:51,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we may have not had the ability to make substantive changes, but I think we did act as a sounding board for this community.

1294
01:41:52,017 --> 01:42:05,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to say that I don't believe any body, whether it's the city council, the mayor's office, or the school committee, has the sole authority, Mr. President, over city-owned buildings.

1295
01:42:06,805 --> 01:42:12,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe that the school committee had the authority to rename the school.

1296
01:42:12,809 --> 01:42:26,838
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I don't think there's anything that would prevent us as a city council, which is the legislative body, to put an ordinance in place that would require a check and balance on the naming of any building within the community.

1297
01:42:27,552 --> 01:42:55,193
[SPEAKER_09]: So at some point, Mr. President, I would like to offer that as a motion, and I'll do it here tonight if need be, that we request the city solicitor, Kim Scanlon, to look at whether we as a legislative body, the Medford City Council, through a city ordinance can require that we as a legislative body elected by the people would also have a say

1298
01:42:55,612 --> 01:43:01,193
[SPEAKER_09]: and the renaming of any building, whether it's municipal or school building, Mr. President.

1299
01:43:01,553 --> 01:43:04,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way, there would be a check and balance in that process.

1300
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:10,215
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, the school committee doesn't even have the authority to appropriate funds.

1301
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:14,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And these buildings are city-owned buildings, Mr. President.

1302
01:43:14,677 --> 01:43:17,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we require closer scrutiny.

1303
01:43:18,798 --> 01:43:24,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that we ask the city solicitor whether we can do that via an ordinance.

1304
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:41,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think when we talk, Mr. President, about this community and about the division over the last couple of years, it's important that we as a community, I think, call out hatred whenever we see it.

1305
01:43:41,251 --> 01:43:45,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, hatred can't be one side or another.

1306
01:43:45,734 --> 01:43:47,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Hatred is hatred, right?

1307
01:43:48,236 --> 01:43:52,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So what gets me is, you know, someone will say, well, you didn't call out this hatred or that hatred.

1308
01:43:53,419 --> 01:43:54,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all stand

1309
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:56,710
[SPEAKER_09]: and I won't speak for anyone else.

1310
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,252
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't, as a community, tolerate hatred, period.

1311
01:44:01,872 --> 01:44:02,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Any type of hatred.

1312
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:19,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, as a community, what really divides us, Mr. President, and I have to bring it up, and, you know, when you have people on social media, and God bless people that want to use social media, I'm not on it, Mr. President, and it's intentional.

1313
01:44:20,237 --> 01:44:23,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the demise of society, to be quite honest with you.

1314
01:44:24,372 --> 01:44:31,158
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that want to get on social media, Mr. President, I think they have to be careful on the words that they use.

1315
01:44:31,758 --> 01:44:35,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if your intent is to get your point across, that's one thing.

1316
01:44:35,742 --> 01:44:41,226
[SPEAKER_09]: If your intent is to continue to divide, I think you have to be called out on that, Mr. President.

1317
01:44:42,687 --> 01:44:46,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is far too good of a community to let that happen.

1318
01:44:47,211 --> 01:44:50,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's one email, Mr. President, that went out.

1319
01:44:51,295 --> 01:44:52,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it was social media.

1320
01:44:52,135 --> 01:44:52,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't an email.

1321
01:44:53,572 --> 01:44:56,893
[SPEAKER_09]: and it was a call for action right before the Columbus School vote.

1322
01:44:58,734 --> 01:45:09,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't mention the person's name, although that person didn't mind throwing everyone else in the community under the bus, but that's fine, if that's the way they want to operate.

1323
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:21,923
[SPEAKER_09]: But we as a community, Mr. President, someday this may be you that they're targeting, someday it may be your group, someday it may be your ancestry, someday it may be your religion, Mr. President.

1324
01:45:22,506 --> 01:45:23,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And the list goes on and on.

1325
01:45:25,407 --> 01:45:33,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always stated as an elected official, just because you have the ability and the power to do something doesn't mean it's right.

1326
01:45:34,151 --> 01:45:36,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been saying that for decades, Mr. President.

1327
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:46,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's a perfect example of a school committee that had the ability, had the power to flex their muscle, and they did it.

1328
01:45:46,857 --> 01:45:48,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't matter anything else, they did it.

1329
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:49,938
[SPEAKER_09]: They flexed their muscle.

1330
01:45:50,792 --> 01:45:53,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my opinion, those are not true leaders.

1331
01:45:53,953 --> 01:45:55,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a true leader will listen.

1332
01:45:55,693 --> 01:45:56,934
[SPEAKER_09]: A true leader will deliberate.

1333
01:45:57,194 --> 01:46:02,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll take into consideration, Mr. President, everyone's feelings and factors, Mr. President.

1334
01:46:03,215 --> 01:46:05,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And that truly did not happen with this issue.

1335
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a shame.

1336
01:46:06,896 --> 01:46:09,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's why it polarized our community, Mr. President.

1337
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:18,540
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do, Mr. President, want to read this hateful, hateful posting that went out.

1338
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure there are a lot of them.

1339
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:26,492
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one really hit home with me, and it was a call right before the meeting for the Columbus School vote.

1340
01:46:27,333 --> 01:46:28,713
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a call to action.

1341
01:46:29,613 --> 01:46:35,476
[SPEAKER_09]: The final voting on the new name for the Columbus School is happening on Monday night during a school committee meeting.

1342
01:46:35,996 --> 01:46:36,876
[SPEAKER_09]: The meeting starts at 6.30.

1343
01:46:37,256 --> 01:46:44,819
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be public participation permitted, and the right wing of Method is organizing around this.

1344
01:46:45,879 --> 01:46:49,861
[SPEAKER_09]: The worst of the worst will be there in force.

1345
01:46:50,796 --> 01:46:55,700
[SPEAKER_09]: and they are defending nothing less than white supremacy in Medford.

1346
01:46:56,961 --> 01:47:10,072
[SPEAKER_09]: The groups that have been energized by this are using the Trump playbook and creating completely false narratives about what happened in the process of how the name change is being handled.

1347
01:47:11,093 --> 01:47:16,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We need bodies at this event in person, and we need faces on Zoom.

1348
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:18,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Fear warning.

1349
01:47:18,795 --> 01:47:25,160
[SPEAKER_09]: The people who are going to speak are the most racist, cruel, hateful humans in method.

1350
01:47:26,862 --> 01:47:28,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And this action will be painful.

1351
01:47:30,845 --> 01:47:34,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I was president at that meeting.

1352
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:43,375
[SPEAKER_09]: There were many, many residents present on Zoom, Mr. President, and at the meeting that took time to come down.

1353
01:47:44,476 --> 01:47:47,779
[SPEAKER_09]: There were many people in this community that had strong feelings

1354
01:47:49,038 --> 01:47:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: about the renaming of the school.

1355
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:53,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're all entitled to our feelings and our opinions.

1356
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Take that away, what do we have as a society?

1357
01:47:59,421 --> 01:48:15,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be told that you may have an opinion that differs from someone else, that you're hateful, that you're a racist, that you're a white supremacist for showing up, is a disgrace, Mr. President, an absolute disgrace.

1358
01:48:16,378 --> 01:48:26,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's an intimidation, nothing more than an intimidation to have people say, you know what, if I show up to that meeting and speak my mind, I'm going to be lumped into this.

1359
01:48:27,803 --> 01:48:37,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can't allow, as a community, no matter what side you are on the issue, because someday, Mr. President, you're going to be on the opposite side.

1360
01:48:39,308 --> 01:48:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: You may be the one they're targeting.

1361
01:48:42,209 --> 01:48:44,670
[SPEAKER_09]: As a community, you would hope we all stand together

1362
01:48:46,339 --> 01:48:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're able to decipher what's right and wrong.

1363
01:48:49,961 --> 01:48:50,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Put everything aside.

1364
01:48:51,522 --> 01:48:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all humans.

1365
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:54,623
[SPEAKER_09]: What's right and wrong, Mr. President?

1366
01:48:56,244 --> 01:49:10,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And calling people out because they have an opinion or trying to label them in the worst way, Mr. President, calling them white supremacy, calling them hateful, the worst possible thing you can call someone, Mr. President.

1367
01:49:12,513 --> 01:49:14,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the most part, it's untrue.

1368
01:49:17,949 --> 01:49:19,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So that really bothered me.

1369
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: When I read that, Mr. President, I've been elected a lot of years, and that language alone really bothered me.

1370
01:49:26,775 --> 01:49:35,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a lot of language going back and forth, but that language resonated with me because, Mr. President, it's not who we are as a community.

1371
01:49:38,403 --> 01:49:40,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Get to know the community that you moved into.

1372
01:49:41,264 --> 01:49:42,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Get to know your neighbors.

1373
01:49:43,466 --> 01:49:46,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Get to know the people across the street or the people who live on the other side.

1374
01:49:48,387 --> 01:49:49,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to what people have to say.

1375
01:49:50,588 --> 01:49:54,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be quick to judge and react or pay people in a corner.

1376
01:49:55,371 --> 01:49:57,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you're a righty, you're a lefty, you're this or that.

1377
01:49:58,113 --> 01:49:59,073
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hard law.

1378
01:50:02,455 --> 01:50:05,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We all live in this city because we love it, Mr. President.

1379
01:50:05,537 --> 01:50:08,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't love it, you know where the door is.

1380
01:50:09,219 --> 01:50:09,819
[SPEAKER_09]: See you later.

1381
01:50:12,821 --> 01:50:15,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're not going to tolerate hate, Mr. President, in this community.

1382
01:50:16,998 --> 01:50:20,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to see all these stop hatred signs all around the community.

1383
01:50:22,339 --> 01:50:26,960
[SPEAKER_09]: People put them out because they feel strongly about it, Mr. President, but that's not who we are.

1384
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:29,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to work on things?

1385
01:50:29,961 --> 01:50:30,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1386
01:50:31,281 --> 01:50:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be naive to say otherwise.

1387
01:50:33,702 --> 01:50:35,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there changes we can make as a community?

1388
01:50:35,582 --> 01:50:36,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1389
01:50:36,322 --> 01:50:37,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're all willing to do it.

1390
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: We all want to do it.

1391
01:50:41,565 --> 01:50:46,846
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not going to get there through a vehicle of intimidation and harassment and name calling.

1392
01:50:47,106 --> 01:50:49,466
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to get there, and we'll never get there.

1393
01:50:49,866 --> 01:51:02,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And if people think we're going to get there by browbeating people and calling them names, then they're misunderstood, Mr. President, because it's not going to happen in this community.

1394
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:04,989
[SPEAKER_09]: We're too good of a community, and we're going to rally around this.

1395
01:51:06,989 --> 01:51:07,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1396
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:09,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilman.

1397
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:17,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Mark says motion on the floor.

1398
01:51:17,972 --> 01:51:28,836
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, this is under public participation, and it will be on next week's agenda Council Mark so.

1399
01:51:29,736 --> 01:51:34,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that Mr. President I'm fine with that just if you could just read back the motion or I'll state it again.

1400
01:51:39,710 --> 01:52:06,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just so for the edification of the people watching now, the wording is that I request that we ask the city solicitor for a ruling, Mr. President, whether or not the city council through way of a formal city ordinance can craft the process of the naming of any municipal or school building

1401
01:52:09,678 --> 01:52:17,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So any facility, municipal school building, Mr. President, and whether we can do that by way of ordinance.

1402
01:52:19,841 --> 01:52:29,984
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by, uh, council Mark seconded by second by council Scarpelli, uh, to go on for next week's, uh, agenda.

1403
01:52:31,204 --> 01:52:31,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1404
01:52:32,584 --> 01:52:33,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that'll be on the next week.

1405
01:52:33,484 --> 01:52:34,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, council box.

1406
01:52:35,225 --> 01:52:35,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1407
01:52:37,098 --> 01:52:40,079
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we have one more public participation.

1408
01:52:42,619 --> 01:52:43,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti.

1409
01:52:45,419 --> 01:52:47,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Mr. Castagnetti, please?

1410
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:48,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1411
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1412
01:52:53,201 --> 01:52:56,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1413
01:52:58,662 --> 01:53:05,983
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, very sad that the Method School Committee has caused such a great division in Medford.

1414
01:53:07,725 --> 01:53:12,188
[SPEAKER_10]: They said that Christopher Columbus was a bad person.

1415
01:53:13,549 --> 01:53:14,569
[SPEAKER_10]: He was no good.

1416
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,131
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a criminal of sorts.

1417
01:53:18,552 --> 01:53:22,014
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as I'm concerned, it's just hearsay and rumor.

1418
01:53:23,395 --> 01:53:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to know where's the beef?

1419
01:53:26,616 --> 01:53:37,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Can someone, anyone out there show me in the method transcript next week or the week after the police show me the court case when he was convicted of any

1420
01:53:37,847 --> 01:53:40,108
[SPEAKER_10]: major crime, please.

1421
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:51,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking about the rumors of bad people, I don't know if Columbus was good or bad.

1422
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:53,753
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all hearsay to me.

1423
01:53:55,093 --> 01:53:58,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I hear other rumors, why should we believe anything?

1424
01:53:59,435 --> 01:54:00,235
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, did

1425
01:54:01,043 --> 01:54:01,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1426
01:54:01,503 --> 01:54:04,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Rousseau stopped this problem from the school committee?

1427
01:54:04,925 --> 01:54:07,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti, we won't mention any names, please.

1428
01:54:08,526 --> 01:54:08,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1429
01:54:09,026 --> 01:54:10,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we mention Columbus's name?

1430
01:54:10,547 --> 01:54:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned Columbus's name.

1431
01:54:13,008 --> 01:54:14,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though he's not here to represent himself?

1432
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:16,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1433
01:54:16,209 --> 01:54:20,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't you kind?

1434
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:21,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, sir.

1435
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:27,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I want to ask the city lawyer if a convicted

1436
01:54:28,486 --> 01:54:35,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Felon is legally allowed to run And serve as an elected official on that road.

1437
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:36,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Cassay.

1438
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:57,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm asking I'm asking you a question about you Thank you, I'll just say Any further public participation?

1439
01:54:58,777 --> 01:55:02,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion to revert back to- Second.

1440
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,702
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion by Vice Mayor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1441
01:55:05,762 --> 01:55:06,383
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1442
01:55:07,204 --> 01:55:07,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1443
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1444
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:12,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Communications from the Mayor.

1445
01:55:12,788 --> 01:55:13,889
[SPEAKER_07]: 21420 to the Honorable Presidents.

1446
01:55:14,730 --> 01:55:22,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President, City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body approves a supplemental appropriation of the amount of $170,898.10

1447
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:34,413
[SPEAKER_07]: for perpetual care, from the perpetual care to the cemetery ordinary expense budget.

1448
01:55:34,974 --> 01:55:52,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I respectfully request to recommend that your Honorable Body approves the supplemental appropriation in the amount of $103,050 from the sale of lost and grazed to the cemetery salary expense budget.

1449
01:55:53,384 --> 01:55:57,086
[SPEAKER_07]: These amounts support the information provided in the fiscal 2022 budget

1450
01:55:59,045 --> 01:56:01,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely yours, our brand of the current mayor.

1451
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:06,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions on this?

1452
01:56:08,351 --> 01:56:10,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Vice President Knight.

1453
01:56:10,573 --> 01:56:19,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we making a supplemental appropriation if this is something that's included in the fiscal 2022 budget and we're in the process of deliberating the fiscal year 2022 budget?

1454
01:56:20,982 --> 01:56:29,006
[SPEAKER_11]: the supplemental appropriation would be to carry us through the remainder of this fiscal year, I would assume, because it would be a supplemental appropriation supplementing the FY20.

1455
01:56:29,026 --> 01:56:30,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Aleesha Nunley on the call here.

1456
01:56:31,468 --> 01:56:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia.

1457
01:56:33,068 --> 01:56:34,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, councilors.

1458
01:56:34,929 --> 01:56:38,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year I prepare this paper for your body to approve.

1459
01:56:39,212 --> 01:56:48,677
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm fine with this being tabled if you want to table it until when the budget is, but I wanted to make sure I got it in on time to go before your body to go with the budget, because it's a part of it.

1460
01:56:49,597 --> 01:56:50,758
[SPEAKER_18]: It has to be voted separately.

1461
01:56:54,258 --> 01:57:06,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, Mr. President, this paper is the paper which we usually expend funds from our perpetual care accounts, retained revenue accounts for the funding of physicians in the cemetery, if I'm not mistaken.

1462
01:57:06,867 --> 01:57:07,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

1463
01:57:08,468 --> 01:57:08,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1464
01:57:08,768 --> 01:57:12,311
[SPEAKER_18]: So through the chair, what this is is for the perpetual care.

1465
01:57:12,331 --> 01:57:12,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, correct.

1466
01:57:13,091 --> 01:57:19,776
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the interest earned for the year and it goes in and it helps provide funding to the cemetery for both ordinary and for salary.

1467
01:57:22,855 --> 01:57:26,638
[SPEAKER_18]: because the ordinary and the salary comes from the sale of lots and graves.

1468
01:57:27,638 --> 01:57:28,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent, thank you.

1469
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:30,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, any further questions?

1470
01:57:33,783 --> 01:57:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a motion on the floor?

1471
01:57:35,184 --> 01:57:37,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

1472
01:57:37,105 --> 01:57:42,069
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1473
01:57:42,669 --> 01:57:45,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is a money paper, let's call for a roll call vote.

1474
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:46,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1480
01:58:00,656 --> 01:58:00,937

[SPEAKER_07]: Paper two one four two one.

1485
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:14,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Presidency counters.

1486
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:21,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body body approve the recommendation of the community preservation committee

1487
01:58:22,047 --> 01:58:24,849
[SPEAKER_07]: the Community Preservation Fund revenues in the amount of $2,047,125.

1488
01:58:24,889 --> 01:58:36,939
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, I respectfully request that you all have already approved the recommendation of the Community Preservation Fund expenditures in the amount of $2,047,125 as follows.

1489
01:58:36,959 --> 01:58:37,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Open space, $204,713.

1490
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:38,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Community housing,

1491
01:58:52,956 --> 01:58:54,137
[SPEAKER_07]: $204,713.

1492
01:58:52,976 --> 01:58:54,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Historic preservation, $204,713.

1493
01:58:54,177 --> 01:58:54,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Administration, $102,356.

1494
01:58:55,398 --> 01:58:56,058
[SPEAKER_07]: General remainder, $1,330,630.

1495
01:58:56,258 --> 01:58:56,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Total $2,047,125.

1496
01:58:57,099 --> 01:58:58,340
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, let's see who's on the call.

1497
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Alicia, are you handling this this evening also?

1498
01:59:21,361 --> 01:59:26,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I am, and I also have Daniel Evans with me from the CPA.

1499
01:59:26,505 --> 01:59:29,688
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the fiscal year 22 appropriation.

1500
01:59:30,408 --> 01:59:44,159
[SPEAKER_18]: We're estimating the $2,047,125, with 10% going to open space, community housing, historic preservation, 5% by statute to the administration, and the remainder to the general reserve.

1501
01:59:44,299 --> 01:59:46,781
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the fiscal year 22 appropriation.

1502
01:59:50,057 --> 01:59:59,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight, it's my understanding, Alicia, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but at no time, we need to do a minimum of 10% into each one of these buckets, correct, annually?

1503
02:00:00,862 --> 02:00:03,924
[SPEAKER_18]: It has to be a minimum of 10% of each bucket, correct.

1504
02:00:04,744 --> 02:00:08,586
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to appropriate this money in order to comply with the Community Preservation Act?

1505
02:00:09,246 --> 02:00:09,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1506
02:00:10,567 --> 02:00:13,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1507
02:00:13,268 --> 02:00:13,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1508
02:00:13,949 --> 02:00:14,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Box.

1509
02:00:15,429 --> 02:00:18,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, do you know how much money we currently have in the historic preservation?

1510
02:00:20,469 --> 02:00:22,291
[SPEAKER_18]: I can check that for you, one second.

1511
02:00:34,282 --> 02:00:36,484
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the historic we have reserved 174,640.

1512
02:00:36,824 --> 02:00:41,048
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, can you just repeat that again?

1513
02:00:41,408 --> 02:00:41,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, 174,640.

1514
02:00:46,483 --> 02:00:53,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So after this appropriation, we'll have 374, 640 or 378, 640 around there.

1515
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:57,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Around there, yes.

1516
02:00:59,167 --> 02:01:14,131
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why I asked Mr. President is when we just met with the fire chief to discuss the fire department budget, it was mentioned to us that some of the capital plans, as well as some of the narrative from the

1517
02:01:14,932 --> 02:01:29,183
[SPEAKER_09]: report that was just commissioned by the mayor to look at our fire stations spoke about using CPC funds from historic preservation in order to fund some of the renovations of our fire stations.

1518
02:01:29,904 --> 02:01:42,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to make sure that the city administration and I won't put Alicia on the spot, but I want to make sure that these funds that are out there that I'm sure they're going to go fast, that this is one of

1519
02:01:43,545 --> 02:01:44,867
[SPEAKER_09]: the areas that they were looking at.

1520
02:01:45,407 --> 02:02:00,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe the city administration, Alicia, I'm not sure if you're familiar or not, but did receive correspondence back from the historic commission stating that indeed, fire stations were of historic significance.

1521
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you familiar with that?

1522
02:02:01,765 --> 02:02:02,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I am familiar with that.

1523
02:02:02,887 --> 02:02:03,868
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the

1524
02:02:04,404 --> 02:02:20,227
[SPEAKER_18]: amount that I just gave you was the reserve for fiscal year 21 they don't expend that till the following year and the fiscal year 22 that you would be voting on wouldn't get expended until that is collected which is the next fiscal year but they have been faithfully expending out

1525
02:02:21,087 --> 02:02:24,348
[SPEAKER_18]: their historic money because she's already moved.

1526
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:28,490
[SPEAKER_18]: She spent $249,519 this year.

1527
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:33,932
[SPEAKER_18]: She has encumbered $20,793 and transferred $439,000.

1528
02:02:33,972 --> 02:02:37,393
[SPEAKER_18]: So they've been spending right along their historic bucket.

1529
02:02:38,133 --> 02:02:43,355
[SPEAKER_18]: And for the fire stations, what they were looking for was an off-cycle funding with some remaining funds.

1530
02:02:43,695 --> 02:02:49,417
[SPEAKER_18]: And she had to make sure that those fire stations qualified underneath the historic preservation

1531
02:02:49,896 --> 02:02:51,998
[SPEAKER_18]: in order to use the funds from the CPA.

1532
02:02:53,039 --> 02:02:54,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Which we found out they do, correct?

1533
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:55,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1534
02:02:56,481 --> 02:02:56,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1535
02:02:57,482 --> 02:03:00,364
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason why I bring it up is because I know these funds go fast.

1536
02:03:00,725 --> 02:03:06,409
[SPEAKER_09]: We've approved a number of preservation items before this council.

1537
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:17,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanna make sure because it would be the city administration reaching out to the community preservation committee requesting funds for a particular purpose like they've done in the past.

1538
02:03:17,718 --> 02:03:19,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would hope that they're requesting funds

1539
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:24,210
[SPEAKER_09]: now to look at some of the renovations on our fire stations.

1540
02:03:25,271 --> 02:03:25,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1541
02:03:25,772 --> 02:03:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Clark.

1542
02:03:26,972 --> 02:03:27,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle Evans.

1543
02:03:29,154 --> 02:03:34,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark, can you unmute Danielle, please?

1544
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:35,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle.

1545
02:03:35,979 --> 02:03:37,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1546
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:37,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening.

1547
02:03:37,921 --> 02:03:41,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Danielle Evans, Community Preservation Coordinator and Housing Planner.

1548
02:03:42,304 --> 02:03:45,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to just explain a little bit.

1549
02:03:45,907 --> 02:03:47,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general reserve

1550
02:03:47,585 --> 02:03:49,746
[SPEAKER_01]: can be used for any of the program areas.

1551
02:03:50,186 --> 02:03:57,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we do the minimum 10% in the buckets is so that we have the bulk of the money that's very flexible.

1552
02:03:57,790 --> 02:04:14,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So some years we may get more historic preservation projects or more open space projects and having them in that general reserve gives the CPC the flexibility to program the funds where the demand is.

1553
02:04:15,339 --> 02:04:15,859
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we,

1554
02:04:17,221 --> 02:04:24,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the aim would be that they're distributed, you know, a third, a third, a third, but sometimes applications don't, you know, come in that way.

1555
02:04:24,926 --> 02:04:33,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that we use all the historic that was in the bucket and then also due to the general reserve.

1556
02:04:33,272 --> 02:04:45,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing the minimum just to read it gives us the flexibility to fund, you know, projects that are important regardless of which category they're in.

1557
02:04:49,871 --> 02:04:51,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if I could follow up, Mr. President.

1558
02:04:51,651 --> 02:04:52,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle, thank you very much.

1559
02:04:52,712 --> 02:05:02,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's an excellent point, because the general remainder is a million three, according to the sheet we have in front of us.

1560
02:05:02,134 --> 02:05:11,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're seeing a third, a third, or a third, there's potentially another 400,000 available for historic preservation, including the 204.

1561
02:05:12,116 --> 02:05:14,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So that makes a huge difference.

1562
02:05:14,576 --> 02:05:15,116
[SPEAKER_09]: That's excellent.

1563
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

1564
02:05:15,796 --> 02:05:16,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1565
02:05:16,777 --> 02:05:17,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott Bailey.

1566
02:05:17,897 --> 02:05:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1567
02:05:19,903 --> 02:05:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'd like to make a motion that we, we, we, uh, convene a meeting, a committee of the whole meeting with our community preservation committee.

1568
02:05:27,066 --> 02:05:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, really now that we've been working with, uh, these funding, these funds and, and looking at these different pools, be interesting to get a report to see what, what

1569
02:05:41,967 --> 02:05:44,409
[SPEAKER_04]: demographic, what groups are really not reaching that?

1570
02:05:44,909 --> 02:05:50,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we getting enough people in the housing field that are requesting enough funding?

1571
02:05:50,713 --> 02:05:54,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we getting enough people for the funding for recreation?

1572
02:05:54,735 --> 02:06:10,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we always talk about the historical sites and this is perfect and it's where it needs to go, but at the same time, are we reaching enough people in our community that have the ability to apply for these funds?

1573
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And are we doing enough to promote that and communicate with the community?

1574
02:06:18,205 --> 02:06:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really just, if we can, is just having a meeting with the committee and just getting a breakdown and just revisit everything and look at it as a whole again to see as we move forward to the next application process that maybe we should be focusing on one area, not the other, because of,

1575
02:06:42,222 --> 02:06:44,443
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that there's equity with the funding.

1576
02:06:44,503 --> 02:06:46,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can do that, that'd be great.

1577
02:06:46,303 --> 02:06:47,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1578
02:06:47,544 --> 02:06:51,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Alicia and Danielle for being here.

1579
02:06:51,565 --> 02:06:52,205
[SPEAKER_17]: So thanks.

1580
02:06:52,545 --> 02:06:53,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Best.

1581
02:06:53,686 --> 02:06:54,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1582
02:06:54,666 --> 02:06:56,166
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, thank you, Alicia and Danielle.

1583
02:06:56,187 --> 02:06:58,447
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to add to what Councilor Scarpelli was saying.

1584
02:06:58,487 --> 02:07:00,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I've spoken with Roberta Cameron.

1585
02:07:00,828 --> 02:07:02,989
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Roberta's probably said it before this council.

1586
02:07:03,769 --> 02:07:07,090
[SPEAKER_17]: On the housing one, the costs are so high to make a real impact.

1587
02:07:07,726 --> 02:07:15,189
[SPEAKER_17]: that they'd like to have an affordable housing trust fund so that we can put money into it, build that up over time, and really hit the big project.

1588
02:07:15,269 --> 02:07:23,993
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to put that out as part of the context as well, because I think, and that may be true for something like the fire stations as well.

1589
02:07:24,033 --> 02:07:29,995
[SPEAKER_17]: That's maybe a bigger expense than a park repair or windows on a historical building, something like that.

1590
02:07:30,215 --> 02:07:35,317
[SPEAKER_17]: So just wanted to put that out as context, and thank you for letting me speak, Mr. President.

1591
02:07:35,598 --> 02:07:35,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1592
02:07:35,958 --> 02:07:36,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

1593
02:07:37,585 --> 02:07:42,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on, Councilor is that an amendment?

1594
02:07:42,986 --> 02:07:45,087
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1595
02:07:47,747 --> 02:07:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, motion by Vice President for approval, second by Councilor Scarpelli.
