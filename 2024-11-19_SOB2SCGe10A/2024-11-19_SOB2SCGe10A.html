    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=412.13s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=414.311s">I</a>  was contacted recently by a local resident that was very interested in obtaining a second meter for outdoor activities, water meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=428.597s">And</a>  after doing a little research, Mr. President, it was found out that only those that have an underground irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=440.613s">are</a>  allowed to benefit from the second meter, which does not add on the added cost for a sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=449.197s">And</a>  after looking at the actual application and reading the application, it seems to me <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=458.129s">the</a>  requirements by the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=462.131s">Tonight,</a>  I'm going to respectfully ask that the Water and Sewer Commissioners meet again, Mr. President, to discuss opening up the second water meter to all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=476.056s">This</a>  irrigation program was established in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=479.897s">And</a>  the first phase was to open it up to residential water meters <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=487.619s">strictly</a>  for underground irrigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=491.361s">And</a>  at the time, it was stated, Mr. President, that this was going to be phase one of the program back in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=500.146s">And</a>  here we are 11 years later, and there's never been another phase rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=506.289s">So</a>  if you're a commercial property in the community, you are currently not eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=511.992s">And</a>  if you are a property owner, that doesn't happen to have, like my property, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=516.618s">I</a>  don't have an underground irrigation system, but I do use a hose. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=520.901s">And</a>  sometimes I may do it by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=523.722s">Sometimes</a>  I may put out one of those little devices that sprinkles water around. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=528.305s">And</a>  like many of us, some people water their garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=534.349s">Some</a>  people fill their pool up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=536.93s">And</a>  to me, the same principle applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=540.833s">If</a>  that water is not finding its way back into the sewer system, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=545.828s">Then,</a>  you know, the whole idea of setting this up was to give taxpayers a relief, a rate relief from using water outside of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=557.615s">And</a>  the whole intent was to provide that relief to those who do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=563.7s">And</a>  I think expanding the program after 11 years, I think we have a good handle on how many people have taken advantage of this program and look at the metrics regarding how this is working out, what has been the cost, because there is a cost not only to the resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=581.454s">that's</a>  putting in a second meter, but there's also a cost to those who pay water and sewer in the community, because as we all know, Mr. President, when the water comes into the community, it's meted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=593.322s">So</a>  there's giant meters that show how much water is coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=596.064s">The</a>  MWRA assesses us through what's coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=601.168s">So</a>  they don't look and say, well, you're using the water outside, using it inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=605.911s">The</a>  MWRA doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=607.972s">The</a>  city of Medford created that program which allows us to give people, if you want to call it a reduction or abatement, on the sewer for consumption outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=618.258s">And</a>  so there is a cost to all of us regarding this meter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=624.621s">But</a>  I think this program, Mr. President, in all honesty, should be expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=629.143s">Because</a>  to me, we should be looking at just people that have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=634.346s">we</a>  should be looking at anyone that uses outside water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=638.488s">And</a>  what I would like to do, Mr. President, I have a copy of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=643.611s">A</a>  lot of residents aren't even familiar that there's a program that exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=648.253s">But</a>  there's an irrigation meter application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=650.895s">The</a>  fee is $300 to fill out this fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=654.957s">And</a>  then it goes on to give you the guidelines for the residential irrigation installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=663.524s">And</a>  just for edification, Mr. President, I think people should be aware if they are interested, the city allows irrigation meters on in-ground irrigation systems for residential accounts only. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=675.973s">Applications</a>  are taken in order they are received and will be handled by the water division at their discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=682.711s">All</a>  applicants must pass a pre-installation inspection and follow the guidelines for basic residential irrigation meter installation and requirements as stated on the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=695.754s">So</a>  as you can see from this particular guideline, you have to have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=704.755s">The</a>  first requirement is a licensed plumber must obtain a permit <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=709.424s">at</a>  the building department in order to install this meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=713.587s">So</a>  you can't install it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=716.109s">A</a>  certified and tested backflow device must be furnished at the customer's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=722.334s">Customers</a>  must maintain the backflow prevention assembly on the irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=727.38s">to</a>  ensure protection of the portable water supply with yearly inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=732.243s">Backflow</a>  tests are conducted by the engineering division, and the current fee for inspection is $60 annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=739.967s">So</a>  there's a $300 charge for the meter itself, and then there's a $60 annual charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=747.452s">So</a>  if you don't use a lot of outside water, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=751.574s">depending</a>  on what you're using, it may not be worthwhile from a financial standpoint to partake in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=758.279s">So</a>  you really have to sit down and figure out how much watering you're doing outside in order if this makes financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=766.504s">All</a>  irrigation systems must comply with all local and state landscape irrigation regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=772.308s">All</a>  pipes from the service through the irrigation meter <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=775.948s">and</a>  three feet past the backflow preventer must be brass or copper material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=781.171s">No</a>  plastic galvanized or cast iron pipes are allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=785.473s">New</a>  and existing dwellings may split the service connection for irrigation with backflow device that has a T or a Y split to separate domestic and irrigation water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=799.015s">The</a>  city of Medford metering division is not responsible for pressure loss or consumption and volume issues resulting from the split connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=807.0s">The</a>  meter and the reading device are issued by the city and the price is included in the application fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=814.846s">All</a>  pipes from the irrigation meter must be inspected to ensure that there are no cross connections between domestic and irrigation lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=823.932s">You</a>  must install shut off valves before and after the new irrigation meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=829.387s">So</a>  that's pretty much what the rules and regulations are, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=832.789s">I</a>  would respectfully ask on behalf of the many hundreds, if not thousands of residents that water their lawn, that tend to their gardens, that fill their pool, and use a hose outside for a number of different reasons, that I respectfully ask the Water and Sewer Commission to expand the program currently to all residents <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=855.68s">if</a>  need be, Mr. President, and also go into phase two, which would allow for the commercial application of outside irrigation as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=867.008s">So</a>  I respectfully put that in the form of a motion, and I thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=873.028s">Councilor</a>  Marks, if you could amend that for me, if the Water Commission could look into the program that the City of Revere uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=884.596s">They</a>  have, for their residents, not a big user, but they have a meter that goes onto the spigot, they charge them a nominal fee to rent for the season, and you put it on your outside spigot, and at the end of the season, you turn it in and you pay <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=902.577s">for</a>  the water that you use for your outside water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=905.077s">It</a>  doesn't cost any money for any plumbing or any of the, it doesn't cost $100 in plumbing fees to put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=911.979s">And</a>  they see it seems to be working well, but say it's just a, it's a meter that goes onto your outside spigot. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=918.36s">And</a>  at the end of the season, you bring it back, you turn it back in and they charge you for whatever water you use through that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=923.261s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm not opposed to looking at that and amending the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=927.221s">So</a>  I would respectfully add that in addition to my motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=931.002s">that</a>  the Water and Sewer Commissioners look at the city of Revere and how they use an outside meter for residents that does not incur the cost of hiring a plumber, as well as other associated costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=945.974s">So</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=947.715s">It's</a>  a lot easier for the residents to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=950.418s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=954.501s">You</a>  make it this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=955.922s">I</a>  can't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=958.164s">So</a>  any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=961.822s">Okay,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=965.924s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=967.945s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=969.706s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=970.107s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=973.529s">21414,</a>  offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford Fire Deputy Chief of Operations, Brian Conan, be congratulated on his retirement and for his commitment and dedication for serving the residents of Medford for over 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=989.477s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=991.078s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=992.719s">I</a>  rise today with all due respect and honor for one of methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=997.261s">Finest</a>  Brian Cronin for anyone that knows Brian has served this city with distinction for 42 years, Mr. President, over four decades of an impeccable record, uh, protecting the life and property of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1014.827s">You</a>  couldn't meet a kinder, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1017.066s">gentle</a>  a person, Mr. President, everyone that I've spoken to that it has seen this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1023.097s">Uh,</a>  the first words out of their mouth were we're sad to see such a man of character leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1030.578s">And</a>  I'm hoping, Mr. President, that he comes back in other capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1035.741s">We</a>  were just talking about, and I didn't mention this to Brian, but we were just talking about emergency preparedness and how that position for a number of years has been somewhat of a stipend side position that's gone unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1051.988s">And</a>  it's such an important role in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1054.529s">And</a>  respectfully, I'd love to see Brian come back as the emergency preparedness <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1061.159s">head</a>  in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1063.14s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, Brian is retiring as the Deputy Chief of Operations, a very high post within the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1073.664s">Brian</a>  came to us September 13, 1979. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1075.545s">He</a>  was appointed to the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1081.063s">June</a>  27, 1980, Brian received a special commendation from Chief Leo McCabe for actions at a water rescue incident at the Mystic Lakes on June 25, 1980, under the direction of Lieutenant Charles Parris. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1097.809s">September</a>  22, 1981, Brian responded to a house fire at 69 Jerome Street as a member of Engine 2 under the direction of Captain Paul Gennetti, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1110.122s">Firefighter</a>  Joe Amato and Firefighter Brian Cronin located and removed Mr. Edward Whitaker from a second bedroom after first isolating the fully involved bedroom by closing the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1124.829s">For</a>  their actions that day, the crew of Engine 2, Captain Paul Gianetti, Firefighter Joe Amato, and Firefighter Brian Cronin were awarded the Firefighter of the Year Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1137.354s">May</a>  3, 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1139.333s">promoted</a>  to lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1142.615s">October</a>  22, 1988, Brian responded to a house fire at 20 Rockwell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1149.678s">Under</a>  the direction of District Commander Donald McCarthy, the latter two crew of Lieutenant Cronin, Firefighter Robert Booth, Firefighter Alfred Magliari, and District Command Aid Robert Murray, located and removed two residents from the involved second floor bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1168.715s">October</a>  22, 2000, department commendation from Chief Frank Gilberti, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1175.897s">for</a>  actions at the medical emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1178.758s">Engine</a>  five crew consisting of Lieutenant Cronin, firefighter Joe Frazier, and firefighter Rich Jentz responded to a Dexter Street address on a report of a woman in labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1192.042s">The</a>  woman was 34 weeks along in her pregnancy with her twins. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1199.279s">Her</a>  water had broken and a breach delivery was imminent with a single leg presentational and umbilical cord wrapped around the left hip and leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1209.785s">The</a>  mother was placed in the delivery position and the right foot presented itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1214.882s">The</a>  patient was allowed to push and the baby's torso delivered easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1219.383s">The</a>  head was more serious situation and delivered with difficulty after some delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1224.905s">The</a>  baby was suction dried, but was lethargic with the heartbeat and a severe respiratory distress close to cardiac arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1235.813s">Stimulation</a>  and additional suctioning of the baby's airway made some improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1240.235s">The</a>  baby was resuscitated with a bag valve mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1244.217s">With</a>  paramedics now on the scene, this was accomplished with the umbilical cord still attached, with all personnel working in very close quarters, and the second baby beginning to crown. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1257.282s">After</a>  several minutes of manual restitution, the baby began to breathe spontaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1265.558s">The</a>  twin brother was delivered without incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1269.101s">The</a>  emergency department doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, where the mom and the twins were taken, told the parents, quote, you are lucky those men knew what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1279.59s">Otherwise,</a>  you and the babies may not have survived, end of quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1284.754s">Lieutenant</a>  Cronin praised his crew and the paramedics for their compassion and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1291.312s">Lieutenant</a>  Cronin, Firefighter Frazier, Firefighter Jentz were awarded the

deceased firefighters, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1414.909s">I</a>  personally want to thank all our brave firefighters <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1419.272s">But</a>  in particular, Mr. President, the Deputy Captain of Operations, Deputy Chief Brian Cronin, who is not only a firefighter, Mr. President, he is a close friend to many. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1435.776s">and</a>  he's gonna be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1438.178s">His</a>  professionalism, the way he carried himself, the way he made every firefighter, no matter what position he served, all the way up to deputy chief, Mr. President, he made every firefighter, whether you're on the job for one day or on it for 40 years, like himself, he respected and made them all feel welcome and at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1461.584s">And</a>  truly, it's firefighters like Brian Cronin that make the family of firefighters what they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1468.688s">And</a>  I would ask that on behalf of this council, that we
