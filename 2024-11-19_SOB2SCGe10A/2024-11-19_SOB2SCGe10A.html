    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=412.13s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=414.311s">I</a>  was contacted recently by a local resident that was very interested in obtaining a second meter for outdoor activities, water meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=428.597s">And</a>  after doing a little research, Mr. President, it was found out that only those that have an underground irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=440.613s">are</a>  allowed to benefit from the second meter, which does not add on the added cost for a sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=449.197s">And</a>  after looking at the actual application and reading the application, it seems to me <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=458.129s">the</a>  requirements by the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=462.131s">Tonight,</a>  I'm going to respectfully ask that the Water and Sewer Commissioners meet again, Mr. President, to discuss opening up the second water meter to all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=476.056s">This</a>  irrigation program was established in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=479.897s">And</a>  the first phase was to open it up to residential water meters <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=487.619s">strictly</a>  for underground irrigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=491.361s">And</a>  at the time, it was stated, Mr. President, that this was going to be phase one of the program back in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=500.146s">And</a>  here we are 11 years later, and there's never been another phase rolled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=506.289s">So</a>  if you're a commercial property in the community, you are currently not eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=511.992s">And</a>  if you are a property owner, that doesn't happen to have, like my property, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=516.618s">I</a>  don't have an underground irrigation system, but I do use a hose. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=520.901s">And</a>  sometimes I may do it by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=523.722s">Sometimes</a>  I may put out one of those little devices that sprinkles water around. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=528.305s">And</a>  like many of us, some people water their garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=534.349s">Some</a>  people fill their pool up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=536.93s">And</a>  to me, the same principle applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=540.833s">If</a>  that water is not finding its way back into the sewer system, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=545.828s">Then,</a>  you know, the whole idea of setting this up was to give taxpayers a relief, a rate relief from using water outside of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=557.615s">And</a>  the whole intent was to provide that relief to those who do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=563.7s">And</a>  I think expanding the program after 11 years, I think we have a good handle on how many people have taken advantage of this program and look at the metrics regarding how this is working out, what has been the cost, because there is a cost not only to the resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=581.454s">that's</a>  putting in a second meter, but there's also a cost to those who pay water and sewer in the community, because as we all know, Mr. President, when the water comes into the community, it's meted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=593.322s">So</a>  there's giant meters that show how much water is coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=596.064s">The</a>  MWRA assesses us through what's coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=601.168s">So</a>  they don't look and say, well, you're using the water outside, using it inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=605.911s">The</a>  MWRA doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=607.972s">The</a>  city of Medford created that program which allows us to give people, if you want to call it a reduction or abatement, on the sewer for consumption outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=618.258s">And</a>  so there is a cost to all of us regarding this meter program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=624.621s">But</a>  I think this program, Mr. President, in all honesty, should be expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=629.143s">Because</a>  to me, we should be looking at just people that have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=634.346s">we</a>  should be looking at anyone that uses outside water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=638.488s">And</a>  what I would like to do, Mr. President, I have a copy of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=643.611s">A</a>  lot of residents aren't even familiar that there's a program that exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=648.253s">But</a>  there's an irrigation meter application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=650.895s">The</a>  fee is $300 to fill out this fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=654.957s">And</a>  then it goes on to give you the guidelines for the residential irrigation installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=663.524s">And</a>  just for edification, Mr. President, I think people should be aware if they are interested, the city allows irrigation meters on in-ground irrigation systems for residential accounts only. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=675.973s">Applications</a>  are taken in order they are received and will be handled by the water division at their discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=682.711s">All</a>  applicants must pass a pre-installation inspection and follow the guidelines for basic residential irrigation meter installation and requirements as stated on the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=695.754s">So</a>  as you can see from this particular guideline, you have to have an underground irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=704.755s">The</a>  first requirement is a licensed plumber must obtain a permit <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=709.424s">at</a>  the building department in order to install this meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=713.587s">So</a>  you can't install it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=716.109s">A</a>  certified and tested backflow device must be furnished at the customer's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=722.334s">Customers</a>  must maintain the backflow prevention assembly on the irrigation system <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=727.38s">to</a>  ensure protection of the portable water supply with yearly inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=732.243s">Backflow</a>  tests are conducted by the engineering division, and the current fee for inspection is $60 annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=739.967s">So</a>  there's a $300 charge for the meter itself, and then there's a $60 annual charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=747.452s">So</a>  if you don't use a lot of outside water, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=751.574s">depending</a>  on what you're using, it may not be worthwhile from a financial standpoint to partake in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=758.279s">So</a>  you really have to sit down and figure out how much watering you're doing outside in order if this makes financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=766.504s">All</a>  irrigation systems must comply with all local and state landscape irrigation regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=772.308s">All</a>  pipes from the service through the irrigation meter <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=775.948s">and</a>  three feet past the backflow preventer must be brass or copper material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=781.171s">No</a>  plastic galvanized or cast iron pipes are allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=785.473s">New</a>  and existing dwellings may split the service connection for irrigation with backflow device that has a T or a Y split to separate domestic and irrigation water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=799.015s">The</a>  city of Medford metering division is not responsible for pressure loss or consumption and volume issues resulting from the split connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=807.0s">The</a>  meter and the reading device are issued by the city and the price is included in the application fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=814.846s">All</a>  pipes from the irrigation meter must be inspected to ensure that there are no cross connections between domestic and irrigation lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=823.932s">You</a>  must install shut off valves before and after the new irrigation meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=829.387s">So</a>  that's pretty much what the rules and regulations are, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=832.789s">I</a>  would respectfully ask on behalf of the many hundreds, if not thousands of residents that water their lawn, that tend to their gardens, that fill their pool, and use a hose outside for a number of different reasons, that I respectfully ask the Water and Sewer Commission to expand the program currently to all residents <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=855.68s">if</a>  need be, Mr. President, and also go into phase two, which would allow for the commercial application of outside irrigation as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=867.008s">So</a>  I respectfully put that in the form of a motion, and I thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=873.028s">Councilor</a>  Marks, if you could amend that for me, if the Water Commission could look into the program that the City of Revere uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=884.596s">They</a>  have, for their residents, not a big user, but they have a meter that goes onto the spigot, they charge them a nominal fee to rent for the season, and you put it on your outside spigot, and at the end of the season, you turn it in and you pay <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=902.577s">for</a>  the water that you use for your outside water. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=905.077s">It</a>  doesn't cost any money for any plumbing or any of the, it doesn't cost $100 in plumbing fees to put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=911.979s">And</a>  they see it seems to be working well, but say it's just a, it's a meter that goes onto your outside spigot. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=918.36s">And</a>  at the end of the season, you bring it back, you turn it back in and they charge you for whatever water you use through that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=923.261s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm not opposed to looking at that and amending the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=927.221s">So</a>  I would respectfully add that in addition to my motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=931.002s">that</a>  the Water and Sewer Commissioners look at the city of Revere and how they use an outside meter for residents that does not incur the cost of hiring a plumber, as well as other associated costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=945.974s">So</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=947.715s">It's</a>  a lot easier for the residents to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=950.418s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=954.501s">You</a>  make it this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=955.922s">I</a>  can't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=958.164s">So</a>  any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=961.822s">Okay,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=965.924s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=967.945s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=969.706s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=970.107s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=973.529s">21414,</a>  offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford Fire Deputy Chief of Operations, Brian Conan, be congratulated on his retirement and for his commitment and dedication for serving the residents of Medford for over 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=989.477s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=991.078s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=992.719s">I</a>  rise today with all due respect and honor for one of methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=997.261s">Finest</a>  Brian Cronin for anyone that knows Brian has served this city with distinction for 42 years, Mr. President, over four decades of an impeccable record, uh, protecting the life and property of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1014.827s">You</a>  couldn't meet a kinder, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1017.066s">gentle</a>  a person, Mr. President, everyone that I've spoken to that it has seen this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1023.097s">Uh,</a>  the first words out of their mouth were we're sad to see such a man of character leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1030.578s">And</a>  I'm hoping, Mr. President, that he comes back in other capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1035.741s">We</a>  were just talking about, and I didn't mention this to Brian, but we were just talking about emergency preparedness and how that position for a number of years has been somewhat of a stipend side position that's gone unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1051.988s">And</a>  it's such an important role in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1054.529s">And</a>  respectfully, I'd love to see Brian come back as the emergency preparedness <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1061.159s">head</a>  in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1063.14s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, Brian is retiring as the Deputy Chief of Operations, a very high post within the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1073.664s">Brian</a>  came to us September 13, 1979. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1075.545s">He</a>  was appointed to the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1081.063s">June</a>  27, 1980, Brian received a special commendation from Chief Leo McCabe for actions at a water rescue incident at the Mystic Lakes on June 25, 1980, under the direction of Lieutenant Charles Parris. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1097.809s">September</a>  22, 1981, Brian responded to a house fire at 69 Jerome Street as a member of Engine 2 under the direction of Captain Paul Gennetti, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1110.122s">Firefighter</a>  Joe Amato and Firefighter Brian Cronin located and removed Mr. Edward Whitaker from a second bedroom after first isolating the fully involved bedroom by closing the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1124.829s">For</a>  their actions that day, the crew of Engine 2, Captain Paul Gianetti, Firefighter Joe Amato, and Firefighter Brian Cronin were awarded the Firefighter of the Year Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1137.354s">May</a>  3, 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1139.333s">promoted</a>  to lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1142.615s">October</a>  22, 1988, Brian responded to a house fire at 20 Rockwell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1149.678s">Under</a>  the direction of District Commander Donald McCarthy, the latter two crew of Lieutenant Cronin, Firefighter Robert Booth, Firefighter Alfred Magliari, and District Command Aid Robert Murray, located and removed two residents from the involved second floor bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1168.715s">October</a>  22, 2000, department commendation from Chief Frank Gilberti, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1175.897s">for</a>  actions at the medical emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1178.758s">Engine</a>  five crew consisting of Lieutenant Cronin, firefighter Joe Frazier, and firefighter Rich Jentz responded to a Dexter Street address on a report of a woman in labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1192.042s">The</a>  woman was 34 weeks along in her pregnancy with her twins. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1199.279s">Her</a>  water had broken and a breach delivery was imminent with a single leg presentational and umbilical cord wrapped around the left hip and leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1209.785s">The</a>  mother was placed in the delivery position and the right foot presented itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1214.882s">The</a>  patient was allowed to push and the baby's torso delivered easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1219.383s">The</a>  head was more serious situation and delivered with difficulty after some delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1224.905s">The</a>  baby was suction dried, but was lethargic with the heartbeat and a severe respiratory distress close to cardiac arrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1235.813s">Stimulation</a>  and additional suctioning of the baby's airway made some improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1240.235s">The</a>  baby was resuscitated with a bag valve mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1244.217s">With</a>  paramedics now on the scene, this was accomplished with the umbilical cord still attached, with all personnel working in very close quarters, and the second baby beginning to crown. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1257.282s">After</a>  several minutes of manual restitution, the baby began to breathe spontaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1265.558s">The</a>  twin brother was delivered without incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1269.101s">The</a>  emergency department doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, where the mom and the twins were taken, told the parents, quote, you are lucky those men knew what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1279.59s">Otherwise,</a>  you and the babies may not have survived, end of quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1284.754s">Lieutenant</a>  Cronin praised his crew and the paramedics for their compassion and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1291.312s">Lieutenant</a>  Cronin, Firefighter Frazier, Firefighter Jentz were awarded the

deceased firefighters, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1414.909s">I</a>  personally want to thank all our brave firefighters <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1419.272s">But</a>  in particular, Mr. President, the Deputy Captain of Operations, Deputy Chief Brian Cronin, who is not only a firefighter, Mr. President, he is a close friend to many. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1435.776s">and</a>  he's gonna be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1438.178s">His</a>  professionalism, the way he carried himself, the way he made every firefighter, no matter what position he served, all the way up to deputy chief, Mr. President, he made every firefighter, whether you're on the job for one day or on it for 40 years, like himself, he respected and made them all feel welcome and at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1461.584s">And</a>  truly, it's firefighters like Brian Cronin that make the family of firefighters what they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1468.688s">And</a>  I would ask that on behalf of this council, that we

<a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2129.72s">Go</a>  to the beach area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2132.061s">But</a>  every year there's an accident up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2134.963s">If</a>  you go through the woods, it's littered with cans and toilet paper and diapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2142.006s">It's</a>  really a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2142.647s">And</a>  I had the opportunity to drive down there at 5.30 on Monday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2148.373s">The</a>  whole stretch of that Mystic Valley Parkway was just littered with cases of beer and bags of trash or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2156.636s">It's</a>  really a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2157.997s">But</a>  aside from that, we've had meetings down there with the residents, the mayor, the police, and I can't seem to come up with a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2169.742s">Chief</a>  doesn't want to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2171.523s">They</a>  won't take it in tow because there's no signs posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2175.173s">and</a>  we don't have an ordinance to allow us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2178.156s">So</a>  after the last meeting we had last week, it was suggested that city council have the solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2188.3s">draw</a>  up a language to amend the current private way parking ordinance they were having. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2195.261s">According</a>  to the Kim, it's not that big of a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2199.022s">Two</a>  or three sentences get added on to that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2201.602s">And</a>  if we can get it, hopefully get it out this week and get it back soon before the summer break, give these people that live in these neighborhoods some much needed help. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2209.964s">Like</a>  I say, because it's not fair to them every Saturday and Sunday that they had to, you know, you drive through the Winchester end <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2215.921s">There's</a>  not a car parked on that over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2218.063s">And</a>  it's a shame that there's not more parking down that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2223.688s">The</a>  DCR has land to maybe put some more parking down there, and maybe they should do that at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2229.734s">But</a>  like I said, it's just not fair that every week these residents have to suffer down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2234.238s">And</a>  I'm tired of going down there when I'm getting the calls and being a policeman for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2240.497s">So</a>  again, I ask my fellow councilors to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2244.286s">I</a>  think there's some people here that may want to speak on that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2249.379s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2250.335s">Council</a>  President Cavill for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2252.536s">I</a>  know that I've talked to a few neighbors and they're appalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2256.059s">And</a>  I think that changing this ordinance might help. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2258.42s">But</a>  I know that we should look into, I know Council Member Marks has brought this up for years, looking at our private ways in general in our community and the lack of funding we're losing because they're not being charged to our roads and streets here for federal reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2274.95s">So</a>  I think that it's important that maybe we call for <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2279.814s">either</a>  a subcommittee, a committee of the whole soon to visit this ordinance in general, and look at the negatives of having that in place and trying to weigh the pros and cons. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2292.045s">And</a>  I think that that might be the beginning, but I think that this has to be something that we reach out to the director of DCR as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2301.754s">And</a>  if we can't send him, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2305.564s">I</a>  don't know who it is, they change them every month, but send out communications DCI director that enlightens them on what's going on in that area, because it's obviously it's being used for recreational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2319.018s">And</a>  if those, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2324.687s">cars</a>  that are coming and families that are showing up and those parties that are throwing in our residential neighborhoods, if they're giving different outlets in different areas where they are approved to recreate and we can help them with that, that might be something we can move them along. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2341.15s">But</a>  I think something has to be done because the neighborhood is failing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2346.451s">I</a>  know that some of the music and the noise and <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2351.802s">heard</a>  gunshots. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2353.583s">One</a>  person told me, I mean, it sounds like it's like the okay corral down there and it's something that we really have to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2360.027s">I</a>  know that Councilor Caraviello has been the active de facto sheriff and going down there, but it shouldn't be a city councilor that's going down to support and help our neighbors in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2373.415s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2374.376s">we</a>  have to really get our state delegates involved and other state agencies to get involved to make sure that we find some solutions to move these these groups out of there because it's really deteriorating that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2386.5s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2390.8s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2391.581s">I</a>  want to thank President Caraviello for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2394.963s">I</a>  have two received calls regarding this issue, and this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2398.845s">It's</a>  long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2400.546s">I</a>  know Councilor Caraviello mentioned previously there was a meeting that the administration held, and I know that it was sponsored by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2411.213s">We</a>  weren't invited to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2413.835s">I</a>  wish I knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2414.815s">I</a>  would have loved to have been there, but we weren't invited to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2418.538s">But</a>  this is an issue that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2421.02s">There</a>  are many quality of life issues here with regard to noise, safety, when you talk about gunshots, I've heard about drug use, I've heard about trash, grills, the possibility of fire, people swimming where they're not supposed to be swimming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2435.126s">These</a>  are quality of life issues that are impacting residents and the residents should not have to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2440.969s">Not</a>  only the quality of life issues, these are public health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2444.682s">the</a>  people going to the bathroom in the woods from what I hear, this is just unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2450.764s">It</a>  needs to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2451.744s">The</a>  administration needs to help out with either calling the state delegation or calling the environmental police or the state police at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2460.046s">I'd</a>  like to amend the resolution to add that the <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2464.628s">state</a>  police step up their patrols on the weekends and make sure that this is dealt with immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2469.877s">I</a>  think as far as the ordinance being adjusted to allow resident only parking and allow the police to enforce it, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2478.013s">I</a>  fully support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2479.094s">I</a>  think it'd be nice to discuss it, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli said, just to see if there's any additional safeguards that we can place in this, but this needs to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2487.38s">It's</a>  long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2488.941s">And</a>  like I said previously, the residents should not have to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2493.004s">So</a>  I second the resolution that was offered by Councilor, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2498.047s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2500.389s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2502.948s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and thank you President Caravelle for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2506.016s">As</a>  Councilor Falco mentioned there's a number of issues going on here I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2510.517s">Great</a>  concern with the public safety issues in public health between the trash and the swimming and the open fires. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2516.178s">I've</a>  been reaching out to DCR probably as long as I've lived here about the trash in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2519.799s">It</a>  seems they have a carry and carry out policy, which essentially in practice is just carry and leave wherever you can find it in bags wherever else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2527.66s">So</a>  that's a major issue and I would love to have our state delegation help and see what we can do there because you can see it with your own eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2535.442s">This</a>  isn't something that can be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2536.862s">If</a>  anyone from DCR ever drives by, they can see all the challenges that are faced. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2540.501s">public</a>  health, public safety, and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2543.061s">I</a>  do have concerns just about the private ways as far as enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2547.942s">It's</a>  my understanding by state statute that because these aren't accepted as public ways, we can't use city money for the police to enforce parking on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2559.204s">I</a>  support Councilor Scarpelli as far as moving to a committee of the whole and just exploring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2564.445s">I</a>  would be interested in because the ideal way to do this is these streets become accepted as public ways, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2570.418s">If</a>  we could get just insight from this, the city engineer the traffic engineer, or the process of accepting these private ways as public ways so we can enforce them as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2581.386s">And</a>  if there's a priority list, or you know any process that exists already for moving a number of these private ways that have a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2589.903s">And</a>  accepting them as public ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2592.567s">And</a>  I do just want to read also from the Commission on parking and policy and enforcement, they did address this issue and one of the recommendations was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2601.083s">to</a>  consider a program where residents of private ways can enforce parking by towing, which is allowable by the state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2607.625s">This</a>  program would allow residents of private ways to file a permit notifying the city of the preferred tow company for that private way to tow away vehicles parked illegally on that private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2616.189s">I</a>  guess this is a program that's done in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2619.09s">Medford</a>  isn't alone in having private ways, but we are specific to having very desirable private ways for parking for a number of resources within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2628.679s">So</a>  I would love to have that committee of the whole to really talk this through and address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2633.641s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2638.223s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2639.824s">Thank</a>  you to my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2642.485s">I</a>  hear what Councilor Morell is saying about the legal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2645.286s">So</a>  I would like Solicitor Scanlon to confirm that we are allowed to take this short-term step. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2650.148s">It</a>  sounds like she thinks we are, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2654.238s">I</a>  was driving through there on a Saturday recently, and it is bonkers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2658.179s">I</a>  mean, there are so many people down there, more than I've ever seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2661.84s">And</a>  you can really tell because there are multiple ice cream trucks up at Shannon Beach, and they're really taking advantage of it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2667.742s">It</a>  took me 10, 15 minutes to get from the circle at High Street up into Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2673.424s">So</a>  it's a huge volume of people up there every weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2678.17s">I</a>  think what everyone has said is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2680.871s">The</a>  piece that I really just wanna make sure we take on is even if we are able to implement the short-term solution, we can't forget the long-term solution and really addressing this larger issue of private ways, because at the end of the day, what Councilor Scarpelli said is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2694.637s">We're</a>  gonna end up spending city resources on enforcing this issue, but not getting the money from Chapter 90, not getting the money back for the large volume of private ways that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2705.982s">Certainly</a>  I support whatever we can do to address this immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2708.503s">It</a>  seems like the situation is way out of hand and it got that way pretty quickly, but I agree with Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2716.807s">We</a>  have to have some sort of committee of the whole on the long-term situation with private ways in our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2723.63s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2775.214s">40%</a>  of our streets we can't enforce on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2779.895s">It's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2782.795s">And</a>  I've been talking about this issue for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2784.936s">No</a>  one wants to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2787.19s">But</a>  it is an issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2789.172s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, if I was the CEO, which would have happened where there would have been signs posted all in those streets stating resident only. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2802.415s">And</a>  I would have had the tow trucks out there and the cops out there ticketing immediately and worry about it after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2810.283s">Because</a>  what we're doing is providing parking for people that want to use the DCR land. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2816.97s">So</a>  we essentially become the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2820.734s">DCR's</a>  not providing parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2822.936s">We</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2825.449s">And</a>  it's a cop-out to say, well, it's a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2829.251s">What</a>  benefit? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2830.091s">Ask</a>  any of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2831.272s">What</a>  benefit do you have living on a private road? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2835.213s">You</a>  have zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2836.854s">You</a>  pay the same tax as everyone else, and you get zero benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2841.636s">So</a>  if they're unable to give tickets on a private road, why are we plowing? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2846.818s">That's</a>  city money. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2847.999s">That's</a>  city resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2849.66s">We're</a>  allowed to plow? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2852.961s">To</a>  me, that has zero bearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2855.662s">And</a>  if there was leadership in the community, they would have acted immediately, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2861.125s">And</a>  it's no different as what's happening at the top of Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2865.768s">It's</a>  no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2867.789s">And</a>  really, it upsets me because I think the city should be the first to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2872.832s">Worry</a>  about the consequences after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2876.694s">Send</a>  a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2877.615s">We're</a>  not going to tolerate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2880.036s">We're</a>  not going to allow you to invade our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2883.597s">We're</a>  not going to allow you to have cookouts in front of someone's home and leave debris behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2888.638s">We're</a>  not going to allow you to change out of your bathing suit in front of our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2894.259s">We're</a>  not going to allow public drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2898.0s">That's</a>  the message that has to be sent, not that we're worried if we give a ticket out because, oh, it's a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2904.601s">That's</a>  baloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2905.781s">That's</a>  absolute baloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2908.462s">And</a>  to hide behind that, Mr. President, is shirking your duties, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2915.723s">These</a>  residents, they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2916.885s">They've</a>  been going through this for years, for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2920.73s">And</a>  if it takes an ordinance change, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2922.772s">I</a>  don't know if that's going to do it all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2925.696s">We</a>  have a serious issue with over the years, over the last 50, 60, 70 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2931.593s">when</a>  this city was being built up and so forth, that the city at the time allowed them to make private ways, Mr. President, because they didn't want to go through the acceptance process to accept a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2943.603s">And</a>  it was done for a number of reasons, because some of these streets, Mr. President, didn't have the proper infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2949.668s">You</a>  go up the heights, a lot of them didn't have the proper drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2954.81s">and</a>  they tapped into the sewer system where they shouldn't have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2958.273s">So</a>  a lot of these roads were created as paper roads and private ways because the city wasn't, for years, didn't really follow through on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2969.083s">There's</a>  no reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2970.765s">If</a>  a road still wants to be a private way, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2973.607s">But</a>  we should send out a survey to everyone on private ways right now and ask them, would you like to change over? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2980.553s">And</a>  for those that want to change over, we should move immediately to change over, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2985.281s">There's</a>  a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2986.423s">For</a>  those that want to keep it private, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2991.395s">But</a>  everyone should be receiving the same city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2994.737s">You</a>  pay the same taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2996.379s">And</a>  police enforcement is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2999.08s">Plowing</a>  is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3000.662s">Your</a>  sidewalk being done is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3002.763s">Your</a>  tree being trimmed is a city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3005.225s">And</a>  there's no reason why 269 roads, which are thousands of homes and tens of thousands of residents, have to say, well, I live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3015.512s">I'm</a>  not entitled to the same enforcement or the same upkeep on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3020.015s">It's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3021.276s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3023.797s">So</a>  I support the president, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3027.378s">I</a>  would ask that immediately enforcement take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3032.701s">And</a>  I know that request already happened through a neighborhood meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3035.782s">And</a>  I guess those saw, those wooden saw horses were broken in half and people tossed them aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3042.124s">But</a>  we need true enforcement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3044.025s">And</a>  if we need to station someone there, Mr. President, have a police officer stationed in that area, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3053.208s">then</a>  so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3054.068s">This</a>  is not Mayberry. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3056.269s">It's</a>  a city of 60,000 people, seven square miles, $190 million budget, and we can't tell residents that are paying tens of thousands of dollars in taxes, sorry, you live on a private website. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3071.536s">We'd</a>  love to help you out, but we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3073.857s">You're</a>  on a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3076.118s">Unacceptable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3077.058s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, for bringing this issue up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3081.98s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3082.76s">I</a>  just want to note that by I believe our current ordinance and our number of legal cases at the state level enforcement related to public safety is allowable and encouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3093.905s">And</a>  there's a number of reasons related to public safety that the street, the police can enforce on private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3100.308s">So</a>  I think to Councilor Behr's point, there may be something easy we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3105.43s">The</a>  city solicitor can help us out with because this is a public safety issue.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3109.06s">I</a>  believe there was some towing that went on a couple of weeks ago because of that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3113.063s">Councilor</a>  Karygiela. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3116.206s">Councilor</a>  Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3117.067s">It's</a>  a cop-out because I've been down there with the police, and they're saying—I was there last Sunday with Officer Montgomery, and as fast as Councilor Paul knows, he's telling them not to pull on there, saying, you can park here all we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3132.579s">The</a>  biggest issue is there's no posted signs on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3136.562s">And</a>  but I agree with Council Marks, tow all the cars out of there, we'll deal with it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3141.983s">Because</a>  again, these are Medford residents' cars that you're towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3144.984s">They're</a>  all out of city and out of state plates there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3147.884s">I</a>  was there, I'll tell you, last Sunday, in front of a neighbor's house, a pickup truck pulls up with six kayaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3156.866s">I</a>  says, well, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3157.967s">He</a>  says, I'm parking my truck here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3159.807s">He</a>  says, it's a private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3161.627s">I</a>  says, well, I'm telling you, your car's not gonna be here when you come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3165.905s">Meanwhile,</a>  the tow trucks were there, the police were there, and Officer McGivery's standing there again. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3171.426s">I've</a>  been down there multiple Saturdays and Sundays with the police standing there, not able to do anything because we'll get the call from whoever's in charge that day, leave, nothing we can do, and run. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3183.129s">Tow</a>  the cars out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3184.029s">If</a>  you see how fast, the people won't be back there the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3187.21s">But</a>  one of the problems is it's not posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3189.97s">So</a>  we can't enforce anything that's not posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3194.235s">Towing</a>  companies said they'd be more than happy to give you all the signs you want to put up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3197.778s">But</a>  again, that's part of the ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3199.719s">It's</a>  going to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3200.64s">Get</a>  some signs up there quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3202.381s">Help</a>  these people out now, not at the end of the summer when it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3206.904s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3207.604s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3209.106s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3210.266s">So</a>  we have outside construction companies come into our community, post their own little handmade signs all over the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3217.551s">No</a>  parking or you'll be towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3219.533s">But</a>  the city of Medford can't do that to help residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3223.84s">It</a>  makes no sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3226.241s">We</a>  allow outside utility companies to come in and invade our city and post these signs, but we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3234.166s">That</a>  should happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3236.207s">I</a>  agree with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3237.347s">That</a>  should happen overnight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3239.889s">It</a>  makes no sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3241.91s">We</a>  really need answers on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3244.695s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3245.375s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3247.176s">I</a>  appreciate everybody's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3250.458s">I</a>  think that we had an issue on Equavia Road just recently during the pandemic where cars were parking from the fells and parking in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3263.125s">And</a>  the temporary signs that were put out there with the horses made it reasonable for towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3272.032s">So,</a>  and I think they just did it just for the weekends because that's when the traffic air really started, no different than what we're seeing in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3279.195s">So</a>  I can't see why we asked the chief and the traffic engineer to put out temporary signs in these areas on Friday afternoons through Sunday, so this could be policed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3293.422s">I</a>  don't think we have to wait for a sign to be erected.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3298.504s">We've</a>  been down there numerous times with the police, the traffic engineer, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3303.966s">Instead</a>  of offering solutions, they're offering excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3308.168s">And</a>  that's really all it's done.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3309.912s">Again,</a>  Mike, we need to demand this from the chief, the traffic engineer and the mayor's office that this is what's being done in other neighborhoods and it's worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3318.878s">So</a>  I'm a little confused with the, so I think that we make a motion that as part of the report that we asked for the temporary signs to be erected by DPW from the traffic department on Friday evenings and then taken down on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3336.27s">And</a>  I believe that would allow <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3339.968s">the</a>  police, the leverage to toe because I know it's not, it's not the officers on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3345.451s">They</a>  want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3346.271s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3346.611s">You</a>  know, they, it's not them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3347.972s">They're</a>  getting it from higher up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3349.813s">So</a>  I think we need to get really, uh, more clarity right now from the chief and get this taken care because, um, you know, until someone drowns out there and it's one of our firefighters that are going out there and one of our police officer going out there and jumping in the lake, trying to help a family that shouldn't have been out there and they lose their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3368.343s">I</a>  think that's when <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3369.523s">we're</a>  going to see some movement, and that's not what we all want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3373.364s">So</a>  I think that's, we need to move on that immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3376.645s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3378.706s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3380.146s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3380.987s">And</a>  through you to President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3384.087s">So</a>  you were at the meeting, and maybe it's the residents that may want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3387.068s">Some</a>  of the residents were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3388.449s">If</a>  residents want to speak, I'd love to get their perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3391.71s">But</a>  so when you were at the meeting, could you tell us, did the administration promise any type of deliverables as to what they were going to do?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3400.241s">Again,</a>  they offered solutions about, we need to change this, we need to change things, but again.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3407.842s">No</a>  timetables or anything?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3409.863s">No,</a>  there was no timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3411.683s">Again,</a>  the traffic engineer was there, a representative from the police department was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3417.944s">Again,</a>  every time we thought of a solution for an immediate action, oh, we can't do that, we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3424.565s">We</a>  have to, again, Council Member Baxter's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3427.786s">Put</a>  the signs up there now, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3430.873s">Again,</a>  like he says, construction guys, they put signs up there and they take it in tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3436.435s">You</a>  can put the signs up there, at least for the season, and take it in tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3441.337s">You</a>  don't have to go for a big expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3444.039s">Again,</a>  the tow company said they would give you all the signs you want to put up there, so when your car got towed, you'd know where they were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3453.115s">We're</a>  looking for immediate relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3454.817s">And</a>  listen, Councilor Morell is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3456.558s">We</a>  do need a long-term solution for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3459.141s">But</a>  in the meantime, these people need help on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3462.704s">They</a>  can't go out of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3464.246s">And</a>  Councilor Morell says, you've got the carryout stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3468.029s">Yeah,</a>  they carry it out and leave it in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3470.972s">That's</a>  what they're doing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3472.533s">They</a>  are taking the carryout there, but they're leaving it on our streets now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3475.536s">And</a>  again, these people need relief now, not in August and September, when it's going to be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3481.5s">You</a>  go on the Winchester side, there's no cars parked by there, they're running to the beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3485.422s">Because</a>  they put up signs, nobody parks there, it's home away. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3488.324s">There's</a>  a car there, it's gone immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3491.246s">Again,</a>  put the signs up, not that big of a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3495.389s">And</a>  it can be done as early as this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3499.248s">We'll</a>  worry about the consequences that are laid, Dave, while this is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3502.751s">We'll</a>  put the signs up, get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3505.454s">And</a>  Mr. President, if you'd also please amend it that this be sent to the solicitor immediately and that the administration contact the environmental police. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3518.587s">And</a>  I can't say that the state police are down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3521.729s">They</a>  probably tow 200 cars every Saturday and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3524.61s">They're</a>  down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3525.871s">They're</a>  doing their best just to keep up with the parking down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3530.293s">So</a>  again, let's get this done quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3533.275s">These</a>  people need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3534.876s">It's</a>  just the beginning of the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3536.336s">It's</a>  only going to get worse.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3540.679s">No,</a>  I want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3542.901s">I</a>  agree a hundred percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3543.841s">I</a>  mean, this is not even July yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3545.643s">It's</a>  still another eight to 10 weeks of summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3548.004s">This</a>  needs to be dealt with right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3549.365s">So</a>  I would agree with my colleagues.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3550.786s">We</a>  need excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3551.367s">I</a>  mean, we don't need excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3552.788s">We</a>  need action.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3553.529s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3553.789s">I'd</a>  love to hear from some of the residents if you want to speak about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3557.451s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Casey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3636.07s">My</a>  name is Lucy Chapman. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3639.172s">I</a>  live at 1454 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3640.973s">And</a>  I've lived there for a long time, roughly 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3646.795s">And</a>  I've really seen this whole situation evolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3651.877s">I</a>  mean, it's been a problem for many years, but most of the cars <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3656.238s">used</a>  to be up towards Sandy Beach, but now they've really gravitated down right in front of my house, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3663.124s">I</a>  mean, literally in front of my house, in front of Bill's house, and trash is left all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3671.311s">I</a>  mean, I didn't grow up that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3673.713s">I</a>  respect people who want to hang out in the woods or have a picnic with their family or whatever, but <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3680.458s">You</a>  know, I would literally carry out, or even when I was smoking cigarettes, I would butt them out and stick them in my pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3688.181s">I</a>  wouldn't even leave that on the ground, even in my 20s, and it's very, very different now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3694.523s">I</a>  took pictures just today, just walking across the street, and I know most of you will not be able to see this, so I will describe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3702.766s">So</a>  I walked across my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3707.228s">Hang</a>  on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3711.718s">And</a>  this is, people bag their trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3716.74s">They</a>  did bag it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3717.64s">I</a>  was like, well, at least they bagged it, but they don't even put it on the side of the road where somebody like could see it, could like pick it up and see it, you know, like a garbage collector or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3730.004s">Not</a>  like they do that, but they put it back in the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3734.765s">So</a>  they bagged the trash and then threw it back into the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3738.309s">So</a>  there are these like five giant trash bags in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3741.852s">And</a>  as soon as you cross the street and you start walking the path, you see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3746.577s">And</a>  at the telephone pole, there's another picture on there that is like a market basket bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3753.678s">with</a>  trash falling out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3756.1s">So</a>  that's just today, one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3759.062s">And</a>  had I known I was gonna be here tonight, which I didn't at the time, I would have taken a lot more pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3765.207s">I'd</a>  have gone inside that woods and taken pictures for all of you to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3769.731s">But</a>  it's a sad state of affairs and there are health issues and people come very early because they wanna park. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3779.378s">Okay,</a>  where do they go to the bathroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3781.947s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3782.427s">You</a>  know, they're parked there all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3784.528s">Now</a>  come on, and they're drinking and eating and cooking and grilling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3788.59s">And</a>  you go back near where the river meets the lower lake, and that whole area is like smashed bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3794.633s">So</a>  there's glass everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3796.994s">My</a>  neighbor who walks her dog is afraid that her dog's gonna get cut on the glass that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3804.417s">So</a>  there's a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3806.178s">And</a>  that's just talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3810.072s">the</a>  lower Mystic Lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3811.693s">One</a>  other thing I wanted to throw out is for years, for a number of years now, I have seen the crew from the prisons come in, but they only clean the upper lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3825.401s">Why</a>  is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3826.482s">That's</a>  a state-related issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3828.683s">I</a>  pay taxes like the Winchester people pay taxes, but they stop where the road is to the dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3835.568s">And</a>  I saw that little truck with the guys in their orange suits <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3839.923s">And</a>  I'm glad they're using them to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3842.105s">I</a>  think it's good for those guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3844.167s">I</a>  think it's good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3845.988s">But</a>  I said, how come you don't come down to the lower lake? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3849.311s">Because</a>  there's been trash there for years and the neighbors have been picking it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3853.515s">We</a>  have a lot of people in our neighborhood who walk with a trash bag in their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3857.958s">And</a>  as they're walking, they put trash in the bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3860.921s">But</a>  I asked, why didn't the prison guys come down to the lower lake and do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3865.045s">Nobody</a>  has the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3866.966s">So</a>  there's a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3868.786s">inequities</a>  that I see happening between what happens in the Winchester end and what happens in the Medford end, including the curbing of the side of the road there where they put the nice curbing in, including the lights they put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3883.977s">Why</a>  does it stop at Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3886.319s">I</a>  don't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3887.74s">I</a>  mean, maybe you guys understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3889.781s">But</a>  just to speak to the private road thing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3893.844s">I</a>  live on a private road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3895.385s">It</a>  looks like Beirut after the bombings. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3898.024s">That's</a>  what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3899.325s">There</a>  are holes everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3901.527s">The</a>  city comes in and they patch the holes every year because the plows get under the lip of those patches, they end up on my lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3910.475s">That's</a>  where that tar ends up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3912.416s">And</a>  we're cleaning it out of our banks for the whole season. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3916.98s">But</a>  that's what they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3918.161s">They</a>  come in and just do a patch job, just do a patch job. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3920.844s">We</a>  were so hoping when the gas company came in recently and put in all the new gas lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3926.124s">that</a>  maybe they would pave that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3928.445s">And</a>  it's not a private road, it's the only way you can access Pitcher Avenue is by going on Lakeview. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3933.347s">You</a>  can't access it any other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3935.208s">So</a>  if it's private, technically, people on Pitcher should not be using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3940.27s">I</a>  guess that's the way I look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3941.971s">I</a>  don't care that they use it, I want the road paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3945.152s">So</a>  I guess I have a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3948.413s">I'm</a>  deciding, I don't come to many of these meetings, I'm throwing them all out there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3952.699s">But</a>  the paving of the road is a huge one for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3955.76s">And</a>  if making it public instead of private is the way to go to get the road paved, I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3961.562s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3962.582s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3969.564s">Hi,</a>  my name's Bill Darnell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3970.964s">I</a>  live at 1466 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3974.965s">And</a>  I've lived there for 22 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3977.726s">And</a>  the last couple of years, I've definitely gotten <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3981.302s">100</a>  times worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3983.884s">And</a>  I hope that you can do the ticketing and the towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3989.208s">But</a>  part of the problem, I think, might be that people, I'm also a board member of the Medford Boat Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3996.233s">And</a>  the parking, they've been there since 1898. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3997.895s">And</a>  they've always used the parking area by the Tufts Boathouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4002.578s">And</a>  to find a parking spot there today on the weekends, you're lucky if you can drive in and get out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4010.789s">the</a>  parking is really getting bad for them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4013.232s">So</a>  they ended up parking in the neighborhoods, members of the boat club, Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4020.239s">So</a>  we kind of, as a member of the Medford boat club, we're like, well, now we're gonna get screwed if we're getting towed, if you're not a resident of that street and you're getting towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4031.611s">So</a>  I don't know if there's a way to, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4034.87s">look</a>  at someone with a Medford Boat Club sticker on the side streets and give them a little break because it's tough for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4046.572s">But</a>  we definitely want to see this problem cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4050.073s">It's</a>  terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4050.733s">I</a>  walk my dog across the street, and I'm afraid that he's going to cut his paws out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4055.234s">You</a>  see glass everywhere, toilet paper, all kinds of trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4060.06s">And</a>  something has to be done, and I'm glad you're looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4064.421s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4065.682s">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4066.562s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4067.922s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4069.243s">I'll</a>  yield to the gentleman.</p>

    <p>[Richard Shultz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4071.683s">My</a>  name is Richard Schultz, and I live at 1454 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is right on the corner of Lakeview, which is a private way, in Mystic Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4083.547s">And</a>  this is my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4085.285s">So</a>  if I move my car on a Sunday and I park on Lakeview, I have to put a trash can in the spot where when I come back, I won't have a parking space. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4100.089s">And</a>  that is every Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4103.749s">Additionally,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4106.918s">I</a>  have had situations where I've said something to someone about parking on Lakeview and I get an earful from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4117.16s">They're</a>  belligerent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4121.181s">Lakeview,</a>  when you cross the parkway, it leads to a path that takes you right down to where the river meets the lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4130.402s">And</a>  you can see hundreds of people <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4135.253s">going</a>  down there on a weekend, carrying everything imaginable. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4140.859s">And</a>  as you've heard, they leave all their trash behind, they defecate in the woods, and they have no respect for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4153.633s">Now,</a>  that area is not supposed to be for swimming and picnicking, and I don't understand why it isn't posted in that way, so that people would know that you have to go to the designated areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4172.379s">This</a>  has become increasingly a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4176.781s">In</a>  front of our house, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4179.491s">And</a>  the front of our house is quite long. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4181.913s">We</a>  have an old Victorian house. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4185.536s">We</a>  pay high taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4187.418s">And</a>  on Sundays, there's bumper to bumper in front of my house, people yelling, especially when they come back, making noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4196.767s">You</a>  can't sit on your porch and have your meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4200.25s">We</a>  have to sit in the back porch to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4203.478s">This,</a>  I'm glad that you're looking into this, but we need action. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4209.741s">And</a>  we don't need to deal, I don't need to deal with belligerency. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4214.244s">I</a>  don't need to deal with having to put a trash can in my parking space so that if I go out, get some groceries, I can't find any place to park in my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4225.73s">And</a>  the final thing I would add, and I said it before, we have a turn of the century Victorian. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4231.173s">We</a>  pay a lot of taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4233.145s">That</a>  house is valuated high. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4236.586s">We're</a>  not getting services for it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4241.428s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4244.069s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4245.57s">Thank</a>  you, Richard, for bringing that point up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4248.031s">He's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4249.312s">The</a>  neighbors shouldn't be down there fighting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4252.253s">I</a>  mean, I've been down there, I've argued with people, I see the other neighbors arguing with people, and they just don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4258.355s">Again,</a>  a couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go with <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4262.763s">Representative</a>  Garberly on a walkthrough of the lower lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4266.706s">The</a>  lower end there, what they're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4268.967s">There's</a>  makeshift bathrooms with toilet paper dispensers hanging on the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4275.212s">I</a>  mean, diapers everywhere, but it's just utter filth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4279.435s">And</a>  she's right, I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4280.576s">They'll</a>  clean the upper part, they won't come down and clean the lower part. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4284.338s">It's</a>  not fair, and I ask for immediate action on this as soon as possible to help these people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4292.879s">before</a>  the summit even starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4297.18s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4299.741s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4300.421s">If</a>  I may, and the residents bring up a good point, if we could get a report back or maybe some answers from our representative Garbali as to why is the upper lake treated differently from the lower lake with regard to cleanliness and the state being proactive with regard to cleaning that area? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4321.162s">There</a>  must be a reason, or maybe it's just being overlooked, but it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4325.964s">It's</a>  not fair that only one section is getting clean, but the rest they just don't care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4329.806s">So</a>  if we can get a report back from that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4332.208s">So</a>  if I can make that as an amendment, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4335.209s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4341.667s">my</a>  my comments earlier is for a motion that we call for a meeting uh to and bring in the stakeholders so um if we can you know one of the uh upcoming meetings i know we have finalized in the budget but <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4357.413s">having</a>  calling for a meeting with state delegates, a representative from the DCR, even somebody from the sheriff's office to answer these questions directly, as well as the traffic engineer and the police chief for the traffic department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4377.282s">Because</a>  again, I appreciate that, that Councilor Caraviello went out to this meeting and when I was told it wasn't a big deal, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4386.777s">It</a>  was just neighbors that were concerned and they were trying to bring it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4389.318s">But</a>  I think this has to be some answers and they have to be people sitting across the table to answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4398.682s">So</a>  if I can call that as a motion to call for an immediate meeting, not to say that we shouldn't try to do something this weekend, but what I'm saying is get some resolution quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4410.707s">and</a>  I know that Mr. Donnell brings up a good point, why penalize Medford residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4416.39s">You</a>  know, when I'm gonna, from what I've heard, it's 99% of non-resident people that are just looking in that area because it is a beautiful area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4427.516s">If</a>  you want it, spend millions of dollars and buy a huge colonial on the corner and they can have those rights, but I just wanna make sure that's on the record, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4442.472s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Caraviello, Scarpelli, Falco, Morell, Bears, Mox, Scarpelli, Caraviello, Falco, Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4457.897s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4459.178s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4460.598s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4462.579s">Hearing</a>  none, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4466.38s">Paper</a>  21417, offered by Councilors Bears and Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4471.723s">be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration work with the Medford Public Schools to issue a communication regarding the expanded child tax credit that will provide a maximum of $300 per month for each child under the age of six and $250 per month for each child between the ages of six and 17, for which I have two, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4497.438s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4499.118s">With</a>  the American Rescue Plan Act, the federal government significantly expanded the child tax credit for families and specifically for children and providing additional resources for all of the different costs that a child has. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4516.763s">This</a>  is a great expanded benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4518.743s">It's</a>  estimated that it will significantly help millions of families across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4523.144s">And</a>  right here in Medford, I'm sure thousands of families, however, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4527.022s">Not</a>  a lot of people are fully aware that this benefit has passed and may not be taking advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4531.825s">So</a>  the intent of this resolution is that the city administration work with the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4537.867s">And</a>  I would like to amend this to include the Medford Family Network to just notify families that this is an option, that these funds are out there and that they can help families and children across the city do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4552.995s">So</a>  I've turned it over to Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4556.503s">who</a>  co-sponsored this.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4557.944s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4558.804s">Councilor</a>  Bears mostly covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4560.285s">So</a>  this was actually, there was an article about this recently about, you know, those most likely to benefit from this are probably largely unaware of the program and some 53% of people may not know about this tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4573.132s">So</a>  a resident brought this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4575.573s">So</a>  just getting this out there and also it may be beneficial just as a side comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4582.035s">The</a>  board of health I know is working really hard as far as snap gap and identifying people who are not enrolling in benefits that they are eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4590.698s">So</a>  this seems like something similar to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4592.418s">Perhaps</a>  the schools could reach out to the board of health to see how they're identifying and reaching out to people to ensure that they are enrolling in programs that they are eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4601.582s">So</a>  move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4608.144s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4608.304s">On</a>  the motion, and Council Member Beall is in the room, I'll second it by Councilor Belco.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4688.096s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4690.677s">And</a>  if I could say thank you to Councilor Falco for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4694.179s">Maria</a>  and her group, a tremendous group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4700.523s">COVID</a>  did not <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4701.676s">They</a>  haven't missed a beat on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4704.117s">They</a>  continue to provide food, clothing, and everything for members of the community who really need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4711.06s">So</a>  they didn't need the COVID to slow them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4715.342s">They</a>  only stepped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4716.662s">And</a>  again, I want to thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4718.583s">In</a>  fact, when I talked last night, as I was going through the school budget, I was kind of shocked <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4728.71s">the</a>  amount of compensation Marie Cassidy receives for the tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4734.772s">And</a>  as I happened to call Councilor Falco last night and asked him if that was the correct number, because I was just like, can I take him back? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4742.235s">But</a>  we can't pay Marie and her staff enough money for the amount of work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4747.036s">So</a>  again, I wanna thank Councilor Falco for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4750.137s">Now</a>  on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4754.319s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4755.299s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4756.359s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4756.999s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4759.051s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4763.232s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks, the suspension to take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4768.274s">Seconded</a>  by? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4768.934s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4771.295s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4772.255s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4772.775s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4773.315s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4775.556s">Public</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4777.416s">We</a>  have a, hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4779.557s">We</a>  have Anita D'Antonio on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4783.278s">If</a>  I can find her paper here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4785.939s">She</a>  was first. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4789.969s">Anita's</a>  paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4792.491s">Hold</a>  on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4798.575s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4800.096s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4801.116s">Anita</a>  D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street, MFMS. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4804.118s">Anita</a>  D'Antonio would like the opportunity to speak regarding the renaming of the Columbus School and the process of the renaming of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4813.985s">Good</a>  evening, Anita. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4814.625s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anita Dantonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4815.586s">Good</a>  evening, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4816.346s">Anita</a>  D'Antonio. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4818.688s">14</a>  Yale Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4820.85s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the city council, bear with me, I'm gonna read a statement rather than ad lib it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4828.315s">Let</a>  me say this is not a rehash or relitigation of this issue because the issue was not hashed or litigated in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4837.241s">We</a>  were in the midst of a pandemic and this issue was given a priority that seemed to surpass the importance of getting children back into classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4846.217s">If</a>  that's not the case, it certainly left that impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4849.881s">From</a>  the outset, the movement to remove the Columbus name and the renaming process have been divisive, yet ultimately revealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4858.61s">Columbus</a>  is but one of the villains du jour in the midst of our own cultural revolution in Medford, served up by a national contagion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4866.918s">And</a>  so a name change was put on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4870.007s">There</a>  was no room for argument or discussion when it came to Columbus, not even for a professor emerita from Stanford University in the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology for nearly 20 years, Carol Delaney, PhD, author of Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem, and who I believe appeared before the school committee by Zoom and got a less than indifferent reception. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4894.209s">didn't</a>  fit the narrative, primary sources, Howard Zinn said so, and the acolytes followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4901.377s">And</a>  who passed the baton to Zinn? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4904.34s">In</a>  an article written by Jennifer Braceras entitled, The Intellectual Roots of the War Against Columbus, she states, and I quote, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4912.109s">The</a>  war against Columbus is cloaked in the lexicon of diversity and the rhetoric of inclusion, but what many of its foot soldiers don't realize is that in fact it has its intellectual roots in the ideologies of Marxism and white supremacy." <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4928.457s">Marx</a>  reviled Columbus because he saw him as the godfather of capitalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4932.781s">The</a>  KKK detested Columbus because of his association with Catholicism. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4939.007s">Strange</a>  bedfellows with a common purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4942.877s">There</a>  is no purity with regard to Columbus arguments pro or con, but wouldn't it have been a great learning experience for young minds and all of us to do what great educators do, encourage discussion, thought, challenge viewpoints, argue, listen to different opinions, and in the end, acquire knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4965.31s">This</a>  is not the example that was set by some members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4969.912s">Mines</a>  were made up long before it was put on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4973.294s">For</a>  some individuals on the school committee, the message seemed to be, if we want your opinion, we'll give it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4982.678s">Objectivity</a>  was nonexistent, notwithstanding the effort to appear otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4987.84s">In</a>  the removal of the name, the selection of a new name in the final vote itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4992.557s">We</a>  were admonished again and again that this was all done in the name of equity, justice, wonderful positive change, signaling how loving, tolerant, open, and welcoming we are as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5003.482s">And</a>  by the way, Columbus was evil and his mere name traumatizes children. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5010.025s">So</a>  what did this process reveal to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5012.668s">Well,</a>  it exposed some virulent bigotry and bias directed toward those who did not want the name change, but then moved on to support a particular nominee to replace the name Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5023.4s">That</a>  nominee's reputation was even besmirched, disgraceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5028.76s">I</a>  learned that what is old is new again, ethnic bigotry, whether it's 1921 or 2021, again, specifically directed at Americans of Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5040.925s">Some</a>  of us were even more special. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5043.266s">We</a>  were old and our lifelong residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5046.992s">There</a>  was even an attempt to stop speakers from stating they were lifelong residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5052.014s">Fortunately,</a>  the attempt failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5054.135s">But</a>  what does it say about a school committee member who would try to stifle free speech that way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5059.55s">We</a>  are, according to one voice, the most racist, cruel, hateful humans in Medford, white supremacists, right-wingers, false narrative bearers, white self-admitted Italian-Americans who may have cheated by simply voting for our choice of nominee, and last but not least, the worst of the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5079.942s">If</a>  this is the change, if this is the progress, if this is what passes for making Medford a loving and welcoming and tolerant community, we are failing miserably. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5090.805s">I</a>  will not stand by and allow anyone to violate or smear the character of my family, my parents, my grandparents, because we happen to be of Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5102.008s">I</a>  condemn those who prioritize their bigotries, cloak them in virtue signaling, trading one bigotry for another, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5109.93s">thinking</a>  they have the high moral ground and feeling justified in doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5114.451s">Those</a>  who bellow about bullying and marginalizing have become the bullies, the marginalizers, and now even the new colonizers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5122.813s">I</a>  want to see a city that can grow positively for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5126.374s">There</a>  are those who see a city that won't be right until it's made in their image, no matter how long or how briefly they have lived here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5133.996s">That</a>  is what we just experienced during the Columbus School renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5138.377s">And</a>  it will not end there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5140.038s">There</a>  are those who will adopt another city's or state's crises and try to include Medford in the same crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5148.463s">That</a>  is not an example of injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5152.765s">That</a>  is destroying a city's character and uniqueness and driving it to a divisive and dead end. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5159.289s">Finally,</a>  I would ask this city council <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5164.088s">to</a>  vigorously condemn bigotry, and specifically the bigotry that has been directed to those of Italian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=5172.415s">Thank</a>  you so much for this time.</p>
