Thank you, President Behrs. This latest meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee was once again held with the City Council's zoning consultant. This was kind of a fun and unusual meeting. They arranged for us a mapping workshop where their GIS specialists printed out a whole range of zoning-related maps showing different characteristics of the city from a zoning perspective.

5
00:06:40,452 --> 00:07:04,582
everything from lot frontage to average income in different neighborhoods. We spread them all out in tapers in City Hall. We had a lot of department heads, members of the public joined us. It was really interesting. And that discussion and the takeaways and questions that came out of it are going to inform our further committee meetings with the zoning consultant, beginning with the next one, which is tomorrow at 7 p.m.

a member Aaron Domenedetto to share anything they'd like to share about this call for election for our state primary on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2024.

37
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:24,804
Well, actually, you did such a good job, Mr. President. I don't think I have anything to add to it, except when we get to the one, we'll talk about it, which is the same thing. Perfect. We're taking that next. Any questions for the Elections Commission on the call to election? Councilor Sayeed.

38
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:47,858
This is more about the voting locations. I know, Henry, you and I worked a lot a few months ago on getting the Walking Court polling location open for our residents around there. I see on this form that we have Walking Court again. Do we know if that's true for the November election? Is it the same building as it usually is? For the entire year, we probably will have to

39
01:13:48,234 --> 01:14:12,227
find another location in 2025, but we got lucky since February, we have it September and November. Great. I'm so happy that our hard work is continuing to work out there. When we work together, we produce things. That's so true. Great. And I am talking to Director Driscoll about some stuff around that too. I'll inform the council if it becomes relevant.

40
01:14:13,285 --> 01:14:37,790
and the president as well. Thank you very much. I know that you've worked very hard on this, but a lot of people have still reached out saying they just don't know, since we've moved some places around, they were curious how they can really know where they're supposed to vote. Is there a number or an office that I can direct them to and that we can maybe send something out publicly?

41
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:56,783
I don't think there's much changes as far as election is concerned in Medford. We've been voting at the same location. The only time we've seen a change was when we come up with what

42
01:14:56,783 --> 01:15:23,592
6 to 8, and 7 to 8. And some of the people get displaced. But that's been about something like three cycle of election. I'm sure they have it. Additionally, one of the thing we're working with the communication director is to send a message to the community telling them where to vote. On top of it, if they have an issue, call the election department.

43
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:38,780
That's a great idea if we can get like a robocall to those residents to say, don't forget your new location or there's a lot of people it's funny because conversations that we have a big state state representative Donato has a big.

44
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:55,077
big race coming up in September, September 3rd. And a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race. So that's where the questions arose. And I appreciate that, if we can get that word out. And I think the other thing was,

45
01:15:55,401 --> 01:16:24,548
that with that race, is it district, Middlesex District? 35. 35, what is it? We really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election. There is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct? There will be. No, the one, two of the chair, the one in September is a state primary. State primary.

46
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:43,916
see you referring to the 35th. The other six, there's three people on the ballot. So it's going to be reduced to two. And the two will be in November for general election. So the two will go in November. OK, that's confusing, because now we were told that

47
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:58,933
the three candidates running on the democratic ticket that the winner that comes out of that race is the winner there's a partisan primary and there's a partisan primary there's a democratic primary there's three candidates yeah yeah

48
01:16:58,933 --> 01:17:14,718
you have that's what you have the first one because what it is you can only have at the general two people well that's that's for municipal henry um in this in this case it'll be one it will be that one will be the only person just like you see for

49
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:38,916
23rd. Right now we have a guy who's not on the post, only his name, but he's still sure on the primary. Right, right. No, I understand that, but I think people, people think that let's, let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November. In November, there'll be no race. It'll just be the, there'll be the candidate that came out of the primary.

50
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:57,142
I think we should generally avoid going down this road, but yes, there will be one candidate on the ballot in November for the Democratic Party, and there's no candidate running, I believe, for the Republican nomination. That's where the confusion is, because if they're the same party,

51
01:17:57,142 --> 01:18:13,200
whoever wins is the one that move forward. And that's why I think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no Republican

52
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:36,544
party running in this race. So in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative. So we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw. So it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration

53
01:18:36,544 --> 01:18:56,510
share a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected, that they understand that November is really just ceremonial. It's not the actual election for that race is the third of September. Thank you, Mr. President. I don't know that we can

54
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:20,913
We could do a B paper to communicate to the public that there's an election coming up and that they can contact the elections department, 781-393-2491, or they can go online wheredoivotema.com to find out who their representative, what is district they're in, their polling location.

55
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:51,220
If I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed. I think it's not very political. And I think, well, it's for all three candidates. It's not political. It's to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates that you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates. And they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November. But the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes we just saw.

56
01:19:51,220 --> 01:20:13,780
that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat. And I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other. I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect and the effort by this body to ask if we can do that. Now, again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, be very simple and say,

57
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:29,121
let's make weapons city solicitor let's let's do that let's send it off as a b paper and we'll we'll get to that when we can but having it stop right now i think it's it's it's not it's not right it's not right all right uh that's fine i'm just what's the text of the b paper

58
01:20:30,162 --> 01:20:46,647
We would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, I'm sorry, District 30. The 35th Middlesex.

59
01:20:46,647 --> 01:21:09,684
the state representative. We have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position. Does that make sense, Mr. Clerk? I know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes.

60
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:51,630
I'm going to read this back, Councilor Scarpelli, because I'm still, I still need to know. Sure, I know, go ahead. The fee paper is to ask the elections department and the mayor's office to do a robo-call and whatever other means possible regarding the 35th Middlesex. Quiet, please, I'm sorry, I can't hear. Regarding the possible 35th Middlesex district to educate these voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that election.

61
01:21:52,671 --> 01:22:07,005
the September 3rd race, the September primary being the, right, yes, good, thank you. Thank you. Vice President Collins. Thank you, President Rivers.

62
01:22:07,568 --> 01:22:22,978
And, you know, as a similar alternative you know I think I know the Election Commission is working part pretty much year round to publicize upcoming elections and, you know, not just make sure that people know the dates on the calendars and where to go but to do things like motor drives, you know if I would offer at the point

63
01:22:22,978 --> 01:22:43,336
asking the Elections Commission to add another layer to redouble their existing efforts to make sure that people know when to get out and vote. I would say, you know, there's there's a primary on September 3rd, not just in the 35 Middlesex, you know, it asked me, but we can just extend that to incorporate all voters within the city of Medford. I think everybody

64
01:22:43,336 --> 01:23:12,927
more people, you know, that we would think can always use a reminder about when to vote. And that goes for everybody within the city for September 3rd, as well as for the November election this year. So I'd offer as an alternative, you know, I would certainly support any efforts to make sure that people know and have that date circled on their calendar and, you know, not just one district, but citywide. So if we could, if you consider an amendment to have that just be a citywide effort at the point that we're going through the effort of a robocall at all, I'm sure that many voters across the community would benefit from it.

65
01:23:14,121 --> 01:23:42,619
Vice President Collins, if I could, just for our clarity, you requested to amend the paper that this be a citywide robocall to remind, and other outreach to remind people of where to vote when the election is occurring? Yes, for the September 3rd primary. For the September 3rd state primary. Through the chair. One second, Henry. Councilor Seng. I was just gonna ask, is that an amendment or a B paper? This is already a B paper. This is an amendment to the B paper. Amendment to, okay. Yeah.

66
01:23:43,422 --> 01:24:03,968
We talked prior to September 3rd. We have to realize that we have the early voting that takes place from the 24th to the 30th. So that is coming out. It's not listed on any of the papers in front of you. In addition to that, we also have

67
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:31,493
listed last day to register. If you don't register on time, you cannot vote on state primaries on the 3rd. We have that coming. It's not on the paper in front of you, because this is not what we're here for tonight. We also have the last day to request a vote by mail ballot. So all this information coming down the pipe

68
01:24:31,647 --> 01:24:57,654
to inform citizens of the city when they can vote prior to September 3rd. Great, thank you. And on September 3rd. Yes, and if folks contact the Elections Department, they can find out more about the early voting at City Hall, as well as the mail-out balloting in addition to voting on Election Day. That's correct. September 3rd. Got it. Thank you. If I can, Mr. President, another point with that, if I'm right, if I'm correct or wrong, I know that if there isn't a Republican candidate that

69
01:24:57,944 --> 01:25:07,483
I, a registered Republican can't, what is it, they report to the elections office to ask to, is it unenrolled so they can vote in that election?

70
01:25:08,302 --> 01:25:36,391
Is that possible? Unenrolled have the ability to choose a time of voting which party to vote for. That's the only one. Because they're not affiliated. They can come. If they're voting for three parties, they can say, who are you voting for? How do you want to vote today? You say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat. So that's important that people that don't have a candidate

71
01:25:36,391 --> 01:26:03,933
in this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat? That's a technical question. Yeah, so that's something if we can ask you. That's something I can explore. That was a question that was brought up to us by... I'll get back to you on that one. I don't wanna give you the wrong answer because once you... You have a window. Yeah.

72
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:28,251
If the window to UN enroll, you can come tomorrow and say, well, I want to change to this body. It can be done. As long as it's not violent. Thank you. Thank you. There's a motion on the floor as amended. If the amendment is accepted, I believe it now reads. Could you read it back, Mr. Clerk?

73
01:26:29,497 --> 01:26:59,411
Mr. President Collins has asked for a date certain citywide robocall and other outreach to remind voters where to vote for the September 3rd primary election. All right, so then that's the amendment. Do you accept the amendment? Yeah, that's good. All right, so on the motion, the B paper is to request citywide robocall to remind everyone where and how to vote in the September 3rd primary.

74
01:27:00,862 --> 01:27:27,927
Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Vice President Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. On the B paper. Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozaro? Yes. Councilor Lemi? Yes. Councilor Scott Kelly? Yes. Councilor Sanz? Yes. President Paris? Yes. On the main paper, the call to election,

75
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:34,957
Motion to approve by, sorry, it's been a while now, was it by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

76
01:27:59,616 --> 01:28:08,046
on the main paper, Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes.

77
01:28:08,848 --> 01:28:32,841
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. Councilor Sanchez? Yes. President Behrs? Yes. Senator Fevella, and then negative motion passes. 24454, Medford election warrant, September 2024. Warrant for the Medford September 2024 state primaries election. To the residents of the city of Medford, Massachusetts, greetings in the name of the Commonwealth. You are hereby required to notify and warn the inhabitants of said city or town who are qualified to vote in elections to vote at.

78
01:28:33,012 --> 01:28:54,770
I've already gone through this at the polling locations from Ward 1 through 8. On Tuesday, the third day of September 2024, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., for the following purpose, to cast their votes in the state primary election for the candidates of the political parties in the following offices, Senator in Congress for the Commonwealth, Representative in Congress, 5th District, Counselor, 6th District,

79
01:28:54,770 --> 01:29:10,333
as a governor's counselor, State Senator, 2nd Middlesex District, State Representative, 23rd, 34th, and 35th Middlesex District, Clerk of Courts, Middlesex County, Register of Deeds, Middlesex Southern District. Given into our hands this 13th day of August 2024, the Medford City Council.

80
01:29:12,671 --> 01:29:42,654
You already read all the location. The only thing we're seeking here is to have this warrant legally. We're seeking signature of the council members. Everybody have to sign it, but we have a deadline to get it done. That's the reason we're in front of you today, so we can meet our deadline. Do you have a copy that you want us to sign? Could you come behind the rail and have us sign it? We're down Larry today, so he would do that, but thank you, Aaron.

81
01:29:45,896 --> 01:30:04,735
Um, we do have councilor lemming remotely. Um, do we just, if he's here in the state, just like I did last year, but if you're six of us, it's fine. I get six. I'll go with it, but if I get seven, all right, thank you.

82
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:40,896
All right, on the motion by Councilor Sang, seconded by Council Vice President, was that you Councilor Lazaro? It's Council Vice President Collins to accept the warrant and introduce signatures. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lazaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes.

83
01:30:41,681 --> 01:31:05,162
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sanchez, President Beresford. Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes. 24449 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, and if I may request a motion to join, I have a similar resolution. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. 24449 be it resolved. Thanks, Aaron. It was a thinner paper than I was expecting.

84
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:12,739
Thanks. Thanks, guys.

85
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:43,370
Be it resolved that the City Council discuss continued concerns dealing with rodent infestation in our community. Be it further resolved that we request a meeting with the Health Department and City Administration to schedule a strategic planning meeting dealing with a serious health concern across the City of Medford. And then I also have, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Health Department undertake additional efforts in partnership with Tufts Medicine and the City of Malden to provide significant additional rodent control to mitigate the impact of construction at the former Malden Hospital site on the neighboring community. Councilor Scarpa.

86
01:31:43,370 --> 01:32:08,575
Thank you, Mr. President. I know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for road infestation, considering we live in a ledge, and you don't have, you know,

87
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:33,865
you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents. But we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to stymie the rodent infestation issues. We've even moved to put in ordinances that allow

88
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:56,152
allow us to go on to private property. If we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more. I know that I've had a few phone calls. I know that the curbside composting is a great initiative, but you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom. So, um,

89
01:32:56,152 --> 01:33:22,978
So there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth. You see neighbor communities put together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or

90
01:33:22,978 --> 01:33:45,247
or slow this process down. I know that my motion would be, Mr. President, is that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force. I know Boston's calling it the rodent czar.

91
01:33:45,247 --> 01:34:07,039
I think that Metro has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community. And I think that what we're seeing is the different

92
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:34,889
different forms of control. I think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce. It wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce. So there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department,

93
01:34:35,196 --> 01:34:50,759
which, by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator, come out to put bait boxes down and leave. It's not working. So my recommendation is that we move forward. I know that

94
01:34:50,759 --> 01:35:17,227
It's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area. I think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse. So thank you. Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Vice President Collins.

95
01:35:17,705 --> 01:35:31,766
I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli as well as President Behrs for bringing this forward and for being so responsive to, you know, really just the latest wave of resident outreach about this. And I think Councilor Scarpelli is exactly right, you know, I think that the city has been

96
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:48,797
Working hard with the available tools to try to stem the tide of increasing rat populations over the past several years, but it's always seemed to me that our approach is, you know, fundamentally reactive and everybody can everybody can see with their eyes, you know that that isn't doing enough.

97
01:35:48,797 --> 01:36:08,507
I think that the idea of a task force is potentially a great idea because there have been so many disparate approaches either tried already in the city or things that have been floated. I think it'd be great to collect some of the topics of discussion from the Solid Waste Task Force, which I was a member of a couple of years ago talking about.

98
01:36:08,507 --> 01:36:27,978
you know, how can we make sure that our evolving trash and compost receptacles are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, which is something that they are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, but it's important to share that information with the community whenever we can. I know that there's a lot of pioneering rodent innovations going on in neighboring cities that

99
01:36:27,978 --> 01:36:56,817
hear about time to time from residents. One, because they seem more effective than just sending somebody out when we get that latest call about where it's getting especially bad, and because we do want to mitigate the effects on other members of the ecosystem. And I think that we're all aware that just putting out a lot of rat poison is really harmful to the other animals that we do treasure in Medford. So everything takes resources, investing in the right tools and the right systems to really attack this.

100
01:36:56,817 --> 01:37:09,718
It's not going to get better without these major institutions pitching in to help us have a more systemic approach. So I would absolutely support this. I thank my fellow councilors for bringing it forward. Thank you, Vice President Collins. Councilor Sang.

101
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:29,224
Thank you. I wanted to thank both Councilor Scarpelli and President Beres for the resolutions on this. I think we all know that this is a really important issue for public health, for quality of living here in Medford. It's, as Councilor Scarpelli said, it's not just Fulton Heights.

102
01:37:29,224 --> 01:37:58,353
but this happening in Fulton Heights is particularly concerning because it's not the place that's used to this. South Medford and Wellington have been particularly hit hard by the rodent infestation over the last few years. Anecdotally, talking to neighbors, some of the methods we have employed seem to have been working. There is a slight decrease anecdotally talking to my neighbors about this. However, rodents are still there.

103
01:37:58,353 --> 01:38:13,660
I think it's really important to note that we did hold a Committee of the Whole on this a few months ago, where we had a long conversation with the Director of the Board of Health about methods that we could employ to combat this.

104
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:38,439
this problem. Now, Councillor Collins has alluded to the public education piece, which really has to be a very, very big part of it. That message was reinforced over and over again at that meeting. It would be lovely to get this resolution passed, to sit down with the Director of the Board of Health and other stakeholders to get an update on those strategies, to see how we're doing,

105
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:58,370
are there, what are the metrics that we're using to measure and how are we doing on those metrics? I think it's also really important to note that the council has been working really hard on this. We have a resolution coming to our, an ordinance coming to our next meeting about wildlife feeding, reduce, basically

106
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:14,445
regulating that so that we're discouraging rodent behavior. Past councils have also passed ordinances tackling rodent infestations as well, which city staff have reported back with metrics showing that they have been useful.

107
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:31,357
Thank you. Any further comment by members of the council? I'll go and then we can go to members of the public. But I just wanted to note specifically around the Malden Hospital site, I want to thank David Tedisco who sent around a number of emails, has been organizing his neighborhood.

108
01:39:31,357 --> 01:39:55,452
the city of bedford and the city of malden. tufts medicine at the malden hospital site is responsible for rodent mitigation and it is on malden land and so they have been very responsive. tufts medicine has made it clear they know they need to do more. mayor christianson as well and also director o'connor and mayor longo current have been involved in some of those discussions as well to

109
01:39:55,452 --> 01:40:12,910
to bring whatever resources we can to bear from the medford side. Thank you for noting the rodent control ordinance that we passed. The solid waste ordinance which really is going to help focus on reducing rodent populations in the commercial areas with the combined

110
01:40:14,172 --> 01:40:40,503
dumpster, for lack of a better word, in the private hauler program, which should really significantly improve both the efficiency and the requirements on the business districts and the businesses in those districts to keep their trash and waste away from rodents and to also centralize removal of it, which hopefully will help on a cost basis. I think the point is really well taken around funding and staff. We've heard time and time again from our animal control

111
01:40:40,503 --> 01:41:09,889
that we have been working on for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time. We have been working on this for a long time.

112
01:41:09,889 --> 01:41:32,517
road and control right now, even though everyone in the city and everyone in this room acknowledges that we need to be spending significantly more on that. So we do the best with what we have. What we have is too little and we need more funding for the city to effectively provide services such as road and control. With that, I will go to the podium and name and address for the record, please. And you have three minutes.

113
01:41:34,753 --> 01:41:50,111
I'm Paulette Bartabedian, 27th Central Ave., Medford, Mass. Just want to commend Vice President Collins on bringing up the environmental impact of the road in control, and I know that it's a huge problem everywhere, and I'm not

114
01:41:51,152 --> 01:42:15,981
dismissing that. But I do hope that we as a city will look to other alternatives, other than rodenticides, which are the worst, worst thing. It actually is counterproductive to rodent control because many of the wildlife and wild birds that use rats, mice, things like that, as their meals are getting killed,

115
01:42:16,152 --> 01:42:42,125
due to secondary rodenticide poisoning. It also affects foxes, coyotes, other things that will feed on rodents. So it's really counterproductive. You're killing the things that will kill the rats. I did read that there is some population control drugs they're trying to use. And I just read that it's a fairly new process, I believe, that some of the,

116
01:42:42,927 --> 01:42:57,927
participants are saying that they're seeing more rats now than ever. That just may be a small percentage that we're seeing. It may not be the whole picture as of yet. But again, it's a multifaceted problem.

117
01:42:57,927 --> 01:43:21,664
Education, as counselor Heng said, is I think the most important thing is to have people, businesses, et cetera, take care of their garbage. No food, no rats. No food, no coyotes. That's just common sense. So please as a whole, please try to avoid using rodenticides foremost amongst everything. And thank you very much. That's it.

118
01:43:21,971 --> 01:43:43,814
Thank you and I just wanted to note on that point, the new solid waste contract and the solid waste councils are can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the new solid waste contract, because of how we can structured it with the State Department of Environmental Protection. We are receiving some funds specifically around an educational program around the solid waste so there should be more information going out to residents.

119
01:43:43,814 --> 01:44:07,568
through that education program. Now that is just limited to the trash, the recycling, the composting, um, funding for other stuff like the wildlife feeding, et cetera, would have to come from somewhere else. Name and address for the record, please. You have three minutes. Hi, Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn street. Uh, I live in the Hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer.

120
01:44:08,063 --> 01:44:37,312
I personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive. I think accountability has to come in play. I think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground. So people think, and they live near food sources. So gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water. So they're gonna live near those things.

121
01:44:37,756 --> 01:45:05,794
My question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way? Like, go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist Fire Station, have a meeting there, go to the community and educate them in that way. It has to be hands-on, and if you really

122
01:45:05,794 --> 01:45:21,715
communicate to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns. I think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online, and you really see the people that you are representing.

123
01:45:21,937 --> 01:45:48,148
face-to-face in that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together. They'll talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property. And that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents. And that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself. If you're elderly, get some help, right?

124
01:45:48,933 --> 01:46:18,831
but don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats. That's one thing. So the community piece. The other piece is, Walkling Court is scheduled for demolition. Is there a plan in place for the hillside area on rodents? Is that part of that? How much money is allocated to that? What are we doing? What are we pre-planning? Because I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that.

125
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:45,930
I know they'll reach out to the media community about like 400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area? We need notification and we need notification about how, what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens. Cause everybody who's talking about it, I'm worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and I read this big, walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon.

126
01:46:46,374 --> 01:47:00,299
I won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out. It's pretty bad when it's still sunny and they're walking in front of me. So I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed and I'm

127
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:27,978
Thank you. My time must be up. Apparently, I didn't realize it was going to play you off like that. Zoom's getting a little snotty. On the Walking Court thing, there is a past mitigation plan that is part of the Walking Court project. The road and control ordinance that we passed, as well as some of the building code stuff that we've done,

128
01:47:27,978 --> 01:47:47,807
And maybe zoning requires all major project construction to have integrated pest management plans as part of the ordinance. And Director O'Connor can talk more about that. It'd be on file with the Board of Health in her office. And then I can also talk to Director Driscoll about trying to communicate out better that there is a plan to the residents. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.

129
01:47:51,920 --> 01:48:13,643
Kurt, please, you have three minutes, and I'm gonna try to shut off that noise. Thank you for the time. My name is Galvin Murphy. I'm actually a Malden resident. I'm here because I'm a contractor for the city of Medford with the Iraq problem. I'm the guy that the health department calls when there's an issue in the neighborhood. I saw this on the agenda, and I thought maybe I could pop in tonight and take a beating like a man if it's necessary.

130
01:48:15,077 --> 01:48:43,490
I would like to let you know that next week, the Women and Pest Management Association is putting on a training program for health inspectors, and the city of Medford's sending three people to that training program. I know when they go through their sanitation training, they do not get any specific rodent control or rodent identification training, so we're gonna try and correct that issue. I do have seats available, although very few, if any city councilors wanna come over

131
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:55,179
see what rats look like up close and personal. So I open that invitation up to each of you. If you want to come, please just give me a call and I'll make a seat for you. As far as what's going on in the city,

132
01:48:55,486 --> 01:49:25,009
with rats. I made a prediction two years ago at the National Pest Management Association Conference, it happened to be in Boston, and I was up speaking, and I do speak at different national level programs. I made a prediction, and nobody's gonna like this prediction, that within the next five to 10 years, rats are gonna become as common as squirrels and we're gonna accept them. I just don't see us changing our habits as people that's gonna bring these rats under control.

133
01:49:25,009 --> 01:49:44,497
Last woman said walking down the street, there's rats in front of her. I think it's going to pretty much stay that way. It's not a rodent problem. It's a people problem. I see it in this very city. I see it in every community in eastern Massachusetts that I walk in on a regular basis, that I walk into people's backyards and the garbage and the trash is just piled up.

134
01:49:44,667 --> 01:50:01,647
and you can't get people to clean it up. The conducive conditions are there, and I'm sure each of you have heard enough about this, and how do we get people to respond to that? I watch our health inspectors go out there, and they work tirelessly to try and correct these issues.

135
01:50:01,647 --> 01:50:25,299
And I see them just get pushed back by people constantly. I'm working on, I'm doing this. I know one site that I've been at for the last two years, and your health inspectors try and be cooperative and work with people and educate, and we're still dealing with rats at the same house. And it's just not getting corrected. Other neighborhoods we go into and people work with your health inspectors and they work with us because

136
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:45,418
Your health department will pay me to go on their property and dispatch the animals using carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide directly right into the burrows. And it works great. And if we can get in there and they're going to correct their issues, we're going to do that. I've seen some neighborhoods really change. In other neighborhoods where we just have one person pushing back, it's just a constant pressure.

137
01:50:45,418 --> 01:51:02,022
But the reason I came up was to invite anybody would like to attend that meeting next week. It's Wednesday. I know everybody has real jobs and it's hard to do that. It's a daytime thing. If you want to try and make it, let me know and just let you know, you know, you have three people coming to it and hopefully they're going to come out with some new ideas of what to do.

138
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:30,828
What time on Wednesday? It starts at 9 a.m. It's in my office to get done about one o'clock in the afternoon. If you leave, I would ask you, Larry, if you leave your phone number with Emily, we can pass it around to the council. And I just want to thank you for coming down and sharing that information with us. We do hear great things about folks who work with you when the city refers you out. But I think it's really helpful and sobering for us to hear what you're saying. That's the experience that we've had issues. We had some folks

139
01:51:31,613 --> 01:51:57,244
I don't know, six months ago, maybe eight months ago, from the Hillside neighborhood on the other side from here and up by like Osgoode Street, talking about a couple of problem properties where we were trying to get code enforcement out there to address overgrowth and waste, and the city not having, essentially the private owners just being able to continue to get away with it to the public detriment.

140
01:51:57,244 --> 01:52:15,145
you know, it is a really important issue. But I do have a question from Councilor Callahan, if you don't mind. Yes, ma'am. Thanks so much for coming. It's great to have you here. I just wanted to see if you had any opinion on the topic that one of the previous speakers mentioned about poison versus population control.

141
01:52:15,316 --> 01:52:32,568
about the what? Poison versus population control. Poison versus population control. I'm not sure I'm going to say the question. The question is birth control? Yes, exactly. Poison versus birth control. Okay, it depends upon the type of poison that you're talking about. And birth control

142
01:52:32,841 --> 01:52:59,582
Hasn't proven itself yet. We had it years ago. We tried it and it blew up in our face. And then we had concerns about that getting into the water supply, infecting most mammals with birth control that we didn't want to affect. So that was taken off the market by the EPA. Okay. So I mean, other poisons that we use, some things we use have no secondary poisonings. Some do. I don't think that we're actually hurting

143
01:53:01,015 --> 01:53:25,316
animals like we've been told that we've been hurting animals. For instance, MK in Arlington died of the bird flu, not of rodent poisoning, rodenticide poisoning, and things like that. So I mean, can we cut back and if things can change in the industry, absolutely. And this training program we're doing is gonna really hit on that, on the alternatives and the best way to control the problem.

144
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:44,292
And the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, that's not, I mean, it's obviously deadly, but it's not a poison. Well, there's no secondary. Okay. Any other questions? All right. Thank you for your time. Thank you for coming down. Yes. Name and address for the record, please.

145
01:53:44,497 --> 01:54:05,981
I just want to thank them for bringing this up again. I have a property on Forest Street where I live and have been seeing rodent activities the first time I've seen it in five years. And I also own a property that I lived in for 25 years at 2931 Stoughton Street and have never had

146
01:54:05,981 --> 01:54:25,469
rat issues over by the hillside, but that is becoming an issue. The Method Health Department was very responsive and coming out after my calls and people have come out and looked. I do just want to say two things. One, there's a huge health concern with rats.

147
01:54:26,237 --> 01:54:52,517
A friend of mine's actual dog got liver disease from being in touch with rat urine. So rat urine actually causes liver disease in animals. So that's an issue. It can also cause a lot of issues with human contact as well. And two, you mentioned something about the trash. Is trash being done, because I walked through Medford Square on Monday night,

148
01:54:53,234 --> 01:55:17,671
And it is disgusting. I don't even like walking through this square at all. It's deplorable, the amount of trash that's not in any receptacles whatsoever. They're just sitting in cardboard boxes and trash bags. And I want to be supportive of the businesses. I think it's really important to have the businesses there, but I also think it doesn't put our city in good light and it also attracts all types of rodents.

149
01:55:18,473 --> 01:55:37,346
Yes, I can give more context on that. And again, Kit, if I get it wrong, please correct me. My understanding is that under prior trash contracts, there was kind of selective, some businesses were getting city pickup, some businesses were paying for private pickup. It was not really clear what the rhyme or reason was, but there was an equal treatment.

150
01:55:37,346 --> 01:56:02,039
some condo buildings were getting city pickup, some were having to pay for private. This contract straightens that out, A, from a pure fairness perspective, but it also, part of the ordinance that we passed establishes a private hauler program where there's essentially a preferred private hauler, which is the person that the city has, the group that the city has a contract with, and businesses or large residential buildings can

151
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:20,043
for a contract at a preferred rate with that hauler because they're already in the community doing the public contract. And the idea is, and this contract just went into effect three, six, five weeks ago, six weeks ago. And I'm not sure when these provisions exactly start to kick in yet. I think there's some grace period in there.

152
01:56:20,043 --> 01:56:50,043
But the idea is that in the major squares, instead of having street pickup with city stuff overnight, that there would be potentially areas of public parking lots or areas on private property where you might have all of the businesses for that building using a single dumpster or multiple dumpsters, and then being part of this preferred hauler program to then be able to have the trash in a contained space that is subject to an integrated pest management plan and is rodent proof.

153
01:56:50,043 --> 01:57:11,271
I worked at roses for when I was a kid here and yeah putting out the trash. I mean I put it out because that's what my boss told me to do but I wasn't happy seeing the street lined and obviously one windstorm that night and we've seen that before in Medford Square and the trash is all over the square. So that is the intent. Councilor Collins seems to have more information than me so I will let her answer.

154
01:57:11,817 --> 01:57:34,787
Not more, but just I think in terms of what, and I agree, I think that this was a lot of what was kind of negotiated while this new contract was being formed between the city side and waste management. I think that a lot of the provisions and goals, since it just went into effect July 1, are probably still being formulated. But I think in terms of what residents can expect to see, especially in the square specifically, is consolidation, because absolutely when you have

155
01:57:34,787 --> 01:58:00,742
one business that has overflow trash cans on the sidewalk, and another that has a dumpster, and then the other one doesn't use that dumpster, they just have a receptacle, and the next one just has a bag. It looks messy, and the more we can just keep everything in one container that really is solid and reinforced, hopefully that'll be, you know, one piece of the puzzle in getting trash off the streets, rats off the streets. And just one other thing, I think the other big thing comes down to enforcement.

156
01:58:00,742 --> 01:58:22,381
enforcing ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary. And if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.

157
01:58:22,705 --> 01:58:46,613
Yeah, one thing we're looking at is the fee and fine schedule. We've heard from our building commissioner right now that it actually costs more to add a new code enforcement officer because we're only charging certain rates than they're gonna actually bring back in, so it's cost negative. Is there a way to make that more cost neutral, cost positive? And you've heard a million times in this room, we don't have enough code enforcement, so I don't need to get into that. Thank you. Thank you very much.

158
01:58:46,903 --> 01:59:09,531
I just want to emphasize what was mentioned here by the pest control expert and the previous speaker that I think you keep complaining that you don't have financial resources. So a great way to address this is actually through fines. And the advantage of that is it's also like a dynamic stream of revenue. So if you have a lot of road and issues,

159
01:59:09,531 --> 01:59:31,596
And then you find, find, find, find, you get a lot of money and then that helps you to address the problem. Because, you know, later on, then you have less rodent pressure, then you don't need as many staff in the health department. So with the fine, it will allow you to just have a lot of resources when you actually need it. And then the second thing that I wanted to emphasize that the pest control experts mentioned is that

160
01:59:31,596 --> 01:59:51,288
individual responsibility. I think everyone in the community should understand that they have a responsibility and in fact they are the primary responsible party here to address this problem and a lot comes to up to education and I think you know the the city can play a role in that but

161
01:59:51,288 --> 02:00:03,763
At the end of the day, it's each of us that can go online or get a book from the library and learn about this. And then if we just don't have an individual sense of responsibility, then

162
02:00:03,882 --> 02:00:30,213
you know, probably as a pest control expert emphasized, then we're just going to live with rats for the city as we do with squirrels. So those two things, first, like, you know, individual responsibility, addressing the issue, being nice to your community. And then the second one is that actually enforcing fines and getting a lot of money from that from businesses has been said, like, you know, why aren't they dealing with the trash in the proper way, right? That's just not acceptable. So the city should go and get revenue from there. Thank you very much.

163
02:00:30,213 --> 02:00:59,002
Thank you. Yeah. And I appreciate the comment. Um, one thing I think when we pass the road and control ordinance, we are limited. There's a state law around non-criminal disposition that limits the maximum amount of fines and how often you can do them. And I think that was one of the barriers for us in terms of using fines as a revenue source. I think we wanted to see, um, it's, I think it's a maximum of $300 per incident, and then there have to have certain time period between incidents. And it's a barrier that we face because of the state law around, around that. I don't know,

164
02:00:59,275 --> 02:01:13,473
when the legislature will change it, but that would be helpful. Yes. I'll let Rada beat in part two. Um, if you assert sign, uh, fines to

165
02:01:14,224 --> 02:01:39,770
repeat offenders, such as one of them said that every time they go by this house, the dumpsters overloaded, overloaded. So you find this landlord or owner and they don't correct it and you find them again and find them again, whatever the allotted period is. Is it legal? Like if I get a lot of speeding tickets, I'm not allowed to renew my license because I have these outstanding speeding tickets.

166
02:01:40,128 --> 02:01:57,841
Is there anything that you can do to, this is going to be extreme, but put a ween on the house or something like that to make these people clean up their problem? Because the only thing that really makes humans do something is it when it hurts them in the pocket.

167
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:17,654
And again, the only thing that's going to correct this problem is humans by cleaning up their mess. All these other loading controls are not going to work if the food source is still there. So my question is, how far can a fine go to make this workable? Thank you.

168
02:02:18,063 --> 02:02:33,712
Yeah, so I can answer partially. So there is this state law that over overarches what cities and towns are able to do through a non-criminal disposition. One thing we are trying, my first term, like I think basically the only thing I really was able to get done was we worked on a

169
02:02:33,712 --> 02:02:50,794
the snow removal ordinance and one of the things we were trying to get done was looking into this and when we passed that snow removal ordinance update, there is now a provision where if you have a repeat offender, you can put a lien on the property.

170
02:02:50,794 --> 02:03:17,619
not just for the fine, which is still stuck at that 300 non-criminal disposition, but also we put in the ordinance, the cost of removal of the snow. So if the city has to send out city employees or contractors to clear the sidewalks, then there could be a lien placed. I don't think we've actually gotten to that point with any property yet since that ordinance was passed. So I don't know. And then I think there is an open question as to

171
02:03:18,524 --> 02:03:35,060
when that comes down the road, and we actually try to do it, and then someone sues and says, no, you can't do this, where are the courts gonna land on it? We passed it in the solicitor, it went through legal counsel, but we haven't tested it yet. So we'll see, it's a litigious society out there these days.

172
02:03:36,544 --> 02:03:53,985
I just wanted to quickly thank everyone for coming up and speaking about this. I think everyone had something super productive to add to the conversation. I think in the future, with this resolution passed, with more meetings about this, the more voices we can get, the more advice that we can get.

173
02:03:53,985 --> 02:04:11,357
will be able to make some positive progress on this. I think Mr. Benedetto's statements actually reminded me of something I wanted to say, which is that I think we have to think in terms of our messaging and our strategy, we need to go in two new directions with this. One is to

174
02:04:11,834 --> 02:04:28,524
go more local. I know my own neighborhood held a road in control meeting, basically neighbors educating each other about the best ways to get rid of road in control now. That's something that should be less neighbors doing it and city coming in and

175
02:04:28,524 --> 02:04:44,582
City leaders coming in and helping organize those meetings. So the local aspect is very, very important. And as much as we can harness that organic momentum, the better. I think we also need to think bigger too and recognize that the road control problem is also a regional problem.

176
02:04:44,582 --> 02:05:07,517
And so the more that we can do to set up institutions where counselors like us, city employees from Medford are working with city employees and counselors in neighboring municipalities to deal with projects that are on the border, I think the better we can serve our residents too. So building those channels of communication I think will be really important.

177
02:05:09,616 --> 02:05:36,698
Thank you. On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to join and approve Papers 24449 and 24451. Seconded by. Seconded by Councilor Zaro. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan. Yes. Vice President Collins. Yes. Councilor Lozano. Yes. Councilor Lovett. Yes.

178
02:05:38,456 --> 02:06:04,002
Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. Councilor Hussain. Yes. President Paris. Yes, 74 and then negative motion passes. Whereas good government is based on the fund, I'm sorry, 24450 offered by Councilor Scarpelli. Whereas good government is based on a foundation of openness, clarity, transparency, and accountability. And whereas the city council, taxpayers, and residents of the city of Medford are intended to be made aware whenever the city resolves claims against the city, the school department, any employee, any department, department head, or employee of the city,

179
02:06:04,002 --> 02:06:32,449
by payment regardless of whether those claims are resolved prior to litigation, after litigation, but before trial, by way of judgment or decision by a court or administrative or quasi-judicial body. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the mayor provide the council with a list of all such matters resolved during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further, for each matter so resolved by payment, the mayor report to the council the name of each person, persons, or entity who made such claim and the amount paid to each such person, persons, or entity, if there is a legal reason that any such name should not be disclosed.

180
02:06:32,449 --> 02:06:51,288
such as in the case of a minor, a general description of the claim without identifying the person will suffice. And further, for each matter so resolved by payment, the mayor reports to the city council the source of the money or funding that was used to pay the claim by specifying which city or school account that money was from, whether it was paid by an insurer of the city or meant for public schools. Further, that the mayor reports to the council

181
02:06:51,288 --> 02:07:19,138
the names and addresses of any insurers with whom the city or school department maintained a policy of insurance whose coverage was the source of payments used to pay any such claim during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further, for each policy of insurance listed by the mayor in answering the request set forth in the previous paragraph that the mayor state the annual premiums paid for each insurance policy listed in the applicable deductibles for each year during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024,

182
02:07:19,138 --> 02:07:38,439
or 2025. And finally, that the mayor provide the city council with a breakdown of all amounts paid to outside council for representing the city of Medford or the Metro Public Schools or any department, department head or employee of the city of Medford for any claims made against the city as a municipality or the Metro Public Schools or any department, department head or employee of the city of Medford during fiscal years 2021

183
02:07:38,439 --> 02:08:08,063
2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025. This request includes payments made for any work performed on such claims to the compliment and page law firm, PB&R law firm, or to any other attorneys. Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Council President. If you'll allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city.

184
02:08:08,063 --> 02:08:25,316
the school department or employees of the city or the schools. Yet many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims.

185
02:08:26,049 --> 02:08:51,032
Going back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500. The purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools.

186
02:08:51,032 --> 02:09:08,387
My motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with. That is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government. People deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent.

187
02:09:08,387 --> 02:09:37,500
With this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution. Now, as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right? We said we need more funding, right? We need more funding. And we've seen over the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million of free cash that was recently certified.

188
02:09:37,722 --> 02:10:04,053
The lack of new growth in our community over the past four years. Payments to outside councils that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are. And lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership. So this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds.

189
02:10:04,343 --> 02:10:29,002
Now, I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that. But there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads. Like we mentioned the other day, that you just go and speak to the department heads. Well, the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor.

190
02:10:29,923 --> 02:10:50,776
So like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying. It's frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it.

191
02:10:52,602 --> 02:11:21,715
So, you know, I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salt. I know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, you know, even the most simple things, an arbitration. If an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations. I'd like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides.

192
02:11:21,834 --> 02:11:42,944
not just the outcome, right? Because we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand and we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey,

193
02:11:43,575 --> 02:12:04,582
In the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes in how we've run the finances in the city. Okay, we've seen that. It's public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see

194
02:12:06,493 --> 02:12:35,811
why we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department. So thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Do any other councilors have any questions? Seeing none, I would just note that the council has not approved any appropriations beyond the city budget for settlements. So settlements are being done within the appropriate amount of the city budget.

195
02:12:37,517 --> 02:13:05,077
Members of the public would like to speak. Yeah, if you leave it with, do you want us to review it now or do you want us to review it after the meeting? Okay, thanks.

196
02:13:08,285 --> 02:13:32,517
name and address for the record, please. You have three minutes. Thank you. Thank you, uh, president bears and members of the council. Um, I appreciate the name and address. Oh, sorry. Steve South, uh, one Oh six Damon road, Medford mass. Okay.

197
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:56,203
Again, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli putting this item forward. For the last four and a half years, I've been educating the three different councils about all the open litigation. This all started a little over four years ago. So when I saw this resolution, I thought it would be a good time to give you my yearly update.

198
02:13:56,203 --> 02:14:26,169
So I did some research and found out some of the open litigations. These are just lawsuits. This doesn't include all the open labor charges with all the unions, arbitrations, mediations, fact finding, and other litigations. So I just want to take you through a couple of these briefly. This was filed, I believe this is 2002, Allison Convoy versus City of Medford. And I just want to take you through a couple of accounts. Failure to pay FLSA overtime.

199
02:14:26,169 --> 02:14:54,292
That's count one. Failure to pay overtime for off-the-clock work. That's count two. Failure to pay overtime wages required under GL-149. Violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act by failure to make timely payment of earned wages. So that's one lawsuit. Another lawsuit, Alicia Nunley versus City of Medford. Also, Breonna Lungo Kern, as well as David Rodriguez.

200
02:14:54,292 --> 02:15:20,657
And I'll just read you the opening. This is an action arising out of the wrongful acts and omissions of the defendants who engaged in discrimination and harassment against Alicia Nunley Benjamin in her employment as Chief Financial Officer slash Auditor Finance Director for the city of Medford, Massachusetts, based on race, color, and sex, and retaliated against her after she complained about the mistreatment.

201
02:15:21,032 --> 02:15:39,616
Next is going to be, and these are all open, by the way, these are pending lawsuits. Again, this is Superior Court, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Michael Durham versus City of Medford, Brianna Lungo Kern and Neil Osborne. Sorry, give me one second.

202
02:15:44,189 --> 02:16:10,435
Okay, count one, discrimination based on disability. Count two, violation of MGL 151B, retaliation. Count three, violation of MGL, the Massachusetts Whistleblower Act. Count four, this is against, individually against Breonna Lungo Kern, aiding and abetting discrimination and violation of MGL. Claims against- Steve, you have about 30 seconds. Yep, Neil Osborne.

203
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:28,848
Let me move on. Next, Sandra Gale versus City of Medford. Next, there's a bunch of inspectors versus City of Medford. Next, there's about 50 DPW employees versus the City of Medford. Next, I want to go to settlements.

204
02:16:28,848 --> 02:16:55,896
2022, 30 school custodians, $495,000. 2023, school security, $28,500. June of 2024, a member of the DPW, $265,000. 2024, you just settled it out in the hall today, $47,500 for another member. 2024, Medford DPW pending settlement. It's gonna be signed sometime very soon.

205
02:16:55,896 --> 02:17:19,684
2024, Samari Montes, you guys took it up outside. I also want to point out that while the city is paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements and are actually there's much more liability and maybe in the millions that the city council is approving two raises for itself as well as all the other non-union.

206
02:17:19,684 --> 02:17:46,886
three raises for the Medford mayor, Brianna Lungo Kern, that goes into effect July 1. That's one for the school committee and two raises for the mayor. And all the while that the city still has many employees under collective bargaining agreements that haven't had a raise in years, including police patrolmen, police superiors, recreation department, DPW superintendents, inspectors, and others.

207
02:17:46,886 --> 02:18:05,845
Steve, you're a minute over. Yeah, I just I just I'm almost done. I got two more points. Okay. I also want to point out that the city is spending many hundreds of thousands on KP law again, while all these other things are pending when they could hire a city solicitor, but they choose not to by leaving the

208
02:18:05,845 --> 02:18:29,633
the wages so low. And lastly, I want to point out while the city is treating the taxpayer dollars as monopoly money, you're asking for multiple prop two and a half overrides in November over seven and a half million dollars. Thank you. Thank you. That was two minutes over. You're welcome. On that note, again,

209
02:18:30,828 --> 02:18:54,770
We have not appropriated a single dollar above the budgeted appropriated amount for any settlements. So there's not a monopoly money approach here. Steve, I'm sorry, but you know, you can't. They've been paid for by appropriated funds. There's no additional funding, magic money, wasted money that's going to these things beyond what is approved in the city budget.

210
02:18:57,466 --> 02:19:24,053
The city council, Steve, I'm not going to get into a back and forth with you. The city council has to, the city council has to approve all appropriations. It's the law. The city council has not been asked to appropriate a single dollar beyond the budget for legal settlements. Well, I would, uh, good luck. Um, any questions on the resolution? Councilor Collins.

211
02:19:25,674 --> 02:19:51,067
I don't have a question on the resolution specifically. I thank the councilor for bringing it forward. I think that a lot of what we've heard in terms of premises for this conversation, I have an honest disagreement with at the same time. I think that there's a lot of ways for us to have really productive conversations about settlements and liabilities before the city.

212
02:19:51,476 --> 02:20:21,186
These sometimes occur in public session. These sometimes occur in executive session. Anytime we are getting more information from the administration as opposed to less when it comes to the city side of things, we have no jurisdiction over the schools. I think that is a good thing. I think that always leaves us better off. That often leaves the atmosphere more productive and collaborative than it was when we were feeling under-informed prior to, you know, whether it's a meeting or a memo or just a substantive update.

213
02:20:21,715 --> 02:20:40,828
I think for myself, I feel, I think, across many issues we've all had the experience of feeling under informed on various issues and then we get that bolus of information it's like wow, now we can really have a conversation about this, that leaves me feeling pretty open and flexible when it comes to what type of format or venue we receive

214
02:20:40,828 --> 02:21:09,019
information about settlements and liabilities in going forward. This, like a lot of our resolutions, when it comes to making resolutions to the administration, they are essentially requests. We cannot compel reports or requests to be filled by the administration just because of the nature of the way our government is set up. That being said, I hope that the administration takes this request for more information as a

215
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:39,360
in the best faith possible to say, it is better for us when we put our issues out on the table and we're able to have these conversations when there's fewer surprises. And I think that, you know, there's a lot of cliche ways to put this, but I think that we're better when fewer things are in the dark. I think that it's better to shine a light on things that people are hearing about than to,

216
02:21:39,787 --> 02:22:06,800
to speculate until kind of a belated information. So that being said, more information is always better. I know that a lot of this is very sensitive, like we saw earlier today. A lot of this has to be discussed in executive session. Some of it, you know, there's some litigations, there's some settlements that always come to the council as a matter of course, we saw that earlier this evening. I always want to correct the record when it comes to what information, you know, the city council does get

217
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:34,787
certain settlements do come before us, we do appropriate. You know, I wouldn't want to put forward a request and also forward the story that, you know, we're in this complete and total information desert in the same way that I, you know, wouldn't want it to go by that, you know, an unusual number for free cash is in some way evidence of financial mismanagement. It's not.

218
02:22:34,991 --> 02:23:04,650
We know from communities across the street that this was a banner year for free cash surpluses for many communities. But in the same way, I don't think that we should need to treat settlements and liabilities like something that we cannot talk about and we cannot ask about. I think to the extent that we are able to have a freer flow of information about this with the administration, leave us better off, leave us better able to communicate with the community when there are concerns, be able to say, this is what it really is.

219
02:23:05,589 --> 02:23:33,080
you know, and help us dial in on what our real problems are. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Scott Riley and Councilor Sviggum. Thank you, Mr. President. So this, I agree with my councils. This is a simple request that, again, do transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested. And I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows

220
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:57,312
if it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right. So I welcome your support. I think that, I know Councilor Behrs said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Seltz just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving.

221
02:23:57,312 --> 02:24:14,497
So, again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories. These are real lawsuits.

222
02:24:15,435 --> 02:24:41,561
what's already been settled are real. Those, a lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record. So I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact. And when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact. If they're fact, then we could discuss something else that's very important. And that's what we're paying for our

223
02:24:41,561 --> 02:25:06,817
our insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right? What does that increase? What have we paid? You know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion. My opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask,

224
02:25:07,244 --> 02:25:23,319
expressed that we just we just certified $9 million. That's $9 million of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly. So in definition to myself, whether you want to take it or not, it's fiscal mismanagement. You do not manage

225
02:25:23,319 --> 02:25:40,179
that money responsibly, and that's the taxpayers' money. So, yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my colleagues in the mayor to see

226
02:25:40,179 --> 02:25:54,753
where we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again. There's a lot of questions. This is just a piece. That's all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward. Thank you.

227
02:25:56,698 --> 02:26:14,019
Councilor Sang and then Councilor Kellyanne. Thank you. You know, I like Vice President Collins. I disagree with a lot of the premises put out there and to the best effort of Councilors to get me to vote no on this, I do intend to vote yes on this. I, you know,

228
02:26:14,019 --> 02:26:37,022
I do believe that the text of the resolution that's in front of us is what we have to debate. And I agree with what's being said in the resolution. I agree with greater transparency. I think it's good when we as the city council have more oversight over these issues, when we are much more to know about these issues, when we can inform our residents about what's going on.

229
02:26:37,022 --> 02:26:54,804
any motion that I think, any motion or resolution that reasonably increases transparency in our community is something that I would support. And so I do plan on voting yes on this. Councilor Calderon. I plan to vote in favor. Thanks. Any further comments from members of the council?

230
02:26:56,476 --> 02:27:17,841
I'll just say for one counselor, the text of the resolution, I don't have a problem with it. It's answers that already exist and could be compiled into a report, I would guess. We've seen them in the Warren articles and we've seen them in reports previously, and I'd like to see them all in one place. And I think we've said so many times here, it'd be nice to see it all. No problem with the text of the resolution.

231
02:27:18,353 --> 02:27:31,152
but the narrative and the arguments being put forth underlying the resolution to try to tie it into some larger accusation, it's just spurious, it's just not real.

232
02:27:31,493 --> 02:27:57,278
The facts of the matter are this council has never been asked to appropriate additional money for settlements and legal services since I've been on this council, which includes all these fiscal years. I haven't seen a million dollar end of year transfer to the legal budget because of all these settlements. That has to happen legally. There's about six different checks and balances on it from the finance director to the state division of local services and the department of revenue to the mayor to this body.

233
02:27:57,278 --> 02:28:05,998
That if that was happening, they'd have to go through all these, there'd have to be such a massive conspiracy going all the way up to the state level, to the commissioner of revenue for that to be true.

234
02:28:07,278 --> 02:28:36,954
that it's not true. So I'm perfectly fine asking the questions. I'm gonna vote yes on it. But the idea that this fits some sort of larger narrative or example of something that's going on about malfeasance is just false. The number of people who would have to be involved in it intentionally is not possible. And I think as everyone knows here, it would involve people who strongly disagree with each other, somehow colluding. I disagree strongly with Mayor Lungo Kern on a number of substantive issues.

235
02:28:37,261 --> 02:28:56,459
I disagree with her on some of the management style in this building. I am not, you know, it's just not possible. So I have no problem asking the questions, but when we try to tie it into this larger thing, it's just plainly political. Councilor Zaro.

236
02:28:57,261 --> 02:29:10,759
I would agree with what President Vares was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see. I think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the

237
02:29:11,152 --> 02:29:30,230
that the city wouldn't have been able to access the funds to pay out, you know, legal fees and things like this. There are, you know, blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge. So for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned,

238
02:29:30,503 --> 02:30:00,503
he just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times. That was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out. I think that would be great. I also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other,

239
02:30:00,503 --> 02:30:15,230
elements of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think, is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Lemming. Thank you, Council President Sell.

240
02:30:15,538 --> 02:30:37,073
Like my colleagues, I don't really like to hear a lot of the conspiratorial narratives, but I have a purely technical question about this that I hope that perhaps Councilor Scarpelli or somebody else could address. If this information is already out there, I'd just like to know, are there any particular

241
02:30:37,739 --> 02:31:03,268
papers or types of information that could be received with this resolution that could not be addressed with a simpler FOIA request. Sorry, can you repeat that, a what request? FOIA, Freedom of Information Act request. So my question is, could somebody simply submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the mayor

242
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:28,968
to the city to get the information requested in this resolution? Or is the resolution asking for information that could not be gotten through a Freedom of Information Act request? It's just a technical question that... I don't know. I truly understand what he's saying. What I'm thinking,

243
02:31:29,462 --> 02:31:41,476
My take and the comment, the question is that, why wouldn't someone put a foyer in? If that's the case, they can do that. I think he was asking if there's anything that a public records request wouldn't provide that this would provide.

244
02:31:42,295 --> 02:32:06,647
maybe, but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in? We would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested just to,

245
02:32:06,647 --> 02:32:19,377
just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability. Thank you. Thank you. Any further comments, Councilor Levee? No, I just, I am just...

246
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:48,558
I guess my point was first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request. And also just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there. It could be just as an effective means

247
02:32:48,558 --> 02:33:13,626
transparency. Obviously, that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received. But that was that was what I was asking. Thank you. There would be a shot clock on a public records request. Technically, the mayor has no obligation to respond to our resolution. But that's the only difference I'm aware of. Any further comments by members of the council?

248
02:33:15,043 --> 02:33:40,828
Seeing none, we'll go to the public. Name and address for record at the podium. Raise your hand on Zoom. You have three minutes. Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road. I just wanted- You have to press the, just once. Yeah, the green line is on. That should be good. Yep. Hello? Okay. So Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road. I just wanted to make a general reminder to everyone.

249
02:33:40,947 --> 02:34:08,166
that one of the basic principles that we learn in a civics education class, which is what stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful? Checks and balances or separation of powers. There's absolutely no reason why one should vote no on this. I strongly support voting yes. And I hope every member of the council does so as well. This is just like, even if this information is spread out and publicly somewhere else,

250
02:34:08,166 --> 02:34:26,749
I think it would be very helpful for members of the, for residents of Medford to basically see this in a compiled report. And as I said, it's about just checks and balances as two councillors here mentioned. I don't see a reason to not do this. Thank you very much. Thank you. Name and address for record please. You have three minutes.

251
02:34:27,090 --> 02:34:45,213
Steve South, 106 Damon Road. I just wanted to clarify a couple of the questions that were asked and comments that were made. One is a FOIA request would not capture some lawsuits that are considered private until, or litigations, I should say,

252
02:34:45,213 --> 02:35:08,609
such as complaints with MCAD, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, which those complaints are private until they are decided or adjudicated or settled. Then they become public. I just want to point that out. So there are things that would be captured by this item that would not be captured by a FOIA. I just want to clarify a couple other things that I

253
02:35:08,609 --> 02:35:25,538
I'm trying to understand if several of the counselors, including you, President Bares, were saying that the settlements that I mentioned never happened because I have copies of them. So I didn't understand if that's what you guys were saying, that it's not possible due to checks and balances. Nobody said that.

254
02:35:25,538 --> 02:35:48,063
Oh, okay. I heard people saying that it would have to go through all checks and balances and money allocated. These are settlements that several of them happened that were never approved by the council and I came and spoke at that time and gave copies of the settlements. I just want to point that out. I also want to point out to one of the counselors who said, you know, that

255
02:35:48,063 --> 02:36:15,589
Something about that I mentioned Sandra Gail twice and maybe it's exaggerated. I just want to point out that the litigation that you approved out there in executive session for $47,500 was a complaint made by Teamsters Local 25 at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations. That was settled a couple weeks ago during the middle of a trial. I believe you guys approved it today. The other lawsuit- I can't comment on that.

256
02:36:15,589 --> 02:36:32,483
Yeah, that's fine. I'm commenting. I know what it is. It's 47-5. You guys just approved it. And the lawsuit that I gave to you guys in your packet, and I just want to point out to Councilor Lozano, this is a United States District Court

257
02:36:32,483 --> 02:36:59,616
District of Massachusetts lawsuit for wage and hour violations. It's valued somewhere in the couple hundred thousand dollar range. So they're two separate litigations. I just wanted to point that out, you know, as people are talking about exaggeration. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Yeah, my point being, I think the comment was made, the words monopoly money were used. And the point was made that

258
02:37:01,032 --> 02:37:25,811
An appropriation to pay for a settlement must be approved by the council. You may be well right that something was approved by the school department or something didn't come to the council. We had that discussion in the past. The money for that would have to be. So that's what I'm saying here. There's been no appropriation requested or made by this, requested by the mayor or made by this council to pay for

259
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:42,415
any sort of settlement sum. And I'm just going to leave it there, sir. You know, there's not, there's not monopoly money activity going on. It's just false.

260
02:37:42,415 --> 02:38:03,319
Scarpelli was here when I came up on previous years and handed out the settlements and the lawsuits, they were never approved by the council. So you guys and I appreciate- That's not the point that's being made. No, of course it is. No, it's not. The point that I'm making is that these settlements were approved within the confines of the budget as approved by the council.

261
02:38:03,968 --> 02:38:19,718
No additional money was asked to be appropriated from the mayor to the council to pay for these settlements. We're not talking about additional money. What we're talking about is when a lawsuit is settled for $500,000, you guys should approve it. I'll leave it at that.

262
02:38:19,718 --> 02:38:43,763
And yes, the point being that this council has never been asked to make an appropriation for money beyond the scope of the city budget for settlements. That is a fact, and it is indisputable. I'm not talking in circles. You're saying there's all this extra money that we're being asked to spend on this. I'm saying that as soon as this is gone, we're going to tax payers money. You didn't get the law, because you own the house. Oh, Steve, you're a big man, aren't you?

263
02:38:45,794 --> 02:39:09,633
No, I'm giggling about your obvious political attempt to malign the city. Steve, please stop. Steve, please stop. Please stop. We are paying attention. You're the one who doesn't know. Councilor Collins, you clearly have no clue. Councilor Collins. I mean, I'm not the one making it a goof show here.

264
02:39:11,067 --> 02:39:40,162
I'm just commenting, he's the one who's trying to, if we're gonna throw conspiracy theories around in the public forum, they will be combated by this chair. Thank you, Harry. Council Vice President Collins. Clown show. I do wanna underline the point, which is reflected in city paperwork, most of which has already been reviewed by the council in public session. If one of the points that this conversation is about is,

265
02:39:41,118 --> 02:40:01,766
Is there secret money being spent on settlements that is not known to counselors, that is not known to the public? I would offer an amendment or a B paper that this information, if it's provided by the administration, also include legal department, budget to actuals for this fiscal years that are being asked about so that we can, we don't have to,

266
02:40:01,766 --> 02:40:20,964
I mean, I was going to say we don't have to take it on faith, but it's on the city website already. We get to see it on paper in the packet that we will receive how much money was budgeted for the legal department and how much was spent. Yes, we do. Thank you, sir. Please stop this. And with that, President Perez, that was the question. Are you asking for a paper?

267
02:40:21,425 --> 02:40:50,589
I would put that forward as an amendment if the councilor is open to it. There's an amendment to include the budget to actuals for the law department, which of course has been in every city budget for all of those fiscal years. Is that amendment acceptable, councilor Scarpelli? We'd like to include as part of the report you're requesting that we get the budget to actuals, although we already have it. It's already in the Warren articles as well.

268
02:40:54,497 --> 02:41:02,551
We're seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it. Anything over $2,500, we should be voting on.

269
02:41:03,387 --> 02:41:33,080
When we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees. These are the things that I want to show. I didn't say monopoly money. What I'm saying is real money. I didn't say you did, sir. Yeah, no, I'm saying it's real money. And it's taxpayers' money. So that's why this resolution's come about. Whether Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue. But I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's,

270
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:59,531
There's, and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement. We're seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability. So thank you, sir. Anything to help? With the point of order?

271
02:42:00,606 --> 02:42:11,425
with my fellow counselors' statement that this has maybe gone astray, I'd like to move the question. All right. If I may? Vice President Collins. I just want to note,

272
02:42:13,114 --> 02:42:41,937
I obviously strongly disagree that there's anything fraudulent going on, but my point with the, including the budget to actuals as context in this information is to illustrate, if we talk about managing money, what does that literally mean? Where the money comes from, where it goes, the budget to actuals, we don't have to talk about how much money is being spent and where does it come from, we can literally see it. And I don't see why that shouldn't be a part of the conversation. And again, we do already have that information, but I think it makes sense to put all the context next to each other. I'm gonna split your paper, George. Glad you can see it.

273
02:42:43,114 --> 02:43:02,961
There's a huge gaps in what's going on in this community. So we could just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff council president mentioned, let's let's talk about it. Because we talked about KP law, and they came here during the budget season, and openly said we only spend $50,000 on KP law. But

274
02:43:02,961 --> 02:43:31,971
But using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up almost $500,000. And that's not totally what was in other departments. So there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory. These are questions that I brought up. These are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city. We've asked for an audit to do this for us. We've asked for transparency and accountability. This is the form that we're asking.

275
02:43:31,971 --> 02:43:48,422
move to the question. Let's get the answers from the mayor's office. Hopefully she does what she's supposed to. And like Councilor Lemming said, that's a great idea. If she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a form. So that's it. Thank you. Is there a motion on the floor?

276
02:43:48,422 --> 02:44:06,920
motion by councillor collins to approve as amended seconded by councillor saying and i just want to go you know we can talk about whatever losing the thread the thread is very clear i have no issue asking the administration as one councillor to compile information that already exists in this way so that it's easy to understand it

277
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:33,063
This council has never appropriated a dollar beyond the city budget for settlements. And that narrative, I agree, not pushed by you, Councilor Scarbelli, but stated in this forum, is blatant misinformation and will be challenged. Name and address for the record, please. You have three minutes. Kyle Heath, 131 Fulton Street Road. I think we're getting a little lost here, too, about this just being about money.

278
02:44:34,684 --> 02:44:56,869
One of the big things is why are people being treated in such this way that this money is being spent? Why is there lawsuit after lawsuit that people are winning? That's because of the administration in this city. It's like George was saying, it's financial mismanagement. I can tell you a quick story about what happened just a few weeks in court.

279
02:44:58,490 --> 02:45:18,063
You know, we had arbitration a few weeks ago, we had a settlement done with the city, and after six or seven hours in court, the mayor decided, I changed my mind, I need to sleep on it more. Let's set up another court date. So after somebody goes and tells their family they just got the settlement and arbitration and they're getting this job,

280
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:46,032
The mayor changed her mind after a few hours. And now after spending $2,400 that day, we're going back to court again for another $24 from the city. So it's almost five grand just to spend on court with one case. The financial mismanagement is just unbelievable. But why is this happening? Why is the city treating its workers in such a way that this is happening? I don't understand it. I just don't get why.

281
02:45:46,493 --> 02:46:10,794
No one's bringing that up with, it's not just money with these lawsuits. It's how are they getting away with the cost of all treating people like this, the workforce that work every single day out there for the city, no matter what understaffed and this lawsuit after lawsuit that we're winning and winning and winning. And I think that needs to be looked into. I don't know, you know,

282
02:46:11,544 --> 02:46:35,265
I don't want to say it, but I think one of the reasons is the way you just spoke to the public and how you're speaking up there, calling it a clown show and everything. You're making comments and not allowing anyone here to make any comments. I think that's part of it. Do you just know two minutes of comments, Kyle? I allow everyone to make their comments, but I'm just saying that what you just said, I agree with you a hundred percent. And my three terms on this council, we have been diligent about asking these questions when we have no formal authority to manage anyone.

283
02:46:35,265 --> 02:47:02,739
You're perfectly fine. You're supposed to be in control of this hall. Kyle, I am in control of this hall, and you're just interrupting me. You're in control of the hall, but you're calling at a clown show, comments under your breath. Everyone can hear you. I'm aware. But that's the reason why. It's not the reason why. They get away with it, is because you're doing it over here. No. That's all I got to say. Kyle, again, you interrupted me. I'd like to have a dialogue with you. But again, when people interrupt me and they don't allow me to have the dialogue, that's when it becomes out of control, and that's when we have these sessions. Now, could I make the point that I was going to make, and then I'll give the floor back to you? Go for it.

284
02:47:03,899 --> 02:47:21,800
The thing we all agree on behind this council and behind this rail is we'd like to see the figures presented in a certain way. And I think all of us have raised questions about the workplace culture and the management of the city in many different aspects, many different departments. That's something we all share.

285
02:47:22,227 --> 02:47:39,787
when that gets mixed into a political narrative about overrides and what happens in public meetings and not liking the outcomes of certain city council votes. And you just said it, we're understaffed, right? I support an override because we've been understaffed and I think we need more money to get out of understaffing.

286
02:47:39,923 --> 02:47:57,210
I don't think even if everything that was just said happened and every lawsuit that Mr. South just presented to us and everything else, if all that money happened and went out the door for settlements tomorrow, it still wouldn't be reliable recurring revenue to pay people in the long term to address the city's financial issues. So when that

287
02:47:57,210 --> 02:48:24,189
True thing that I'm saying, it's just statistical fact that the city budget gets lumped in with the settlements and gets politicized around revenue and overrides. That's when we have a disagreement. That's when people start yelling from the crowd and breaking the quorum. And that's when I lose patience with that narrative. So I agree with you. I have those questions. I share those concerns. I raised them. I raised them when I was sitting there. I try to raise them when I'm sitting here. I don't think anyone would say that I'm

288
02:48:24,428 --> 02:48:37,159
their best friend of this administration. I try to work with them collaboratively because that's what the job of government is. When the narratives start getting spun up in a certain way to politicize things and attack other things that aren't related to these fundamental factual questions,

289
02:48:37,722 --> 02:49:04,326
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? We can talk all we want up here, but what are we doing about it? As Mr. Seltz just mentioned, we're going back just four years of this going on, and nothing's been changed. We're looking at a city charter change right now. But this isn't just financial. It's been four years of lawsuits. What's being changed to look at this administration and say, why are you guys treating the employees this way? What's being done about it? We have been exercising our, how many resolutions have we passed on legal issues, George?

290
02:49:05,879 --> 02:49:20,282
5, 6, 7, 8, 10. Steve was talking about all the meetings he's come and given the report. I haven't seen any changes. Well, I haven't seen anything. I haven't actually seen one of you guys come down with DPW. I haven't even talked to us. What's the limit of our authority, Kyle?

291
02:49:20,845 --> 02:49:48,507
I'm not sure. I'd like to know if you can come down to the DW and say hello once in a while, too. That'd be nice to see how we're actually doing. We'd love to. Come on down. Give us a call. It'd be nice to see you guys, to show that everyone actually cares about us, because we're not getting there right now. We do. We'd love to come down. We'd love to do that. I've been there five years. I haven't seen anyone but Mr. Scalvelli. I've been down there, but I'm sorry I missed you. I'm there all the time. I don't know. Well, maybe you miss me, but I've been down to the building. Oh. Thank you. But in any case,

292
02:49:49,497 --> 02:50:16,510
My point being, I don't disagree with what you're saying when it gets wrapped up in all this other stuff, that's the division. So I'm not wrapping it up in anything and I will continue not to. And I hope that we can have, I appreciate that. And I hope that we can continue to have meetings where we have a respectful dialogue like that. Thank you, instead of yelling from the crowd, thank you. On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Vice President Collins to approve the motion as amended,

293
02:50:17,637 --> 02:50:43,251
Any further discussion by members of the council or members of the public? Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Kellyanne? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lazaro? Yes. Councilor Lemmon? Yes. Councilor Scripp-Kellyanne? Yes. Councilor Singh? Yes. President Peters? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative. The motion passes.

294
02:50:43,951 --> 02:51:11,271
24-452 is mine, so Council Vice President Collins can take the chair. On the motion to take paper, 24-459, we have multiple appointments? Yeah. Can we take 2445, if we're gonna do that, 24447, 24448, and 24459?

295
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:37,193
on the motion of councilor saying to take those papers out of order. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. The second is Council Vice President Collins.

296
02:51:39,906 --> 02:51:57,602
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

297
02:51:58,490 --> 02:52:18,234
Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body confirm the appointment of William O'Keefe, Republican of 18 Kilgore Avenue, to the Election Commission for the unexpired term of the existing vacancy to expire March 30, 2026, in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 51, Section 16A. William will be present in person or via Zoom for the meeting, and a copy of the appointment letter is enclosed.

298
02:52:18,234 --> 02:52:37,329
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Sincerely, Brandon Lugo, current mayor. And I just want to add, for folks who may not know about the law, the law requires partisan balance on our Elections Commission to ensure that all parties are represented. And Mr. O'Keefe here is filling the vacant term of the Republican seat that expires March 30th, 2026. Thank you for being here. Absolutely, yes.

299
02:52:37,892 --> 02:53:03,370
and welcome the opportunity to take any questions. Lifelong Method resident, father, husband, served on the school committee, attorney. And I also think that the mayor is doing a wonderful job as well as his council. So it can be as impossible as impossible can be, but just like anything else, everybody's gotta agree to disagree sometimes. Think about that, a Republican and a socialist. Yes. Any questions for Mr. O'Keefe?

300
02:53:03,848 --> 02:53:20,111
Council Vice President Collins. Thank you so much for stepping up and putting yourself forward to fill this position. I think we'd be very lucky to have you. I have a motion to approve. On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Zahra. Mr. Clerk, please file the roll. Oh, we have a comment from Mr. Leona.

301
02:53:20,623 --> 02:53:44,275
fun going on 86 Chandler Road. I just want to say that I've known Bill O'Keefe as an attorney and somebody that has been so active with Medford Little League. Back when my three kids started, we had four little leagues in the city of Medford. Now we're down to one. Bill O'Keefe was the one responsible for negotiating and it wasn't easy to bring

302
02:53:46,937 --> 02:54:15,623
He brought the parties together so that we still have an active. But anyway. As long as it wasn't during election season. I think we're very fortunate to have Bill O'Keefe on the Elections Commission. I would hope you would approve it. Thank you. All right, great. Thank you. On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Zahra, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan. Yes.

303
02:54:16,886 --> 02:54:43,780
Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lazaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes. Councilor Skrpilian? Yes. Councilor Sanz? Yes. President Behrs? Yes. Assembly affirmative then negative, motion passes. 24-447, Medford Housing Authority Appointment, Michael Luongo.

304
02:54:45,896 --> 02:55:15,896
Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend the honorable body in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 121B, Section 5, confirm the reappointment of the following individual, effective July 1, 2024, for a five-year term through June 30, 2029, as a member cited in the reference statute, Michael Longo, member of 145 4th Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to the Medford Housing Authority for a term of five years to expire on June 30, 2029, and a copy of the appointment letter is attached. Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. Brianna Longo, current mayor.

305
02:55:18,302 --> 02:55:45,026
Do we have Mr. Longo here on Zoom? Seeing none, and whereas this is a reappointment, I'll leave it up to my fellow councilors as to how they'd like to dispose of this paper. Councilor Lazaro. Motion to approve. Motion to approve by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by? Seconded by Council Vice President Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan. Yes. Vice President Collins.

306
02:55:46,084 --> 02:56:04,036
Councilor Lazzaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. Councilor Sang? Yes. President Behrs? Yes. Affirmative, none negative. The motion passes. 24-448 Medford Housing Authority Appointment and Schiavone.

307
02:56:05,418 --> 02:56:35,282
President Beers and members of the Medford City Council, I hereby, I'm guessing it says, I hereby request and recommend that your honorable body in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 121B, Section 5, confirm the appointment of the following individual, effective August 13th, 2024, for a five-year term through March 1, 2029, as the representative of the Saltonstall Local Tenant Organization board members, as cited in the reference statute, and Chiavone, representative of the Saltonstall Local Tenant Association board members, 121 Riverside Avenue, number 206, Medford MA,

308
02:56:35,555 --> 02:57:01,203
02155 to the Manford Housing Authority for a term of five years to expire, September 30th, 2029. A copy of the appointment letter is attached. Thank you for your kind attention in this matter. Sincerely, Brando Lugo, current mayor. We did receive an email from the administration that Ms. Schiavone was ill and unable to attend tonight, but there she was, the recommendation of the Tenants Association for the seat that goes to a public housing resident. Is there a motion? Council Vice President Collins.

309
02:57:02,381 --> 02:57:23,029
On the motion to approve of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozano? Yes. Councilor Lemon? Yes.

310
02:57:25,282 --> 02:57:45,640
Yes. Councilor San Buenaventura. Yes. President Ferris. Yes. And then I get the motion passes. 24452 resolution. This is mine. Can you take that chair? Oh, perfect.

311
02:57:48,524 --> 02:58:01,476
24452, resolution to support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural substances on the November 5, 2024 general election ballot offered by President Behrs.

312
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:25,674
Whereas one in three Massachusetts residents struggle with mental health challenges, and whereas pioneering research from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School find that natural psychedelics can be effective in managing treatment-resistant depression and other forms of mental illness, and whereas the FDA recently granted psilocybin, one of the psychedelics, a, quote, breakthrough therapy, unquote, designation for treatment-resistant depression,

313
02:58:25,674 --> 02:58:44,770
And whereas the ballot question would create a regulated framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy for adults 21 and older, now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural psychedelic substances on the November 4, 2024 general election ballot. President Burris.

314
02:58:44,770 --> 02:59:03,763
Thank you, President Collins. The resolution is relatively self-explanatory. There are five statewide questions and three local ballot questions on the ballot for November 5th, 2024. This is question four, certified by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, which would legalize certain, decriminalize, I should say, certain

315
02:59:04,787 --> 02:59:29,872
psychedelic substances that have been shown in clinical studies to help address mental health issues. The decriminalization of these has occurred in other places and it has helped, gone a long way to helping a lot of folks. I personally have spoken to a number of advocates, including veterans who would like to see these options provided to them where current other pharmaceutical practices

316
02:59:30,179 --> 02:59:56,203
items in medicines have not been helpful to address their mental health challenges. And again, this is a limited decriminalization of certain substances that have been seen in clinical studies and by the FDA to be really helpful in addressing serious mental health challenges. So I'm hopeful that the voters will approve in November, but also I'm hopeful that the council will endorse this question as well.

317
02:59:57,654 --> 03:00:24,428
Thank you, President Behrs. Any further comment from members of the council? I have a motion to approve from Councilor Sang. Is there a second? Seconded by President Behrs. Name and address for the record, please. Castaneda Andrew Cushion Street, East Method Mass. Through the chair and over the table, I'd like to address to Councilor Behrs.

318
03:00:27,790 --> 03:00:54,923
Totally, I'm 99.9 behind Councilor Beers on this. I think it's great, because this country has really neglected to study alternative medicines for the longest time. For example, cannabis, it took them 85 years to legalize it, only after they could figure out a way to tax it.

319
03:00:56,152 --> 03:01:21,903
Let's call the diamond a diamond and a club a club. They figure out a way to tax it. Now on this psilocybin, I'm hearing really good stories. It's helping people with the PTSD, depression, anxiety. This could be a natural God's sin. If you don't believe in God, a natural nature's sin that could help a lot of people.

320
03:01:22,824 --> 03:01:49,616
And this should have been done a long time ago. I believe Harvard Professor Timothy Leary, back in 1960, was experimented with lysergic acid, and this government should have been right on it, not to lock him up, but to look at the different parts of psilocybin, et cetera. I commend you, Counselor Pierce. Let's get it through, no matter what they say. Thank you.

321
03:01:52,142 --> 03:02:15,555
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti. I have a hand from Councilor Lemming. Thank you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward. So I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two...

322
03:02:16,425 --> 03:02:32,090
The advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot. There were two. There were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them.

323
03:02:32,722 --> 03:03:01,527
One group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use and it would be less regulated. The other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a,

324
03:03:02,073 --> 03:03:30,162
body, an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them. So it turns it into a for-profit, it turns it into a for-profit industry. So I will be supporting it. I think that any

325
03:03:30,384 --> 03:03:47,756
Any progress is good. Although I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago. So thank you once again for your efforts.

326
03:03:49,633 --> 03:04:14,343
Thank you, Councilor Lemming, President Burris. Thank you, thank you, Councilor Lemming. Yeah, and I completely agree. And I am hopeful that if this question passes, that the legislature may look to make some technical adjustments after passage as they did. I didn't agree with all of them on the cannabis law and some of the other ballot questions that have passed to address some of your concerns. Thank you. Thank you, President Burris.

327
03:04:14,872 --> 03:04:44,394
Seeing no further comments on the motion by President Behr, seconded by Councilor Seng to approve. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

328
03:04:46,681 --> 03:05:10,384
I'm sorry, I should have said something. I don't have enough information to support this tonight, so I'm going to vote no. Yes. Yes. Six in favor, one opposed. The motion passes.

329
03:05:26,357 --> 03:05:47,517
24446 offered by Mayor Berena Longo-Curran, Brooks PTO Food Truck. Request for a food truck permit for the Brooks School Fall Festival Bondi Food Truck. Any discussion or motions? Motion to approve. Motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

330
03:06:02,756 --> 03:06:21,800
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

331
03:06:22,381 --> 03:06:52,210
Social Services Coordinator. Dear President Beers and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve of the following amendment to the revised ordinances, Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formerly included as Article 2, Section 6631 to 6640, by adopting the following language, the language of Capital 11, which shall be amended to replace the title of Community Social Worker with the following title, quote, Social Services Coordinator. Upon review by the Health Department, Office of Outreach and Prevention, the term social worker is very specific,

332
03:06:52,210 --> 03:07:16,391
It may require the city to hire a licensed social worker, limiting the pool of applicants. Upon their assessing other municipalities in similar positions, several have social services or human service coordinators for this role and fit within the current cap range in Medford. The primary responsibility of this role is to connect residents to services. As the cap would remain the same, there is no change in compensation budget. Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor. Any questions, comments, or motions? Vice President Collins.

333
03:07:17,415 --> 03:07:44,872
On the motion to approve for first reading by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro. Unless, well, technically there was a motion to approve. Is there any objection to taking all three readings tonight, or would we like to do a first reading? No objection. No objections to moving through all readings this evening. All right, on the motion to approve for all three readings by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

334
03:08:00,469 --> 03:08:21,459
for proof of third reading. Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? No. Councilor San Buenaventura? Yes. President Pears? Yes.

335
03:08:21,886 --> 03:08:47,534
Public participation, to participate outside of Zoom, please email ahertovisa.menford-ma.gov. If you'd like to participate, please come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you. Name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes. Gaston Fury 61, Stigney Road. I just wanted to say that I'm appalled at the lack of definitive information that was given regarding the September 3rd

336
03:08:48,541 --> 03:09:14,275
state primary or state representative for the 35th Middlesex District. There's no Republican candidate. There's no libertarian candidate. There's only three candidates in the Democratic ballot. As such, the primary is the definitive election. And I would have hoped that this body would have stated that immediately and in a very definitive manner. Everyone should get out and vote.

337
03:09:14,735 --> 03:09:41,732
on the September 3rd primary, because that's going to determine the person that then goes into the general election. In the general election, there's only one person you can vote for. So the September 3rd state primary is the election that everyone should vote for. And then the other thing that I'm appalled that there wasn't more a definitive answer to is that I'm here at the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William and Frances Baldwin website. And I think it was Consuelo Escarpilla that brought up what happens

338
03:09:42,568 --> 03:09:48,200
if someone is registered as a Republican or a Libertarian and

339
03:09:48,780 --> 03:10:17,602
wants to go and vote in the September 3rd state primary. And I think they wouldn't be able to do so because you have to register it as a Democrat or an enrolled. And it says here, voting registration deadlines, the deadline to register to vote, update your registration, or change your party is 10 days before any election or town meeting. So if I go to my calendar, where is it? I think that puts it on the 24th, which is a Saturday.

340
03:10:17,602 --> 03:10:43,097
anyone that is registered as either a Republican or a Libertarian needs to change their party affiliation to either Democratic or unenrolled by Friday August 23rd according to what this website says because otherwise you're not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates and I would hope that you know this body would definitively state that because it's extremely important right so

341
03:10:43,097 --> 03:10:54,121
And I'm not sure that everyone understands that if they are registered as either Republican or Libertarian, that they know that they are not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates.

342
03:10:54,514 --> 03:11:23,370
So anyways, I just wanted to state that, you know, I'm appalled and disappointed to be honest, that I think, you know, I would have hoped that this information was clear and absolutely clear. And there's absolutely no doubt about that. Oh, would you like to say like two candidates go from September 13th? No, no, no, no. It's just one. That's it. That was corrected. Sorry? I did correct that. Yeah, I know, but it wasn't. And then about, again, what happens if someone is registered as a Republican or Libertarian? That wasn't clear.

343
03:11:23,729 --> 03:11:38,251
I think they need to change their party affiliation 10 days before any election. That's the registration deadline. Yes, that's right. That must be right. Otherwise they're not going to be able to vote. I appreciate you making the comment. As an elected body, we

344
03:11:39,377 --> 03:12:01,067
Once you start going down that road, you go into the road, not just of advising people how to access information, but suggesting a course of action. And I don't believe it is the, that any, you know, the city is, if you call the elections office and you say, how do I do this? They'll tell you how to do it, but they're not going to say everyone really should do this. And that's, that's gets to the point of influencing people toward the direction. It's different than providing information.

345
03:12:01,067 --> 03:12:15,435
No, but what direction? It's just that anyone that wants to vote, in order to vote in the primary, is going to have to be either registered... I agree. I'm talking about the other piece of it. Which one? A well-organized Republican write-in candidate could conceivably win the November general election.

346
03:12:15,998 --> 03:12:41,101
No. I'm just saying. I agree that on its face, it's not going to happen, right? But it's not the job. It's completely unbiased and not political. Like, anyone that their election to vote on is September 3, and in order to vote, you need to be able to do it as a democrat, you're on the road, which means that if you are a Democrat, you're on the road. But to say the election is this day, and what happens in November doesn't matter, that gets down the road of suggesting a course of action. OK. Thank you.

347
03:12:44,531 --> 03:13:04,053
Any further comment by members of the public in person at the podium or on Zoom? Just want to make sure, seeing no hands on Zoom, seeing no one at the podium, public participation is closed. Thank you. I would motion to take from the table and approve for third reading.

349
03:13:26,527 --> 03:13:52,483
In the past, I voted no. I think that the questions that were asked by those residents and were clear in those answers, and I shared those answers to those residents that reached out, and I'm in full support with the process as we speak, so thank you. Just to note, this is a motion to take from the table and approve, so we're technically not considering it.
