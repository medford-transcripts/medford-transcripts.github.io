249
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:26,992
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more about the voting locations.

250
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:35,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Henry, you and I worked a lot a few months ago on getting the Walking Court polling location open for our residents around there.

251
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I see on this form that we have Walking Court again.

252
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:43,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know if that's true for the November election?

253
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:45,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the same building as it usually is?

254
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: For the entire year, we probably will have to

255
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:55,678
[SPEAKER_02]: find another location in 2025, but we got lucky since February, we have it September and November.

256
01:13:55,838 --> 01:13:56,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

257
01:13:56,278 --> 01:14:00,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy that our hard work is continuing to work out there.

258
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: When we work together, we produce things.

259
01:14:03,362 --> 01:14:04,023
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so true.

260
01:14:05,543 --> 01:14:05,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

261
01:14:05,924 --> 01:14:09,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am talking to Director Driscoll about some stuff around that too.

262
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll inform the council if it becomes relevant.

263
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:15,365
[SPEAKER_11]: and the president as well.

264
01:14:15,445 --> 01:14:16,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

265
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:28,088
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that you've worked very hard on this, but a lot of people have still reached out saying they just don't know, since we've moved some places around, they were curious how they can really know where they're supposed to vote.

266
01:14:28,628 --> 01:14:37,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a number or an office that I can direct them to and that we can maybe send something out publicly?

267
01:14:38,629 --> 01:14:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's much changes as far as election is concerned in Medford.

268
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,618
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been voting at the same location.

269
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:55,722
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time we've seen a change was when we come up with what

270
01:14:57,343 --> 01:15:00,904
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 to 8, and 7 to 8.

271
01:15:01,725 --> 01:15:03,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the people get displaced.

272
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's been about something like three cycle of election.

273
01:15:06,986 --> 01:15:07,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have it.

274
01:15:07,967 --> 01:15:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, one of the thing we're working with the communication director is to send a message to the community telling them where to vote.

275
01:15:19,351 --> 01:15:22,492
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of it, if they have an issue, call the election department.

276
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:37,760
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great idea if we can get like a robocall to those residents to say, don't forget your new location or there's a lot of people it's funny because conversations that we have a big state state representative Donato has a big.

277
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,423
[SPEAKER_14]: big race coming up in September, September 3rd.

278
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:47,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race.

279
01:15:47,429 --> 01:15:50,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where the questions arose.

280
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:53,135
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate that, if we can get that word out.

281
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,256
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the other thing was,

282
01:15:55,441 --> 01:16:01,202
[SPEAKER_14]: that with that race, is it district, Middlesex District?

283
01:16:01,222 --> 01:16:01,202
35.

284
01:16:01,883 --> 01:16:04,203
[SPEAKER_14]: 35, what is it?

285
01:16:05,223 --> 01:16:11,365
[SPEAKER_14]: We really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election.

286
01:16:12,185 --> 01:16:16,666
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct?

287
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:17,186
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be.

288
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:22,367
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the one, two of the chair, the one in September is a state primary.

289
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: State primary.

290
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,111
[SPEAKER_02]: see you referring to the 35th.

291
01:16:29,411 --> 01:16:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: The other six, there's three people on the ballot.

292
01:16:33,053 --> 01:16:35,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be reduced to two.

293
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:38,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two will be in November for general election.

294
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:40,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So the two will go in November.

295
01:16:40,695 --> 01:16:43,256
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, that's confusing, because now we were told that

296
01:16:44,036 --> 01:16:57,792
[SPEAKER_11]: the three candidates running on the democratic ticket that the winner that comes out of that race is the winner there's a partisan primary and there's a partisan primary there's a democratic primary there's three candidates yeah yeah

297
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:14,438
[SPEAKER_02]: you have that's what you have the first one because what it is you can only have at the general two people well that's that's for municipal henry um in this in this case it'll be one it will be that one will be the only person just like you see for

298
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:15,459
[SPEAKER_02]: 23rd.

299
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:23,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we have a guy who's not on the post, only his name, but he's still sure on the primary.

300
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:24,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, right.

301
01:17:24,465 --> 01:17:32,131
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I understand that, but I think people, people think that let's, let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November.

302
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:33,992
[SPEAKER_14]: In November, there'll be no race.

303
01:17:34,012 --> 01:17:37,895
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll just be the, there'll be the candidate that came out of the primary.

304
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:50,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should generally avoid going down this road, but yes, there will be one candidate on the ballot in November for the Democratic Party, and there's no candidate running, I believe, for the Republican nomination.

305
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the confusion is, because if they're the same party,

306
01:17:57,282 --> 01:17:59,425
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever wins is the one that move forward.

307
01:18:00,245 --> 01:18:11,678
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no Republican

308
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,581
[SPEAKER_14]: party running in this race.

309
01:18:15,122 --> 01:18:20,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative.

310
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw.

311
01:18:24,812 --> 01:18:35,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration

312
01:18:36,684 --> 01:18:46,267
[SPEAKER_14]: share a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected, that they understand that November is really just ceremonial.

313
01:18:46,387 --> 01:18:51,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the actual election for that race is the third of September.

314
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:54,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

315
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:56,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that we can

316
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:19,051
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do a B paper to communicate to the public that there's an election coming up and that they can contact the elections department, 781-393-2491, or they can go online wheredoivotema.com to find out who their representative, what is district they're in, their polling location.

317
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:28,105
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed.

318
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:29,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's not very political.

319
01:19:30,006 --> 01:19:33,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, well, it's for all three candidates.

320
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:34,109
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not political.

321
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:42,214
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates that you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates.

322
01:19:42,614 --> 01:19:46,657
[SPEAKER_14]: And they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November.

323
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:50,620
[SPEAKER_14]: But the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes we just saw.

324
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:56,104
[SPEAKER_14]: that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat.

325
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:59,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other.

326
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:09,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect and the effort by this body to ask if we can do that.

327
01:20:09,857 --> 01:20:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, be very simple and say,

328
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:28,620
[SPEAKER_14]: let's make weapons city solicitor let's let's do that let's send it off as a b paper and we'll we'll get to that when we can but having it stop right now i think it's it's it's not it's not right it's not right all right uh that's fine i'm just what's the text of the b paper

329
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:43,606
[SPEAKER_14]: We would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, I'm sorry, District 30.

330
01:20:43,646 --> 01:20:44,826
[SPEAKER_14]: The 35th Middlesex.

331
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:47,888
[SPEAKER_14]: the state representative.

332
01:20:47,908 --> 01:21:04,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position.

333
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense, Mr. Clerk?

334
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:09,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes.

335
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:27,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read this back, Councilor Scarpelli, because I'm still, I still need to know.

336
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:29,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, I know, go ahead.

337
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:38,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The fee paper is to ask the elections department and the mayor's office to do a robo-call and whatever other means possible regarding the 35th Middlesex.

338
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:40,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Quiet, please, I'm sorry, I can't hear.

339
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:50,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Regarding the possible 35th Middlesex district to educate these voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that election.

340
01:21:52,751 --> 01:21:59,057
[SPEAKER_14]: the September 3rd race, the September primary being the, right, yes, good, thank you.

341
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:01,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

342
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:04,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

343
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:06,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Rivers.

344
01:22:07,608 --> 01:22:22,358
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, as a similar alternative you know I think I know the Election Commission is working part pretty much year round to publicize upcoming elections and, you know, not just make sure that people know the dates on the calendars and where to go but to do things like motor drives, you know if I would offer at the point

345
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:30,345
[SPEAKER_22]: asking the Elections Commission to add another layer to redouble their existing efforts to make sure that people know when to get out and vote.

346
01:22:30,465 --> 01:22:41,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I would say, you know, there's there's a primary on September 3rd, not just in the 35 Middlesex, you know, it asked me, but we can just extend that to incorporate all voters within the city of Medford.

347
01:22:41,514 --> 01:22:42,155
[SPEAKER_22]: I think everybody

348
01:22:44,176 --> 01:22:47,458
[SPEAKER_22]: more people, you know, that we would think can always use a reminder about when to vote.

349
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:52,379
[SPEAKER_22]: And that goes for everybody within the city for September 3rd, as well as for the November election this year.

350
01:22:52,399 --> 01:23:01,123
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd offer as an alternative, you know, I would certainly support any efforts to make sure that people know and have that date circled on their calendar and, you know, not just one district, but citywide.

351
01:23:01,963 --> 01:23:12,607
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we could, if you consider an amendment to have that just be a citywide effort at the point that we're going through the effort of a robocall at all, I'm sure that many voters across the community would benefit from it.

352
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:28,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins, if I could, just for our clarity, you requested to amend the paper that this be a citywide robocall to remind, and other outreach to remind people of where to vote when the election is occurring?

353
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,231
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, for the September 3rd primary.

354
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:31,872
[SPEAKER_11]: For the September 3rd state primary.

355
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:34,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Through the chair.

356
01:23:34,154 --> 01:23:35,294
[SPEAKER_11]: One second, Henry.

357
01:23:35,895 --> 01:23:36,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

358
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:38,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just gonna ask, is that an amendment or a B paper?

359
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:40,217
[SPEAKER_11]: This is already a B paper.

360
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:41,198
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an amendment to the B paper.

361
01:23:41,278 --> 01:23:42,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Amendment to, okay.

362
01:23:42,219 --> 01:23:42,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

363
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:47,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked prior to September 3rd.

364
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:54,025
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to realize that we have the early voting that takes place from the 24th to the 30th.

365
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:56,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is coming out.

366
01:23:56,446 --> 01:24:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not listed on any of the papers in front of you.

367
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:03,248
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we also have

368
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:07,002
[SPEAKER_02]: listed last day to register.

369
01:24:07,522 --> 01:24:13,265
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't register on time, you cannot vote on state primaries on the 3rd.

370
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:14,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that coming.

371
01:24:15,266 --> 01:24:20,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the paper in front of you, because this is not what we're here for tonight.

372
01:24:20,228 --> 01:24:26,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the last day to request a vote by mail ballot.

373
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:30,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So all this information coming down the pipe

374
01:24:31,687 --> 01:24:36,008
[SPEAKER_02]: to inform citizens of the city when they can vote prior to September 3rd.

375
01:24:36,568 --> 01:24:37,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

376
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And on September 3rd.

377
01:24:38,329 --> 01:24:46,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and if folks contact the Elections Department, they can find out more about the early voting at City Hall, as well as the mail-out balloting in addition to voting on Election Day.

378
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:47,111
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

379
01:24:47,151 --> 01:24:47,811
[SPEAKER_11]: September 3rd.

380
01:24:48,091 --> 01:24:48,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

381
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:48,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

382
01:24:49,012 --> 01:24:56,854
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can, Mr. President, another point with that, if I'm right, if I'm correct or wrong, I know that if there isn't a Republican candidate that

383
01:24:58,205 --> 01:25:07,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I, a registered Republican can't, what is it, they report to the elections office to ask to, is it unenrolled so they can vote in that election?

384
01:25:08,342 --> 01:25:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that possible?

385
01:25:12,303 --> 01:25:18,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Unenrolled have the ability to choose a time of voting which party to vote for.

386
01:25:18,705 --> 01:25:19,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only one.

387
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:22,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not affiliated.

388
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:23,007
[SPEAKER_02]: They can come.

389
01:25:23,547 --> 01:25:27,708
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're voting for three parties, they can say, who are you voting for?

390
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you want to vote today?

391
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:32,650
[SPEAKER_14]: You say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat.

392
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:35,751
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's important that people that don't have a candidate

393
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:47,920
[SPEAKER_14]: in this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat?

394
01:25:50,222 --> 01:25:51,503
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a technical question.

395
01:25:51,883 --> 01:25:53,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so that's something if we can ask you.

396
01:25:53,465 --> 01:25:54,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I can explore.

397
01:25:54,746 --> 01:25:58,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a question that was brought up to us by... I'll get back to you on that one.

398
01:25:58,188 --> 01:26:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna give you the wrong answer because once you... You have a window.

399
01:26:03,753 --> 01:26:03,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

400
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: If the window to UN enroll, you can come tomorrow and say, well, I want to change to this body.

401
01:26:12,624 --> 01:26:13,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done.

402
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:16,166
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not violent.

403
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:17,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

404
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:19,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

405
01:26:19,347 --> 01:26:21,448
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor as amended.

406
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:24,990
[SPEAKER_11]: If the amendment is accepted, I believe it now reads.

407
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:26,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you read it back, Mr. Clerk?

408
01:26:29,537 --> 01:26:43,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President Collins has asked for a date certain citywide robocall and other outreach to remind voters where to vote for the September 3rd primary election.

409
01:26:44,684 --> 01:26:46,505
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so then that's the amendment.

410
01:26:46,525 --> 01:26:48,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you accept the amendment?

411
01:26:48,486 --> 01:26:50,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's good.

412
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:58,330
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so on the motion, the B paper is to request citywide robocall to remind everyone where and how to vote in the September 3rd primary.

413
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

01:28:03,761 --> 01:28:03,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

437
01:28:04,402 --> 01:28:05,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

438
01:28:05,483 --> 01:28:05,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

439
01:28:06,204 --> 01:28:06,805

01:28:07,525 --> 01:28:07,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

442
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:10,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

443
01:28:10,529 --> 01:28:11,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sanchez?

444
01:28:11,309 --> 01:28:11,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,330
[SPEAKER_07]: President Bears?

446
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:12,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

447
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:15,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Senator Fevella, and then negative motion passes.

457
01:29:13,332 --> 01:29:15,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You already read all the location.

458
01:29:15,213 --> 01:29:19,776
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing we're seeking here is to have this warrant legally.

459
01:29:20,697 --> 01:29:24,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeking signature of the council members.

460
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:28,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody have to sign it, but we have a deadline to get it done.

461
01:29:29,404 --> 01:29:32,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason we're in front of you today, so we can meet our deadline.

462
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:35,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a copy that you want us to sign?

463
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:37,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you come behind the rail and have us sign it?

464
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:42,374
[SPEAKER_11]: We're down Larry today, so he would do that, but thank you, Aaron.

465
01:29:46,076 --> 01:29:47,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we do have councilor Leming remotely.

466
01:29:48,519 --> 01:30:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do we just, if he's here in the state, just like I did last year, but if you're six of us, it's fine.

467
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:00,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I get six.

468
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:04,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go with it, but if I get seven, all right, thank you.

469
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:18,485
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, on the motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Council Vice President, was that you Councilor Lazzaro?

470
01:30:18,745 --> 01:30:22,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Council Vice President Collins to accept the warrant and introduce signatures.

471
01:30:23,647 --> 01:30:24,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

472
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:33,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan?

473
01:30:33,252 --> 01:30:33,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

474
01:30:34,093 --> 01:30:34,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

475
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:34,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

476
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:36,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

477
01:30:38,195 --> 01:30:38,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

478
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:39,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming?

479
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:40,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

480
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sanchez, President Beresford.

481
01:30:45,645 --> 01:30:48,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

482
01:30:48,627 --> 01:30:55,173
[SPEAKER_11]: 24449 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, and if I may request a motion to join, I have a similar resolution.

483
01:30:56,574 --> 01:30:57,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

484
01:30:57,855 --> 01:31:00,178
[SPEAKER_11]: 24449 be it resolved.

485
01:31:01,799 --> 01:31:02,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Aaron.

486
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,042
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a thinner paper than I was expecting.

487
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:11,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

488
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:12,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, guys.

489
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:18,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss continued concerns dealing with rodent infestation in our community.

490
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:27,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it further resolved that we request a meeting with the Health Department and City Administration to schedule a strategic planning meeting dealing with a serious health concern across the City of Medford.

491
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:42,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also have, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Health Department undertake additional efforts in partnership with Tufts Medicine and the City of Malden to provide significant additional rodent control to mitigate the impact of construction at the former Malden Hospital site on the neighboring community.

492
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:43,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpa.

493
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:45,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

494
01:31:46,651 --> 01:32:07,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for road infestation, considering we live in a ledge, and you don't have, you know,

495
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,141
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents.

496
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:26,964
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to stymie the rodent infestation issues.

497
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:32,025
[SPEAKER_14]: We've even moved to put in ordinances that allow

498
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:36,753
[SPEAKER_14]: allow us to go on to private property.

499
01:32:36,793 --> 01:32:40,877
[SPEAKER_14]: If we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more.

500
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:43,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that I've had a few phone calls.

501
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:54,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that the curbside composting is a great initiative, but you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom.

502
01:32:54,951 --> 01:32:55,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um,

503
01:32:56,352 --> 01:33:02,133
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth.

504
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:22,398
[SPEAKER_14]: You see neighbor communities put together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or

505
01:33:23,138 --> 01:33:24,739
[SPEAKER_14]: or slow this process down.

506
01:33:24,759 --> 01:33:41,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that my motion would be, Mr. President, is that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force.

507
01:33:41,586 --> 01:33:44,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Boston's calling it the rodent czar.

508
01:33:45,847 --> 01:33:58,194
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that Metro has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community.

509
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:06,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that what we're seeing is the different

510
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:11,333
[SPEAKER_14]: different forms of control.

511
01:34:11,493 --> 01:34:18,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce.

512
01:34:20,139 --> 01:34:29,285
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce.

513
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:34,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department,

514
01:34:35,256 --> 01:34:46,112
[SPEAKER_14]: which, by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator, come out to put bait boxes down and leave.

515
01:34:46,873 --> 01:34:47,614
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not working.

516
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So my recommendation is that we move forward.

517
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:50,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that

518
01:34:50,959 --> 01:35:00,822
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area.

519
01:35:01,242 --> 01:35:13,286
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse.

520
01:35:13,926 --> 01:35:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

521
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:16,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

522
01:35:16,067 --> 01:35:16,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins.

523
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:25,997
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli as well as President Bears for bringing this forward and for being so responsive to, you know, really just the latest wave of resident outreach about this.

524
01:35:26,017 --> 01:35:31,025
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think Councilor Scarpelli is exactly right, you know, I think that the city has been

525
01:35:32,652 --> 01:35:46,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Working hard with the available tools to try to stem the tide of increasing rat populations over the past several years, but it's always seemed to me that our approach is, you know, fundamentally reactive and everybody can everybody can see with their eyes, you know that that isn't doing enough.

526
01:35:48,937 --> 01:35:59,703
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that the idea of a task force is potentially a great idea because there have been so many disparate approaches either tried already in the city or things that have been floated.

527
01:36:00,123 --> 01:36:08,227
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it'd be great to collect some of the topics of discussion from the Solid Waste Task Force, which I was a member of a couple of years ago talking about.

528
01:36:08,607 --> 01:36:21,394
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, how can we make sure that our evolving trash and compost receptacles are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, which is something that they are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, but it's important to share that information with the community whenever we can.

529
01:36:21,414 --> 01:36:27,638
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that there's a lot of pioneering rodent innovations going on in neighboring cities that

530
01:36:28,438 --> 01:36:30,019
[SPEAKER_22]: hear about time to time from residents.

531
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:40,526
[SPEAKER_22]: One, because they seem more effective than just sending somebody out when we get that latest call about where it's getting especially bad, and because we do want to mitigate the effects on other members of the ecosystem.

532
01:36:40,686 --> 01:36:48,091
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that we're all aware that just putting out a lot of rat poison is really harmful to the other animals that we do treasure in Medford.

533
01:36:49,472 --> 01:36:54,856
[SPEAKER_22]: So everything takes resources, investing in the right tools and the right systems to really attack this.

534
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:01,384
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not going to get better without these major institutions pitching in to help us have a more systemic approach.

535
01:37:01,445 --> 01:37:03,768
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would absolutely support this.

536
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:06,032
[SPEAKER_22]: I thank my fellow councilors for bringing it forward.

537
01:37:07,715 --> 01:37:08,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

538
01:37:08,516 --> 01:37:09,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

539
01:37:10,011 --> 01:37:10,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

540
01:37:11,132 --> 01:37:17,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to thank both Councilor Scarpelli and President Beres for the resolutions on this.

541
01:37:17,936 --> 01:37:23,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all know that this is a really important issue for public health, for quality of living here in Medford.

542
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:28,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, as Councilor Scarpelli said, it's not just Fulton Heights.

543
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: but this happening in Fulton Heights is particularly concerning because it's not the place that's used to this.

544
01:37:36,286 --> 01:37:43,108
[SPEAKER_04]: South Medford and Wellington have been particularly hit hard by the rodent infestation over the last few years.

545
01:37:43,768 --> 01:37:50,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Anecdotally, talking to neighbors, some of the methods we have employed seem to have been working.

546
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:54,572
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a slight decrease anecdotally talking to my neighbors about this.

547
01:37:55,592 --> 01:37:57,593
[SPEAKER_04]: However, rodents are still there.

548
01:37:58,413 --> 01:38:13,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really important to note that we did hold a Committee of the Whole on this a few months ago, where we had a long conversation with the Director of the Board of Health about methods that we could employ to combat this.

549
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,401
[SPEAKER_04]: this problem.

550
01:38:15,882 --> 01:38:22,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Councilor Collins has alluded to the public education piece, which really has to be a very, very big part of it.

551
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,190
[SPEAKER_04]: That message was reinforced over and over again at that meeting.

552
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be lovely to get this resolution passed, to sit down with the Director of the Board of Health and other stakeholders to get an update on those strategies, to see how we're doing,

553
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:43,022
[SPEAKER_04]: are there, what are the metrics that we're using to measure and how are we doing on those metrics?

554
01:38:43,622 --> 01:38:47,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also really important to note that the council has been working really hard on this.

555
01:38:48,264 --> 01:38:57,409
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a resolution coming to our, an ordinance coming to our next meeting about wildlife feeding, reduce, basically

556
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,693
[SPEAKER_04]: regulating that so that we're discouraging rodent behavior.

557
01:39:04,095 --> 01:39:14,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Past councils have also passed ordinances tackling rodent infestations as well, which city staff have reported back with metrics showing that they have been useful.

558
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:16,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

559
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:17,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comment by members of the council?

560
01:39:19,402 --> 01:39:21,104
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go and then we can go to members of the public.

561
01:39:21,645 --> 01:39:30,936
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to note specifically around the Malden Hospital site, I want to thank David Tedisco who sent around a number of emails, has been organizing his neighborhood.

562
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:34,699
[SPEAKER_11]: the city of bedford and the city of malden.

563
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:45,806
[SPEAKER_11]: tufts medicine at the malden hospital site is responsible for rodent mitigation and it is on malden land and so they have been very responsive.

564
01:39:45,866 --> 01:39:48,428
[SPEAKER_11]: tufts medicine has made it clear they know they need to do more.

565
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:55,252
[SPEAKER_11]: mayor christianson as well and also director o'connor and mayor longo current have been involved in some of those discussions as well to

566
01:39:55,612 --> 01:39:58,215
[SPEAKER_11]: to bring whatever resources we can to bear from the medford side.

567
01:39:59,376 --> 01:40:02,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for noting the rodent control ordinance that we passed.

568
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:11,729
[SPEAKER_11]: The solid waste ordinance which really is going to help focus on reducing rodent populations in the commercial areas with the combined

569
01:40:14,192 --> 01:40:34,440
[SPEAKER_11]: dumpster, for lack of a better word, in the private hauler program, which should really significantly improve both the efficiency and the requirements on the business districts and the businesses in those districts to keep their trash and waste away from rodents and to also centralize removal of it, which hopefully will help on a cost basis.

570
01:40:35,181 --> 01:40:38,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the point is really well taken around funding and staff.

571
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:40,283
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard time and time again from our animal control

572
01:40:40,723 --> 01:40:42,643
[SPEAKER_11]: that we have been working on for a long time.

573
01:40:42,683 --> 01:40:44,104
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

574
01:40:44,144 --> 01:40:45,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

575
01:40:45,784 --> 01:40:47,064
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

576
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:49,085
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

577
01:40:49,105 --> 01:40:50,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

578
01:40:50,905 --> 01:40:52,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

579
01:40:52,525 --> 01:40:54,886
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

580
01:40:54,906 --> 01:40:57,006
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

581
01:40:57,046 --> 01:40:58,527
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

582
01:40:58,567 --> 01:40:59,907
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

583
01:40:59,927 --> 01:41:01,767
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

584
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:04,588
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

585
01:41:04,608 --> 01:41:06,128
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

586
01:41:06,148 --> 01:41:07,428
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

587
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:09,209
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been working on this for a long time.

588
01:41:10,149 --> 01:41:16,891
[SPEAKER_11]: road and control right now, even though everyone in the city and everyone in this room acknowledges that we need to be spending significantly more on that.

589
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:20,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do the best with what we have.

590
01:41:20,253 --> 01:41:26,715
[SPEAKER_11]: What we have is too little and we need more funding for the city to effectively provide services such as road and control.

591
01:41:27,275 --> 01:41:30,976
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, I will go to the podium and name and address for the record, please.

592
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:32,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have three minutes.

593
01:41:34,853 --> 01:41:37,977
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Paulette Bartabedian, 27th Central Ave., Medford, Mass.

594
01:41:38,277 --> 01:41:49,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Just want to commend Vice President Collins on bringing up the environmental impact of the road in control, and I know that it's a huge problem everywhere, and I'm not

595
01:41:51,192 --> 01:41:52,693
[SPEAKER_18]: dismissing that.

596
01:41:53,113 --> 01:42:02,796
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do hope that we as a city will look to other alternatives, other than rodenticides, which are the worst, worst thing.

597
01:42:03,156 --> 01:42:15,221
[SPEAKER_18]: It actually is counterproductive to rodent control because many of the wildlife and wild birds that use rats, mice, things like that, as their meals are getting killed,

598
01:42:16,192 --> 01:42:18,413
[SPEAKER_18]: due to secondary rodenticide poisoning.

599
01:42:18,913 --> 01:42:24,116
[SPEAKER_18]: It also affects foxes, coyotes, other things that will feed on rodents.

600
01:42:24,176 --> 01:42:25,637
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really counterproductive.

601
01:42:25,957 --> 01:42:28,378
[SPEAKER_18]: You're killing the things that will kill the rats.

602
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:35,222
[SPEAKER_18]: I did read that there is some population control drugs they're trying to use.

603
01:42:35,462 --> 01:42:41,605
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just read that it's a fairly new process, I believe, that some of the,

604
01:42:42,947 --> 01:42:46,792
[SPEAKER_18]: participants are saying that they're seeing more rats now than ever.

605
01:42:48,034 --> 01:42:52,239
[SPEAKER_18]: That just may be a small percentage that we're seeing.

606
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:53,942
[SPEAKER_18]: It may not be the whole picture as of yet.

607
01:42:54,362 --> 01:42:57,226
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, it's a multifaceted problem.

608
01:42:58,027 --> 01:43:08,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Education, as counselor Heng said, is I think the most important thing is to have people, businesses, et cetera, take care of their garbage.

609
01:43:08,254 --> 01:43:09,435
[SPEAKER_18]: No food, no rats.

610
01:43:09,956 --> 01:43:11,096
[SPEAKER_18]: No food, no coyotes.

611
01:43:11,397 --> 01:43:12,818
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just common sense.

612
01:43:13,138 --> 01:43:19,883
[SPEAKER_18]: So please as a whole, please try to avoid using rodenticides foremost amongst everything.

613
01:43:19,923 --> 01:43:21,004
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you very much.

614
01:43:21,104 --> 01:43:21,344
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

615
01:43:21,991 --> 01:43:35,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you and I just wanted to note on that point, the new solid waste contract and the solid waste councils are can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the new solid waste contract, because of how we can structured it with the State Department of Environmental Protection.

616
01:43:36,326 --> 01:43:43,514
[SPEAKER_11]: We are receiving some funds specifically around an educational program around the solid waste so there should be more information going out to residents.

617
01:43:43,954 --> 01:43:45,075
[SPEAKER_11]: through that education program.

618
01:43:45,095 --> 01:43:53,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that is just limited to the trash, the recycling, the composting, um, funding for other stuff like the wildlife feeding, et cetera, would have to come from somewhere else.

619
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

620
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:56,802
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

621
01:43:57,342 --> 01:43:59,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn street.

622
01:43:59,723 --> 01:44:07,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I live in the Hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer.

623
01:44:08,323 --> 01:44:14,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive.

624
01:44:15,285 --> 01:44:17,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I think accountability has to come in play.

625
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground.

626
01:44:25,808 --> 01:44:29,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So people think, and they live near food sources.

627
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:33,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water.

628
01:44:34,051 --> 01:44:36,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're gonna live near those things.

629
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:50,664
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way?

630
01:44:51,145 --> 01:45:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist Fire Station, have a meeting there, go to the community and educate them in that way.

631
01:45:02,412 --> 01:45:05,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be hands-on, and if you really

632
01:45:06,034 --> 01:45:10,600
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns.

633
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:21,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online, and you really see the people that you are representing.

634
01:45:21,997 --> 01:45:27,139
[SPEAKER_01]: face-to-face in that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together.

635
01:45:27,219 --> 01:45:33,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property.

636
01:45:33,662 --> 01:45:36,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents.

637
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:44,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself.

638
01:45:45,407 --> 01:45:48,088
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're elderly, get some help, right?

639
01:45:48,953 --> 01:45:52,455
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats.

640
01:45:52,795 --> 01:45:53,416
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.

641
01:45:53,676 --> 01:45:54,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community piece.

642
01:45:54,997 --> 01:46:00,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece is, Walkling Court is scheduled for demolition.

643
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:09,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a plan in place for the hillside area on rodents?

644
01:46:09,325 --> 01:46:10,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of that?

645
01:46:10,726 --> 01:46:12,647
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money is allocated to that?

646
01:46:13,148 --> 01:46:13,928
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing?

647
01:46:13,988 --> 01:46:14,849
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we pre-planning?

648
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:18,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that.

649
01:46:19,511 --> 01:46:27,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they'll reach out to the media community about like 400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area?

650
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:33,081
[SPEAKER_01]: We need notification and we need notification about how, what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens.

651
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:45,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everybody who's talking about it, I'm worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and I read this big, walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon.

652
01:46:46,414 --> 01:46:49,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out.

653
01:46:50,295 --> 01:46:54,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty bad when it's still sunny and they're walking in front of me.

654
01:46:54,617 --> 01:47:00,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed and I'm

655
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:05,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

656
01:47:06,372 --> 01:47:07,092
[SPEAKER_01]: My time must be up.

657
01:47:07,513 --> 01:47:09,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, I didn't realize it was going to play you off like that.

658
01:47:13,534 --> 01:47:15,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Zoom's getting a little snotty.

659
01:47:17,895 --> 01:47:22,817
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Walking Court thing, there is a past mitigation plan that is part of the Walking Court project.

660
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:27,278
[SPEAKER_11]: The road and control ordinance that we passed, as well as some of the building code stuff that we've done,

661
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:34,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe zoning requires all major project construction to have integrated pest management plans as part of the ordinance.

662
01:47:35,001 --> 01:47:37,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And Director O'Connor can talk more about that.

663
01:47:37,722 --> 01:47:40,144
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be on file with the Board of Health in her office.

664
01:47:40,804 --> 01:47:46,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I can also talk to Director Driscoll about trying to communicate out better that there is a plan to the residents.

665
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:46,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

666
01:47:46,646 --> 01:47:47,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.

667
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:47,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

668
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:54,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Kurt, please, you have three minutes, and I'm gonna try to shut off that noise.

669
01:47:54,723 --> 01:47:55,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the time.

670
01:47:55,464 --> 01:47:56,525
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Galvin Murphy.

671
01:47:56,545 --> 01:47:57,986
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually a Malden resident.

672
01:47:58,147 --> 01:48:01,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here because I'm a contractor for the city of Medford with the Iraq problem.

673
01:48:02,631 --> 01:48:05,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the guy that the health department calls when there's an issue in the neighborhood.

674
01:48:06,095 --> 01:48:12,342
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw this on the agenda, and I thought maybe I could pop in tonight and take a beating like a man if it's necessary.

675
01:48:15,137 --> 01:48:25,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to let you know that next week, the Women and Pest Management Association is putting on a training program for health inspectors, and the city of Medford's sending three people to that training program.

676
01:48:26,462 --> 01:48:36,767
[SPEAKER_15]: I know when they go through their sanitation training, they do not get any specific rodent control or rodent identification training, so we're gonna try and correct that issue.

677
01:48:37,367 --> 01:48:42,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have seats available, although very few, if any city councilors wanna come over

678
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:45,712
[SPEAKER_15]: see what rats look like up close and personal.

679
01:48:46,252 --> 01:48:48,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So I open that invitation up to each of you.

680
01:48:49,074 --> 01:48:51,896
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to come, please just give me a call and I'll make a seat for you.

681
01:48:52,817 --> 01:48:54,418
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as what's going on in the city,

682
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:56,147
[SPEAKER_15]: with rats.

683
01:48:57,988 --> 01:49:08,316
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a prediction two years ago at the National Pest Management Association Conference, it happened to be in Boston, and I was up speaking, and I do speak at different national level programs.

684
01:49:08,816 --> 01:49:16,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a prediction, and nobody's gonna like this prediction, that within the next five to 10 years, rats are gonna become as common as squirrels and we're gonna accept them.

685
01:49:17,703 --> 01:49:24,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't see us changing our habits as people that's gonna bring these rats under control.

686
01:49:25,129 --> 01:49:27,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Last woman said walking down the street, there's rats in front of her.

687
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:29,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going to pretty much stay that way.

688
01:49:30,411 --> 01:49:31,932
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a rodent problem.

689
01:49:32,152 --> 01:49:33,312
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a people problem.

690
01:49:33,953 --> 01:49:35,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I see it in this very city.

691
01:49:35,293 --> 01:49:43,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I see it in every community in eastern Massachusetts that I walk in on a regular basis, that I walk into people's backyards and the garbage and the trash is just piled up.

692
01:49:44,707 --> 01:49:46,289
[SPEAKER_15]: and you can't get people to clean it up.

693
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:55,119
[SPEAKER_15]: The conducive conditions are there, and I'm sure each of you have heard enough about this, and how do we get people to respond to that?

694
01:49:55,660 --> 01:50:01,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I watch our health inspectors go out there, and they work tirelessly to try and correct these issues.

695
01:50:01,767 --> 01:50:04,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see them just get pushed back by people constantly.

696
01:50:04,829 --> 01:50:06,069
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working on, I'm doing this.

697
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:17,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I know one site that I've been at for the last two years, and your health inspectors try and be cooperative and work with people and educate, and we're still dealing with rats at the same house.

698
01:50:17,695 --> 01:50:19,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just not getting corrected.

699
01:50:20,116 --> 01:50:24,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Other neighborhoods we go into and people work with your health inspectors and they work with us because

700
01:50:25,492 --> 01:50:32,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Your health department will pay me to go on their property and dispatch the animals using carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide directly right into the burrows.

701
01:50:33,574 --> 01:50:34,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And it works great.

702
01:50:34,835 --> 01:50:37,456
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we can get in there and they're going to correct their issues, we're going to do that.

703
01:50:37,596 --> 01:50:39,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen some neighborhoods really change.

704
01:50:40,376 --> 01:50:44,878
[SPEAKER_15]: In other neighborhoods where we just have one person pushing back, it's just a constant pressure.

705
01:50:45,478 --> 01:50:49,203
[SPEAKER_15]: But the reason I came up was to invite anybody would like to attend that meeting next week.

706
01:50:49,244 --> 01:50:49,884
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Wednesday.

707
01:50:49,904 --> 01:50:53,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I know everybody has real jobs and it's hard to do that.

708
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:54,311
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a daytime thing.

709
01:50:54,711 --> 01:51:01,581
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to try and make it, let me know and just let you know, you know, you have three people coming to it and hopefully they're going to come out with some new ideas of what to do.

710
01:51:02,302 --> 01:51:03,162
[SPEAKER_15]: What time on Wednesday?

711
01:51:03,542 --> 01:51:04,763
[SPEAKER_15]: It starts at 9 a.m.

712
01:51:04,923 --> 01:51:08,643
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in my office to get done about one o'clock in the afternoon.

713
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:14,065
[SPEAKER_11]: If you leave, I would ask you, Larry, if you leave your phone number with Emily, we can pass it around to the council.

714
01:51:15,265 --> 01:51:17,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to thank you for coming down and sharing that information with us.

715
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:22,666
[SPEAKER_11]: We do hear great things about folks who work with you when the city refers you out.

716
01:51:23,246 --> 01:51:26,667
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's really helpful and sobering for us to hear what you're saying.

717
01:51:27,527 --> 01:51:29,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the experience that we've had issues.

718
01:51:29,628 --> 01:51:30,288
[SPEAKER_11]: We had some folks

719
01:51:31,633 --> 01:51:55,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, six months ago, maybe eight months ago, from the Hillside neighborhood on the other side from here and up by like Osgoode Street, talking about a couple of problem properties where we were trying to get code enforcement out there to address overgrowth and waste, and the city not having, essentially the private owners just being able to continue to get away with it to the public detriment.

720
01:51:57,324 --> 01:51:59,326
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, it is a really important issue.

721
01:51:59,346 --> 01:52:02,270
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do have a question from Councilor Callahan, if you don't mind.

722
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:02,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, ma'am.

723
01:52:03,471 --> 01:52:04,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks so much for coming.

724
01:52:04,292 --> 01:52:05,674
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great to have you here.

725
01:52:05,734 --> 01:52:14,644
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to see if you had any opinion on the topic that one of the previous speakers mentioned about poison versus population control.

726
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:16,016
[SPEAKER_15]: about the what?

727
01:52:16,277 --> 01:52:18,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Poison versus population control.

728
01:52:18,778 --> 01:52:20,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Poison versus population control.

729
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure I'm going to say the question.

730
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:24,142
[SPEAKER_15]: The question is birth control?

731
01:52:24,602 --> 01:52:25,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, exactly.

732
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Poison versus birth control.

733
01:52:27,144 --> 01:52:30,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, it depends upon the type of poison that you're talking about.

734
01:52:30,687 --> 01:52:31,667
[SPEAKER_15]: And birth control

735
01:52:32,881 --> 01:52:34,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Hasn't proven itself yet.

736
01:52:34,983 --> 01:52:36,344
[SPEAKER_15]: We had it years ago.

737
01:52:36,884 --> 01:52:38,826
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried it and it blew up in our face.

738
01:52:39,386 --> 01:52:45,671
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we had concerns about that getting into the water supply, infecting most mammals with birth control that we didn't want to affect.

739
01:52:46,071 --> 01:52:48,113
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was taken off the market by the EPA.

740
01:52:48,914 --> 01:52:49,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

741
01:52:49,834 --> 01:52:55,939
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, other poisons that we use, some things we use have no secondary poisonings.

742
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Some do.

743
01:52:57,660 --> 01:52:59,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that we're actually hurting

744
01:53:01,155 --> 01:53:04,518
[SPEAKER_15]: animals like we've been told that we've been hurting animals.

745
01:53:04,538 --> 01:53:14,947
[SPEAKER_15]: For instance, MK in Arlington died of the bird flu, not of rodent poisoning, rodenticide poisoning, and things like that.

746
01:53:14,967 --> 01:53:18,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, can we cut back and if things can change in the industry, absolutely.

747
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:24,916
[SPEAKER_15]: And this training program we're doing is gonna really hit on that, on the alternatives and the best way to control the problem.

748
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:31,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, that's not, I mean, it's obviously deadly, but it's not a poison.

749
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's no secondary.

750
01:53:33,339 --> 01:53:33,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

751
01:53:35,261 --> 01:53:36,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions?

752
01:53:36,242 --> 01:53:37,664
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

753
01:53:37,724 --> 01:53:38,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time.

754
01:53:38,505 --> 01:53:39,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming down.

755
01:53:39,406 --> 01:53:39,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

756
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:44,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

757
01:53:44,657 --> 01:53:51,845
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to thank them for bringing this up again.

758
01:53:51,865 --> 01:53:58,493
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a property on Forest Street where I live and have been seeing rodent activities the first time I've seen it in five years.

759
01:53:59,394 --> 01:54:02,958
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also own a property that I lived in for 25 years at 2931 Stoughton Street and have never had

760
01:54:06,121 --> 01:54:09,142
[SPEAKER_20]: rat issues over by the hillside, but that is becoming an issue.

761
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:18,266
[SPEAKER_20]: The Method Health Department was very responsive and coming out after my calls and people have come out and looked.

762
01:54:19,106 --> 01:54:21,087
[SPEAKER_20]: I do just want to say two things.

763
01:54:21,227 --> 01:54:24,369
[SPEAKER_20]: One, there's a huge health concern with rats.

764
01:54:26,597 --> 01:54:32,682
[SPEAKER_20]: A friend of mine's actual dog got liver disease from being in touch with rat urine.

765
01:54:33,122 --> 01:54:38,566
[SPEAKER_20]: So rat urine actually causes liver disease in animals.

766
01:54:38,606 --> 01:54:39,487
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's an issue.

767
01:54:39,507 --> 01:54:42,249
[SPEAKER_20]: It can also cause a lot of issues with human contact as well.

768
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:46,112
[SPEAKER_20]: And two, you mentioned something about the trash.

769
01:54:47,053 --> 01:54:52,037
[SPEAKER_20]: Is trash being done, because I walked through Medford Square on Monday night,

770
01:54:53,294 --> 01:54:54,335
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is disgusting.

771
01:54:55,556 --> 01:54:58,378
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even like walking through this square at all.

772
01:54:58,638 --> 01:55:03,841
[SPEAKER_20]: It's deplorable, the amount of trash that's not in any receptacles whatsoever.

773
01:55:03,901 --> 01:55:08,264
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just sitting in cardboard boxes and trash bags.

774
01:55:08,324 --> 01:55:10,066
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to be supportive of the businesses.

775
01:55:10,106 --> 01:55:17,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's really important to have the businesses there, but I also think it doesn't put our city in good light and it also attracts all types of rodents.

776
01:55:18,493 --> 01:55:20,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I can give more context on that.

777
01:55:20,775 --> 01:55:23,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, Kit, if I get it wrong, please correct me.

778
01:55:24,577 --> 01:55:33,123
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that under prior trash contracts, there was kind of selective, some businesses were getting city pickup, some businesses were paying for private pickup.

779
01:55:33,183 --> 01:55:37,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not really clear what the rhyme or reason was, but there was an equal treatment.

780
01:55:37,706 --> 01:55:40,868
[SPEAKER_11]: some condo buildings were getting city pickup, some were having to pay for private.

781
01:55:41,628 --> 01:56:01,839
[SPEAKER_11]: This contract straightens that out, A, from a pure fairness perspective, but it also, part of the ordinance that we passed establishes a private hauler program where there's essentially a preferred private hauler, which is the person that the city has, the group that the city has a contract with, and businesses or large residential buildings can

782
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:07,266
[SPEAKER_11]: for a contract at a preferred rate with that hauler because they're already in the community doing the public contract.

783
01:56:07,727 --> 01:56:13,354
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea is, and this contract just went into effect three, six, five weeks ago, six weeks ago.

784
01:56:13,755 --> 01:56:16,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure when these provisions exactly start to kick in yet.

785
01:56:16,699 --> 01:56:18,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's some grace period in there.

786
01:56:20,143 --> 01:56:48,462
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea is that in the major squares, instead of having street pickup with city stuff overnight, that there would be potentially areas of public parking lots or areas on private property where you might have all of the businesses for that building using a single dumpster or multiple dumpsters, and then being part of this preferred hauler program to then be able to have the trash in a contained space that is subject to an integrated pest management plan and is rodent proof.

787
01:56:50,243 --> 01:56:54,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked at roses for when I was a kid here and yeah putting out the trash.

788
01:56:55,045 --> 01:57:05,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean I put it out because that's what my boss told me to do but I wasn't happy seeing the street lined and obviously one windstorm that night and we've seen that before in Medford Square and the trash is all over the square.

789
01:57:06,549 --> 01:57:08,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is the intent.

790
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:11,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins seems to have more information than me so I will let her answer.

791
01:57:11,877 --> 01:57:21,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Not more, but just I think in terms of what, and I agree, I think that this was a lot of what was kind of negotiated while this new contract was being formed between the city side and waste management.

792
01:57:21,261 --> 01:57:27,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that a lot of the provisions and goals, since it just went into effect July 1, are probably still being formulated.

793
01:57:27,864 --> 01:57:34,047
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think in terms of what residents can expect to see, especially in the square specifically, is consolidation, because absolutely when you have

794
01:57:34,967 --> 01:57:42,672
[SPEAKER_22]: one business that has overflow trash cans on the sidewalk, and another that has a dumpster, and then the other one doesn't use that dumpster, they just have a receptacle, and the next one just has a bag.

795
01:57:43,512 --> 01:57:55,459
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks messy, and the more we can just keep everything in one container that really is solid and reinforced, hopefully that'll be, you know, one piece of the puzzle in getting trash off the streets, rats off the streets.

796
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,262
[SPEAKER_20]: And just one other thing, I think the other big thing comes down to enforcement.

797
01:58:00,962 --> 01:58:10,671
[SPEAKER_20]: enforcing ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary.

798
01:58:10,971 --> 01:58:22,121
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.

799
01:58:22,725 --> 01:58:25,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, one thing we're looking at is the fee and fine schedule.

800
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:36,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard from our building commissioner right now that it actually costs more to add a new code enforcement officer because we're only charging certain rates than they're gonna actually bring back in, so it's cost negative.

801
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a way to make that more cost neutral, cost positive?

802
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've heard a million times in this room, we don't have enough code enforcement, so I don't need to get into that.

803
01:58:44,412 --> 01:58:44,792
Thank you.

804
01:58:45,433 --> 01:58:46,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

805
01:58:47,003 --> 01:58:59,307
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to emphasize what was mentioned here by the pest control expert and the previous speaker that I think you keep complaining that you don't have financial resources.

806
01:58:59,327 --> 01:59:02,989
[SPEAKER_26]: So a great way to address this is actually through fines.

807
01:59:03,729 --> 01:59:07,390
[SPEAKER_26]: And the advantage of that is it's also like a dynamic stream of revenue.

808
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:09,191
[SPEAKER_26]: So if you have a lot of road and issues,

809
01:59:09,691 --> 01:59:14,092
[SPEAKER_26]: And then you find, find, find, find, you get a lot of money and then that helps you to address the problem.

810
01:59:15,192 --> 01:59:22,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Because, you know, later on, then you have less rodent pressure, then you don't need as many staff in the health department.

811
01:59:22,274 --> 01:59:26,275
[SPEAKER_26]: So with the fine, it will allow you to just have a lot of resources when you actually need it.

812
01:59:26,775 --> 01:59:30,836
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the second thing that I wanted to emphasize that the pest control experts mentioned is that

813
01:59:32,296 --> 01:59:33,557
[SPEAKER_26]: individual responsibility.

814
01:59:33,677 --> 01:59:50,768
[SPEAKER_26]: I think everyone in the community should understand that they have a responsibility and in fact they are the primary responsible party here to address this problem and a lot comes to up to education and I think you know the the city can play a role in that but

815
01:59:52,029 --> 01:59:58,617
[SPEAKER_26]: At the end of the day, it's each of us that can go online or get a book from the library and learn about this.

816
01:59:59,157 --> 02:00:03,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And then if we just don't have an individual sense of responsibility, then

817
02:00:03,922 --> 02:00:09,084
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, probably as a pest control expert emphasized, then we're just going to live with rats for the city as we do with squirrels.

818
02:00:10,225 --> 02:00:15,507
[SPEAKER_26]: So those two things, first, like, you know, individual responsibility, addressing the issue, being nice to your community.

819
02:00:15,547 --> 02:00:26,171
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the second one is that actually enforcing fines and getting a lot of money from that from businesses has been said, like, you know, why aren't they dealing with the trash in the proper way, right?

820
02:00:26,191 --> 02:00:27,072
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just not acceptable.

821
02:00:27,092 --> 02:00:29,173
[SPEAKER_26]: So the city should go and get revenue from there.

822
02:00:29,413 --> 02:00:29,853
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

823
02:00:30,293 --> 02:00:30,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

824
02:00:30,613 --> 02:00:30,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

825
02:00:30,953 --> 02:00:31,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the comment.

826
02:00:32,154 --> 02:00:36,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, one thing I think when we pass the road and control ordinance, we are limited.

827
02:00:36,615 --> 02:00:41,757
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a state law around non-criminal disposition that limits the maximum amount of fines and how often you can do them.

828
02:00:41,777 --> 02:00:45,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was one of the barriers for us in terms of using fines as a revenue source.

829
02:00:45,958 --> 02:00:54,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we wanted to see, um, it's, I think it's a maximum of $300 per incident, and then there have to have certain time period between incidents.

830
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:58,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a barrier that we face because of the state law around, around that.

831
02:00:58,342 --> 02:00:58,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know,

832
02:00:59,355 --> 02:01:02,219
[SPEAKER_11]: when the legislature will change it, but that would be helpful.

833
02:01:04,882 --> 02:01:05,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

834
02:01:05,182 --> 02:01:08,967
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll let Rada beat in part two.

835
02:01:09,568 --> 02:01:13,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, if you assert sign, uh, fines to

836
02:01:14,284 --> 02:01:20,666
[SPEAKER_18]: repeat offenders, such as one of them said that every time they go by this house, the dumpsters overloaded, overloaded.

837
02:01:20,886 --> 02:01:30,268
[SPEAKER_18]: So you find this landlord or owner and they don't correct it and you find them again and find them again, whatever the allotted period is.

838
02:01:31,428 --> 02:01:32,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it legal?

839
02:01:32,208 --> 02:01:39,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Like if I get a lot of speeding tickets, I'm not allowed to renew my license because I have these outstanding speeding tickets.

840
02:01:40,188 --> 02:01:51,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything that you can do to, this is going to be extreme, but put a ween on the house or something like that to make these people clean up their problem?

841
02:01:51,556 --> 02:01:57,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the only thing that really makes humans do something is it when it hurts them in the pocket.

842
02:01:58,630 --> 02:02:03,576
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, the only thing that's going to correct this problem is humans by cleaning up their mess.

843
02:02:04,037 --> 02:02:09,924
[SPEAKER_18]: All these other loading controls are not going to work if the food source is still there.

844
02:02:10,225 --> 02:02:16,873
[SPEAKER_18]: So my question is, how far can a fine go to make this workable?

845
02:02:17,314 --> 02:02:17,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

846
02:02:18,083 --> 02:02:20,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I can answer partially.

847
02:02:20,244 --> 02:02:27,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is this state law that over overarches what cities and towns are able to do through a non-criminal disposition.

848
02:02:27,729 --> 02:02:33,512
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing we are trying, my first term, like I think basically the only thing I really was able to get done was we worked on a

849
02:02:33,852 --> 02:02:49,773
[SPEAKER_11]: the snow removal ordinance and one of the things we were trying to get done was looking into this and when we passed that snow removal ordinance update, there is now a provision where if you have a repeat offender, you can put a lien on the property.

850
02:02:50,954 --> 02:03:00,216
[SPEAKER_11]: not just for the fine, which is still stuck at that 300 non-criminal disposition, but also we put in the ordinance, the cost of removal of the snow.

851
02:03:00,836 --> 02:03:08,097
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the city has to send out city employees or contractors to clear the sidewalks, then there could be a lien placed.

852
02:03:09,157 --> 02:03:14,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we've actually gotten to that point with any property yet since that ordinance was passed.

853
02:03:14,338 --> 02:03:14,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know.

854
02:03:14,999 --> 02:03:17,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think there is an open question as to

855
02:03:18,564 --> 02:03:25,170
[SPEAKER_11]: when that comes down the road, and we actually try to do it, and then someone sues and says, no, you can't do this, where are the courts gonna land on it?

856
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:30,996
[SPEAKER_11]: We passed it in the solicitor, it went through legal counsel, but we haven't tested it yet.

857
02:03:31,256 --> 02:03:34,800
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see, it's a litigious society out there these days.

858
02:03:36,904 --> 02:03:40,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to quickly thank everyone for coming up and speaking about this.

859
02:03:40,569 --> 02:03:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone had something super productive to add to the conversation.

860
02:03:45,495 --> 02:03:52,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the future, with this resolution passed, with more meetings about this, the more voices we can get, the more advice that we can get.

861
02:03:54,125 --> 02:03:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: will be able to make some positive progress on this.

862
02:03:57,628 --> 02:04:10,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mr. Benedetto's statements actually reminded me of something I wanted to say, which is that I think we have to think in terms of our messaging and our strategy, we need to go in two new directions with this.

863
02:04:10,697 --> 02:04:11,157
[SPEAKER_04]: One is to

864
02:04:11,874 --> 02:04:13,815
[SPEAKER_04]: go more local.

865
02:04:14,195 --> 02:04:23,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my own neighborhood held a road in control meeting, basically neighbors educating each other about the best ways to get rid of road in control now.

866
02:04:23,321 --> 02:04:28,284
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that should be less neighbors doing it and city coming in and

867
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: City leaders coming in and helping organize those meetings.

868
02:04:33,149 --> 02:04:35,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So the local aspect is very, very important.

869
02:04:35,672 --> 02:04:38,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And as much as we can harness that organic momentum, the better.

870
02:04:38,295 --> 02:04:43,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we also need to think bigger too and recognize that the road control problem is also a regional problem.

871
02:04:44,702 --> 02:05:03,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the more that we can do to set up institutions where counselors like us, city employees from Medford are working with city employees and counselors in neighboring municipalities to deal with projects that are on the border, I think the better we can serve our residents too.

872
02:05:04,675 --> 02:05:07,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So building those channels of communication I think will be really important.

873
02:05:09,636 --> 02:05:10,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

874
02:05:10,096 --> 02:05:15,100
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to join and approve Papers 24449 and 24451.

875
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:16,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by.

876
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:19,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

877
02:05:19,704 --> 02:05:20,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

878
02:05:24,008 --> 02:05:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

879
02:05:24,768 --> 02:05:25,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

880
02:05:26,109 --> 02:05:26,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins.

881
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:26,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

882
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

883
02:05:28,792 --> 02:05:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

884
02:05:28,912 --> 02:05:29,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lovett.

885
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

886
02:05:38,456 --> 02:05:39,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

887
02:05:39,116 --> 02:05:39,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

888
02:05:40,316 --> 02:05:40,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng.

889
02:05:40,777 --> 02:05:40,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

890
02:05:41,477 --> 02:05:42,077
[SPEAKER_07]: President Paris.

891
02:05:42,277 --> 02:05:44,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 74 and then negative motion passes.

892
02:05:44,797 --> 02:05:48,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas good government is based on the fund, I'm sorry, 24450 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

893
02:05:48,918 --> 02:05:53,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas good government is based on a foundation of openness, clarity, transparency, and accountability.

894
02:05:53,740 --> 02:06:03,522
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas the city council, taxpayers, and residents of the city of Medford are intended to be made aware whenever the city resolves claims against the city, the school department, any employee, any department, department head, or employee of the city,

895
02:06:04,102 --> 02:06:12,104
[SPEAKER_11]: by payment regardless of whether those claims are resolved prior to litigation, after litigation, but before trial, by way of judgment or decision by a court or administrative or quasi-judicial body.

896
02:06:12,724 --> 02:06:32,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the mayor provide the council with a list of all such matters resolved during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further, for each matter so resolved by payment, the mayor report to the council the name of each person, persons, or entity who made such claim and the amount paid to each such person, persons, or entity, if there is a legal reason that any such name should not be disclosed.

897
02:06:32,889 --> 02:06:36,673
[SPEAKER_11]: such as in the case of a minor, a general description of the claim without identifying the person will suffice.

898
02:06:36,813 --> 02:06:48,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And further, for each matter so resolved by payment, the mayor reports to the city council the source of the money or funding that was used to pay the claim by specifying which city or school account that money was from, whether it was paid by an insurer of the city or meant for public schools.

899
02:06:49,026 --> 02:06:50,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Further, that the mayor reports to the council

900
02:06:51,408 --> 02:07:16,137
[SPEAKER_11]: the names and addresses of any insurers with whom the city or school department maintained a policy of insurance whose coverage was the source of payments used to pay any such claim during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further, for each policy of insurance listed by the mayor in answering the request set forth in the previous paragraph that the mayor state the annual premiums paid for each insurance policy listed in the applicable deductibles for each year during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024,

901
02:07:19,518 --> 02:07:19,659
[SPEAKER_11]: or 2025.

902
02:07:19,759 --> 02:07:37,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, that the mayor provide the city council with a breakdown of all amounts paid to outside council for representing the city of Medford or the Metro Public Schools or any department, department head or employee of the city of Medford for any claims made against the city as a municipality or the Metro Public Schools or any department, department head or employee of the city of Medford during fiscal years 2021

903
02:07:40,521 --> 02:07:42,682
[SPEAKER_11]: 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025.

904
02:07:43,043 --> 02:07:51,570
[SPEAKER_11]: This request includes payments made for any work performed on such claims to the compliment and page law firm, PB&R law firm, or to any other attorneys.

905
02:07:51,610 --> 02:07:52,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

906
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:54,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council President.

907
02:07:55,593 --> 02:08:07,402
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'll allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city.

908
02:08:08,163 --> 02:08:11,245
[SPEAKER_14]: the school department or employees of the city or the schools.

909
02:08:12,787 --> 02:08:24,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims.

910
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:34,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500.

911
02:08:34,757 --> 02:08:50,271
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools.

912
02:08:51,172 --> 02:08:57,057
[SPEAKER_14]: My motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with.

913
02:08:57,738 --> 02:09:04,283
[SPEAKER_14]: That is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government.

914
02:09:05,064 --> 02:09:07,666
[SPEAKER_14]: People deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent.

915
02:09:08,507 --> 02:09:12,889
[SPEAKER_14]: With this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution.

916
02:09:13,549 --> 02:09:17,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right?

917
02:09:17,171 --> 02:09:19,932
[SPEAKER_14]: We said we need more funding, right?

918
02:09:20,092 --> 02:09:20,933
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more funding.

919
02:09:22,013 --> 02:09:36,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've seen over the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million of free cash that was recently certified.

920
02:09:37,762 --> 02:09:40,683
[SPEAKER_14]: The lack of new growth in our community over the past four years.

921
02:09:41,584 --> 02:09:46,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Payments to outside councils that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are.

922
02:09:46,926 --> 02:09:51,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership.

923
02:09:52,688 --> 02:10:03,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds.

924
02:10:04,383 --> 02:10:14,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that.

925
02:10:15,872 --> 02:10:20,095
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads.

926
02:10:20,135 --> 02:10:24,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we mentioned the other day, that you just go and speak to the department heads.

927
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:28,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor.

928
02:10:29,943 --> 02:10:39,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying.

929
02:10:40,049 --> 02:10:50,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it.

930
02:10:52,662 --> 02:11:03,747
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salt.

931
02:11:03,767 --> 02:11:13,291
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, you know, even the most simple things, an arbitration.

932
02:11:13,671 --> 02:11:17,133
[SPEAKER_14]: If an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations.

933
02:11:17,493 --> 02:11:20,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides.

934
02:11:21,934 --> 02:11:24,075
[SPEAKER_14]: not just the outcome, right?

935
02:11:24,375 --> 02:11:42,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand and we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey,

936
02:11:43,715 --> 02:11:51,638
[SPEAKER_14]: In the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes in how we've run the finances in the city.

937
02:11:51,658 --> 02:11:53,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we've seen that.

938
02:11:54,819 --> 02:12:04,062
[SPEAKER_14]: It's public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see

939
02:12:06,573 --> 02:12:12,357
[SPEAKER_14]: why we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department.

940
02:12:12,957 --> 02:12:14,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Mr. President.

941
02:12:14,438 --> 02:12:16,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the time.

942
02:12:16,999 --> 02:12:17,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

943
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Do any other councilors have any questions?

944
02:12:25,605 --> 02:12:31,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, I would just note that the council has not approved any appropriations beyond the city budget for settlements.

945
02:12:31,728 --> 02:12:35,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So settlements are being done within the appropriate amount of the city budget.

946
02:12:37,537 --> 02:12:38,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Members of the public would like to speak.

947
02:12:47,564 --> 02:12:51,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if you leave it with, do you want us to review it now or do you want us to review it after the meeting?

948
02:12:54,709 --> 02:12:56,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thanks.

949
02:13:08,465 --> 02:13:09,566
[SPEAKER_11]: name and address for the record, please.

950
02:13:09,586 --> 02:13:10,106
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

951
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:18,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

952
02:13:22,232 --> 02:13:24,973
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, uh, president bears and members of the council.

953
02:13:25,534 --> 02:13:28,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I appreciate the name and address.

954
02:13:28,595 --> 02:13:29,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sorry.

955
02:13:29,055 --> 02:13:31,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Steve South, uh, one Oh six Damon road, Medford mass.

956
02:13:31,957 --> 02:13:32,177
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

957
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:38,045
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli putting this item forward.

958
02:13:38,846 --> 02:13:46,954
[SPEAKER_23]: For the last four and a half years, I've been educating the three different councils about all the open litigation.

959
02:13:47,454 --> 02:13:49,897
[SPEAKER_23]: This all started a little over four years ago.

960
02:13:50,577 --> 02:13:55,582
[SPEAKER_23]: So when I saw this resolution, I thought it would be a good time to give you my yearly update.

961
02:13:56,363 --> 02:14:01,084
[SPEAKER_23]: So I did some research and found out some of the open litigations.

962
02:14:01,164 --> 02:14:02,544
[SPEAKER_23]: These are just lawsuits.

963
02:14:02,964 --> 02:14:10,446
[SPEAKER_23]: This doesn't include all the open labor charges with all the unions, arbitrations, mediations, fact finding, and other litigations.

964
02:14:10,826 --> 02:14:13,006
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to take you through a couple of these briefly.

965
02:14:13,687 --> 02:14:19,788
[SPEAKER_23]: This was filed, I believe this is 2002, Allison Convoy versus City of Medford.

966
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:22,888
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just want to take you through a couple of accounts.

967
02:14:22,948 --> 02:14:25,529
[SPEAKER_23]: Failure to pay FLSA overtime.

968
02:14:26,609 --> 02:14:27,550
[SPEAKER_23]: That's count one.

969
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:31,714
[SPEAKER_23]: Failure to pay overtime for off-the-clock work.

970
02:14:31,754 --> 02:14:32,594
[SPEAKER_23]: That's count two.

971
02:14:32,975 --> 02:14:36,978
[SPEAKER_23]: Failure to pay overtime wages required under GL-149.

972
02:14:37,778 --> 02:14:42,743
[SPEAKER_23]: Violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act by failure to make timely payment of earned wages.

973
02:14:43,183 --> 02:14:44,864
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's one lawsuit.

974
02:14:45,505 --> 02:14:49,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Another lawsuit, Alicia Nunley versus City of Medford.

975
02:14:49,808 --> 02:14:53,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, Breonna Lungo-Koehn, as well as David Rodriguez.

976
02:14:54,372 --> 02:14:56,472
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll just read you the opening.

977
02:14:57,253 --> 02:15:20,077
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an action arising out of the wrongful acts and omissions of the defendants who engaged in discrimination and harassment against Alicia Nunley Benjamin in her employment as Chief Financial Officer slash Auditor Finance Director for the city of Medford, Massachusetts, based on race, color, and sex, and retaliated against her after she complained about the mistreatment.

978
02:15:21,332 --> 02:15:26,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Next is going to be, and these are all open, by the way, these are pending lawsuits.

979
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:36,412
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, this is Superior Court, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Michael Durham versus City of Medford, Breanna Lungo-Koehn and Neil Osborne.

980
02:15:38,234 --> 02:15:39,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, give me one second.

981
02:15:44,309 --> 02:15:47,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, count one, discrimination based on disability.

982
02:15:48,110 --> 02:15:52,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Count two, violation of MGL 151B, retaliation.

983
02:15:52,951 --> 02:15:57,572
[SPEAKER_23]: Count three, violation of MGL, the Massachusetts Whistleblower Act.

984
02:15:57,992 --> 02:16:06,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Count four, this is against, individually against Breonna Lungo-Koehn, aiding and abetting discrimination and violation of MGL.

985
02:16:07,034 --> 02:16:08,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Claims against- Steve, you have about 30 seconds.

986
02:16:08,735 --> 02:16:10,095
[SPEAKER_23]: Yep, Neil Osborne.

987
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:13,591
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me move on.

988
02:16:14,412 --> 02:16:17,115
[SPEAKER_23]: Next, Sandra Gale versus City of Medford.

989
02:16:17,475 --> 02:16:21,259
[SPEAKER_23]: Next, there's a bunch of inspectors versus City of Medford.

990
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:26,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Next, there's about 50 DPW employees versus the City of Medford.

991
02:16:26,626 --> 02:16:28,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Next, I want to go to settlements.

992
02:16:29,108 --> 02:16:29,908
[SPEAKER_23]: 2022, 30 school custodians, $495,000.

993
02:16:29,948 --> 02:16:30,689
[SPEAKER_23]: 2023, school security, $28,500.

994
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:31,629
[SPEAKER_23]: June of 2024, a member of the DPW, $265,000.

995
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:34,610
[SPEAKER_23]: 2024, you just settled it out in the hall today, $47,500 for another member.

996
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:36,030
[SPEAKER_23]: 2024, Medford DPW pending settlement.

997
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:37,871
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna be signed sometime very soon.

998
02:16:56,856 --> 02:17:00,137
[SPEAKER_23]: 2024, Samari Montes, you guys took it up outside.

999
02:17:00,578 --> 02:17:19,064
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to point out that while the city is paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements and are actually there's much more liability and maybe in the millions that the city council is approving two raises for itself as well as all the other non-union.

1000
02:17:19,764 --> 02:17:25,749
[SPEAKER_23]: three raises for the Medford mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, that goes into effect July 1.

1001
02:17:26,429 --> 02:17:30,233
[SPEAKER_23]: That's one for the school committee and two raises for the mayor.

1002
02:17:30,673 --> 02:17:46,265
[SPEAKER_23]: And all the while that the city still has many employees under collective bargaining agreements that haven't had a raise in years, including police patrolmen, police superiors, recreation department, DPW superintendents, inspectors, and others.

1003
02:17:47,166 --> 02:17:48,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, you're a minute over.

1004
02:17:48,568 --> 02:17:50,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I just I just I'm almost done.

1005
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:51,991
[SPEAKER_23]: I got two more points.

1006
02:17:52,131 --> 02:17:52,432
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1007
02:17:52,592 --> 02:18:05,665
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to point out that the city is spending many hundreds of thousands on KP law again, while all these other things are pending when they could hire a city solicitor, but they choose not to by leaving the

1008
02:18:05,925 --> 02:18:07,045
[SPEAKER_23]: the wages so low.

1009
02:18:07,386 --> 02:18:19,129
[SPEAKER_23]: And lastly, I want to point out while the city is treating the taxpayer dollars as monopoly money, you're asking for multiple prop two and a half overrides in November over seven and a half million dollars.

1010
02:18:19,209 --> 02:18:19,570
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1011
02:18:19,610 --> 02:18:19,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1012
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,470
[SPEAKER_11]: That was two minutes over.

1013
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:26,412
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1014
02:18:27,852 --> 02:18:29,273
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, again,

1015
02:18:30,848 --> 02:18:35,392
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not appropriated a single dollar above the budgeted appropriated amount for any settlements.

1016
02:18:35,512 --> 02:18:37,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's not a monopoly money approach here.

1017
02:18:38,395 --> 02:18:45,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, I'm sorry, but you know, you can't.

1018
02:18:46,122 --> 02:18:47,984
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been paid for by appropriated funds.

1019
02:18:48,024 --> 02:18:53,349
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no additional funding, magic money, wasted money that's going to these things beyond what is approved in the city budget.

1020
02:18:59,387 --> 02:19:02,527
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council, Steve, I'm not going to get into a back and forth with you.

1021
02:19:02,567 --> 02:19:06,188
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council has to, the city council has to approve all appropriations.

1022
02:19:06,248 --> 02:19:06,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the law.

1023
02:19:06,828 --> 02:19:11,430
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council has not been asked to appropriate a single dollar beyond the budget for legal settlements.

1024
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would, uh, good luck.

1025
02:19:18,592 --> 02:19:21,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, any questions on the resolution?

1026
02:19:22,293 --> 02:19:23,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

1027
02:19:25,914 --> 02:19:28,155
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have a question on the resolution specifically.

1028
02:19:28,195 --> 02:19:29,676
[SPEAKER_22]: I thank the councilor for bringing it forward.

1029
02:19:29,876 --> 02:19:41,402
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that a lot of what we've heard in terms of premises for this conversation, I have an honest disagreement with at the same time.

1030
02:19:41,462 --> 02:19:50,427
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that there's a lot of ways for us to have really productive conversations about settlements and liabilities before the city.

1031
02:19:51,556 --> 02:19:53,477
[SPEAKER_22]: These sometimes occur in public session.

1032
02:19:53,537 --> 02:19:55,777
[SPEAKER_22]: These sometimes occur in executive session.

1033
02:19:56,978 --> 02:20:04,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Anytime we are getting more information from the administration as opposed to less when it comes to the city side of things, we have no jurisdiction over the schools.

1034
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,481
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that is a good thing.

1035
02:20:05,541 --> 02:20:07,701
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that always leaves us better off.

1036
02:20:07,781 --> 02:20:19,165
[SPEAKER_22]: That often leaves the atmosphere more productive and collaborative than it was when we were feeling under-informed prior to, you know, whether it's a meeting or a memo or just a substantive update.

1037
02:20:21,775 --> 02:20:40,468
[SPEAKER_22]: I think for myself, I feel, I think, across many issues we've all had the experience of feeling under informed on various issues and then we get that bolus of information it's like wow, now we can really have a conversation about this, that leaves me feeling pretty open and flexible when it comes to what type of format or venue we receive

1038
02:20:40,968 --> 02:20:44,589
[SPEAKER_22]: information about settlements and liabilities in going forward.

1039
02:20:44,669 --> 02:20:50,272
[SPEAKER_22]: This, like a lot of our resolutions, when it comes to making resolutions to the administration, they are essentially requests.

1040
02:20:50,352 --> 02:20:58,815
[SPEAKER_22]: We cannot compel reports or requests to be filled by the administration just because of the nature of the way our government is set up.

1041
02:21:00,516 --> 02:21:07,979
[SPEAKER_22]: That being said, I hope that the administration takes this request for more information as a

1042
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:19,506
[SPEAKER_22]: in the best faith possible to say, it is better for us when we put our issues out on the table and we're able to have these conversations when there's fewer surprises.

1043
02:21:20,267 --> 02:21:29,653
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that, you know, there's a lot of cliche ways to put this, but I think that we're better when fewer things are in the dark.

1044
02:21:29,873 --> 02:21:39,000
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that it's better to shine a light on things that people are hearing about than to,

1045
02:21:39,827 --> 02:21:43,229
[SPEAKER_22]: to speculate until kind of a belated information.

1046
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:48,191
[SPEAKER_22]: So that being said, more information is always better.

1047
02:21:48,231 --> 02:21:50,872
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that a lot of this is very sensitive, like we saw earlier today.

1048
02:21:50,912 --> 02:21:53,093
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of this has to be discussed in executive session.

1049
02:21:53,233 --> 02:22:00,717
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of it, you know, there's some litigations, there's some settlements that always come to the council as a matter of course, we saw that earlier this evening.

1050
02:22:00,737 --> 02:22:06,160
[SPEAKER_22]: I always want to correct the record when it comes to what information, you know, the city council does get

1051
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:09,241
[SPEAKER_22]: certain settlements do come before us, we do appropriate.

1052
02:22:10,561 --> 02:22:32,907
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I wouldn't want to put forward a request and also forward the story that, you know, we're in this complete and total information desert in the same way that I, you know, wouldn't want it to go by that, you know, an unusual number for free cash is in some way evidence of financial mismanagement.

1053
02:22:33,387 --> 02:22:33,787
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not.

1054
02:22:35,051 --> 02:22:39,974
[SPEAKER_22]: We know from communities across the street that this was a banner year for free cash surpluses for many communities.

1055
02:22:41,475 --> 02:22:50,921
[SPEAKER_22]: But in the same way, I don't think that we should need to treat settlements and liabilities like something that we cannot talk about and we cannot ask about.

1056
02:22:51,582 --> 02:23:04,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I think to the extent that we are able to have a freer flow of information about this with the administration, leave us better off, leave us better able to communicate with the community when there are concerns, be able to say, this is what it really is.

1057
02:23:05,609 --> 02:23:07,910
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, and help us dial in on what our real problems are.

1058
02:23:07,930 --> 02:23:09,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1059
02:23:10,871 --> 02:23:11,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1060
02:23:11,151 --> 02:23:13,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Riley and Councilor Sviggum.

1061
02:23:13,832 --> 02:23:14,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1062
02:23:15,413 --> 02:23:18,834
[SPEAKER_14]: So this, I agree with my councils.

1063
02:23:19,495 --> 02:23:27,918
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a simple request that, again, do transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested.

1064
02:23:28,098 --> 02:23:32,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows

1065
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:41,284
[SPEAKER_14]: if it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right.

1066
02:23:41,784 --> 02:23:44,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So I welcome your support.

1067
02:23:44,226 --> 02:23:57,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, I know Councilor Bears said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Seltz just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving.

1068
02:23:57,492 --> 02:24:12,496
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories.

1069
02:24:12,997 --> 02:24:14,077
[SPEAKER_14]: These are real lawsuits.

1070
02:24:15,475 --> 02:24:17,175
[SPEAKER_14]: what's already been settled are real.

1071
02:24:17,916 --> 02:24:21,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Those, a lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record.

1072
02:24:21,516 --> 02:24:25,517
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact.

1073
02:24:25,577 --> 02:24:31,799
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact.

1074
02:24:31,899 --> 02:24:35,980
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're fact, then we could discuss something else that's very important.

1075
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:39,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we're paying for our

1076
02:24:41,881 --> 02:24:46,084
[SPEAKER_14]: our insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right?

1077
02:24:46,124 --> 02:24:46,884
[SPEAKER_14]: What does that increase?

1078
02:24:46,944 --> 02:24:47,585
[SPEAKER_14]: What have we paid?

1079
02:24:47,605 --> 02:24:51,567
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion.

1080
02:24:51,607 --> 02:25:06,177
[SPEAKER_14]: My opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask,

1081
02:25:07,324 --> 02:25:10,227
[SPEAKER_14]: expressed that we just we just certified $9 million.

1082
02:25:10,867 --> 02:25:15,492
[SPEAKER_14]: That's $9 million of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly.

1083
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:21,377
[SPEAKER_14]: So in definition to myself, whether you want to take it or not, it's fiscal mismanagement.

1084
02:25:21,657 --> 02:25:22,879
[SPEAKER_14]: You do not manage

1085
02:25:23,579 --> 02:25:27,344
[SPEAKER_14]: that money responsibly, and that's the taxpayers' money.

1086
02:25:27,944 --> 02:25:39,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my colleagues in the mayor to see

1087
02:25:40,439 --> 02:25:45,044
[SPEAKER_14]: where we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again.

1088
02:25:45,644 --> 02:25:46,665
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of questions.

1089
02:25:46,705 --> 02:25:47,586
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just a piece.

1090
02:25:47,626 --> 02:25:54,072
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward.

1091
02:25:54,333 --> 02:25:54,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1092
02:25:56,698 --> 02:25:58,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Callahan.

1093
02:25:58,400 --> 02:25:58,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1094
02:25:59,742 --> 02:26:02,085
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I like Vice President Collins.

1095
02:26:02,285 --> 02:26:10,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree with a lot of the premises put out there and to the best effort of Councilors to get me to vote no on this, I do intend to vote yes on this.

1096
02:26:11,196 --> 02:26:13,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know,

1097
02:26:14,179 --> 02:26:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe that the text of the resolution that's in front of us is what we have to debate.

1098
02:26:19,625 --> 02:26:22,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with what's being said in the resolution.

1099
02:26:22,187 --> 02:26:23,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with greater transparency.

1100
02:26:24,029 --> 02:26:34,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's good when we as the city council have more oversight over these issues, when we are much more to know about these issues, when we can inform our residents about what's going on.

1101
02:26:37,222 --> 02:26:44,732
[SPEAKER_04]: any motion that I think, any motion or resolution that reasonably increases transparency in our community is something that I would support.

1102
02:26:44,772 --> 02:26:46,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I do plan on voting yes on this.

1103
02:26:48,096 --> 02:26:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Calderon.

1104
02:26:48,757 --> 02:26:51,019
[SPEAKER_19]: I plan to vote in favor.

1105
02:26:52,341 --> 02:26:52,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1106
02:26:52,942 --> 02:26:54,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comments from members of the council?

1107
02:26:56,716 --> 02:27:01,597
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just say for one counselor, the text of the resolution, I don't have a problem with it.

1108
02:27:02,117 --> 02:27:05,958
[SPEAKER_11]: It's answers that already exist and could be compiled into a report, I would guess.

1109
02:27:05,978 --> 02:27:12,020
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen them in the Warren articles and we've seen them in reports previously, and I'd like to see them all in one place.

1110
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:14,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we've said so many times here, it'd be nice to see it all.

1111
02:27:15,981 --> 02:27:17,381
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem with the text of the resolution.

1112
02:27:18,373 --> 02:27:30,511
[SPEAKER_11]: but the narrative and the arguments being put forth underlying the resolution to try to tie it into some larger accusation, it's just spurious, it's just not real.

1113
02:27:31,553 --> 02:27:40,795
[SPEAKER_11]: The facts of the matter are this council has never been asked to appropriate additional money for settlements and legal services since I've been on this council, which includes all these fiscal years.

1114
02:27:40,815 --> 02:27:45,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen a million dollar end of year transfer to the legal budget because of all these settlements.

1115
02:27:45,996 --> 02:27:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: That has to happen legally.

1116
02:27:48,236 --> 02:27:56,478
[SPEAKER_11]: There's about six different checks and balances on it from the finance director to the state division of local services and the department of revenue to the mayor to this body.

1117
02:27:57,398 --> 02:28:05,577
[SPEAKER_11]: That if that was happening, they'd have to go through all these, there'd have to be such a massive conspiracy going all the way up to the state level, to the commissioner of revenue for that to be true.

1118
02:28:07,298 --> 02:28:08,279
[SPEAKER_11]: that it's not true.

1119
02:28:08,679 --> 02:28:10,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm perfectly fine asking the questions.

1120
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:12,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna vote yes on it.

1121
02:28:12,741 --> 02:28:19,805
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea that this fits some sort of larger narrative or example of something that's going on about malfeasance is just false.

1122
02:28:20,225 --> 02:28:25,708
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of people who would have to be involved in it intentionally is not possible.

1123
02:28:25,928 --> 02:28:32,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think as everyone knows here, it would involve people who strongly disagree with each other, somehow colluding.

1124
02:28:32,792 --> 02:28:36,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I disagree strongly with Mayor Lungo-Koehn on a number of substantive issues.

1125
02:28:37,401 --> 02:28:40,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I disagree with her on some of the management style in this building.

1126
02:28:40,624 --> 02:28:45,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not, you know, it's just not possible.

1127
02:28:46,630 --> 02:28:54,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have no problem asking the questions, but when we try to tie it into this larger thing, it's just plainly political.

1128
02:28:55,318 --> 02:28:55,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1129
02:28:57,621 --> 02:29:05,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with what President Vares was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see.

1130
02:29:05,832 --> 02:29:10,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the

1131
02:29:11,532 --> 02:29:21,121
[SPEAKER_00]: that the city wouldn't have been able to access the funds to pay out, you know, legal fees and things like this.

1132
02:29:21,902 --> 02:29:26,306
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, you know, blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge.

1133
02:29:26,747 --> 02:29:30,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned,

1134
02:29:30,543 --> 02:29:38,408
[SPEAKER_00]: he just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times.

1135
02:29:38,468 --> 02:29:45,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out.

1136
02:29:45,993 --> 02:29:46,754
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be great.

1137
02:29:48,095 --> 02:29:58,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other,

1138
02:30:00,823 --> 02:30:08,547
[SPEAKER_00]: elements of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think, is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about.

1139
02:30:08,567 --> 02:30:09,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1140
02:30:10,668 --> 02:30:11,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1141
02:30:13,209 --> 02:30:15,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President Sell.

1142
02:30:15,638 --> 02:30:29,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my colleagues, I don't really like to hear a lot of the conspiratorial narratives, but I have a purely technical question about this that I hope that perhaps Councilor Scarpelli or somebody else could address.

1143
02:30:29,728 --> 02:30:36,713
[SPEAKER_05]: If this information is already out there, I'd just like to know, are there any particular

1144
02:30:37,759 --> 02:30:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: papers or types of information that could be received with this resolution that could not be addressed with a simpler FOIA request.

1145
02:30:50,824 --> 02:30:52,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, can you repeat that, a what request?

1146
02:30:53,144 --> 02:30:55,205
[SPEAKER_05]: FOIA, Freedom of Information Act request.

1147
02:30:55,265 --> 02:31:01,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is, could somebody simply submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the mayor

1148
02:31:03,939 --> 02:31:08,141
[SPEAKER_05]: to the city to get the information requested in this resolution?

1149
02:31:08,161 --> 02:31:16,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is the resolution asking for information that could not be gotten through a Freedom of Information Act request?

1150
02:31:16,864 --> 02:31:26,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a technical question that... I don't know.

1151
02:31:26,627 --> 02:31:27,808
[SPEAKER_14]: I truly understand what he's saying.

1152
02:31:27,848 --> 02:31:28,388
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm thinking,

1153
02:31:29,562 --> 02:31:34,508
[SPEAKER_14]: My take and the comment, the question is that, why wouldn't someone put a foyer in?

1154
02:31:34,628 --> 02:31:35,809
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's the case, they can do that.

1155
02:31:35,829 --> 02:31:41,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he was asking if there's anything that a public records request wouldn't provide that this would provide.

1156
02:31:42,335 --> 02:31:53,841
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe, but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in?

1157
02:31:54,261 --> 02:32:05,606
[SPEAKER_14]: We would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested just to,

1158
02:32:06,727 --> 02:32:11,691
[SPEAKER_14]: just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability.

1159
02:32:11,991 --> 02:32:12,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1160
02:32:12,852 --> 02:32:13,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1161
02:32:13,252 --> 02:32:14,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comments, Councilor Levee?

1162
02:32:16,555 --> 02:32:18,576
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just, I am just...

1163
02:32:20,981 --> 02:32:32,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my point was first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request.

1164
02:32:33,328 --> 02:32:45,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there.

1165
02:32:45,776 --> 02:32:47,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be just as an effective means

1166
02:32:48,698 --> 02:32:49,618
[SPEAKER_05]: transparency.

1167
02:32:51,079 --> 02:32:57,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received.

1168
02:32:57,161 --> 02:32:59,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was that was what I was asking.

1169
02:32:59,301 --> 02:33:02,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1170
02:33:02,462 --> 02:33:05,243
[SPEAKER_11]: There would be a shot clock on a public records request.

1171
02:33:05,383 --> 02:33:09,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Technically, the mayor has no obligation to respond to our resolution.

1172
02:33:09,085 --> 02:33:10,685
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the only difference I'm aware of.

1173
02:33:11,745 --> 02:33:13,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comments by members of the council?

1174
02:33:15,083 --> 02:33:16,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, we'll go to the public.

1175
02:33:17,243 --> 02:33:18,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for record at the podium.

1176
02:33:18,884 --> 02:33:19,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Raise your hand on Zoom.

1177
02:33:19,784 --> 02:33:20,664
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

1178
02:33:20,904 --> 02:33:22,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

1179
02:33:22,825 --> 02:33:28,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted- You have to press the, just once.

1180
02:33:28,846 --> 02:33:30,326
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, the green line is on.

1181
02:33:30,786 --> 02:33:31,366
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be good.

1182
02:33:31,626 --> 02:33:31,806
[SPEAKER_26]: Yep.

1183
02:33:32,926 --> 02:33:33,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello?

1184
02:33:33,607 --> 02:33:33,827
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1185
02:33:34,147 --> 02:33:35,987
[SPEAKER_26]: So Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

1186
02:33:36,607 --> 02:33:39,548
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to make a general reminder to everyone.

1187
02:33:40,987 --> 02:33:49,113
[SPEAKER_26]: that one of the basic principles that we learn in a civics education class, which is what stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful?

1188
02:33:49,833 --> 02:33:51,594
[SPEAKER_26]: Checks and balances or separation of powers.

1189
02:33:52,795 --> 02:33:57,278
[SPEAKER_26]: There's absolutely no reason why one should vote no on this.

1190
02:33:57,559 --> 02:33:59,100
[SPEAKER_26]: I strongly support voting yes.

1191
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:02,542
[SPEAKER_26]: And I hope every member of the council does so as well.

1192
02:34:02,902 --> 02:34:07,566
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just like, even if this information is spread out and publicly somewhere else,

1193
02:34:08,687 --> 02:34:15,115
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it would be very helpful for members of the, for residents of Medford to basically see this in a compiled report.

1194
02:34:15,635 --> 02:34:20,581
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I said, it's about just checks and balances as two councillors here mentioned.

1195
02:34:20,601 --> 02:34:22,183
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see a reason to not do this.

1196
02:34:22,364 --> 02:34:22,884
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1197
02:34:24,066 --> 02:34:24,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1198
02:34:24,526 --> 02:34:25,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for record please.

1199
02:34:25,668 --> 02:34:26,469
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

1200
02:34:27,210 --> 02:34:28,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Steve South, 106 Damon Road.

1201
02:34:28,892 --> 02:34:32,937
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to clarify a couple of the questions that were asked and comments that were made.

1202
02:34:33,758 --> 02:34:44,552
[SPEAKER_23]: One is a FOIA request would not capture some lawsuits that are considered private until, or litigations, I should say,

1203
02:34:45,513 --> 02:34:54,699
[SPEAKER_23]: such as complaints with MCAD, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, which those complaints are private until they are decided or adjudicated or settled.

1204
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,261
[SPEAKER_23]: Then they become public.

1205
02:34:56,301 --> 02:34:57,441
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to point that out.

1206
02:34:57,501 --> 02:35:04,526
[SPEAKER_23]: So there are things that would be captured by this item that would not be captured by a FOIA.

1207
02:35:04,886 --> 02:35:07,909
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to clarify a couple other things that I

1208
02:35:09,009 --> 02:35:18,034
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm trying to understand if several of the counselors, including you, President Bears, were saying that the settlements that I mentioned never happened because I have copies of them.

1209
02:35:18,134 --> 02:35:24,618
[SPEAKER_23]: So I didn't understand if that's what you guys were saying, that it's not possible due to checks and balances.

1210
02:35:24,658 --> 02:35:25,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody said that.

1211
02:35:25,638 --> 02:35:26,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, okay.

1212
02:35:26,438 --> 02:35:32,580
[SPEAKER_23]: I heard people saying that it would have to go through all checks and balances and money allocated.

1213
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:41,582
[SPEAKER_23]: These are settlements that several of them happened that were never approved by the council and I came and spoke at that time and gave copies of the settlements.

1214
02:35:41,642 --> 02:35:42,642
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to point that out.

1215
02:35:42,962 --> 02:35:47,383
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to point out to one of the counselors who said, you know, that

1216
02:35:48,323 --> 02:35:52,184
[SPEAKER_23]: Something about that I mentioned Sandra Gail twice and maybe it's exaggerated.

1217
02:35:52,684 --> 02:36:07,627
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to point out that the litigation that you approved out there in executive session for $47,500 was a complaint made by Teamsters Local 25 at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations.

1218
02:36:07,987 --> 02:36:11,128
[SPEAKER_23]: That was settled a couple weeks ago during the middle of a trial.

1219
02:36:11,448 --> 02:36:13,108
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe you guys approved it today.

1220
02:36:13,569 --> 02:36:15,549
[SPEAKER_11]: The other lawsuit- I can't comment on that.

1221
02:36:15,629 --> 02:36:16,490
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's fine.

1222
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:17,130
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm commenting.

1223
02:36:17,190 --> 02:36:18,091
[SPEAKER_23]: I know what it is.

1224
02:36:18,171 --> 02:36:19,032
[SPEAKER_23]: It's 47-5.

1225
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:20,073
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys just approved it.

1226
02:36:20,573 --> 02:36:32,043
[SPEAKER_23]: And the lawsuit that I gave to you guys in your packet, and I just want to point out to Councilor Lazzaro, this is a United States District Court

1227
02:36:32,743 --> 02:36:37,966
[SPEAKER_23]: District of Massachusetts lawsuit for wage and hour violations.

1228
02:36:38,086 --> 02:36:40,947
[SPEAKER_23]: It's valued somewhere in the couple hundred thousand dollar range.

1229
02:36:41,287 --> 02:36:43,128
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're two separate litigations.

1230
02:36:43,208 --> 02:36:47,870
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to point that out, you know, as people are talking about exaggeration.

1231
02:36:48,110 --> 02:36:48,831
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1232
02:36:49,251 --> 02:36:50,031
[SPEAKER_23]: Appreciate your time.

1233
02:36:52,152 --> 02:36:52,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1234
02:36:53,313 --> 02:36:57,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my point being, I think the comment was made, the words monopoly money were used.

1235
02:36:58,175 --> 02:36:59,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And the point was made that

1236
02:37:01,072 --> 02:37:04,815
[SPEAKER_11]: An appropriation to pay for a settlement must be approved by the council.

1237
02:37:05,575 --> 02:37:11,640
[SPEAKER_11]: You may be well right that something was approved by the school department or something didn't come to the council.

1238
02:37:11,660 --> 02:37:15,003
[SPEAKER_11]: We had that discussion in the past.

1239
02:37:15,043 --> 02:37:16,544
[SPEAKER_11]: The money for that would have to be.

1240
02:37:17,545 --> 02:37:18,946
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I'm saying here.

1241
02:37:19,266 --> 02:37:25,191
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been no appropriation requested or made by this, requested by the mayor or made by this council to pay for

1242
02:37:26,610 --> 02:37:27,950
[SPEAKER_11]: any sort of settlement sum.

1243
02:37:28,571 --> 02:37:30,071
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just going to leave it there, sir.

1244
02:37:30,871 --> 02:37:34,052
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's not, there's not monopoly money activity going on.

1245
02:37:34,332 --> 02:37:35,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just false.

1246
02:37:42,835 --> 02:37:51,826
[SPEAKER_23]: Scarpelli was here when I came up on previous years and handed out the settlements and the lawsuits, they were never approved by the council.

1247
02:37:51,846 --> 02:37:54,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys and I appreciate- That's not the point that's being made.

1248
02:37:54,969 --> 02:37:56,031
[SPEAKER_11]: No, of course it is.

1249
02:37:56,051 --> 02:37:56,611
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

1250
02:37:56,711 --> 02:38:03,039
[SPEAKER_11]: The point that I'm making is that these settlements were approved within the confines of the budget as approved by the council.

1251
02:38:04,028 --> 02:38:08,631
[SPEAKER_11]: No additional money was asked to be appropriated from the mayor to the council to pay for these settlements.

1252
02:38:08,811 --> 02:38:10,632
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not talking about additional money.

1253
02:38:10,672 --> 02:38:18,117
[SPEAKER_23]: What we're talking about is when a lawsuit is settled for $500,000, you guys should approve it.

1254
02:38:18,197 --> 02:38:18,978
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll leave it at that.

1255
02:38:19,938 --> 02:38:27,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, the point being that this council has never been asked to make an appropriation for money beyond the scope of the city budget for settlements.

1256
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,580
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fact, and it is indisputable.

1257
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:30,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not talking in circles.

1258
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:34,241
[SPEAKER_11]: You're saying there's all this extra money that we're being asked to spend on this.

1259
02:38:34,541 --> 02:38:39,142
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm saying that as soon as this is gone, we're going to tax payers money.

1260
02:38:39,162 --> 02:38:41,903
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't get the law, because you own the house.

1261
02:38:42,003 --> 02:38:43,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Steve, you're a big man, aren't you?

1262
02:38:47,175 --> 02:38:51,719
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm giggling about your obvious political attempt to malign the city.

1263
02:38:51,859 --> 02:38:52,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, please stop.

1264
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:53,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve, please stop.

1265
02:38:54,101 --> 02:38:55,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Please stop.

1266
02:38:55,802 --> 02:38:56,823
[SPEAKER_11]: We are paying attention.

1267
02:38:56,843 --> 02:38:58,384
[SPEAKER_11]: You're the one who doesn't know.

1268
02:38:59,265 --> 02:39:01,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins, you clearly have no clue.

1269
02:39:03,868 --> 02:39:04,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

1270
02:39:07,011 --> 02:39:09,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm not the one making it a goof show here.

1271
02:39:11,147 --> 02:39:17,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just commenting, he's the one who's trying to, if we're gonna throw conspiracy theories around in the public forum, they will be combated by this chair.

1272
02:39:20,112 --> 02:39:20,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Harry.

1273
02:39:21,072 --> 02:39:22,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President Collins.

1274
02:39:24,074 --> 02:39:24,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Clown show.

1275
02:39:25,775 --> 02:39:32,838
[SPEAKER_22]: I do wanna underline the point, which is reflected in city paperwork, most of which has already been reviewed by the council in public session.

1276
02:39:36,140 --> 02:39:39,262
[SPEAKER_22]: If one of the points that this conversation is about is,

1277
02:39:41,198 --> 02:39:46,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there secret money being spent on settlements that is not known to counselors, that is not known to the public?

1278
02:39:47,360 --> 02:40:00,706
[SPEAKER_22]: I would offer an amendment or a B paper that this information, if it's provided by the administration, also include legal department, budget to actuals for this fiscal years that are being asked about so that we can, we don't have to,

1279
02:40:01,986 --> 02:40:04,829
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I was going to say we don't have to take it on faith, but it's on the city website already.

1280
02:40:05,009 --> 02:40:12,956
[SPEAKER_22]: We get to see it on paper in the packet that we will receive how much money was budgeted for the legal department and how much was spent.

1281
02:40:15,099 --> 02:40:15,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we do.

1282
02:40:15,759 --> 02:40:16,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

1283
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:16,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Please stop this.

1284
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:18,922
[SPEAKER_22]: And with that, President Perez, that was the question.

1285
02:40:19,322 --> 02:40:20,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you asking for a paper?

1286
02:40:22,005 --> 02:40:27,670
[SPEAKER_22]: I would put that forward as an amendment if the councilor is open to it.

1287
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:35,276
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an amendment to include the budget to actuals for the law department, which of course has been in every city budget for all of those fiscal years.

1288
02:40:35,336 --> 02:40:37,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that amendment acceptable, councilor Scarpelli?

1289
02:40:42,983 --> 02:40:47,346
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to include as part of the report you're requesting that we get the budget to actuals, although we already have it.

1290
02:40:48,527 --> 02:40:50,229
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already in the Warren articles as well.

1291
02:40:54,597 --> 02:40:59,385
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it.

1292
02:40:59,466 --> 02:41:00,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything over $2,500, we should be voting on.

1293
02:41:03,407 --> 02:41:07,789
[SPEAKER_14]: When we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees.

1294
02:41:08,149 --> 02:41:09,770
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the things that I want to show.

1295
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:11,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say monopoly money.

1296
02:41:11,711 --> 02:41:12,831
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm saying is real money.

1297
02:41:12,891 --> 02:41:13,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say you did, sir.

1298
02:41:13,611 --> 02:41:14,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I'm saying it's real money.

1299
02:41:15,532 --> 02:41:16,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's taxpayers' money.

1300
02:41:16,593 --> 02:41:17,993
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why this resolution's come about.

1301
02:41:18,334 --> 02:41:26,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue.

1302
02:41:26,377 --> 02:41:32,280
[SPEAKER_14]: But I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's,

1303
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:37,942
[SPEAKER_14]: There's, and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement.

1304
02:41:38,782 --> 02:41:49,967
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability.

1305
02:41:53,128 --> 02:41:53,789
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, sir.

1306
02:41:53,849 --> 02:41:54,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything to help?

1307
02:41:55,009 --> 02:41:55,990
[SPEAKER_11]: With the point of order?

1308
02:42:00,766 --> 02:42:06,817
[SPEAKER_04]: with my fellow counselors' statement that this has maybe gone astray, I'd like to move the question.

1309
02:42:07,057 --> 02:42:07,498
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1310
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:09,161
[SPEAKER_22]: If I may?

1311
02:42:09,421 --> 02:42:10,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins.

1312
02:42:10,203 --> 02:42:10,804
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to note,

1313
02:42:13,174 --> 02:42:23,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I obviously strongly disagree that there's anything fraudulent going on, but my point with the, including the budget to actuals as context in this information is to illustrate, if we talk about managing money, what does that literally mean?

1314
02:42:24,123 --> 02:42:31,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Where the money comes from, where it goes, the budget to actuals, we don't have to talk about how much money is being spent and where does it come from, we can literally see it.

1315
02:42:31,228 --> 02:42:33,150
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't see why that shouldn't be a part of the conversation.

1316
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:38,054
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, we do already have that information, but I think it makes sense to put all the context next to each other.

1317
02:42:38,074 --> 02:42:40,035
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna split your paper, George.

1318
02:42:40,836 --> 02:42:41,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad you can see it.

1319
02:42:43,114 --> 02:42:45,175
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a huge gaps in what's going on in this community.

1320
02:42:45,835 --> 02:42:54,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff council president mentioned, let's let's talk about it.

1321
02:42:55,378 --> 02:43:00,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we talked about KP law, and they came here during the budget season, and openly said we only spend $50,000 on KP law.

1322
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:00,640
[SPEAKER_14]: But

1323
02:43:02,961 --> 02:43:07,603
[SPEAKER_14]: But using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up almost $500,000.

1324
02:43:07,723 --> 02:43:12,344
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not totally what was in other departments.

1325
02:43:12,744 --> 02:43:17,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory.

1326
02:43:17,546 --> 02:43:19,027
[SPEAKER_14]: These are questions that I brought up.

1327
02:43:19,207 --> 02:43:24,628
[SPEAKER_14]: These are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city.

1328
02:43:24,989 --> 02:43:26,849
[SPEAKER_14]: We've asked for an audit to do this for us.

1329
02:43:26,889 --> 02:43:29,410
[SPEAKER_14]: We've asked for transparency and accountability.

1330
02:43:29,870 --> 02:43:31,451
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the form that we're asking.

1331
02:43:32,431 --> 02:43:33,832
[SPEAKER_14]: move to the question.

1332
02:43:34,132 --> 02:43:35,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get the answers from the mayor's office.

1333
02:43:36,134 --> 02:43:38,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully she does what she's supposed to.

1334
02:43:38,515 --> 02:43:41,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And like Councilor Leming said, that's a great idea.

1335
02:43:41,818 --> 02:43:44,399
[SPEAKER_14]: If she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a form.

1336
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:45,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's it.

1337
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:46,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1338
02:43:46,681 --> 02:43:47,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1339
02:43:48,622 --> 02:44:06,580
[SPEAKER_11]: motion by councillor collins to approve as amended seconded by councillor saying and i just want to go you know we can talk about whatever losing the thread the thread is very clear i have no issue asking the administration as one councillor to compile information that already exists in this way so that it's easy to understand it

1340
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:11,984
[SPEAKER_11]: This council has never appropriated a dollar beyond the city budget for settlements.

1341
02:44:12,865 --> 02:44:21,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And that narrative, I agree, not pushed by you, Councilor Scarpelli, but stated in this forum, is blatant misinformation and will be challenged.

1342
02:44:24,455 --> 02:44:25,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

1343
02:44:25,336 --> 02:44:25,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You have three minutes.

1344
02:44:26,317 --> 02:44:28,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Heath, 131 Fulton Street Road.

1345
02:44:28,699 --> 02:44:32,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're getting a little lost here, too, about this just being about money.

1346
02:44:34,744 --> 02:44:40,625
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big things is why are people being treated in such this way that this money is being spent?

1347
02:44:41,005 --> 02:44:44,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there lawsuit after lawsuit that people are winning?

1348
02:44:45,226 --> 02:44:48,007
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because of the administration in this city.

1349
02:44:49,127 --> 02:44:52,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like George was saying, it's financial mismanagement.

1350
02:44:53,848 --> 02:44:56,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you a quick story about what happened just a few weeks in court.

1351
02:44:58,510 --> 02:45:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we had arbitration a few weeks ago, we had a settlement done with the city, and after six or seven hours in court, the mayor decided, I changed my mind, I need to sleep on it more.

1352
02:45:09,277 --> 02:45:10,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's set up another court date.

1353
02:45:11,158 --> 02:45:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So after somebody goes and tells their family they just got the settlement and arbitration and they're getting this job,

1354
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor changed her mind after a few hours.

1355
02:45:21,121 --> 02:45:26,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And now after spending $2,400 that day, we're going back to court again for another $24 from the city.

1356
02:45:26,904 --> 02:45:31,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost five grand just to spend on court with one case.

1357
02:45:31,866 --> 02:45:34,847
[SPEAKER_03]: The financial mismanagement is just unbelievable.

1358
02:45:35,227 --> 02:45:37,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But why is this happening?

1359
02:45:38,109 --> 02:45:42,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is the city treating its workers in such a way that this is happening?

1360
02:45:43,071 --> 02:45:43,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand it.

1361
02:45:43,971 --> 02:45:45,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't get why.

1362
02:45:46,573 --> 02:45:50,296
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's bringing that up with, it's not just money with these lawsuits.

1363
02:45:50,396 --> 02:46:03,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how are they getting away with the cost of all treating people like this, the workforce that work every single day out there for the city, no matter what understaffed and this lawsuit after lawsuit that we're winning and winning and winning.

1364
02:46:04,268 --> 02:46:06,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that needs to be looked into.

1365
02:46:08,352 --> 02:46:09,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you know,

1366
02:46:11,584 --> 02:46:17,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say it, but I think one of the reasons is the way you just spoke to the public and how you're speaking up there, calling it a clown show and everything.

1367
02:46:17,830 --> 02:46:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making comments and not allowing anyone here to make any comments.

1368
02:46:20,852 --> 02:46:21,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's part of it.

1369
02:46:21,713 --> 02:46:23,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you just know two minutes of comments, Kyle?

1370
02:46:24,015 --> 02:46:28,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I allow everyone to make their comments, but I'm just saying that what you just said, I agree with you a hundred percent.

1371
02:46:28,559 --> 02:46:34,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And my three terms on this council, we have been diligent about asking these questions when we have no formal authority to manage anyone.

1372
02:46:35,265 --> 02:46:35,885
[SPEAKER_11]: You're perfectly fine.

1373
02:46:35,965 --> 02:46:37,806
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to be in control of this hall.

1374
02:46:37,826 --> 02:46:39,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Kyle, I am in control of this hall, and you're just interrupting me.

1375
02:46:39,987 --> 02:46:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in control of the hall, but you're calling at a clown show, comments under your breath.

1376
02:46:43,109 --> 02:46:43,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone can hear you.

1377
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:44,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm aware.

1378
02:46:45,190 --> 02:46:46,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the reason why.

1379
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:47,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the reason why.

1380
02:46:47,271 --> 02:46:49,332
[SPEAKER_03]: They get away with it, is because you're doing it over here.

1381
02:46:49,412 --> 02:46:49,572
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1382
02:46:49,632 --> 02:46:50,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got to say.

1383
02:46:50,253 --> 02:46:51,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Kyle, again, you interrupted me.

1384
02:46:51,893 --> 02:46:53,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have a dialogue with you.

1385
02:46:53,294 --> 02:46:59,297
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, when people interrupt me and they don't allow me to have the dialogue, that's when it becomes out of control, and that's when we have these sessions.

1386
02:46:59,337 --> 02:47:01,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, could I make the point that I was going to make, and then I'll give the floor back to you?

1387
02:47:01,979 --> 02:47:02,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

1388
02:47:03,919 --> 02:47:10,947
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing we all agree on behind this council and behind this rail is we'd like to see the figures presented in a certain way.

1389
02:47:11,168 --> 02:47:19,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think all of us have raised questions about the workplace culture and the management of the city in many different aspects, many different departments.

1390
02:47:20,118 --> 02:47:21,179
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something we all share.

1391
02:47:22,307 --> 02:47:32,999
[SPEAKER_11]: when that gets mixed into a political narrative about overrides and what happens in public meetings and not liking the outcomes of certain city council votes.

1392
02:47:33,400 --> 02:47:34,841
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just said it, we're understaffed, right?

1393
02:47:35,122 --> 02:47:39,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I support an override because we've been understaffed and I think we need more money to get out of understaffing.

1394
02:47:39,983 --> 02:47:55,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think even if everything that was just said happened and every lawsuit that Mr. South just presented to us and everything else, if all that money happened and went out the door for settlements tomorrow, it still wouldn't be reliable recurring revenue to pay people in the long term to address the city's financial issues.

1395
02:47:55,589 --> 02:47:56,510
[SPEAKER_11]: So when that

1396
02:47:57,330 --> 02:48:04,495
[SPEAKER_11]: True thing that I'm saying, it's just statistical fact that the city budget gets lumped in with the settlements and gets politicized around revenue and overrides.

1397
02:48:04,935 --> 02:48:06,196
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when we have a disagreement.

1398
02:48:06,537 --> 02:48:10,439
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when people start yelling from the crowd and breaking the quorum.

1399
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:13,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's when I lose patience with that narrative.

1400
02:48:14,062 --> 02:48:15,043
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree with you.

1401
02:48:15,143 --> 02:48:16,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I have those questions.

1402
02:48:16,243 --> 02:48:17,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I share those concerns.

1403
02:48:17,364 --> 02:48:17,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I raised them.

1404
02:48:18,325 --> 02:48:19,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I raised them when I was sitting there.

1405
02:48:19,546 --> 02:48:21,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to raise them when I'm sitting here.

1406
02:48:21,427 --> 02:48:23,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anyone would say that I'm

1407
02:48:24,488 --> 02:48:26,210
[SPEAKER_11]: their best friend of this administration.

1408
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:29,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to work with them collaboratively because that's what the job of government is.

1409
02:48:29,893 --> 02:48:36,558
[SPEAKER_11]: When the narratives start getting spun up in a certain way to politicize things and attack other things that aren't related to these fundamental factual questions,

1410
02:48:37,742 --> 02:48:38,363
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you gonna do?

1411
02:48:38,683 --> 02:48:39,363
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you gonna do?

1412
02:48:39,383 --> 02:48:41,285
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk all we want up here, but what are we doing about it?

1413
02:48:42,026 --> 02:48:47,731
[SPEAKER_03]: As Mr. Seltz just mentioned, we're going back just four years of this going on, and nothing's been changed.

1414
02:48:49,072 --> 02:48:51,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking at a city charter change right now.

1415
02:48:51,815 --> 02:48:52,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But this isn't just financial.

1416
02:48:53,176 --> 02:48:54,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been four years of lawsuits.

1417
02:48:55,078 --> 02:48:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: What's being changed to look at this administration and say, why are you guys treating the employees this way?

1418
02:48:59,642 --> 02:49:00,543
[SPEAKER_03]: What's being done about it?

1419
02:49:00,563 --> 02:49:04,106
[SPEAKER_11]: We have been exercising our, how many resolutions have we passed on legal issues, George?

1420
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:10,326
[SPEAKER_11]: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.

1421
02:49:07,962 --> 02:49:10,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve was talking about all the meetings he's come and given the report.

1422
02:49:11,187 --> 02:49:12,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen any changes.

1423
02:49:13,111 --> 02:49:14,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't seen anything.

1424
02:49:14,653 --> 02:49:16,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't actually seen one of you guys come down with DPW.

1425
02:49:16,516 --> 02:49:18,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even talked to us.

1426
02:49:18,219 --> 02:49:19,961
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the limit of our authority, Kyle?

1427
02:49:20,905 --> 02:49:21,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

1428
02:49:21,626 --> 02:49:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to know if you can come down to the DW and say hello once in a while, too.

1429
02:49:25,128 --> 02:49:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be nice to see how we're actually doing.

1430
02:49:27,070 --> 02:49:27,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to.

1431
02:49:28,051 --> 02:49:28,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on down.

1432
02:49:28,551 --> 02:49:29,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a call.

1433
02:49:29,372 --> 02:49:33,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice to see you guys, to show that everyone actually cares about us, because we're not getting there right now.

1434
02:49:33,335 --> 02:49:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.

1435
02:49:33,535 --> 02:49:34,756
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd love to come down.

1436
02:49:34,816 --> 02:49:35,377
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd love to do that.

1437
02:49:35,997 --> 02:49:36,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there five years.

1438
02:49:36,698 --> 02:49:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen anyone but Mr. Scalvelli.

1439
02:49:38,619 --> 02:49:40,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been down there, but I'm sorry I missed you.

1440
02:49:41,141 --> 02:49:41,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm there all the time.

1441
02:49:41,922 --> 02:49:42,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1442
02:49:42,462 --> 02:49:44,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe you miss me, but I've been down to the building.

1443
02:49:45,385 --> 02:49:45,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1444
02:49:46,085 --> 02:49:46,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1445
02:49:47,306 --> 02:49:47,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But in any case,

1446
02:49:49,597 --> 02:49:55,100
[SPEAKER_11]: My point being, I don't disagree with what you're saying when it gets wrapped up in all this other stuff, that's the division.

1447
02:49:55,360 --> 02:49:57,941
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not wrapping it up in anything and I will continue not to.

1448
02:49:58,681 --> 02:50:01,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that we can have, I appreciate that.

1449
02:50:01,783 --> 02:50:05,225
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that we can continue to have meetings where we have a respectful dialogue like that.

1450
02:50:05,445 --> 02:50:08,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, instead of yelling from the crowd, thank you.

1451
02:50:11,848 --> 02:50:16,050
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Collins to approve the motion as amended,

1452
02:50:17,697 --> 02:50:20,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion by members of the council or members of the public?

1453
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:23,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1454
02:50:24,041 --> 02:50:24,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan?

1455
02:50:25,301 --> 02:50:25,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1456
02:50:26,442 --> 02:50:27,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

1457
02:50:27,382 --> 02:50:27,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1458
02:50:29,624 --> 02:50:30,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1459
02:50:30,824 --> 02:50:31,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1460
02:50:31,845 --> 02:50:32,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming?

1461
02:50:33,085 --> 02:50:33,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1462
02:50:34,626 --> 02:50:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scripp-Kellyanne?

1463
02:50:35,567 --> 02:50:35,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1464
02:50:35,847 --> 02:50:36,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

1465
02:50:37,168 --> 02:50:37,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1466
02:50:38,188 --> 02:50:38,809
[SPEAKER_07]: President Peters?

1467
02:50:39,129 --> 02:50:39,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1468
02:50:39,509 --> 02:50:41,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1469
02:50:41,430 --> 02:50:42,491
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1470
02:50:43,951 --> 02:50:48,434
[SPEAKER_11]: 24-452 is mine, so Council Vice President Collins can take the chair.

1471
02:50:54,779 --> 02:50:56,880
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to take paper, 24-459, we have multiple appointments?

1472
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1473
02:50:57,041 --> 02:50:58,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we take 2445, if we're gonna do that, 24447, 24448, and 24459?

1474
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:15,522
[SPEAKER_11]: on the motion of Councilor Tseng to take those papers out of order.

1475
02:51:15,542 --> 02:51:34,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1476
02:51:34,632 --> 02:51:36,673
[SPEAKER_09]: The second is Council Vice President Collins.

1477
02:51:40,126 --> 02:51:40,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1478
02:51:40,306 --> 02:51:40,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1479
02:51:40,707 --> 02:51:40,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1480
02:51:41,527 --> 02:51:41,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1481
02:51:41,768 --> 02:51:41,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1482
02:51:58,510 --> 02:52:14,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body confirm the appointment of William O'Keefe, Republican of 18 Kilgore Avenue, to the Election Commission for the unexpired term of the existing vacancy to expire March 30, 2026, in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 51, Section 16A.

1483
02:52:14,149 --> 02:52:17,954
[SPEAKER_11]: William will be present in person or via Zoom for the meeting, and a copy of the appointment letter is enclosed.

1484
02:52:18,414 --> 02:52:19,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1485
02:52:19,935 --> 02:52:21,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Brandon Lugo, current mayor.

1486
02:52:21,356 --> 02:52:29,183
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to add, for folks who may not know about the law, the law requires partisan balance on our Elections Commission to ensure that all parties are represented.

1487
02:52:29,763 --> 02:52:34,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. O'Keefe here is filling the vacant term of the Republican seat that expires March 30th, 2026.

1488
02:52:34,307 --> 02:52:36,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here.

1489
02:52:36,448 --> 02:52:36,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely, yes.

1490
02:52:37,932 --> 02:52:39,633
[SPEAKER_21]: and welcome the opportunity to take any questions.

1491
02:52:40,854 --> 02:52:46,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Lifelong Method resident, father, husband, served on the school committee, attorney.

1492
02:52:47,559 --> 02:52:50,681
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also think that the mayor is doing a wonderful job as well as his council.

1493
02:52:50,761 --> 02:52:56,925
[SPEAKER_21]: So it can be as impossible as impossible can be, but just like anything else, everybody's gotta agree to disagree sometimes.

1494
02:52:57,866 --> 02:52:59,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Think about that, a Republican and a socialist.

1495
02:52:59,968 --> 02:53:00,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1496
02:53:01,609 --> 02:53:02,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Any questions for Mr. O'Keefe?

1497
02:53:03,868 --> 02:53:05,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President Collins.

1498
02:53:05,570 --> 02:53:09,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much for stepping up and putting yourself forward to fill this position.

1499
02:53:09,316 --> 02:53:10,437
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we'd be very lucky to have you.

1500
02:53:10,457 --> 02:53:11,399
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a motion to approve.

1501
02:53:13,361 --> 02:53:16,045
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1502
02:53:16,085 --> 02:53:17,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please file the roll.

1503
02:53:17,187 --> 02:53:19,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have a comment from Mr. Leona.

1504
02:53:20,623 --> 02:53:22,484
[SPEAKER_16]: fun going on 86 Chandler Road.

1505
02:53:22,504 --> 02:53:30,488
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say that I've known Bill O'Keefe as an attorney and somebody that has been so active with Medford Little League.

1506
02:53:31,128 --> 02:53:34,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Back when my three kids started, we had four little leagues in the city of Medford.

1507
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:36,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're down to one.

1508
02:53:36,691 --> 02:53:43,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Bill O'Keefe was the one responsible for negotiating and it wasn't easy to bring

1509
02:53:47,717 --> 02:53:50,898
[SPEAKER_16]: He brought the parties together so that we still have an active.

1510
02:53:56,099 --> 02:53:56,559
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway.

1511
02:53:56,579 --> 02:53:59,140
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as it wasn't during election season.

1512
02:54:01,380 --> 02:54:05,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're very fortunate to have Bill O'Keefe on the Elections Commission.

02:56:05,438 --> 02:56:33,861

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.

1564
02:56:43,958 --> 02:56:45,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Brando Lugo, current mayor.

1565
02:56:45,358 --> 02:56:48,319
[SPEAKER_11]: We did receive an email from the administration that Ms.

[SPEAKER_11]: Schiavone was ill and unable to attend tonight, but there she was, the recommendation of the Tenants Association for the seat that goes to a public housing resident.

1567
02:56:57,902 --> 02:56:58,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion?

1568
02:56:59,202 --> 02:57:00,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President Collins.

1569
02:57:02,521 --> 02:57:07,023
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to approve of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1570
02:57:07,083 --> 02:57:08,183

1571
02:57:12,645 --> 02:57:13,285

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1573
02:57:15,286 --> 02:57:16,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

1574
02:57:16,446 --> 02:57:16,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1575
02:57:17,667 --> 02:57:18,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1576
02:57:19,107 --> 02:57:19,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1577
02:57:19,928 --> 02:57:20,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lemon?

1578
02:57:22,649 --> 02:57:22,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1579
02:57:25,282 --> 02:57:25,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1580
02:57:25,903 --> 02:57:26,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

1581
02:57:26,803 --> 02:57:26,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1582
02:57:27,304 --> 02:57:27,904
[SPEAKER_07]: President Ferris.

1583
02:57:28,024 --> 02:57:28,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1584
02:57:28,425 --> 02:57:31,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I get the motion passes.

1585
02:57:32,008 --> 02:57:32,468
[SPEAKER_11]: 24452 resolution.

1586
02:57:32,508 --> 02:57:33,069
[SPEAKER_11]: This is mine.

1587
02:57:33,249 --> 02:57:34,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you take that chair?

1588
02:57:34,610 --> 02:57:44,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, perfect.

1589
02:57:49,065 --> 02:58:00,835
[SPEAKER_22]: 24452, resolution to support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural substances on the November 5, 2024 general election ballot offered by President Bears.

1590
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:25,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Whereas one in three Massachusetts residents struggle with mental health challenges, and whereas pioneering research from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School find that natural psychedelics can be effective in managing treatment-resistant depression and other forms of mental illness, and whereas the FDA recently granted psilocybin, one of the psychedelics, a, quote, breakthrough therapy, unquote, designation for treatment-resistant depression,

1591
02:58:25,794 --> 02:58:43,709
[SPEAKER_22]: And whereas the ballot question would create a regulated framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy for adults 21 and older, now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural psychedelic substances on the November 4, 2024 general election ballot.

1592
02:58:44,129 --> 02:58:44,510
[SPEAKER_11]: President Burris.

1593
02:58:44,850 --> 02:58:47,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Collins.

1594
02:58:47,232 --> 02:58:49,293
[SPEAKER_11]: The resolution is relatively self-explanatory.

1595
02:58:49,813 --> 02:58:54,277
[SPEAKER_11]: There are five statewide questions and three local ballot questions on the ballot for November 5th, 2024.

1596
02:58:54,517 --> 02:59:03,083
[SPEAKER_11]: This is question four, certified by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, which would legalize certain, decriminalize, I should say, certain

1597
02:59:04,847 --> 02:59:10,048
[SPEAKER_11]: psychedelic substances that have been shown in clinical studies to help address mental health issues.

1598
02:59:11,148 --> 02:59:17,750
[SPEAKER_11]: The decriminalization of these has occurred in other places and it has helped, gone a long way to helping a lot of folks.

1599
02:59:18,510 --> 02:59:29,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally have spoken to a number of advocates, including veterans who would like to see these options provided to them where current other pharmaceutical practices

1600
02:59:30,279 --> 02:59:34,743
[SPEAKER_11]: items in medicines have not been helpful to address their mental health challenges.

1601
02:59:35,624 --> 02:59:47,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this is a limited decriminalization of certain substances that have been seen in clinical studies and by the FDA to be really helpful in addressing serious mental health challenges.

1602
02:59:47,495 --> 02:59:56,003
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hopeful that the voters will approve in November, but also I'm hopeful that the council will endorse this question as well.

1603
02:59:57,654 --> 02:59:58,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Bears.

1604
02:59:58,474 --> 03:00:00,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further comment from members of the council?

1605
03:00:03,797 --> 03:00:05,518
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a motion to approve from Councilor Tseng.

1606
03:00:05,678 --> 03:00:06,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there a second?

1607
03:00:06,459 --> 03:00:07,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by President Bears.

1608
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:10,321
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address for the record, please.

1609
03:00:12,282 --> 03:00:15,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Castagnetti Andrew Cushion Street, East Method Mass.

1610
03:00:17,805 --> 03:00:22,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the chair and over the table, I'd like to address to Councilor Bears.

1611
03:00:27,870 --> 03:00:33,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Totally, I'm 99.9 behind Councilor Bears on this.

1612
03:00:34,813 --> 03:00:43,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's great, because this country has really neglected to study alternative medicines for the longest time.

1613
03:00:44,258 --> 03:00:54,763
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, cannabis, it took them 85 years to legalize it, only after they could figure out a way to tax it.

1614
03:00:56,172 --> 03:00:58,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's call the diamond a diamond and a club a club.

1615
03:00:59,133 --> 03:01:00,454
[SPEAKER_12]: They figure out a way to tax it.

1616
03:01:01,634 --> 03:01:05,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Now on this psilocybin, I'm hearing really good stories.

1617
03:01:07,237 --> 03:01:10,618
[SPEAKER_12]: It's helping people with the PTSD, depression, anxiety.

1618
03:01:11,318 --> 03:01:14,540
[SPEAKER_12]: This could be a natural God's sin.

1619
03:01:14,940 --> 03:01:21,743
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't believe in God, a natural nature's sin that could help a lot of people.

1620
03:01:23,004 --> 03:01:24,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And this should have been done a long time ago.

1621
03:01:25,645 --> 03:01:41,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe Harvard Professor Timothy Leary, back in 1960, was experimented with lysergic acid, and this government should have been right on it, not to lock him up, but to look at the different parts of psilocybin, et cetera.

1622
03:01:43,153 --> 03:01:44,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I commend you, Councilor Pierce.

1623
03:01:45,474 --> 03:01:48,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get it through, no matter what they say.

1624
03:01:49,196 --> 03:01:49,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1625
03:01:52,162 --> 03:01:53,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1626
03:01:53,203 --> 03:01:56,865
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a hand from Councilor Leming.

1627
03:01:58,606 --> 03:02:01,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward.

1628
03:02:02,128 --> 03:02:14,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two...

1629
03:02:16,545 --> 03:02:21,687
[SPEAKER_05]: The advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot.

1630
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two.

1631
03:02:25,528 --> 03:02:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them.

1632
03:02:32,902 --> 03:02:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: One group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use and it would be less regulated.

1633
03:02:45,024 --> 03:03:01,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a,

1634
03:03:02,193 --> 03:03:16,678
[SPEAKER_05]: body, an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them.

1635
03:03:17,278 --> 03:03:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So it turns it into a for-profit, it turns it into a for-profit industry.

1636
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:25,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will be supporting it.

1637
03:03:26,721 --> 03:03:29,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that any

1638
03:03:30,924 --> 03:03:33,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Any progress is good.

1639
03:03:34,287 --> 03:03:44,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago.

1640
03:03:45,034 --> 03:03:47,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you once again for your efforts.

1641
03:03:49,633 --> 03:03:50,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Leming, President Burris.

1642
03:03:51,274 --> 03:03:52,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, thank you, Councilor Leming.

1643
03:03:52,494 --> 03:03:53,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I completely agree.

1644
03:03:54,675 --> 03:04:03,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am hopeful that if this question passes, that the legislature may look to make some technical adjustments after passage as they did.

1645
03:04:04,339 --> 03:04:10,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't agree with all of them on the cannabis law and some of the other ballot questions that have passed to address some of your concerns.

1646
03:04:11,402 --> 03:04:11,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1647
03:04:13,363 --> 03:04:14,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Burris.

1648
03:04:14,932 --> 03:04:20,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Seeing no further comments on the motion by President Behr, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve.

1649
03:04:21,297 --> 03:04:22,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1650
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:26,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1651
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:26,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1652
03:04:26,381 --> 03:04:26,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1653
03:04:26,621 --> 03:04:26,781
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1654
03:04:46,841 --> 03:04:48,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I should have said something.

1655
03:04:49,103 --> 03:04:52,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have enough information to support this tonight, so I'm going to vote no.

1656
03:04:56,310 --> 03:04:58,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1657
03:04:58,292 --> 03:04:58,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1658
03:05:08,362 --> 03:05:09,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Six in favor, one opposed.

1659
03:05:09,523 --> 03:05:10,244
[SPEAKER_22]: The motion passes.

1660
03:05:27,018 --> 03:05:32,363
[SPEAKER_11]: 24446 offered by Mayor Berena Longo-Curran, Brooks PTO Food Truck.

1661
03:05:34,665 --> 03:05:38,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Request for a food truck permit for the Brooks School Fall Festival Bondi Food Truck.

1662
03:05:39,509 --> 03:05:40,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Any discussion or motions?

1663
03:05:41,912 --> 03:05:43,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

1664
03:05:43,313 --> 03:05:46,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1665
03:05:46,216 --> 03:05:47,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1666
03:06:02,756 --> 03:06:02,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1667
03:06:02,896 --> 03:06:02,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1668
03:06:03,016 --> 03:06:03,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1669
03:06:03,237 --> 03:06:03,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1670
03:06:03,457 --> 03:06:03,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1671
03:06:03,998 --> 03:06:04,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1672
03:06:22,461 --> 03:06:23,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Social Services Coordinator.

1673
03:06:23,721 --> 03:06:47,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear President Bears and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve of the following amendment to the revised ordinances, Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formerly included as Article 2, Section 6631 to 6640, by adopting the following language, the language of Capital 11, which shall be amended to replace the title of Community Social Worker with the following title, quote, Social Services Coordinator.

1674
03:06:47,549 --> 03:06:51,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon review by the Health Department, Office of Outreach and Prevention, the term social worker is very specific,

1675
03:06:52,270 --> 03:06:55,573
[SPEAKER_11]: It may require the city to hire a licensed social worker, limiting the pool of applicants.

1676
03:06:55,673 --> 03:07:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon their assessing other municipalities in similar positions, several have social services or human service coordinators for this role and fit within the current cap range in Medford.

1677
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,923
[SPEAKER_11]: The primary responsibility of this role is to connect residents to services.

1678
03:07:07,043 --> 03:07:09,825
[SPEAKER_11]: As the cap would remain the same, there is no change in compensation budget.

1679
03:07:09,905 --> 03:07:11,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1680
03:07:13,629 --> 03:07:14,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Any questions, comments, or motions?

1681
03:07:14,870 --> 03:07:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins.

1682
03:07:17,415 --> 03:07:24,960
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to approve for first reading by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1683
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:28,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless, well, technically there was a motion to approve.

1684
03:07:28,322 --> 03:07:32,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any objection to taking all three readings tonight, or would we like to do a first reading?

1685
03:07:34,966 --> 03:07:35,986
[SPEAKER_22]: No objection.

1686
03:07:36,407 --> 03:07:38,748
[SPEAKER_11]: No objections to moving through all readings this evening.

1687
03:07:39,449 --> 03:07:43,811
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, on the motion to approve for all three readings by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1688
03:07:43,831 --> 03:07:44,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1689
03:08:00,489 --> 03:08:01,389
[SPEAKER_07]: for proof of third reading.

1690
03:08:02,390 --> 03:08:03,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan?

1691
03:08:03,350 --> 03:08:03,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1692
03:08:04,631 --> 03:08:05,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins?

1693
03:08:05,732 --> 03:08:05,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1694
03:08:06,412 --> 03:08:07,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1695
03:08:08,113 --> 03:08:08,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1696
03:08:09,013 --> 03:08:09,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming?

1697
03:08:09,994 --> 03:08:10,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1698
03:08:11,294 --> 03:08:12,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1699
03:08:12,355 --> 03:08:12,555
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1700
03:08:16,016 --> 03:08:16,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor San Buenaventura?

1701
03:08:16,997 --> 03:08:17,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1702
03:08:17,497 --> 03:08:18,077
[SPEAKER_07]: President Pears?

1703
03:08:18,498 --> 03:08:18,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1704
03:08:21,906 --> 03:08:27,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Public participation, to participate outside of Zoom, please email ahertovisa.menford-ma.gov.

1705
03:08:28,048 --> 03:08:33,630
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd like to participate, please come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you.

1706
03:08:33,750 --> 03:08:35,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.

1707
03:08:35,770 --> 03:08:37,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Gaston Fury 61, Stigney Road.

1708
03:08:37,271 --> 03:08:46,554
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to say that I'm appalled at the lack of definitive information that was given regarding the September 3rd

1709
03:08:48,641 --> 03:08:54,064
[SPEAKER_26]: state primary or state representative for the 35th Middlesex District.

1710
03:08:54,464 --> 03:08:55,705
[SPEAKER_26]: There's no Republican candidate.

1711
03:08:55,725 --> 03:08:56,946
[SPEAKER_26]: There's no libertarian candidate.

1712
03:08:56,986 --> 03:09:01,028
[SPEAKER_26]: There's only three candidates in the Democratic ballot.

1713
03:09:01,608 --> 03:09:05,330
[SPEAKER_26]: As such, the primary is the definitive election.

1714
03:09:05,750 --> 03:09:11,774
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would have hoped that this body would have stated that immediately and in a very definitive manner.

1715
03:09:12,134 --> 03:09:13,775
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone should get out and vote.

1716
03:09:14,795 --> 03:09:20,178
[SPEAKER_26]: on the September 3rd primary, because that's going to determine the person that then goes into the general election.

1717
03:09:20,198 --> 03:09:22,140
[SPEAKER_26]: In the general election, there's only one person you can vote for.

1718
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:27,243
[SPEAKER_26]: So the September 3rd state primary is the election that everyone should vote for.

1719
03:09:27,263 --> 03:09:37,790
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the other thing that I'm appalled that there wasn't more a definitive answer to is that I'm here at the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William and Frances Baldwin website.

1720
03:09:38,470 --> 03:09:41,552
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think it was Consuelo Escarpilla that brought up what happens

1721
03:09:42,809 --> 03:09:46,657
[SPEAKER_26]: if someone is registered as a Republican or a Libertarian and

1722
03:09:48,820 --> 03:09:53,083
[SPEAKER_26]: wants to go and vote in the September 3rd state primary.

1723
03:09:53,343 --> 03:09:58,828
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think they wouldn't be able to do so because you have to register it as a Democrat or an enrolled.

1724
03:09:58,908 --> 03:10:10,276
[SPEAKER_25]: And it says here, voting registration deadlines, the deadline to register to vote, update your registration, or change your party is 10 days before any election or town meeting.

1725
03:10:10,336 --> 03:10:12,818
[SPEAKER_26]: So if I go to my calendar, where is it?

1726
03:10:13,379 --> 03:10:16,541
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that puts it on the 24th, which is a Saturday.

1727
03:10:17,782 --> 03:10:42,497
[SPEAKER_26]: anyone that is registered as either a Republican or a Libertarian needs to change their party affiliation to either Democratic or unenrolled by Friday August 23rd according to what this website says because otherwise you're not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates and I would hope that you know this body would definitively state that because it's extremely important right so

1728
03:10:43,498 --> 03:10:53,840
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm not sure that everyone understands that if they are registered as either Republican or Libertarian, that they know that they are not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates.

1729
03:10:55,274 --> 03:11:06,881
[SPEAKER_26]: So anyways, I just wanted to state that, you know, I'm appalled and disappointed to be honest, that I think, you know, I would have hoped that this information was clear and absolutely clear.

1730
03:11:07,221 --> 03:11:08,942
[SPEAKER_26]: And there's absolutely no doubt about that.

1731
03:11:09,022 --> 03:11:12,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, would you like to say like two candidates go from September 13th?

1732
03:11:12,444 --> 03:11:12,904
[SPEAKER_26]: No, no, no, no.

1733
03:11:12,924 --> 03:11:13,505
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just one.

1734
03:11:13,545 --> 03:11:13,965
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

1735
03:11:14,005 --> 03:11:14,745
[SPEAKER_11]: That was corrected.

1736
03:11:15,225 --> 03:11:15,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry?

1737
03:11:15,686 --> 03:11:16,466
[SPEAKER_11]: I did correct that.

1738
03:11:17,207 --> 03:11:18,447
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I know, but it wasn't.

1739
03:11:18,647 --> 03:11:22,409
[SPEAKER_26]: And then about, again, what happens if someone is registered as a Republican or Libertarian?

1740
03:11:22,429 --> 03:11:23,050
[SPEAKER_26]: That wasn't clear.

1741
03:11:23,809 --> 03:11:28,236
[SPEAKER_26]: I think they need to change their party affiliation 10 days before any election.

1742
03:11:28,596 --> 03:11:29,998
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the registration deadline.

1743
03:11:30,039 --> 03:11:31,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, that's right.

1744
03:11:31,401 --> 03:11:32,142
[SPEAKER_26]: That must be right.

1745
03:11:32,202 --> 03:11:33,744
[SPEAKER_26]: Otherwise they're not going to be able to vote.

1746
03:11:34,045 --> 03:11:35,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you making the comment.

1747
03:11:36,268 --> 03:11:37,830
[SPEAKER_11]: As an elected body, we

1748
03:11:39,457 --> 03:11:46,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you start going down that road, you go into the road, not just of advising people how to access information, but suggesting a course of action.

1749
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:52,403
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't believe it is the, that any, you know, the city is, if you call the elections office and you say, how do I do this?

1750
03:11:52,423 --> 03:11:55,825
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll tell you how to do it, but they're not going to say everyone really should do this.

1751
03:11:56,185 --> 03:11:59,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, that's gets to the point of influencing people toward the direction.

1752
03:11:59,746 --> 03:12:01,067
[SPEAKER_11]: It's different than providing information.

1753
03:12:01,127 --> 03:12:02,008
[SPEAKER_26]: No, but what direction?

1754
03:12:02,188 --> 03:12:08,591
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just that anyone that wants to vote, in order to vote in the primary, is going to have to be either registered... I agree.

1755
03:12:08,631 --> 03:12:09,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the other piece of it.

1756
03:12:10,052 --> 03:12:10,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one?

1757
03:12:10,832 --> 03:12:15,115
[SPEAKER_11]: A well-organized Republican write-in candidate could conceivably win the November general election.

1758
03:12:16,038 --> 03:12:16,619
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1759
03:12:17,099 --> 03:12:18,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying.

1760
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:21,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree that on its face, it's not going to happen, right?

1761
03:12:21,923 --> 03:12:22,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not the job.

1762
03:12:23,004 --> 03:12:24,986
[SPEAKER_25]: It's completely unbiased and not political.

1763
03:12:25,006 --> 03:12:33,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, anyone that their election to vote on is September 3, and in order to vote, you need to be able to do it as a democrat, you're on the road, which means that if you are a Democrat, you're on the road.

1764
03:12:33,814 --> 03:12:39,520
[SPEAKER_11]: But to say the election is this day, and what happens in November doesn't matter, that gets down the road of suggesting a course of action.

1765
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:39,920
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1766
03:12:40,561 --> 03:12:40,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1767
03:12:44,611 --> 03:12:54,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further comment by members of the public in person at the podium or on Zoom?

1768
03:12:54,082 --> 03:12:59,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Just want to make sure, seeing no hands on Zoom, seeing no one at the podium, public participation is closed.

1769
03:12:59,948 --> 03:13:00,169
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1770
03:13:00,189 --> 03:13:03,853
[SPEAKER_22]: I would motion to take from the table and approve for third reading.

1771
03:13:04,771 --> 03:13:14,618
[SPEAKER_11]: 24421.

1772
03:13:04,991 --> 03:13:14,618
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Collins to take paper 24421, the South Street Historic District Ordinance and approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Sen.

1773
03:13:14,738 --> 03:13:15,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1774
03:13:15,919 --> 03:13:18,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I can.

1775
03:13:19,022 --> 03:13:26,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to thank Mr. Bader, this morning I talked to, we had some questions that residents had and the reason why

1776
03:13:26,867 --> 03:13:28,268
[SPEAKER_14]: In the past, I voted no.

1777
03:13:28,468 --> 03:13:48,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the questions that were asked by those residents and were clear in those answers, and I shared those answers to those residents that reached out, and I'm in full support with the process as we speak, so thank you.

1778
03:13:48,441 --> 03:13:52,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to note, this is a motion to take from the table and approve, so we're technically not considering it.

1779
03:13:52,743 --> 03:14:09,343
[SPEAKER_11]: uh it yet um so there's no just there can be discussion about whether or not we want to take it off the table or not but we're not gonna happen would you like it to be taken off the table no no you don't yes would you like it to be voted on this evening yes all right that's that's what we can take for public participation that's the motion before us

1780
03:14:12,992 --> 03:14:18,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm guessing that having shepherded it to this point, you'd like us to vote on it.

1781
03:14:20,033 --> 03:14:26,215
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to take from the table and approve for third reading by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1782
03:14:27,555 --> 03:14:28,695
[SPEAKER_11]: The second from Councilor Sviggum.

1783
03:14:29,875 --> 03:14:30,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Keohokalole.

1784
03:14:30,595 --> 03:14:30,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1785
03:14:31,796 --> 03:14:32,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins.

1786
03:14:32,536 --> 03:14:32,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1787
03:14:33,356 --> 03:14:34,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1788
03:14:35,936 --> 03:14:36,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1789
03:14:36,977 --> 03:14:37,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming.

1790
03:14:38,097 --> 03:14:38,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1791
03:14:39,292 --> 03:14:40,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1792
03:14:40,272 --> 03:14:40,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1794
03:14:41,733 --> 03:14:41,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
