1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:06,271
We now have someone who is from here, but is currently in South Korea.

2
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:19,877
And I don't know how many people listening know about South Korea and the way that they have dealt with COVID, but it's very different from how the US has dealt with COVID.

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,058
And so here is Howard Kim.

4
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,539
I'm just gonna pop your name up here.

5
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:31,395
And you are live, so Howard, it's great to see you.

6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,456
It's great to see you as well.

7
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:35,098
Thanks for coming on.

8
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:37,299
Yeah, absolutely.

9
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:38,340
It's great to be here.

10
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:43,784
So I'm a software engineer usually based in the Somerville area.

11
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:48,568
I've lived there for the last 10 years or so, and was there right when COVID broke.

12
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:51,590
And my parents happen to live in Seoul, Korea.

13
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,854
And I got a lot of questions from my friends around early February.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,321
saying, are your parents all right?

15
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:00,201
Are your parents all right?

16
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:02,203
Are you worried about your family?

17
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:21,015
And I was thinking, I'm honestly a lot more worried about my friends and the people around us and myself than I am for my parents, because I knew that the South Korean public health response was more better prepared for what was coming and has kind of been borne out in the numbers.

18
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,158
So I'm going to share a little bit of my personal experience about

19
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:41,896
going to Korea and all of that and what that entails and what I saw on the ground and also the global situation as sort of a grounding factor for people who haven't been looking at the news.

20
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:48,102
So personally, I was in the same boat as everyone else, as everyone is in right now.

21
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,864
I spent about two weeks in isolation.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,222
from mid-March to the end of March, doing the quarantine thing that all the responsible citizens are doing.

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,303
And I realized that it didn't make that much.

24
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,843
I was really lucky to have family in Korea.

25
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,404
So I'm a US citizen.

26
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,304
I was born in the States.

27
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:15,086
And I was a little bit concerned that if I happened to get sick in Korea, I wouldn't be covered with health insurance there.

28
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:21,488
But I was seeing the news reports that was coming in about how there weren't enough ventilators, how there weren't

29
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:35,089
any room in the hospitals and that you have to wait until you're basically, not to be frank, basically at death's door before you'd even be seen by a doctor.

30
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,971
When you say you're hearing this news, you mean in America?

31
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,852
In America, exactly.

32
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:40,572
Yes.

33
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:44,894
And I was thinking that that sounded really scary.

34
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:49,237
So I got onto a plane to Korea and

35
00:02:50,444 --> 00:03:02,893
came and it landed on I think at the end of March so March 30th and immediately got put through an immigration process and a kind of a quarantine process that I'd never seen before.

36
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:11,619
I've traveled to and from Korea a fair bit and basically I was taken to a secure location and tested.

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,362
So basically as soon as I got off the plane I saw

38
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,834
Um, as soon as I stepped out of the airport, I saw like lines of testing booths.

39
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:34,980
So very unlike, um, um, the United States where you can't get a test unless you're, um, although I don't know, it's probably a little bit better now, but, um, at the end of March, you basically could not get a test unless you all basically, you knew you already had it.

40
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:46,919
So, yeah, what I've heard is that it was, at first, you could only get tested, even if you had symptoms, you could only get tested if you had a known contact, if you'd been in contact with someone who was known to have had COVID.

41
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,280
That was how limited the testing was.

42
00:03:49,460 --> 00:04:00,927
And now, then it was if you had symptoms of COVID, they're loosening it up a little bit, but it is still very difficult to get a test.

43
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:02,768
Right.

44
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,052
That's something that was on my mind when I made the move.

45
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:11,394
And then basically as soon as I stepped off the test, I got a free test.

46
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,215
So just to be clear, I am not a Korean citizen.

47
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:17,037
I do not have Korean health care.

48
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,077
I don't have anything like that.

49
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:26,161
But I basically got tested for free by people in proper PPE, protective equipment.

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:35,486
And then I was, for one day, I was taken to a secure location to, with all the other non-citizens while the test results came in.

51
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,607
I was just going to ask if the test results had come back yet.

52
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:37,888
Okay.

53
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:38,448
So yeah.

54
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:39,929
And they came in overnight.

55
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,090
Get the test back.

56
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,052
So came in about six to 12 hours.

57
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:44,833
And then I got to go.

58
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,914
I basically was free to go home.

59
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:55,060
There were a bunch of restrictions as I wasn't a citizen and, you know, coming in from the United States, I was potentially at risk for COVID.

60
00:04:57,232 --> 00:05:03,617
And so I was required to install an app and report in on my temperature two times a day.

61
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,337
Wow.

62
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,818
Which you did yourself.

63
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,400
Yes, exactly.

64
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,363
And my location was being monitored on my phone.

65
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:22,451
So there was sort of an upfront cost that I had to take to kind of make the numbers that you see on television from South Korea happen.

66
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:26,634
But in the end, what I was doing, which is just basically staying at home,

67
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:33,838
wasn't different than what I was doing before I left, in a large way, because I was just staying at home regardless.

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,765
And the really nice thing was that we got sent a care package from the local Korean government.

69
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:46,730
I have some pictures and they're actually kind of ridiculous how much food they sent me.

70
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,633
They sent me a solid two weeks of food to encourage me not to leave the house.

71
00:05:51,826 --> 00:06:02,874
So even though you were tested and your test came back after one day, did they ask you to stay indoors for two weeks or did they just give you two weeks worth of food and then tell you you could go out?

72
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,936
No, it was a requirement.

73
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:19,767
So people who walked around, there was, I think, someone from Britain who walked around and actually had COVID and he basically ignored the app requests and he was forced to leave the country as a result.

74
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,873
So they were taking this very seriously.

75
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:36,559
So this might sound a little bit crazy, but they actually had one unannounced visit where they knocked on my door just to make sure that I was actually at home.

76
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:42,962
So that might sound a little bit ridiculous, but at the same time, that's what

77
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,411
everyone is being forced to stay at home now, right?

78
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:49,992
You mean here in Somerville?

79
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,033
Yes, in the United States.

80
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:53,374
Sorry, excuse me.

81
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:58,458
And now I can go out and I can walk around and I can basically do regular things.

82
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:01,820
So you had two weeks of staying at home.

83
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,941
You got tested.

84
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,222
Your test came back negative.

85
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:05,442
Yes.

86
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:13,788
And then you were at home for two weeks, maybe because there's some chance that you could have had and it hadn't shown up yet on the test for whatever reason.

87
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,381
you stayed home for two weeks.

88
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:20,446
And after that time, now tell us what is your life like?

89
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,049
Okay, so after that time, I got tested again.

90
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:37,141
And something that I glossed over was in that care package was not just food, but there are also masks, there are also there was toilet paper, there was

91
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:43,583
hand sanitizer, basically all the necessities that you would need to stay at home for two weeks.

92
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:44,683
So it wasn't uncomfortable.

93
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,825
And I was staying at my parents' house, which I chose, and you can basically pick your location.

94
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:53,486
Now, when you were staying at your parents' house, did they have to stay home?

95
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,507
So my parents did not have to stay home.

96
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,107
As long as they didn't come into close contact with me.

97
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,188
Okay, great.

98
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:02,128
Yeah.

99
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:06,209
So since then, life has been pretty much normal.

100
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:14,879
When I go outside, I see about over 80 to 90% of people are wearing masks voluntarily.

101
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,821
It is highly recommended.

102
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:20,983
You see advertisements everywhere for public health, on television all the time.

103
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:24,665
So people are definitely still conscientious about it.

104
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:27,927
But for the most part, life is going on.

105
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:33,831
I think that even the movie theaters are open now, which is really nice.

106
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,152
Although, from what I heard,

107
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:41,702
For my friends who actually did go to the movie theater, there were only three people there, and there were two of them.

108
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,323
So they're still taking it very seriously.

109
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:46,586
But restaurants, coffee shops?

110
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,227
Yeah, they have a regular amount of people is what I would say.

111
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,089
The economy took a hit.

112
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,312
It took a hit the same as everyone else did, but it hasn't ground to a halt.

113
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:03,117
Unlike the traffic, which is now back to normal, and it's now very difficult to get anywhere by car.

114
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,279
because people are basically out and about.

115
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:14,303
And that's borne out by the numbers, which shows that for all of last week, the number of confirmed new cases a day was in single digits.

116
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:23,308
And to put that in perspective, Korea was one of the worst hit countries by the outbreak when it first broke out.

117
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:31,732
So now to shift from my personal perspective, where I kind of put in the costs that I had to do, which were honestly were not that severe,

118
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:36,095
putting an app in two times a day, stay home for two weeks, get tested.

119
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,778
All for free, got free care package to kind of incentivize that.

120
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:49,167
On the other end of that, I think at the end of February, there were a couple of thousand cases.

121
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:57,194
There was a large incident with a spreading incident where a lot of people got it all at the same time.

122
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:04,099
So there was sort of a panic response type of deal where the country didn't go into lockdown.

123
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:11,623
People still went to work, but people were advised to wear masks, advised to have hand sanitizer.

124
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:17,547
And you would see hand sanitizer pretty much everywhere for free use in elevators, at restaurants.

125
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:24,101
And the number of cases dropped dramatically.

126
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:29,324
And they had a very robust trace and, what's the word?

127
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:30,444
What am I looking for?

128
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,025
Basically a tracing program.

129
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:44,513
Yeah, where anyone who had come into contact with a known confirmed case was asked to stay at home for two weeks, just as I was, who was at high risk, and then was given testing twice.

130
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,615
And they also implemented the

131
00:10:50,238 --> 00:11:01,247
The drive-through response, which is basically drive-through testing, you could get tested in your car, a lot like getting a coffee from Starbucks or whatnot.

132
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:05,991
And there would be basically no risk of exposure.

133
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:14,497
Can I ask you, where does South Korea get all these tests?

134
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,239
We cannot seem to get tests.

135
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,360
You may not even know this,

136
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:26,988
Why is there such a difference in the ability for people in South Korea to access tests than people like in Somerville, for example?

137
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:31,431
Why can we not access tests here?

138
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,453
So there's a couple of reasons for this.

139
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm going to start with some things I absolutely know are for sure, and then step into things that are less confirmed but still

140
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,124
Probably true.

141
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:53,147
So for sure is that Korea was exposed to exponential respiratory virus in the past.

142
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:58,749
It had SARS in the early 2000s and then MERS again more recently in about around 2016.

143
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:07,652
And so the public consciousness and the government was kind of warned that this was coming like in a very serious way.

144
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:20,779
I think 60 people died from MERS back in 2016, which may not sound like a lot, but when you're dealing with an exponentially growing virus as the way that these things are, that is potentially very scary.

145
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:35,929
And so the public health response has taken this seriously and has had a lot of testing scenarios in place in a way that the USA has not.

146
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:42,004
To move to, so that's why Korea has done very well in this regard.

147
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:43,505
While the U.S.

148
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:52,750
has done so poorly is, I think, a little bit more controversial, but a very large part of it, I think, has just been the federal response.

149
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,433
So from what I understand, in early February, late March, the U.S.

150
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:02,555
government was actually offered a test that was developed internationally.

151
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,835
I heard about this.

152
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:04,916
Yeah, from Germany.

153
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:06,897
And it was turned down.

154
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:29,743
the reasons for which are unclear, but seem to lead to, what is it, the private health insurance company or private health companies looking to use their own testing to help benefit themselves at the potential cost of the public.

155
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:35,767
And so I think that is, whether or not that all of that is exactly as I said it isn't clear,

156
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:46,185
But it does seem to be that the US has a habit of prioritizing private industries rather than the public health at large.

157
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:56,212
And that's something that I think that we're seeing right now, what effect that can have on communities and people and lives.

158
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,175
And I think that that is something that really needs to change.

159
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,637
I don't think at all that

160
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,812
Korean political system is perfect.

161
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:10,915
I think that it has, it's a real country the same as everyone else.

162
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:18,901
If you talk to people, they have the same problems that everyone has with their local politics and their country's politics.

163
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:30,870
But at the same time, I feel like there's a level of trust in the government and more abstractly in science in general to provide answers and

164
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:43,296
Generally, if people say, if people hear on the news science suggests that you should do X because it is best for you and it's going to keep you safe, people will generally abide by that.

165
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,678
I'm not sure.

166
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:50,281
Can I ask, does South Korea have a national healthcare system?

167
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,182
Yes, it absolutely does.

168
00:14:52,762 --> 00:14:58,526
It has basically the equivalent of Medicare for all in which everyone is on

169
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,132
a government-issued health plan.

170
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:06,433
So there are no private options, as it were.

171
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:22,378
I know that South Korea is, actually, of all the world's developed countries, I can think of very few besides the United States that don't have a public health care policy.

172
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:28,900
And I think that shows when private and public interests collide.

173
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,630
And I think that that's really shown in the US today.

174
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,414
So I don't know if that's a little too on the nose.

175
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,440
But if you look at the numbers, it's really quite striking.

176
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:51,369
So Incheon International Airport, which is 300,000 people, excuse me, which is a major international hub,

177
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:57,117
took in 300,000 travelers in the month of March.

178
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:06,665
And not a single equivalent of their TSA, of those employees, not a single one of them have contracted COVID.

179
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,587
Wow.

180
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:09,968
Which is crazy.

181
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:19,957
And when I was walking through the lines, every single person I interacted with that was on staff was wearing PPE, was wearing a mask,

182
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:28,009
The people who were doing the testing were geared up from head to toe in what looked like an astronaut suit, basically.

183
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,451
They just took it seriously because they had seen the power of exponential growth.

184
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:39,013
And just because you can't see it right now doesn't mean that it's not a threat.

185
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:46,055
And they didn't wait until they saw people getting sick to take it seriously, I think is the other thing.

186
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:48,451
Wow.

187
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,932
It is such an amazing story.

188
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:58,215
And I'm so glad that you started with the personal story of your own experience living in Somerville.

189
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,737
And I had not realized that you were here when COVID started.

190
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:14,661
And you decided to go to South Korea knowing that the South Korean reaction to this was going to be much better, was much better, and that you would be both safer

191
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:21,426
and more free to go about your normal daily life in South Korea than here?

192
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,948
Yeah, so I actually wanted to touch on that point a little bit.

193
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:36,070
I think I saw a headline recently that somebody said something about South Korea not really being free because it's tracking people for all of these things.

194
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:41,681
I mean, you can say that, but first of all, your phone is probably already tracking you already.

195
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,523
And by probably, I mean, it's tracking you already.

196
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,184
So that's the unfortunate truth of it.

197
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:53,328
Second is that I had to install an app by the government, but I could uninstall it after that was over.

198
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:58,951
So it's not like I'm being tracked any more than usual after the kind of risk period was over.

199
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:04,813
And third is that I feel a lot freer right now than I did in the United States.

200
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:07,335
I'm very, very lucky.

201
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:18,701
I don't want to stress that enough, that I had the ability to work in a field where I don't have to show up, where I can work remotely.

202
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:22,323
And now in Somerville, you would be forced to work remotely anyway.

203
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:25,505
Like you would still be having to work remotely right now.

204
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:25,925
Right.

205
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,211
That's because we need to.

206
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:33,513
But we needed to a month ago and a month and a half ago as well.

207
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:35,093
We just didn't see it yet.

208
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:38,655
We pretended that the problem was going to go away.

209
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,897
And that's obviously not good public policy.

210
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:45,298
Because the problem is not going to go away.

211
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:51,362
It's still whether it's going to be with us for the next couple months or the next over a year remains to be seen.

212
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:59,025
But South Korea's response sounds like it's just a lot more sustainable than ours.

213
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:18,192
Because you guys are going about mostly about your normal business, but with the testing and tracing program that they have, the contact tracing program, they can contain it very well while most people are kind of going about their daily lives and the economy is not under a huge hit.

214
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,013
Does that sound about right?

215
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:20,053
Yeah.

216
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:23,760
people are really encouraged to get testing as much as possible.

217
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:36,084
So testing costs roughly the equivalent of, I think it's 140 US dollars, so it's not the cheapest thing in the world, but first you can get them, and second, if you test positive, it's free.

218
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:36,944
Right.

219
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:40,845
So it's subsidized by the government, and I think

220
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:46,348
But right now, in the United States, I saw tests being put out there for about $2,000 to $3,000.

221
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,029
Is that incorrect?

222
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:50,150
Is that crazy?

223
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:50,510
I don't know.

224
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,370
We'll have to check.

225
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,290
I really have no idea.

226
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,351
We'll check on that.

227
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:54,131
That might be crazy.

228
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:55,131
It might be right.

229
00:19:55,191 --> 00:20:01,433
I mean, hey, we're in the US, where medical things cost ridiculous amounts of money.

230
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:07,575
Yeah, but at the same time, I've heard that the testing kits are not very accurate.

231
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:09,576
I've heard that they have a 20% to 30% false negative rate.

232
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:13,618
South Korean ones or United States?

233
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,699
No, not the South Korean ones, the United States ones.

234
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,901
The South Korean ones have a false negative rate of, I believe, 5%.

235
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:23,924
So it's not zero, but it's much better.

236
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:29,266
We'll get to our experts and we'll ask about that here as well.

237
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,809
Again, I'm definitely not an expert on the medical side of things.

238
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:39,952
But yeah, from what I can see on the ground, it's really night and day, the difference.

239
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:41,635
So amazing.

240
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:43,776
So we have something to look forward to.

241
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,198
We can get life back to normal and keep this thing under control.

242
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:53,400
So it has been really eye-opening to talk to you.

243
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,201
I appreciate you coming on so much.

244
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:58,622
And I have to say, it is kind of amazing that your Skype feed is great.

245
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,031
half a world away from us.

246
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,852
So good job Skype.

247
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:08,012
Yeah, no kidding.

248
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,192
So yeah, thank you so much.

249
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:12,973
Do you have any last, any final words before we let you go?

250
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,853
Not really.

251
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:16,634
Thank you so much for having me on.

252
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:18,074
It was a pleasure to be here.

253
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:23,735
Really, really fascinating to hear about what life is like there for you right now.

254
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:25,816
And I hope we get there soon.

255
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:27,376
Thank you so much.

256
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:28,236
Great to talk to you.
