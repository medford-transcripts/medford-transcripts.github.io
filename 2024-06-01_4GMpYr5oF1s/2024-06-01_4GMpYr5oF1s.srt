1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:13,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, welcome everybody to the... Welcome everybody to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee of March 13th, 2024.

2
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, can you please call the roll?

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kelly?

4
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:15,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

5
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

6
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

7
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:19,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Strunk-Kelly?

8
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see him on Zoom.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

10
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

11
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:27,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Leno?

12
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:28,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

13
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:42,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, Councilor Scarpelli was at the previous meeting, but might be, oh, Justin Singh is, yep.

14
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:57,041
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we'll wait a little bit for Councilor Scarpelli, but I know he was at the previous meeting, so he should be here momentarily.

15
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:11,997
[SPEAKER_07]: The only discussion item on the agenda for tonight is 24-015 offered by Councilor Tseng, resolution to discuss modernizing council communications and outreach strategy.

16
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any presentations on the floor, Councilor Tseng?

17
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chair LeMing.

18
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:29,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to go back to sharing the slides that I shared with everyone last meeting, just to reorient ourselves in this meeting.

19
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second as I set that up.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to say there is a

21
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:52,236
[SPEAKER_07]: motion in the previous meeting, which was passed for Council members to submit their ideas for modernizing City Council communications.

22
00:01:54,617 --> 00:02:02,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody submitted anything in the meantime, so just provide an update on that.

23
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:07,425
[SPEAKER_07]: In any case, feel free to go on with the presentation.

24
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:08,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

25
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:15,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a chance to sit down with communications director Smriti last week, walking through the ideas.

26
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the summary of our meeting was that he's very, very supportive of the council taking up a lot of these most, if not all of these initiatives.

27
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:29,742
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me that he's worked in many municipalities and governments in the past.

28
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was strange to him that the legislative branch did not.

29
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:35,486
[SPEAKER_02]: the mayor's newsletter.

30
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,388
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have any communications of their own.

31
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he said he would be supportive of it that he would support us in, um in distributing as well.

32
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:47,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said, um, pending an approval from the chief of staff.

33
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks it would be appropriate to, um, boost our monthly newsletters in the mayor's newsletter.

34
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:55,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Um newsletters as well to

35
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:08,225
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want to use the city's email list, he would help us get access to it.

36
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also suggested that we work on further developing our own email list.

37
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the clerk has one.

38
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:21,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a good jumping off point, potentially, for the distribution of the newsletters.

39
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:29,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But going really quickly back, so the press releases slash monthly summaries is the main idea

40
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: is I think it's the headline piece of the communications reform package, essentially to remind residents.

41
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, one moment.

42
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Ms.

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaya said the sound is not working for the public in the chat on Zoom.

44
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:49,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Apologies.

45
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:50,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

46
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let us know when.

47
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:54,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

48
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:03,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

49
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

50
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

51
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:10,358
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

52
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Apologies continue.

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng sorry for the interruption.

54
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

55
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so from last week's discussion and from my discussion with Steve, the, um.

56
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:28,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The monthly summaries basically would be created by a rotating group of Councilors who sign up for this duty.

57
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:36,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would be best if Chair Leming created the schedule of Councilors who were interested.

58
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:48,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially each month, this committee at the beginning of our meeting, we would vote and approve a summary of that month's city council activities to go out to the public.

59
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically just a summary as some Councilors are already doing.

60
00:04:52,589 --> 00:05:02,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reason why we have decided on the rotating structure is that a lot of our Councilors have individually started newsletters at some point.

61
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:06,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it gets to be a lot, we all kind of drop off after a few months.

62
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:11,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we go back into it, but it's really difficult to sustain over a long period of time.

63
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we believe that creating the system where we have

64
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:30,986
[SPEAKER_02]: a duty to bring something in on a calendar system, but also something that's not too demanding on councillors is the best system, and I think the rotating system is that solution.

65
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would actually move.

66
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:58,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I have sent the text of these motions to the clerk, but on the newsletter item, and we can vote on these at the end of the meeting, but I would motion to start a city council newsletter to summarize important city council meetings and discussions, as well as inform the public as to upcoming meetings to be distributed prior to

67
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:03,584
[SPEAKER_02]: and approved at each meeting of the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement.

68
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second on that motion?

69
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:15,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan.

70
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I do have a clarifying question.

71
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:25,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure we're talking about an email newsletter specifically, or do you mean more broadly the sense of a newsletter that could be email and other things as well?

72
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more broadly.

73
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:31,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is this newsletter, this monthly newsletter slash summary,

74
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:39,304
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the kind of baseline for us to create short form videos informing residents on.

75
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:42,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't know whether when you said the word newsletter.

76
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,709
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's a great clarifying question.

77
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That you meant the email part of it, or if you were talking more broadly.

78
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:47,334
[SPEAKER_02]: More broadly.

79
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:47,854
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

80
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:48,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

81
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:49,276
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great question.

82
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

83
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:56,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and I would, there's a second motion that I think we would need to make.

84
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:19,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to move for the chair of the committee on resident services and public engagement to create and distribute a sign up list slash sign up survey of Councilors who will rotate responsibilities in writing the city council newsletter and or making short form video summaries in collaboration with the Medford community media and to authorize the chair to create a calendar for these responsibilities.

85
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,270
[SPEAKER_08]: on the second, but also a question.

86
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:24,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

87
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

88
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:27,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

89
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:38,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I I'm assuming that this, um, sort of voluntary sign up will be available to all because and not just those are this committee.

90
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's the that's the intention.

91
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:43,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can add in language in the motion to clarify that.

92
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:47,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can email the clerk after I'm finished speaking.

93
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good detail to pick up on.

94
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of speaks to, I'm going to go quickly to this slide, the idea of creating short form videos.

95
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:07,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that some residents, especially for younger residents, it's easier to engage with government in a visual form rather than in reading.

96
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And so creating a short form video, nothing more than a minute or two,

97
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:19,687
[SPEAKER_02]: that summarizes what we've written in the monthly summaries, I think would be really helpful, particularly for residents closer to my age.

98
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:30,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would be the algorithms on social media apps also do tend to promote this stuff, too.

99
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:39,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we want this, if we want our contents to be going out to a wider audience rather than a limited audience, I think it would behoove us to create short form videos.

100
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the same time, we talked to Kevin from Medford Community Media last week.

101
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,517
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically gave us the structure of how we would execute this.

102
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:59,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And so essentially what we do is, Councilors who are interested in doing this would create their own Medford Community Media accounts.

103
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: they can go into the studios to record or record something at home and send it into To the Medford community media and they can post it on their website and have it run on the loop on public access TV Yeah, so that that's a short form video part I wanted to to talk about it real quick because that was in the last motion as well Now I would also like to

104
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: On the idea of distribution, I think there's continuous work to be done on making sure this reaches the widest audience possible.

105
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:51,606
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that a lot last week, from using city email lists to developing our own, to creating social media accounts, to working with a senior center to put in their newsletter as well, to working with whatever forms of print media might arise.

106
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to create a cash haul motion

107
00:09:56,331 --> 00:10:09,306
[SPEAKER_02]: to authorize the chair or a designee from this committee to work on that process continuously, to basically empower the chair or that designee to work on it.

108
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,075
[SPEAKER_02]: to work on creating those connections.

109
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:26,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would like to move for the chair of the committee on resident services and public engagement and or his designee to work with our communications director and other city staff to distribute the city council newsletter and create an email list for the city council to use.

110
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a second for that motion first?

111
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,944
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you, Councilor Callahan.

112
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,805
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we do it, if it comes to me for questions.

113
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:38,265
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's great.

114
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,266
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the questions are really helpful, yeah.

115
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:57,490
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems to me that in addition to an email, like having our own email list, specifically because of the laws around opt-in, that any list really should, if you want to have an email list, then you'll have to be opt-in.

116
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:04,311
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want for people to be able to get access to this information, they should be able to opt in.

117
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:08,512
[SPEAKER_08]: They should also be able to follow a social media account on their preferred social media platform.

118
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:14,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want you to reread that.

119
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,595
[SPEAKER_08]: But to me, that sounds a little vague.

120
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,135
[SPEAKER_08]: The language, I wasn't sure exactly what you meant by it.

121
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wonder if we can

122
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:37,190
[SPEAKER_08]: very specifically have something that's more talking about the creation of, um, followable distribution platforms, which would include things like an email list that people can opt into, um, a, uh,

123
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:45,108
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, an X account, a YouTube account, you know, blah, blah, blah, like accounts on those specific platforms.

124
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a motion coming up that addresses that.

125
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do this motion slightly before, but since you're talking about that already, I can go to this slide.

126
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:59,038
[SPEAKER_02]: On the topic of the email list, I've included that in this motion to create an email list.

127
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what's the third motion?

128
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:06,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first motion is to create the newsletter.

129
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: The second motion is to create a list of councillors who will rotate responsibilities.

130
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The third motion that I just read out is basically to work with city staff and the comms director to develop ways for outreach, for distribution.

131
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,387
[SPEAKER_02]: and to create an email list for us to use.

132
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:30,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way to do that might actually just be working with the city clerk.

133
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:36,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it'd be something that we should work on.

134
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That might take quite a while to set up.

135
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we should empower someone to work on that outside of a committee meeting.

136
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,771
[SPEAKER_08]: When you say that, it might take a while to set up.

137
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The email list, yes.

138
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,951
[SPEAKER_02]: On the topic of social media, because you brought that up,

139
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:58,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on the question of distribution, it's really important to find as many ways to distribute as possible.

140
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:04,656
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said, it's important for folks to be able to follow on their preferred networks.

141
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think

142
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:22,264
[SPEAKER_02]: with that goal of distributing news in a more rapid manner, in a way that folks prefer, in a way that is more casual and accessible and widespread.

143
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted our committee to discuss a little bit the creation of social media.

144
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:31,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a little bit more complex, and so I wanted to get feedback from the committee first about it.

145
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see Steve has his hand raised and I want to give him, I would love to give him a chance to speak.

146
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, Mr. Smierti.

147
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you be unmuted?

148
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thanks for having me, Steve Smerdy, Communications Director.

149
00:13:54,918 --> 00:14:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to, just to clarify, we can definitely, the city can definitely help with promotion of the newsletter or any other type of outreach you're doing.

150
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:13,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when I was talking to councilors saying, I just mentioned that I think the actual distribution though should be coming from the city council side.

151
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:19,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, whether that's the clerk or a designated member of the council that's sending out the communications, I think,

152
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be kind of a more effective use.

153
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then in terms of assisting just with, you know, any other types of if you want suggestions or insights or help setting up accounts, things like that, then obviously more than happy to help.

154
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:41,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

155
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Steve.

156
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for clarifying.

157
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:56,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what I meant was just more for, you know, like the mayor's newsletter does link often to other newsletters.

158
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:01,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I was more referring to, and Steve can nod if that's possible.

159
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,021
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave us a thumbs up.

160
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like that, maybe putting in when we have something really important, putting in a few points for us.

161
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:16,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did talk and he did think keeping the independence of the city council is important.

162
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:22,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having us develop our own systems for distribution will be really important as well.

163
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:36,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We only have one person raising their hand at the moment, so Ms.

164
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:40,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaya, would you prefer to speak?

165
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Councilor Bizarro.

166
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:52,990
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Patty Kaya, One Monument Street, and I'm sorry if this isn't the appropriate time in the meeting.

167
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, I don't know the protocol.

168
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,112
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a question and also a comment.

169
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:03,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think my comment is this is a great idea.

170
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:10,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to improve constituent communication and to reach constituents where they live in terms of demographics.

171
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:13,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Young people prefer certain mediums that

172
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: older constituents might appreciate the newsletter.

173
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:22,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a great mix and I appreciate the initiative to improve and expand communication.

174
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:28,829
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have one concern and it might be a question for the communication director with the city.

175
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:36,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like as a constituent to understand the boundaries of official communication

176
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:44,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any policing of what constitutes official communication?

177
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:58,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm concerned that this type of informal communication could easily go from simple fact-based reporting of events that have occurred and will

178
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:03,799
[SPEAKER_01]: occur in the future, opportunities for constituent participation.

179
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:18,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concerned about spin, just to be quite honest with you, that this could easily devolve into furthering each or any one of your sort of political platforms.

180
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:21,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I'd like to understand better

181
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:34,365
[SPEAKER_01]: what the mechanisms are so that official communication is one thing in the world, and then your personal opinions is something else, and how you represent it to the public, kind of that dividing line matters.

182
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:39,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I know it's a big question, but I'm, I would like to understand it better.

183
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:40,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

184
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Smearty.

185
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks, Patty.

186
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:57,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess are you kind of, are you just talking about how you kind of differentiate between official government communications and then like campaign communications?

187
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:02,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess if that's... I think that's a good question, yes.

188
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

189
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a body, I think, or a an agency that kind of is the one that oversees, you know, whenever you kind of use your government.

190
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:21,033
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the word for it?

191
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:24,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like whenever you're in a government setting and you're campaigning when you shouldn't be.

192
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget exactly what agency that is, but.

193
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, that is something that is self-policed.

194
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know, obviously, from the communications that we put out, the mayor has her own official government social media platforms, the newsletter, the website.

195
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,942
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all her government page.

196
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:52,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a government employee, obviously, I don't put out campaign communications.

197
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,725
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my job.

198
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:56,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be against the law, obviously.

199
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:06,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't think that whatever is being put out on the city council side is right.

200
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:07,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're correct.

201
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:10,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It cannot be anything that's campaign related, but I don't.

202
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that, I guess, as a, as an issue so much is because that's kind of how.

203
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everyone understands, I guess, the ethical component of that.

204
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be putting out kind of their government work.

205
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I assume their campaign things will be supported on their campaign pages.

206
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:33,013
[SPEAKER_03]: know that answers the question.

207
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a little complicated.

208
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:39,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't exactly have the mechanism for which that's kind of that oversight happens.

209
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:48,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But just in my experience, people tend to abide by that rule, because you can, it's definitely unethical.

210
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think legal, I didn't get fined, I don't I don't exactly know what what happens, but something that's very strict.

211
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So

212
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:03,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, there's two at the moment, but Ms.

213
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Kea, did you have a follow-up that you wanted to add to that?

214
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: You raised your hand again.

215
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure if that clarified the question for you.

216
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Just I was going to answer the question.

217
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to help answer.

218
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:18,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I wouldn't mind if you could give me just another second to clarify.

219
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not talking about pure campaigning.

220
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:30,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to understand better how in this forum that you're suggesting, how you enforce

221
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:43,549
[SPEAKER_01]: news versus propagating an opinion about, like, I'll give you an example because I'm obviously doing a very poor job of explaining this.

222
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, I attended last night's meeting.

223
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:51,259
[SPEAKER_01]: which I thought was a massacre, no matter what side of the issues you were on.

224
00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:07,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that came to mind when I heard this proposal was, huh, so how would members of the city council characterize the work that was done last night if they were using all of these very informal social media channels, for example?

225
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:14,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Councilor Lazzaro was

226
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:21,036
[SPEAKER_07]: first, but Councilor Tseng if you could answer if you want to provide an answer to the question, I would like to answer.

227
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:27,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that Steve had his hand briefly raised if he if he wants to speak to that first, that would be helpful.

228
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:38,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, look, I don't want to I don't want to talk for city council members, but I know, you know, in terms of the mayor's communications, like, I mean, the mayor is going to put out her own opinion on policy.

229
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,231
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of like that's what she'll do.

230
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:43,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's her prerogative as an elected official.

231
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:48,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So I I'm not exactly sure, I guess, then what

232
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: what your question is kind of referring to, just because I think as elected officials, you're going to be in a position to advocate for your stance.

233
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:05,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a government, it's part of your government job.

234
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, I guess, my answer to that.

235
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

236
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:26,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So every elected official has an obligation to tell their constituents what they're working on, and we have been kind of remiss in not carrying out that part of our job thus far.

237
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:33,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say about what happened last night is we voted on, so for example, about the

238
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,815
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate transfer fee.

239
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:48,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say last night at the meeting, we heard public comment and we voted to send the real estate transfer fee to the planning and permitting committee.

240
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:52,752
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what happened.

241
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:58,976
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what we, like, if that's the information that we were sharing in the newsletter, that's how I would present it.

242
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:06,500
[SPEAKER_00]: But every government, every elected government official is sharing information with their constituents about what work they're performing.

243
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,444
[SPEAKER_00]: And constituents can be in favor of that work or not in favor of it in the same way that we would share information about like the vote to,

244
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:28,353
[SPEAKER_00]: in favor of a ceasefire, that then we shared a letter that we sent to our federal delegation that was then shared with President Biden.

245
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:32,276
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just share it as like, this is what we voted on and this is what was passed.

246
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:35,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the other things that happened during the meeting.

247
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,701
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just, I think that's how it would go.

248
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:43,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why we would have a rotating group of

249
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:49,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Councilors participating in this is so that it wouldn't really be editorialized, but it's not.

250
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,441
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really something that you can editorialize.

251
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:56,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of going through what we're what we're doing and how the votes went.

252
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,046
[SPEAKER_00]: If that clarifies things.

253
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:00,028
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.

254
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Councilor Lazzaro put it really well.

255
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:10,968
[SPEAKER_02]: The vision of this is just to say, we voted on this item, this is how that vote went, and link to that item as well.

256
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:17,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And occasionally, if we're just doing a release about one agenda item, posting the text of that resolution as well.

257
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:22,437
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, I spent quite a lot of time thinking about how we could make this

258
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: as official and as not politicized as possible.

259
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:44,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, as Councilor Lazzaro referred to, that is the idea of having this rotate amongst a lot of different councilors to have that switch, and also to make sure that we are approving them as a committee together.

260
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:48,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Councilor Scarpelli is usually here.

261
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:50,829
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't really miss any of these meetings.

262
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:58,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, there's a reason, I mean, there's a reason why he's on this committee in the first place, but there's also a reason why, why I

263
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,342
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to have this committee approve it, right?

264
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:10,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Because him and I, we don't usually vote the same or we vote the same way half of the time, but we have our major disagreements.

265
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:14,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure that he feels comfortable with those press releases that we're sending out as well.

266
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:20,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the idea of having it approved by a body of five people first.

267
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:22,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

268
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

269
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with both of y'all.

270
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to add that I'm probably even more excited to put into the newsletter things that are upcoming than things that already passed, because that allows for people in the community to participate in the decisions to be involved in engaging in democracy.

271
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are difficult to spin.

272
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:49,324
[SPEAKER_08]: We simply just state what is coming up and what is going to be on the agenda.

273
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And that way, people will know

274
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,167
[SPEAKER_08]: when to come if they want to speak out about something.

275
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:54,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

276
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

277
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:17,381
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, I think one of the most important things that came out of the meeting last night to me was that a lot of people were uncertain about what was being discussed and there had been a lot of misinformation and rumors that had been going around misleading people and a lot of people were here because they were angry about something that was not true.

278
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:24,209
[SPEAKER_00]: was not true information about what we were going to be talking about, that I learned from talking to people after the meeting.

279
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:31,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could have avoided that if we had been already implementing something like this kind of system.

280
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:41,293
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had already had stuff on social media that was clarifying the stuff, we could have headed off some of those misinterpretations of what we had been trying to do.

281
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:47,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited for this kind of process to avoid situations like that in the future.

282
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:52,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that the short video format will be really good for that.

283
00:26:52,971 --> 00:27:01,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll catch people's attention and it'll be able to clarify things really quickly as you're like scrolling through and it's part of your day.

284
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:10,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has like a big chunk of time to devote to learning about what's going on in city council or what's coming up in city council.

285
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:20,706
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to apply to their life, but they might have 30 seconds to see, oh, there's gonna be a discussion that's really important to me coming up.

286
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:22,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be at that meeting.

287
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:30,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't apply to them, or if it's something they already like the idea of, and they sort of trust us to go ahead, then they know about that too.

288
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:39,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think all of these things are really important going forward, and it's just gonna help us all work together to make sure that we're doing things

289
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,963
[SPEAKER_00]: work for the most people possible.

290
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:57,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess just to offer my own point of view on the question, as part of my campaign website and whatnot, I maintain a blog and a newsletter myself, and that's just

291
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,751
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much the form where I say whatever's on my mind is directly as informal as possible.

292
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:08,074
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is a distinction between that and something coming out of an official government body, in my view.

293
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:23,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally would see the newsletter as just straight up facts about what is actually being discussed in City Council, what we're doing, what we're voting on, what we have voted on.

294
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that if

295
00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:34,286
[SPEAKER_07]: if we were voting on something that were coming out of my personal campaign website that there would obviously be a lot of disagreements on that.

296
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:46,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're as a city council voting on something that is just supposed to be very fact based, then that's everybody can agree on, you know what we're discussing and what we're doing.

297
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:52,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really just the goal would really just to be keeping keeping people informed of current activities.

298
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

299
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

300
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so

301
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:03,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume this is because I only had four hours of sleep, although it could also be because you only had four hours of sleep when you wrote these.

302
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:08,999
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't fully understand the first three motions.

303
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's okay with you, because, hey, we're in a body where words matter, do you mind reading those slowly?

304
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:21,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I will probably make slight amendments just to the wording to make sure that that wording is easily understood by everybody.

305
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:21,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

306
00:29:22,106 --> 00:29:22,386
[SPEAKER_08]: One at a time.

307
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:22,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

308
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:23,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

309
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:26,729
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion of Councilor Callahan to have Justin Tseng read all the motions.

310
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be happy to read them without emotion.

311
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:49,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very first one is the motion to start a city council newsletter to summarize important city council meetings and discussions, as well as inform the public as the upcoming meetings to be distributed prior to and approved at each.

312
00:29:51,629 --> 00:30:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I should amend this to say to be distributed to committee members prior to and approved at each meeting of the committee on resident services and public engagement.

313
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:07,065
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing for me is the word newsletter to me, it means email newsletter.

314
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wonder if we can call it a communications plan or communications or I'm not sure.

315
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:18,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's a better word and if everybody else thinks it's fine, that's fine with me.

316
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:22,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But like I was confused when I really thought you meant an email newsletter.

317
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I defer to my colleagues.

318
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:32,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally think newsletter is the best, the best description for that kind of thing.

319
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

320
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:46,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause well, I feel like people that are more like certain generations would understand a newsletter is like an email older generations might understand the newsletter and it's more original, like physical things.

321
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:47,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

322
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:52,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's pretty much the clearest word we're going to get out of this multi platform.

323
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:54,976
[SPEAKER_08]: That just, that just feels like it.

324
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's difficult because... If you guys understand it, that's fine.

325
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:03,535
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it meant something different from what you meant.

326
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I get what you're saying.

327
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely understand what you're saying.

328
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:13,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that it's one of those things where I feel like attempts to come up with another word would just make it a bit more muddled.

329
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just me, though, personally.

330
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with multi-platform in particular, I see this written newsletter as the basis of everything else.

331
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:34,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we say multi-platform, we might fall into the space of we don't know if we would have to keep voting on every single video that we send out.

332
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:36,456
[SPEAKER_08]: What if we say monthly newsletter content?

333
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:40,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Newsletter content.

334
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:40,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

335
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd be happy with that.

336
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:52,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we can we can decide at a further time what exactly to call it if we want but no, I just Only because it meant something different to me than what you meant.

337
00:31:52,095 --> 00:32:06,605
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason so thank you I think this is something that we can uh, we can just say newsletter content for now and then at our upcoming meeting where we do I assume we'll have

338
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,289
[SPEAKER_08]: and when we will have perhaps left a little bit more.

339
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:10,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

340
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

341
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, well, with the with with the plumbing meeting next month, I'm assuming that we'll have one draft on our desks.

342
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:21,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, we can we can workshop it.

343
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:22,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't realize.

344
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,299
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's a great point.

345
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:33,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The second motion was a motion for the chair of the committee on resident services and public engagement to create and distribute a

346
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:57,910
[SPEAKER_02]: sign-up lists of, I guess, instead of sign-up lists, maybe sign-up form, sign-up form of councillors who wish to rotate responsibilities in writing the city council newsletter content and or making short form videos, summaries in collaboration with Medford Community Media and to authorize the chair to create a calendar for these responsibilities.

347
00:32:58,091 --> 00:33:01,353
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it specifically includes any city councilor, not just this

348
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll make sure that yeah, beautiful.

349
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:05,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

350
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:10,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

351
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a second.

352
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:17,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best way to do that would be to say to create and distribute a sign up form.

353
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:24,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a sign up form and distribute to city councilors to all city councilors who wish to rotate responsibilities.

354
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah.

355
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:34,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also going to resend this in a new email to you.

356
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:39,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get the original email?

357
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:40,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the original.

358
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already pasting it in the report.

359
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be easy for me to type in just the individual edits.

360
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:46,147
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

361
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:56,334
[SPEAKER_05]: The second motion should be that we open the email to not just your member.

362
00:33:56,554 --> 00:33:57,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

363
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:57,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

364
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:58,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

365
00:33:58,876 --> 00:33:59,436
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it is.

366
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:02,012
[SPEAKER_02]: great.

367
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:20,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third motion you asked me to read out was a motion for the chair of the Committee on Resident Services and Public Engagement and or his designee to work with our communications director and other city staff to distribute the City Council newsletter content and to create an email list for the City Council to use.

368
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:20,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

369
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:21,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

370
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:22,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

371
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:26,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Just adding the word content.

372
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,065
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it.

373
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I think at this point... I just had a question.

374
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:43,533
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be something that Steve can answer, but in terms of getting the email list, what would... Is there any... I understand we just talked about opt-in laws.

375
00:34:43,553 --> 00:34:48,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this was covered earlier on in the meeting, but where would we get the emails from?

376
00:34:48,277 --> 00:34:53,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Would we be like... Yeah, Councilor Callahan, the clerk.

377
00:34:55,464 --> 00:35:04,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was just going to say like, you know, if the mayor helps distribute or any of these other email lists agrees, then what they do is they don't just distribute our content as if it's theirs.

378
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:09,329
[SPEAKER_08]: They say, you know, sign up here, like here's the content sign up here.

379
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And that gives everyone on their list the opportunity to opt in.

380
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:21,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if I might jump in quickly, I, for my conversations with Steve, it seemed like that was actually the main thing that he could do in helping us is, um,

381
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:33,987
[SPEAKER_02]: like what they do with other departments and their newsletters put in a link on the newsletter saying here's a new city council newsletter sign up.

382
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:41,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to provide a little context for what we do in the clerk's office with council meeting agendas and committee agendas.

383
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:57,912
[SPEAKER_06]: We, as a matter of course, in addition to physically posting it in the office and then posting it on the website, as a matter of course, we send it to an email distribution list, which includes all users in the city of Medford.

384
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:04,517
[SPEAKER_06]: email system, and then there is an opt-in that's been created over the last several years.

385
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:14,763
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot more opt-ins than there are opt-outs because everything has to be, I can't just blindly send somebody a newsletter, they have to opt-in for it.

386
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:19,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if that's the council agenda and it's an official communication, they still need to opt-in for it.

387
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:21,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sort of have a

388
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: rather clumsily curated email list that gets copied and pasted into an email that goes out every time we distribute a council agenda or a committee agenda.

389
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: But the important part that I'm taking a long time to get to is that it's entirely an opt-in system for the Medford residents and other constituents who want to see those agendas.

390
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:45,916
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may?

391
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I just saw that Steve had his hand raised on Zoom.

392
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Councilor Tseng.

393
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the clerk's point, I think that's a great basis for us to go off of.

394
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:12,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be something that we can do as a committee is find ways to publicize the opt-in and to really do some work into building that email list up.

395
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:18,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the clerks work really hard to get the list to where it is right now, but we all have our personal networks as well.

396
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:36,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Our own constituents who reach out to us and want to learn more and if we if we can point them to that direction say Here's a link to opt into this list And we're gonna start posting newsletters on that list then that might be it Put it in your email signature Steve

397
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no I was gonna add to in addition to adding it to the news to the mayor's newsletter.

398
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:53,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also obviously add just a direct sign up link on the city council page.

399
00:37:54,388 --> 00:38:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever went to our alerts page but that's, we usually try to plug that pretty periodically for sign ups, and then it allows people to go directly into our like

400
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,536
[SPEAKER_03]: or newsletter platform to sign up.

401
00:38:10,337 --> 00:38:12,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not entirely sure.

402
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if Councilor Tseng mentioned the platform that you wanted to use for this system.

403
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:22,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We use Constant Contacts as well as other departments, I think Health Department and PDS do as well.

404
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:25,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been really effective for us getting signups.

405
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty easy system to use also to create.

406
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be my recommendation.

407
00:38:33,328 --> 00:38:39,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was not aware of the sign up for the email for the agenda.

408
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just curious how that works.

409
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,387
[SPEAKER_03]: How do residents sign up for that?

410
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Clark, yeah.

411
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:56,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I should also add that before we started this new software, Steve and Emma in the communications office actually would help us because they would be the ones posting it to the website when it needed to get posted.

412
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they've always been sort of involved in this when we send them agendas.

413
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:04,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're right away, you know, posting it within, you know, five, ten minutes of getting an email.

414
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve, in terms of the

415
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:12,611
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the opt-in email, what happens is it's sort of really analog.

416
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,552
[SPEAKER_06]: People call us.

417
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,733
[SPEAKER_06]: They stop in the office.

418
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:20,136
[SPEAKER_06]: They send us emails and say, how do I get on the city council agenda list?

419
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:21,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And they only have one option.

420
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,399
[SPEAKER_06]: They're either on the list or they're not on the list.

421
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:27,341
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, I don't have a separate list for committee meetings.

422
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:30,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a separate list for council agendas.

423
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:36,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a separate list for the monthly meetings that the president and vice president set out when they set out the proposed monthly schedule.

424
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:38,229
[SPEAKER_06]: it's all the same list.

425
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:41,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you're on that list, you're on that list until you're off that list.

426
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

427
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I, for some reason, assumed it was like an actual... They were able to sign up online or something like that, or through an email system.

428
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I didn't realize... Yeah.

429
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:55,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was that smart.

430
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:56,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

431
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

432
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, anyway, that's definitely something that we would be we could do to help get more signups is just promoted obviously across our platforms and the city platforms, and as well as on the website for the city council.

433
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:17,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We also briefly discussed revamping portions of the website to, to better fit the needs of the council.

434
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:22,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

435
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:24,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Steve.

436
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really helpful, and that would be excellent.

437
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:28,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about constant contacts.

438
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:40,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a subscription fee that the city has already signed up to that we could create an account with, or would we have to subscribe separately as a city council?

439
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you know the details about that?

440
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:44,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

441
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:47,345
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a fee for that.

442
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:53,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many accounts we have under our subscription.

443
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have already met that threshold.

444
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:57,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know for sure.

445
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, we do have a few departments already utilizing that.

446
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that is a fee.

447
00:41:04,814 --> 00:41:16,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I don't know though, if like MailChimp may not have a fee or there may be other ones that are, are free to use, but I can definitely look into, um, if you can get a account under constant contacts.

448
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

449
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:23,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think these are all questions to keep considering.

450
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:28,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we already have something to build off of, so we can use that for now.

451
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the second motion that I introduced would empower Matt or Matt's, Chair Leming or Chair Leming's designated work, keep working with Steve and Adam to work out if we can get on an official platform or if there's a better way to build out.

452
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of this future action is already there's already a motion for it.

453
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just if I could add one thing to I also think you need to kind of develop a policy around your social media.

454
00:41:57,568 --> 00:42:08,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So just so you know how your accounts work and how who has access and things like that, because obviously you don't want to kind of leave yourself victims anything.

455
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:13,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would definitely recommend setting some sort of policy in place before you kind of launch these things.

456
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: the social media accounts would all be maintained through the clerks up as I imagine.

457
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:32,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I was just thinking like Facebook, for example, I think like you need a personal Facebook account to set up like a, a page.

458
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:35,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have to take that into consideration as well.

459
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:37,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

460
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:43,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor say, I think that's a good segue into the social media conversation.

461
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:55,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess I, I had two big questions for the my other Councilors here tonight, the first one being which platforms we should set up.

462
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard.

463
00:42:57,512 --> 00:43:03,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people say Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube.

464
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do all of them and assign different ones to different Councilors, maybe have one Councilor take up more than one and work with the clerk to maintain it.

465
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about the policy part later, but I think the first thing is to decide which platforms we think are worth using.

466
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the second thing to decide is,

467
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: what does that policy look like?

468
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if it would be helpful for the council, we could motion for me to draft the policy for social media and then come back next meeting and then create the social media accounts at the next meeting.

469
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be possible.

470
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the committee prefers creating an account now and then just to set up an account now,

471
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:55,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that also works.

472
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do like just just kind of something that's on my mind while we're talking about that.

473
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:07,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I do feel like we do need to treat each social media platform as sort of an environment in itself.

474
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:15,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's plenty of precedent for having city council type pages on like Facebook, for instance, but I feel like.

475
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:42,411
[SPEAKER_07]: reddit is kind of a different environment for that sort of a thing it's where a lot of people get their information but like an official reddit posting it yeah it is definitely like the specific policy is definitely up for discussion uh councillor i thought you were first okay councillor callahan um if we really want for this to get to as many people as possible um i suspect that we need to

476
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:53,094
[SPEAKER_08]: really make an effort to be on all of those platforms, because that's kind of the point, is that each platform has its own subset of people that actually check that platform and prefer that platform to other things.

477
00:44:53,974 --> 00:45:02,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should not neglect to at least consider texting, WhatsApp, discourse.

478
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:09,406
[SPEAKER_08]: These are things, so especially like texting and WhatsApp are used by a lot of

479
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:13,607
[SPEAKER_08]: less affluent immigrant communities.

480
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:32,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we don't even discuss them, and I understand that texting probably would cost us money, but if we don't at least consider those, I think that we are sort of blocking off certain people to engagement and specifically people who tend to be the least engaged.

481
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love for us to consider those as well.

482
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:40,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely agree with that.

483
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:54,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I just with with each platform, I think that it would be good to have a specific strategy in mind to look at what other folks have done for that, because with what's that we would need a way to get lots of different phone numbers for that, which may not have a moment.

484
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,323
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty that could be a very intensive process.

485
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:03,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But I definitely hear your point about different communities and, um, what?

486
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Not using these different social media platforms.

487
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

488
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:07,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree.

489
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I like where your head's at.

490
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:24,567
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same way that we would want to have hard copies for people that aren't connected, we need to be thinking in a progressive way about folks that are connected in a different way.

491
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:35,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would want to say that if our content is going to be functionally similar

492
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:44,788
[SPEAKER_00]: and start with the newsletter content, I think maybe this meeting is gonna have to like top off with the newsletter and then we should come back to social media next time.

493
00:46:44,808 --> 00:46:49,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Smearty.

494
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:53,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get like too into the weeds.

495
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can stop me definitely if you don't need to talk about this.

496
00:46:56,796 --> 00:47:08,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just, I would also, you know, it might be helpful if you put out some sort of survey to your constituencies, and then see where they consume their news and their information on what platforms.

497
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really identify where you want your messaging to go, or at least

498
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:16,506
[SPEAKER_03]: where the predominant amount of your messaging to go.

499
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I agree, it'd be great to do texting, but you just want to make sure that you have people that are utilizing that and getting information that way, because you don't want to overextend your bandwidth either, or your workflow.

500
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sorry, I was gonna say one other thing too.

501
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:45,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I would definitely also, again, this is all for your planning purposes, but I would definitely set up a calendar, like a social calendar so you know, so you have enough content to fill all your platforms and that you don't

502
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,568
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of have a drop off in content, because then you're going to lose followers or lose likes and things like that.

503
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to maintain all of those different platforms so people know that they can rely on that.

504
00:47:57,196 --> 00:47:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my input.

505
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:05,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Steve.

506
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's really helpful.

507
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea I think it's really good.

508
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, in general, I also agree.

509
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Councilor Callahan brought up a great point about the texting and WhatsApp.

510
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:22,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love for us to do everything, but I think we should

511
00:48:23,772 --> 00:48:28,156
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about bandwidth as well, and I think that is something for us to think about over the next few weeks.

512
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:51,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to pick up the social media conversation at the next meeting, and maybe in the meantime, either one of us could create a survey and post it representing the committee, and we could have a motion for that, or we could just not have a motion, just have one of us create a survey, not representing the committee, but just surveying people's media usage.

513
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:55,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's a preferred path.

514
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of us would post it on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram.

515
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like a survey would be kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

516
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a thing.

517
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

518
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

519
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I did think that, yeah.

520
00:49:12,022 --> 00:49:13,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you don't do the survey.

521
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe we think about it over the next few weeks.

522
00:49:25,517 --> 00:49:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in the meantime, it might behoove us, in order to speed things up a little bit, for one of us, I can do it, to create social media guidelines, like a policy, for us to walk into these apps with.

523
00:49:47,224 --> 00:49:47,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give them a sec.

524
00:49:50,305 --> 00:49:52,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make a motion on the social media thing then.

525
00:49:53,476 --> 00:50:00,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'd like to motion for this committee to, do you want me to do it?

526
00:50:05,404 --> 00:50:13,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Councilor Tseng is taking on a lot of responsibility for these tasks, and I feel like it's a little unevenly distributed.

527
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:22,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to not have to do a direct social media policy, and maybe I could do it, and just put something together that we could review as a committee next time?

528
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:23,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to.

529
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:34,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll motion that I can draft a social media policy for the committee to review at our next meeting.

530
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:37,674
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, do we have a second?

531
00:50:38,074 --> 00:50:39,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

532
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:40,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Settle down.

533
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:42,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so grateful.

534
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:43,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so grateful.

535
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:55,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want, you know, it's such a project that I've been working on that I don't want to put work on you guys that you don't want to do, but I'm so happy.

536
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:58,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very, very happy for people to take things on my desk.

537
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we want to lump all these together?

538
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:04,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

539
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:06,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, I think that makes sense.

540
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:08,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can voice vote.

541
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to quickly go to, if you'll let me, just the last few slides, because I have some ideas about how to proceed with those ideas, but I don't think we should necessarily move on everything tonight.

542
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And so actually, this one I did actually.

543
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:44,157
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, just ideas to discuss.

544
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but this one I do actually have a motion for.

545
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:54,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, um, I've talked about this very briefly at the last meeting, and I didn't really have time to go into depth about it.

546
00:51:55,942 --> 00:52:05,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the last budget as a person like as a Councilor myself, I put out a survey for feedback about what people would like to see in our budget.

547
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

548
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And I posted it on all the social media, sent it out to email lists, asked other Councilors to help distribute it for me.

549
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:16,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got a lot of responses.

550
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:19,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have gotten 300, 400 responses.

551
00:52:19,943 --> 00:52:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of great feedback in that survey.

552
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love if this committee would

553
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:29,321
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that.

554
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:38,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of doing it as an individual Councilor, doing it as a public engagement committee, I think that would be really powerful and impactful.

555
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:46,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can, as in that case, as Councilors, we can all distribute that information to all of our lists, and we would all be empowered to.

556
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:56,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I'd love for us to talk about this, but I would like to motion for me to present a draft of a budget input survey at our next meeting.

557
00:52:58,831 --> 00:52:59,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

558
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

559
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

560
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,980
[SPEAKER_05]: How many motions do we have?

561
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:23,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be five.

562
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:23,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

563
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:33,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to do a roll call, by the way.

564
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:37,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can just move to join and approve.

565
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

566
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize, I will have to leave in nine minutes.

567
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I move that we join these and approve them.

568
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:47,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

569
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:49,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second the move.

570
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:51,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

571
00:53:51,443 --> 00:53:56,906
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan to join and approve the other five motions.

572
00:53:57,646 --> 00:53:58,567
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

573
00:53:58,907 --> 00:53:59,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

574
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

575
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:18,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The last two things I have on this slide are, so Steve mentioned, we talked briefly about the City website and he had some ideas about what we could put on the City website on the Council page.

576
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:19,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

577
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask for you to recognize me.

578
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

579
00:54:23,353 --> 00:54:24,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I literally just looked up.

580
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:34,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to move the question on the, because we, we, we motioned to join them.

581
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't actually vote on them.

582
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:37,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was join and approve.

583
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:39,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nevermind.

584
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was just, I thought it was just joined them.

585
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept you up last night.

586
00:54:49,391 --> 00:54:49,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

587
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

588
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

589
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:52,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something.

590
00:54:54,015 --> 00:55:01,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I would like to recognize my esteemed colleague, Councilor Tseng.

591
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:02,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

592
00:55:03,364 --> 00:55:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So Steve and I talked really quickly about some ideas that we could

593
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:13,796
[SPEAKER_02]: do on the city website, like putting the newsletters on there, sign up for the email list.

594
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:21,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about building out pages for Councilors with bios and for us to put out our own press releases if we need.

595
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:35,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a future discussion because I think I would love to, there is actually a paper in committee about meeting to discuss reforming the city website.

596
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:50,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to meet in a future setting where we can publicize that meeting really widely and get people to come and give us some feedback as to what they would want to see in a reformed city website, especially on the council page.

597
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just my kind of note on that one.

598
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:59,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very last thing, which I think we should create another paper for it.

599
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:12,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it would make sense for Councilors to introduce it as a resolution on a meeting agenda, but meeting with underrepresented groups, we talked

600
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:19,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilors are and I were at the senior center and we mentioned doing a coffee hour with senior residents at the senior center.

601
00:56:20,673 --> 00:56:30,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've talked with Councilor Callaghan during the election season about an idea like this where we do a listening tour with underrepresented groups.

602
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to bring this up because I think I was just saying that I think the right course of action would be to create a paper number for it in the future.

603
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:44,801
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's all I had, thank you.

604
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:50,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I can be that person creating a paper to report and putting on the agenda at some point?

605
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:51,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can work with you.

606
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,509
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, yeah, I better.

607
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:54,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

608
00:56:56,492 --> 00:57:00,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we have any further comment from members of the public?

609
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:06,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, do we, Councilor Callahan?

610
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:06,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Move to adjourn.

611
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:08,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a second?

612
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:16,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Callaghan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to adjourn.

613
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:17,112
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favour?

614
00:57:17,712 --> 00:57:18,313
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

615
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Nay.

616
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,816
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

617
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:21,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.
