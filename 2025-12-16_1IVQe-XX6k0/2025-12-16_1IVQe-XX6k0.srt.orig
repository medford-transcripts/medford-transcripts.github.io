1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:01,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being here tonight for our waste collection public meeting.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:06,873
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Steve Smerdy.

4
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:09,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the director of communications for the city of Medford.

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll get started here and get to the next slide.

6
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,024
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's the agenda for the meeting tonight.

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:24,828
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do a quick Zoom poll to see how many people here have completed our waste system feedback form.

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,691
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor will give opening remarks, which will be followed by a brief presentation.

9
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we'll move to public comments.

10
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:38,177
[SPEAKER_13]: We're allotting roughly three hours for public comment and we'll reassess at 9.30 p.m.

11
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:42,661
[SPEAKER_13]: If there are a few people that are left to speak, we'll finish it up there.

12
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:51,730
[SPEAKER_13]: But if there's still a considerable number of people who have yet to speak but wish to do so, then we will schedule an additional meeting to make sure everyone is heard.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide.

14
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:01,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight you'll hear from Mayor, sorry, go back Alicia.

15
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:22,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight you'll hear from Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern, our DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability Alicia Hunt, President and Founder of Garbage to Garden, the City's composting vendor, Tyler Frank, and the City's Waste Consultant Jeremy Drake of Zero Waste Solutions.

16
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:30,502
[SPEAKER_13]: And just a reminder that if you have any specific questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to us at waste at medford-ma.gov.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Next slide.

18
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a bit of housekeeping for how we're going to manage the meeting tonight.

19
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:46,392
[SPEAKER_13]: The chat will be disabled, but if you need any technical help, you can direct message troubleshooting staff for assistance.

20
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:55,421
[SPEAKER_13]: During the public comment portion, please use the raise hand function in the React menu, and we will get to you.

21
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:03,262
[SPEAKER_13]: For security reasons, we've disabled video for participants due to Zoom bombings that the city's experienced at other public meetings.

22
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:06,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So please keep your comments to two minutes.

23
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:11,268
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to get to as many people as possible, so a timer will appear to show how much time is left.

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,855
[SPEAKER_13]: If your question overlaps with one that is being shared, please feel free to thumbs it up or heart it to show support.

25
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:36,451
[SPEAKER_13]: We're here to listen tonight and we'll use the information that we gather to update our frequently asked questions section on our website at medfordma.org slash waste dash system.

26
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:43,998
[SPEAKER_13]: This meeting is being recorded and it will be available on our website, the city's YouTube channel, and on Medford Community Media.

27
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:56,021
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's more you want to say, but you didn't get the chance, please feel free to fill out our feedback form if you haven't already done so, or email us at waste at Medford dash ma dot gov.

28
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:01,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a QR form right here on the screen that you can scan and that will take you directly to the form.

29
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:08,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, we'd like to know if you've completed the feedback form.

30
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to launch a poll in just a moment here to see who's done that.

31
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:15,863
[SPEAKER_13]: So hold on one second.

32
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:29,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's give a few seconds here for people to fill out.

33
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:59,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, now I'm going to kick it over to Mayor Wango Kern to give some brief remarks.

34
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:16,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Steve.

35
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:16,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

36
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:19,627
[SPEAKER_29]: Great.

37
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone, and thank you for being here.

38
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:30,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a lot being said about this change to our trash collection, and we definitely want to hear your thoughts on the program.

39
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:45,240
[SPEAKER_14]: It's clear that there is some anger and frustration out there, that's understandable, and hopefully you are able to voice your concerns tonight and through our survey, and learn more about why this change is occurring, as well as how you can best reduce your household waste.

40
00:04:46,349 --> 00:05:07,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Please take the time during this meeting to tell us what your frustrations are, what your needs are, how you don't think this will work for you, or how you think it will work for you and why, as well as what ideas you have, what has worked for you to reduce waste, and what suggestions you have so we can potentially adjust our plan accordingly.

41
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:11,940
[SPEAKER_14]: and make as many people as possible happy with this change.

42
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:19,224
[SPEAKER_14]: The state is proposing a food waste ban, from what we understand, for residential trash in 2030.

43
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:26,268
[SPEAKER_14]: They've done some for commercial already, and I think they're proposing fully commercial waste ban in 2027.

44
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Residential will be 2030 again.

45
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,389
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been very proactive.

46
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:37,303
[SPEAKER_14]: to get it and we've done what we can to get ahead of that ban.

47
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:43,705
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting as many people as possible into our free residential curbside composting program.

48
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:47,767
[SPEAKER_14]: 80, 100 plus residents have already enrolled.

49
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:54,959
[SPEAKER_14]: You're seeing other cities explore this option as well, as food waste is a main driver of collection costs due to its weight.

50
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:04,962
[SPEAKER_14]: By diverting food waste from our trash bins and our incinerators, we're not only reducing our overall trash tonnage, but we're lowering our collection and disposal costs.

51
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:13,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Composting, recycling, implementing containerization in our business districts, and making commercial

52
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:26,912
[SPEAKER_14]: properties secure their own trash collection service encompasses our overall waste strategy that prioritizes sustainable environmental practices and protects the city and our community from significant rising costs.

53
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,815
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll hear more throughout the presentation.

54
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:38,443
[SPEAKER_14]: shortly, but it will be a short presentation and we'll go into greater detail on our waste system and planning process.

55
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:44,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate everybody for being engaged and hopefully willing to learn more about our waste goals and priorities.

56
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:54,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope you're able to not just educate you, we're hoping to educate you, but also have you provide some feedback

57
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:57,278
[SPEAKER_14]: so that we can adjust as best we can.

58
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:03,261
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you again, and I'll now turn it over to our Department of Public Works Commissioner, Tim McGibbon.

59
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:12,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Great, thank you very much, Madam Mayor.

60
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,567
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me just get myself situated here.

61
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, everyone, for being here.

62
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,796
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Tim McGibbon.

63
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,877
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm the Commissioner of Public Works here at the City of Medford.

64
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,398
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm also a resident.

65
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,741
[SPEAKER_28]: So a lot of these contracts are very large.

66
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,602
[SPEAKER_28]: They're long.

67
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:42,224
[SPEAKER_28]: And our plans for these are long term when it comes to waste.

68
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:48,068
[SPEAKER_28]: So we've been working on this since early 2023, just the start of 2023.

69
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,749
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's been quite a journey.

70
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,969
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're going to talk a little bit about that.

71
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,455
[SPEAKER_28]: So rising disposal costs over the next 20 plus years is something that is a well-known prediction at this point.

72
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:03,697
[SPEAKER_28]: Our current collection contracts go through June 2035.

73
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,980
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, we're thinking long-term.

74
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:14,284
[SPEAKER_28]: We're trying to set ourselves up to be protected from increasing disposal costs as time goes on.

75
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:15,405
[SPEAKER_28]: Excuse me?

76
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,442
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just going to read this quote here from John Fisher, MassDEP Deputy Division Director.

77
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,002
[SPEAKER_28]: He could not be here tonight.

78
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:33,544
[SPEAKER_28]: The average reported solid waste disposal fee has increased from $87 per ton in 2021 to $103 per ton in 2024.

79
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:36,285
[SPEAKER_28]: This cost is expected to continue to rise in the future.

80
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,329
[SPEAKER_28]: 40% of trash is shipped out of the state.

81
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,330
[SPEAKER_28]: That's important to know.

82
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,753
[SPEAKER_28]: Disposal capacity in Massachusetts is very limited.

83
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:59,358
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever we don't reduce, reuse, and recycle and compost has got to go somewhere.

84
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,881
[SPEAKER_28]: And currently, our trash is going to the Saugus incinerator.

85
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,783
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's literally burned.

86
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:13,661
[SPEAKER_28]: The proposed statewide 2030 residential food waste ban that the mayor mentioned is also a very important point.

87
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:22,124
[SPEAKER_28]: MassDEP already bans food waste and trash for businesses in institutions that generate more than a half a ton of food waste per week.

88
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:28,446
[SPEAKER_28]: Now they're looking to expand that ban to include food waste generated by Massachusetts residents as well.

89
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,375
[SPEAKER_28]: The state estimates that 21% of statewide trash is food waste.

90
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:45,763
[SPEAKER_28]: Data from the Saugus incinerator suggests that 31% of our trash is food waste and compostable paper, which are materials accepted into our residential compost program.

91
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,989
[SPEAKER_28]: 53% of our trash is recyclable or compostable in our curbside programs.

92
00:09:55,981 --> 00:10:10,152
[SPEAKER_28]: In addition to food waste and compostable paper, other materials that take up a lot of space in our trash can be collected through other curbside collection programs, such as yard trimmings and leaves, paper and cardboard, metal, plastic, and glass, et cetera.

93
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:17,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Over half of what we are throwing away by weight can be removed from our trash by using the programs currently available to us.

94
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:21,702
[SPEAKER_28]: Next slide.

95
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, program achievements, this is a good one.

96
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:46,867
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's fun for me to talk about because it shows how much work we've been doing since early 2023, when we started conceptualizing and thinking about, you know, the need to renew or, you know, get new contracts going and create a new waste program here in Medford.

97
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,048
[SPEAKER_28]: Mayor mentioned a little bit about that.

98
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so I'm just going to read these.

99
00:10:54,009 --> 00:11:06,281
[SPEAKER_28]: They're big things that you know we've hit in this program curbside municipal composting which a lot of people know about 8100 households currently enrolled and where we're, you know, obviously.

100
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:13,522
[SPEAKER_28]: In a sense, just getting going there, but more to do more frequent yard and leaf collection.

101
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:17,707
[SPEAKER_28]: So our services is going from 16 weeks a year to 20 weeks per year.

102
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:23,994
[SPEAKER_28]: We've received a couple of mass DEP grants, which paid for the kickoff of curbside composting.

103
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:28,637
[SPEAKER_28]: We've currently received two Distinguished Industry Leadership Awards.

104
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:39,341
[SPEAKER_28]: The Outstanding Community at the Northeast Recycling Council's 2025 Enviro Leadership Mayoral Award at the National Recycling Coalition.

105
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:40,942
[SPEAKER_28]: So very exciting.

106
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:45,535
[SPEAKER_28]: And another one that's dear to my heart, the business district improvements.

107
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:54,964
[SPEAKER_28]: The business districts are now quote unquote clean, no more trash bags on the sidewalks, over spilling trash, smelly boxes, etc.

108
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:59,489
[SPEAKER_28]: All businesses are now recycling as well in these business districts and throughout the city.

109
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:09,208
[SPEAKER_28]: The trash tonnage, which of course we pay for, has decreased since July 2024, and we are moving in the right direction.

110
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,710
[SPEAKER_28]: There was something else I needed to read.

111
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,073
[SPEAKER_28]: This will be it.

112
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:27,710
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, so just a little bit more about item 6, the trash is decreased by more than 5% since initiating the new program.

113
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:35,617
[SPEAKER_28]: That reduction has saved the city about $80,000 in avoided disposal costs.

114
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:40,320
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's from food waste and yard trimmings that are kept out of the residents' trash can.

115
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,622
[SPEAKER_28]: So, again, that's $80,000 savings.

116
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,003
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know,

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,406
[SPEAKER_28]: So those dollars are basically directed to organics processing facilities instead of the incinerator.

118
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:59,231
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's a lot to talk about with compost and kind of why that matters.

119
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,454
[SPEAKER_28]: But we're going to move on for now and go to the next slide.

120
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:06,539
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to hand it over to Alicia Hunt.

121
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,520
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Alicia.

122
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:09,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Good afternoon.

123
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:09,863
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening.

124
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:10,764
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm Alicia Hunt.

125
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:14,047
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm the city's director of planning development and sustainability.

126
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,850
[SPEAKER_32]: And like Tim, I also live here in the city of Medford.

127
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,733
[SPEAKER_32]: So just a few quick things here.

128
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,215
[SPEAKER_32]: So some of this gets confusing.

129
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:29,942
[SPEAKER_32]: We talk about percentages and stuff, and sometimes it's confusing because trash is collected by volume, right?

130
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:33,405
[SPEAKER_32]: We talk about our 64 gallon trash can, but we pay for it by weight.

131
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:36,368
[SPEAKER_32]: Our compost, it reduces the weight.

132
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,029
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's gets out what's heavy and wet.

133
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:48,957
[SPEAKER_32]: So sometimes when we say that it could be like 50%, we're talking about 50% of the waste because of that is the compost by weight, not necessarily all.

134
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:50,698
[SPEAKER_32]: And so we, that goes back and forth.

135
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,960
[SPEAKER_32]: The recycling reduces the volume.

136
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,881
[SPEAKER_32]: That's where we get out what's big and dry.

137
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,187
[SPEAKER_32]: And we also, the yard and leaf waste takes care of both what's heavy and big.

138
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:07,925
[SPEAKER_32]: One of the things we will note is that we have a fairly high contamination rate in our recycling.

139
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,306
[SPEAKER_32]: No plastic bags in the recycling.

140
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,147
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm taking this opportunity to say that.

141
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,048
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't bag your recycles, your recycling.

142
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,870
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'll get to that.

143
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:23,893
[SPEAKER_32]: So the new collection schedule, and to be clear, we're talking about 19 months in the future.

144
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,575
[SPEAKER_32]: I think maybe we're down to 18 months now.

145
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:27,795
[SPEAKER_32]: Effective July 1st, 2027.

146
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,101
[SPEAKER_32]: Food waste, the composting would be weekly in the 12-gallon cart.

147
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,762
[SPEAKER_32]: Trash every other week in the 64-gallon cart.

148
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,323
[SPEAKER_32]: That would be the same day as your recycling.

149
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:46,205
[SPEAKER_32]: Recycling is every other week, and that's in your 96-gallon cart.

150
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:54,868
[SPEAKER_32]: And then yard and leaf waste is 20 weeks a year, and that's in paper bags or 32-gallon barrels, bundles.

151
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:59,814
[SPEAKER_32]: you can choose what to put it in, but not plastic bags again.

152
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:00,555
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

153
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:02,376
[SPEAKER_32]: Back to Tim.

154
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:05,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Alicia.

155
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so this is a nice slide here.

156
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:17,021
[SPEAKER_28]: Kind of shows the big numbers that help understand the changes over a long period of time.

157
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:24,908
[SPEAKER_28]: Annually in collections, and just so everybody understands, there's two costs with trash, collection and disposal.

158
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:31,229
[SPEAKER_28]: Collection is the more expensive thing, but disposal adds up pretty quickly as well, as the middle number shows.

159
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,070
[SPEAKER_28]: So a million dollars annual collection savings every year.

160
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,251
[SPEAKER_28]: This is basically what we save by switching to every other week trash collection.

161
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:45,312
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's really where the cost really hits home.

162
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,473
[SPEAKER_28]: 4.6 million dollars total disposal savings.

163
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:53,176
[SPEAKER_28]: from composting and waste reduction combined over the life of our contracts.

164
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,959
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, $13 million in total savings over eight years.

165
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,860
[SPEAKER_28]: This is our anticipated savings to the end of our current contracts.

166
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,501
[SPEAKER_28]: We anticipate more in the future.

167
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:07,364
[SPEAKER_28]: And I also note that there's risk involved here, so it could be higher, too.

168
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:16,629
[SPEAKER_28]: We can't necessarily predict trash disposal or the recycling market in the future, but we're going to do the best that we can.

169
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,327
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, next slide, please.

170
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:40,808
[SPEAKER_28]: So the idea behind what you see here and the additional costs shown below is the direction that you're going to be seeing, I think, already 116 cities and towns throughout the state.

171
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:42,929
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's a pay-as-you-throw program.

172
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:46,951
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's a minimum baseline of service, which is free.

173
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,772
[SPEAKER_28]: And then if you need more than that, then you have options.

174
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:57,157
[SPEAKER_28]: This is important because every family is different and there are different amounts.

175
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:04,384
[SPEAKER_28]: It's important to note that the every other week additional recycling bin is shown there, $6 a month.

176
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,386
[SPEAKER_28]: That kicks in at the beginning of that every other week program.

177
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,609
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, make sure I'm getting everything here.

178
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:20,462
[SPEAKER_28]: So for trash, also, I want to point out that not only can you lease an additional card for $12 a month, but you can buy overflow bags for $2 a bag.

179
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,844
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

180
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:36,692
[SPEAKER_28]: One thing that's also important to note, since we know recyclables can be big households with large families may need more recycling space.

181
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:41,406
[SPEAKER_28]: So the cost of an additional recycling cart will drop from $12 to $6 per month.

182
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:47,391
[SPEAKER_28]: This is an incentive to get residents to recycle more, to make sure only trash goes in the trash carts.

183
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:49,413
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, next slide.

184
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:49,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

185
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:51,335
[SPEAKER_28]: To Alicia.

186
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,378
[SPEAKER_32]: Yep, and the next slide is for me, for benefits.

187
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,821
[SPEAKER_32]: So there are a bunch of different things that are going on here.

188
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,283
[SPEAKER_32]: Tim has talked about the money.

189
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:14,270
[SPEAKER_32]: We're also preparing for a potential state ban, where we believe that the state has announced that they would like to start banning residential food in your regular trash, basically requiring composting starting in 2030.

190
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:20,575
[SPEAKER_32]: We'd like to clean up our recycling streams, making them cleaner.

191
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:26,959
[SPEAKER_32]: One of the things that we are hoping to do is to do more education around this as well.

192
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:33,843
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm working with the library right now to arrange for some education to help people understand a lot of this better.

193
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:44,516
[SPEAKER_32]: improved air quality, that we'll see a 33% reduction in collection truck trips through residential areas.

194
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:51,777
[SPEAKER_32]: And those trucks actually cause a lot more damage to our streets than residential regular vehicles do.

195
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:55,358
[SPEAKER_32]: So that'll reduce the wear and tear on residential streets.

196
00:18:55,878 --> 00:19:02,919
[SPEAKER_32]: And it'll move us towards our climate goals and towards the zero wastes as outlined in our climate action and adaptation plan.

197
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:11,936
[SPEAKER_32]: One other piece that I meant to mention earlier is that people have asked me a lot, why don't we move to every week recycling as part of this?

198
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:28,223
[SPEAKER_32]: And there are a lot of studies out there that show that communities that move to every week recycling do not significantly or noticeably increase their recycling rate, that they seem to have about the same rate as communities that do every other week recycling.

199
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,857
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I'm going to hand this over to Tyler for one minute here.

200
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:38,059
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi, I'm Tyler Frank, president of Garbage to Garden.

201
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,483
[SPEAKER_44]: So we worked with the city to launch Medford's curbside composting program last year, and we have experience with this.

202
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:48,486
[SPEAKER_44]: We also provide the service for the city of Boston and in other communities.

203
00:19:51,327 --> 00:20:00,836
[SPEAKER_44]: One very bright spot here is, as has been said, in Medford, with over 8,000 households signed up and separating their food scraps today, that's 43% of everybody.

204
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:04,519
[SPEAKER_44]: Medford is the most successful composting program in the state.

205
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:17,591
[SPEAKER_44]: And, you know, we do often hear from people who weren't used to separating their food scraps before, how surprised they often are, how much they actually do generate, how much of that yucky stuff they're able to separate from their trash.

206
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,903
[SPEAKER_44]: Compostable waste is 31% by weight of the trash.

207
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:28,106
[SPEAKER_44]: And just so everyone knows about this, anything that's from a living source is compostable in this program.

208
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,287
[SPEAKER_44]: If it grows, it goes.

209
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:35,951
[SPEAKER_44]: That's including meat and dairy and bones and paper towels, as well as compostable plates and cups and forks.

210
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:39,393
[SPEAKER_44]: So there's a lot that we can divert this way.

211
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,675
[SPEAKER_44]: And also we're using more secure latching bins, which keep rodents out.

212
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,057
[SPEAKER_44]: So our drivers dump them by hand.

213
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,747
[SPEAKER_44]: weekly, and if we find a hole chewed in a bin, it's not very common, but we've replaced those on the spot.

214
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:59,855
[SPEAKER_44]: So we're able to make sure that the food waste is not a food source for rodents.

215
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:07,344
[SPEAKER_44]: And food waste is currently collected weekly in Medford on the same day as trash, and that weekly service will continue.

216
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:18,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

217
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:19,987
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jeremy Drake.

218
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:22,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with Strategy Zero Waste Solutions.

219
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:24,011
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the city's solid waste consultants.

220
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:27,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna share three benefits of Medford's recycling program.

221
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:32,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia touched on this earlier, but first, recycling saves space in your trash cart.

222
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,120
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of recyclables are big.

223
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Cardboard boxes is a great example.

224
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:40,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So break down the boxes, maximize the space in your recycling cart.

225
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, recycling conserves natural resources.

226
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:51,026
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known this for decades, that making products from recycled materials uses less raw materials, and it saves energy.

227
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:56,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, third, recycling reduces environmental impacts from resource extraction.

228
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take, for example, an aluminum can.

229
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Those can be recycled indefinitely.

230
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:11,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Recycling that can into another can is much less impactful to the environment than mining for bauxite, then refining it into aluminum, and then making a can.

231
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,716
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can you recycle in Medford?

232
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:21,004
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphic on the screen shows what you can and cannot recycle across the state.

233
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,249
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from RecycleSmartMA.org.

234
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check that out for details.

235
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:29,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, an update about recycling in Massachusetts.

236
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:33,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Paper and plastic cups are now accepted in your curbside cart.

237
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:45,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good guideline to follow to ensure recyclables can be recycled is to make sure they're empty, clean, and dry before you put them in your cart.

238
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:51,024
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions about your recycling service, contact the city's partner for recycling.

239
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:51,945
[SPEAKER_01]: That's WM.

240
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,405
[SPEAKER_01]: The information's there on the screen.

241
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:56,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will pass it on back to Alicia.

242
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:58,527
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Jeremy.

243
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,985
[SPEAKER_32]: So moving forward, the city is listening to public concerns and we're open to suggestions for how to improve.

244
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,907
[SPEAKER_32]: We are also working to help residents prepare.

245
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:23,477
[SPEAKER_32]: Over time we've said that some things need, people need to choose what to do to be best for the environment and now we're coming to as a city and saying reducing our trash and reducing what goes in the waste is an important thing for Medford residents to be doing.

246
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,982
[SPEAKER_32]: So the next community meeting, after we listen to you all tonight, will be January 28th at 6 p.m.

247
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:34,243
[SPEAKER_32]: We're gonna do that one in City Hall in the City Council Chambers.

248
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,203
[SPEAKER_32]: We are working on educational workshops.

249
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:39,464
[SPEAKER_32]: We're looking to do them over the next year and a half.

250
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:41,725
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll post them on the city's event calendar.

251
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,625
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been talking to the libraries.

252
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,666
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll definitely be hosting some of them there.

253
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:50,247
[SPEAKER_32]: We are absolutely open to hosting workshops around the city as well.

254
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,340
[SPEAKER_32]: And the schools, Medford schools are working with Garbage to Garden to implement school composting.

255
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:03,164
[SPEAKER_32]: Garbage to Garden has a lot of experience with rolling out composting in the schools and this has been part of our plan from the very beginning.

256
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:07,986
[SPEAKER_32]: So you will see composting coming to a school near you soon.

257
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:10,487
[SPEAKER_32]: And Tim, back to you.

258
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:12,208
[SPEAKER_28]: Great, fantastic.

259
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,527
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, just gonna go over some of the housekeeping rules before we jump into public comment.

260
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,889
[SPEAKER_28]: So Stephen, over these, I'm just gonna go over them real quickly again.

261
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,591
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we actually gotta go back one more slide.

262
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,471
[SPEAKER_28]: Go back one slide.

263
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:25,833
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh no, back.

264
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:27,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, this one.

265
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,395
[SPEAKER_28]: So general chat is disabled.

266
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:34,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Direct message the troubleshooting staff in the chat if you need technical help.

267
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:38,241
[SPEAKER_28]: Use the raise hand function in the React menu to be placed in queue.

268
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,423
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you can't figure that out, just wave your hands around, someone will find you.

269
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:44,149
[SPEAKER_28]: You're going to get two minutes to speak.

270
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,712
[SPEAKER_28]: That's really just because there's a lot of people here and a lot of people want to speak.

271
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,175
[SPEAKER_28]: And we want to give an opportunity to as many people as possible.

272
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:57,920
[SPEAKER_28]: And I see some of you are already taking advantage of the fun reaction emojis and sending them across the screen.

273
00:24:58,321 --> 00:24:58,981
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

274
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,263
[SPEAKER_28]: Please keep them respectful.

275
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:03,545
[SPEAKER_28]: And I guess have fun.

276
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:05,787
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll be watching those as well.

277
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:09,610
[SPEAKER_28]: So with that said, we can go to the next slide.

278
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:16,223
[SPEAKER_28]: This is just a repeat listening session.

279
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:21,725
[SPEAKER_28]: It's being recorded, so you'll be able to go back and reference it or tell your neighbors about it.

280
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:31,829
[SPEAKER_28]: And if we've run out of time or there's something long that you want to say, it's not going to fill something more than two minutes, please, we want to hear from you.

281
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:34,731
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have a feedback form and other ways to get in touch.

282
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:38,012
[SPEAKER_28]: So with that said, let's go to the last slide, and we can get going.

283
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:54,256
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, Christine's iPhone.

284
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,177
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to ask to unmute.

285
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,077
[SPEAKER_28]: And just start with your name and address.

286
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:02,058
[SPEAKER_28]: And please pay attention to the time.

287
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:02,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

288
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,779
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just going to tell you that I'm having trouble screen sharing and running the timer app at the same time.

289
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:12,360
[SPEAKER_32]: Hopefully I can get that started.

290
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,680
[SPEAKER_32]: OK.

291
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Christine's iPhone, I believe you can begin to speak.

292
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Christine Bennett.

293
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:22,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on Martin Street in Medford.

294
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:30,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a couple of things that I wanted to bring up.

295
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:37,463
[SPEAKER_04]: In the manner of the way that this is being presented, first of all, I'm not really thrilled about.

296
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,995
[SPEAKER_04]: The first question was how many people have filled out the form.

297
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really wasn't a form that was being asked to fill out.

298
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of a survey.

299
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:49,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt it was an extremely biased survey.

300
00:26:49,259 --> 00:27:02,146
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one was there's no acknowledgement of those people who have already followed all of these things, who have already taken care of their own compost for many years.

301
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:08,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also looking at this expectation of

302
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:15,174
[SPEAKER_04]: large families being held to the amount that they're being asked to do.

303
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:23,679
[SPEAKER_04]: In one particular case, they're saying, OK, you can always use another barrel and you can rent that barrel for X amount of dollars per month.

304
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,824
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an issue that our barrel got stolen and we were asked to pay for that barrel.

305
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:37,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens if somebody gets two barrels and all of a sudden that stuff all starts getting done.

306
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:38,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people are using that.

307
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:38,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what I'm saying?

308
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: It just isn't making sense unless we have an ability to do all of all of those things to really ensure that the people who are renting those barrels get to use those barrels.

309
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:53,135
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many open gapping gaping

310
00:27:53,815 --> 00:28:10,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Areas that we're not taking care of and we're being that that survey was Absolutely biased and I kind of felt insulted by it Okay, thank you very much, thank you we will

311
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:21,289
[SPEAKER_28]: And if, just to help me out, if folks could just take down your raised hand afterwards, just so I can kind of keep track of who's in queue, that would be very helpful.

312
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:21,970
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

313
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:23,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Christine.

314
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:25,733
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, S. Wong is next.

315
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:26,673
[SPEAKER_28]: S. Wong.

316
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,140
[SPEAKER_28]: S. Wong, are you there?

317
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,124
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move on to the next person, Uli.

318
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,889
[SPEAKER_28]: So Uli, I'm going to ask to unmute.

319
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:47,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

320
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is Dennis.

321
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:52,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis Detling-Kalto for 120 North Street in Medford.

322
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:53,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Dennis.

323
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

324
00:28:54,896 --> 00:29:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I want to thank the city for Garbage to Garden, the increased yard waste pickups, and business recycling.

325
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:04,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good developments.

326
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to know that we compost with Garbage to Garden.

327
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We recycle whatever we can.

328
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are only two people.

329
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there are larger families, as someone mentioned.

330
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,192
[SPEAKER_03]: My concerns are rats and the volume of trash.

331
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:25,419
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, not everyone participates in Garbage to Garden.

332
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,108
[SPEAKER_03]: despite the fact that the city pays for it.

333
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:31,650
[SPEAKER_03]: People have to pay for the bags.

334
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also packaging of food, plastic packaging, paper packaging of food, and single-use plastics, and diapers.

335
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:47,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so these are all things that

336
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:59,401
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to, at least the packaging of food and food waste in the trash barrels will attract rats.

337
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:06,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I think that asking people to rent extra barrels will be resisted.

338
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:11,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be seen as a reduction in services.

339
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:18,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And also people need to be aware that you can't compost tissues

340
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,883
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been used for personal use.

341
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:29,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disgusting to put one's own germs into the soil that's going to be used by other people in their gardens.

342
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:40,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you really want to be effective, and also many people have already overloaded their barrels.

343
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Paper towels that are used with detergents to clean surfaces cannot be composted.

344
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:56,799
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to reduce waste, I suggest that you ban single-use plastics in grocery stores.

345
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,602
[SPEAKER_03]: We reuse our single-use plastic bags, but it's impossible to do this forever.

346
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:08,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And styrofoam in deliveries.

347
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,385
[SPEAKER_03]: There should never be styrofoam anywhere.

348
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:11,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

349
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:12,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Uli.

350
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:17,708
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move to Megan Fuller.

351
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,456
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, Megan Fuller, I live on Woods Road.

352
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:31,786
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm concerned about sanitation like others, and as was mentioned, the

353
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:40,320
[SPEAKER_33]: the non-compostable waste that still attracts rodents, and also the overflow bag option.

354
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:54,214
[SPEAKER_33]: When you were listing kind of wins, you talked about the removal of these overflow bags from businesses, and now they're going to be put on the streets, and I'm concerned about the hygienic implications of that.

355
00:31:56,018 --> 00:32:08,666
[SPEAKER_33]: I also think there's a little bit of a disconnect in the program because from the city's perspective, trash is measured by weight, but from our perspective, trash is measured by volume.

356
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:15,191
[SPEAKER_33]: And the current proposal here reduces the total amount of trash

357
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:22,853
[SPEAKER_33]: collected by volume by 40 gallons per every two weeks, which is quite a lot.

358
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:39,599
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think if it's reason if people are going to do that, we need some guidance on how on how how to reduce by volume our trash to that to that extent.

359
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:58,068
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think as well, there will be times when people who are mostly okay, for example, throw a party and have overflow trash with these tighter limits.

360
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:08,535
[SPEAKER_33]: And so if there could be some sort of dumpsters or somewhere we could put sort of one-time overflow, unexpected, unusual, I think that would help.

361
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:12,144
[SPEAKER_28]: Great, thank you very much.

362
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:17,565
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, now we're going to move to Citizens of Wellington.

363
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:20,646
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address, and you have two minutes.

364
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:30,848
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I'm sorry, I did the wrong one.

365
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,509
[SPEAKER_28]: Cheryl's iPhone, I'm just gonna mute you again, and we'll get to you next, sorry.

366
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Citizens of Wellington.

367
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,482
[SPEAKER_32]: You have to send it again, they unmuted and remuted pretty quickly.

368
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:50,284
[SPEAKER_32]: You may be correct to unmute to them.

369
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:51,666
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'll do it again.

370
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:55,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you hear me now?

371
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, hello, welcome.

372
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:02,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, so I would like to remain anonymous, just know I am a citizen of Wellington Circle.

373
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:03,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been here since I was born.

374
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that okay with you guys?

375
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,662
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there an address you can give us?

376
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:10,943
[SPEAKER_07]: First Street.

377
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:12,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

378
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:16,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a few questions to be said.

379
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:22,667
[SPEAKER_07]: As we all know that trash brings rats and rats are known to harbor and transmit diseases.

380
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:28,249
[SPEAKER_07]: They also bring in other larger and dangerous wildlife and especially dangerous towards pets.

381
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also what will be done with the $13 million in savings?

382
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:34,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Will that be allocated?

383
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:39,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Will there be a cut in taxes as the services provided are being cut in half?

384
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:41,784
[SPEAKER_07]: What about compost smell?

385
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:47,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It is widely known that many, especially during the summer, keep their scraps inside until they can be collected.

386
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:52,209
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also the increase in flies from both compost and trash that now has to sit there for two weeks.

387
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And then going back to with the new latches and improved on them.

388
00:34:58,212 --> 00:35:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Just today, I saw numerous compost bins being knocked over from wind and spilling.

389
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:08,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Will also City Hall and other public buildings be collected weekly?

390
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:13,226
[SPEAKER_07]: as those are currently collected weekly, or will they also be collected every other week?

391
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:20,552
[SPEAKER_07]: What are also Waste Management's thoughts on this, as they are the provider of our service?

392
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:24,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And who will be enforcing this new policy?

393
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:26,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it be the police enforcing it?

394
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:33,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And who will be liable for tenants with landlords that don't care?

395
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:35,879
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

396
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,220
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

397
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,221
[SPEAKER_28]: Valuable questions.

398
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:44,043
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we'll move to Cheryl's iPhone.

399
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,964
[SPEAKER_28]: Please state your name and address, and you have two minutes.

400
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:47,384
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

401
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:59,530
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me try one more time.

402
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,270
[SPEAKER_28]: Cheryl's iPhone, I'm gonna click S to unmute right now.

403
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, got it.

404
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:04,691
[SPEAKER_20]: That's okay.

405
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, can you hear me now?

406
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:07,871
[SPEAKER_28]: I can hear you, welcome.

407
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:09,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, sorry.

408
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:10,792
[SPEAKER_20]: I live on Sampson Road.

409
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:16,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Just quickly wanna say, yeah, I'm surprised by this just by everybody else.

410
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:27,295
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you're looking at the discourse on Facebook, there's people in there that'll have to be like, well, I can do it, why can't you?

411
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:35,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I will tell you, I compost, I recycle, I go down to the extra recycling bin behind the DPW.

412
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:43,952
[SPEAKER_20]: where people are kind enough to just throw whole boxes in there, and I've actually pulled them out and broke them down myself just so I can get boxes in there.

413
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,133
[SPEAKER_20]: My recycling bin's usually full.

414
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,855
[SPEAKER_20]: By the end of two weeks, I have two barrels.

415
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,916
[SPEAKER_20]: I have me and my husband, my granddaughter's over a lot.

416
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:54,437
[SPEAKER_20]: We always have people at the house.

417
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:59,800
[SPEAKER_20]: For the most part, both of my barrels are getting full, but I recycle, I compost,

418
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:04,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what else I can do.

419
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:07,836
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm glad I have the composting, but what sucks is that we have the rats.

420
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:15,238
[SPEAKER_20]: I used to compost my own waste for my gardens, and now, yes, we have a composting service.

421
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:22,179
[SPEAKER_20]: To buy compost from garbage to garden is actually pretty expensive, so I don't use their service for that.

422
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

423
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,461
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it's right.

424
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:34,949
[SPEAKER_20]: I am not a big family, but I have two dogs and two dogs worth of poop for two weeks.

425
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:35,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Not pretty.

426
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Middle of the summer with the composting bins.

427
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:44,217
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, sometimes I might have room to throw, you know,

428
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:51,916
[SPEAKER_20]: garbage, you know, food waste into the freezer, whereas somebody said, just throw it in the freezer.

429
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,277
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't always have space for that.

430
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,099
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, those bins can stink.

431
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,043
[SPEAKER_20]: I am constantly fighting with the rats around my house.

432
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:05,785
[SPEAKER_20]: I am constantly going down the holes and killing them.

433
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:10,729
[SPEAKER_20]: And the problem is, I got people who can't even pick up garbage around their own houses.

434
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,411
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just gonna get worse.

435
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:14,899
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Cheryl.

436
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:15,999
[SPEAKER_28]: We appreciate the feedback.

437
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,485
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we'll move to Billy.

438
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:25,007
[SPEAKER_28]: Billy, I'll ask you to unmute.

439
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:30,912
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address, Billy.

440
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:31,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

441
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,861
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll give Billy one more minute here, just a few more seconds.

442
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:42,502
[SPEAKER_28]: Billy?

443
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,627
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, thank you.

444
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:49,890
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move to Kim.

445
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:51,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Kim, please name and address.

446
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:55,075
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, everyone.

447
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,756
[SPEAKER_43]: I live on Maple Ave.

448
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:59,658
[SPEAKER_43]: I've been a Medford resident pretty much my whole life.

449
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:07,345
[SPEAKER_43]: My first question is for the two people, Tim and I think Alicia.

450
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,246
[SPEAKER_43]: You currently live in Medford.

451
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:10,628
[SPEAKER_43]: Are you currently practicing this?

452
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,167
[SPEAKER_28]: But I don't think we should be answering personal questions tonight.

453
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:17,651
[SPEAKER_28]: We want to take your feedback, though.

454
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:19,938
[SPEAKER_28]: But we do live in Medford, yes.

455
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,401
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll take that as a no, thank you.

456
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:28,324
[SPEAKER_43]: I echo what Megan Fuller said, and I hope that she runs for mayor.

457
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,665
[SPEAKER_43]: Megan, get in contact with me.

458
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:32,726
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm on Maple Ave.

459
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:34,407
[SPEAKER_43]: You should run for mayor.

460
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:35,467
[SPEAKER_43]: You would crush it.

461
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,329
[SPEAKER_43]: We clearly need some new leadership in here.

462
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,270
[SPEAKER_43]: They are not listening to the people.

463
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,732
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm grateful for all of you here speaking up.

464
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:47,514
[SPEAKER_43]: But this is pretty embarrassing.

465
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:56,379
[SPEAKER_43]: It's pretty embarrassing that we have to come on here on a Monday right before the holidays and fight with our town about something we never got to even vote on.

466
00:39:58,401 --> 00:39:59,982
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, that's really all I have to say.

467
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:07,907
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll look forward to you answering that question, Tim, about whether or not you're actually doing this right now while asking all of us to do this.

468
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:09,836
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not sure.

469
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:11,858
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm on the city contract just like everybody else.

470
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:15,761
[SPEAKER_28]: So when it goes into effect, my services will be what I showed you just like yours.

471
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:17,682
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you very much.

472
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:22,405
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

473
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

474
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:26,889
[SPEAKER_28]: We will move to Milva McDonald.

475
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:28,850
[SPEAKER_28]: Milva, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

476
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,751
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address, please.

477
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:34,173
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, thank you.

478
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:37,517
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm Milva McDonald at 61 Monument Street.

479
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:43,165
[SPEAKER_41]: First, I just want to thank everyone who's been working so hard on this for the last few years.

480
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:51,300
[SPEAKER_41]: Commissioner McGivern, Director Hunt, the Solid Waste Task Force, Garbage to Garden, and our Solid Waste Consultant.

481
00:40:51,961 --> 00:41:03,372
[SPEAKER_41]: I think it's really impressive the way you've been able to come up with a plan that addresses our climate goals as well as the budget issues the city is going to be facing.

482
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:12,472
[SPEAKER_41]: I've read a little bit about pay-as-you-throw programs, and I believe I read that it's over 160 communities in Massachusetts that have them.

483
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:25,524
[SPEAKER_41]: And the statistic that I saw on the MassDEP website said that in pay-as-you-throw communities, households produce 32% less trash, and that's pretty considerable.

484
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:28,827
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm really excited that we're moving towards this.

485
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:40,308
[SPEAKER_41]: I think that not all pay-as-you-throw communities are able to offer free composting, so that really, I think, gives Medford a chance to do maybe even better than that.

486
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:47,500
[SPEAKER_41]: And I am really proud to live in a city that's been a leader in terms of environmental issues.

487
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,802
[SPEAKER_41]: We composted for many years.

488
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:58,847
[SPEAKER_41]: I had four children at home, and I know it's hard to reduce trash, but even with my four kids at home, we never filled up our bin.

489
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:03,110
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'm excited that you're going to be giving programs that are going to help people

490
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,392
[SPEAKER_41]: sort of address some of the challenges of making less trash.

491
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:10,253
[SPEAKER_41]: I see this as very positive.

492
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:15,536
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't see it as a reduction in services because the free composting to me is a huge increase in services.

493
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:23,380
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think that we're going to see some issues, but it's clear that we can address problems as they arise.

494
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,164
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'm glad to see Citi listening and taking people's concerns seriously and working to address them.

495
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:32,265
[SPEAKER_41]: So thank you to everyone who's worked on this.

496
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:34,483
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Melba.

497
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:37,104
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

498
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:43,887
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move to Robert Carney.

499
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:45,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Robert, name and address.

500
00:42:45,788 --> 00:42:46,509
[SPEAKER_28]: Two minutes to speak.

501
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:47,049
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, Robert.

502
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:50,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Tim, thanks for having me today.

503
00:42:51,511 --> 00:43:02,821
[SPEAKER_11]: So, first of all, I actually want to propose a compromise that I think could help move us in a direction of waste reduction while keeping weekly service.

504
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:03,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

505
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:21,128
[SPEAKER_11]: here just I think what could be interesting to think about let's take a 32 gallon equivalent limit per week idea but keep the weekly trash pickup and let me just hear me out here what I'm proposing here is from what I understand waste management already has the ability

506
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,789
[SPEAKER_11]: to weigh the trash it collects.

507
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:41,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering, is there a way to impose, like, maybe with a pay-as-you-throw program, some type of weight limit or, like, periodic weight report of how much trash you're throwing out, you know, on a weekly basis, and then charge residents over that, or have citywide bags, a limit on how many you can buy?

508
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:47,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the thing that I'm concerned about is really trash being out there for too long.

509
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:50,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Certain food-related packaging can attract flies and rodents.

510
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:54,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm concerned about that being in the trash for two weeks.

511
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:59,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about the plastic and foam-like wrapping for the meat and smelly fish out there.

512
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:09,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing with diapers, especially I'm thinking about young families who might want to use cloth diapers, but maybe they're living in a house that doesn't have a washer and dryer hookup.

513
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:15,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I think things like this are things we really don't want to have in the trash for a long time.

514
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have concerns about sanitary enforcement in the city.

515
00:44:19,048 --> 00:44:24,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of my neighbors already have overflowing trash barrels or barrels that lack proper lids.

516
00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:27,075
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like it's rat central in South Medford.

517
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:34,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we need to get these issues resolved before we further limit residents abilities to put things

518
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:38,143
[SPEAKER_11]: to have, you know, more frequent traffic.

519
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:42,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think let's get that under control first, but I do support the spirit of what you're trying to do.

520
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:44,826
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do thank you for having this conversation.

521
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:47,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And I live at Hicks Ave, so you have my address for the record.

522
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:48,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

523
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:49,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, actually, one more thing.

524
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:50,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Tim.

525
00:44:51,249 --> 00:45:01,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want the city to continue the conversation, Tim, I've been having with you and the mayor about resuming and starting services for all townhouses with the money saved from this project.

526
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:02,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

527
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:03,615
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Robert.

528
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:15,514
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to jump out of order real quickly, because Billy, who was in line before, fixed his headset apparently.

529
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:23,641
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to move to Billy, and then I'm going to go back to Alessandra's iPhone and proceed with the queue from there.

530
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:26,022
[SPEAKER_28]: So Billy, I'm going to ask you to unmute again.

531
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:26,363
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome.

532
00:45:26,403 --> 00:45:27,203
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address, please.

533
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:30,926
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

534
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:31,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

535
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:32,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.

536
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:33,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.

537
00:45:33,588 --> 00:45:33,868
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

538
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:34,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.

539
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:35,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

540
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:38,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy Fosstreet.

541
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:46,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's just a bit frustrating that, you know, I think a lot of us like recycling and want to expand it.

542
00:45:46,596 --> 00:45:48,397
[SPEAKER_00]: We like compost and want to expand it.

543
00:45:49,418 --> 00:45:56,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but really the, the problem that I'm most concerned with is how this is going to increase the rat population.

544
00:45:56,664 --> 00:46:05,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I saw one of the wins was about healthier air quality, but it just feels like we're, we're trading that for all the health concerns from

545
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:12,247
[SPEAKER_00]: how many rats we're going to be bringing, especially in the summer, especially people with pets, people with babies.

546
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:20,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I mean, one thing that I would hope the city would consider is what ways are we going to mitigate the rat population?

547
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:27,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, I think some towns have shown that putting birth control in rat populations is actually one of the best ways to get them to stop.

548
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you're looking into those kinds of things.

549
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:38,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just really hope it's frustrating to hear like, Oh, don't worry.

550
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:38,939
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a year away.

551
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:40,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I plan to live here for many years.

552
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,822
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just hearing I've got one more year without a massive rat problem.

553
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:47,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And then many years with a massive rat problem.

554
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just really hope the city would consider.

555
00:46:50,385 --> 00:47:03,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking back from this expanding compost, expanding recycling, but it just doesn't, you know, if one house near me out of 200 houses doesn't do a good job and they attract rats, we're all going to have rats.

556
00:47:03,232 --> 00:47:03,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seems like.

557
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:10,252
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychology, the behavioral of the community maybe isn't really being fully considered.

558
00:47:10,272 --> 00:47:13,794
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like we're on a collision course for a ton of rats.

559
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:17,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope we would consider just walking back from this.

560
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:21,880
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to be locked into this, even though this is what we've said we're doing.

561
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,702
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Billy.

562
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:26,663
[SPEAKER_28]: We appreciate the feedback.

563
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,662
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, back to the top of the queue, Alessandra's iPhone.

564
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:35,363
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll ask you to unmute.

565
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Please list your name and address.

566
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:37,305
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

567
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,732
[SPEAKER_28]: Alessandra's iPhone, you're up if you choose to speak.

568
00:47:46,752 --> 00:47:56,400
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, I'm gonna click ask to unmute one more time, see what happens, and then move on.

569
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:06,733
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, Alexandra may be having some problems.

570
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:09,153
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to lower your hand.

571
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:12,094
[SPEAKER_28]: If you get your audio issues worked out, please raise your hand again.

572
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:15,695
[SPEAKER_28]: Jessica H is next.

573
00:48:16,035 --> 00:48:17,556
[SPEAKER_28]: Jessica H, I'm going to unmute.

574
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:20,637
[SPEAKER_28]: Please let us know your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

575
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:29,539
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me?

576
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:30,860
[SPEAKER_28]: I can.

577
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome.

578
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:34,596
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm Jessica Haley, Lock Road in Medford.

579
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:40,558
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to know, is it the mayor who signed for this or is it someone else in the city?

580
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:44,439
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you guys know like who signs the contract?

581
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:53,302
[SPEAKER_28]: We aren't necessarily answering questions tonight, but that is the mayor is the signatory as the executive for contracts that the city holds.

582
00:48:53,962 --> 00:49:00,785
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, no, I was just wondering why she's not here for this listening session that so I'm pretty confused on that aspect.

583
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:02,067
[SPEAKER_28]: She was earlier.

584
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:02,388
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

585
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:03,829
[SPEAKER_28]: And she I believe she's in the audience now.

586
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:07,311
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not I don't know that for certain school committee meeting.

587
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,252
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you're not listening to this.

588
00:49:10,252 --> 00:49:12,054
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just earlier one.

589
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:13,755
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

590
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:20,399
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would like to know what's going to happen with my big thing is animal waste.

591
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:22,680
[SPEAKER_29]: I already have holes in my barrel.

592
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,581
[SPEAKER_29]: The rats have already chewed through.

593
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:30,325
[SPEAKER_29]: And so what do we do like cat waste, dog waste, baby diapers?

594
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:38,444
[SPEAKER_29]: because when we had people come around here to handle the rats, they said the big thing is like dog waste.

595
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:40,665
[SPEAKER_29]: Make sure you pick up your dog waste, you throw it out.

596
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:48,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we do that, but now sitting in the trash for two weeks is gonna be pretty disgusting.

597
00:49:49,206 --> 00:49:53,507
[SPEAKER_29]: And the rats, it's just gonna attract them more to the barrels that they chew through.

598
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:57,768
[SPEAKER_29]: I compost, I use a disposal.

599
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,928
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't throw food outside.

600
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:05,710
[SPEAKER_29]: but we have a bigger family and we're always full at the end of the week.

601
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:10,952
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm not sure how this is going to work.

602
00:50:11,873 --> 00:50:17,415
[SPEAKER_29]: And for these questions, are you going to like put them online to kind of answer what we're asking?

603
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:23,341
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, we're going to be updating the Frequently Asked Questions section that's on the website.

604
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:26,083
[SPEAKER_28]: And the website is on that slide there.

605
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:26,304
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

606
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:27,424
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's a lot of feedback.

607
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,126
[SPEAKER_28]: Just so everybody realizes it's worth repeating, there's a lot of feedback.

608
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:31,167
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people want to speak.

609
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:38,773
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're trying to take the most common, frequent questions and provide some answers.

610
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:46,118
[SPEAKER_28]: And if we don't have answers, as was mentioned before, or if there's a gap somewhere, then we're going to try to fill that.

611
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,120
[SPEAKER_28]: Tweak the program, make updates as as needed.

612
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,862
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's that's really what the goal is here.

613
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:53,582
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

614
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:55,903
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you Jessica.

615
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,104
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome.

616
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:57,684
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

617
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:03,026
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to mute you and lower your hand and then we're going to move to Daniel.

618
00:51:04,507 --> 00:51:06,708
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't see the whole name actually, unless I go.

619
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:18,013
[SPEAKER_28]: One second, Daniel Rosenwig.

620
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:26,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Daniel Rosenswig.

621
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:28,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on Wilson Street.

622
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:33,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm native to the greater Boston area, but pretty new to Medford specifically.

623
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already composting.

624
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:36,481
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great program.

625
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:37,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

626
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:44,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering how much of our trash cost is for collection versus how much for disposal.

627
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:56,419
[SPEAKER_08]: along the same lines of Robert who spoke recently, I'm not that concerned about paying for a bit of extra volume, but I am concerned about having it sit there for two weeks.

628
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:06,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm particularly concerned that excess might sit outside proper containers, and therefore more exposed to animals.

629
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:15,695
[SPEAKER_08]: You have said that extra containers are available for a fee, but they only make sense if you'll overfill every week, and not if you overfill on an erratic basis.

630
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:23,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think that composting will help to reduce the volume, but I'm concerned it won't reduce it enough.

631
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:30,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Another speaker mentioned that pay-as-you-throw has reduced waste by 32% elsewhere.

632
00:52:31,007 --> 00:52:37,649
[SPEAKER_08]: But in order to make things work based on our existing consumption, it would have to be reduced by 50%.

633
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:40,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a lot.

634
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:47,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think that our waste limits should be dependent on the number of residents.

635
00:52:50,528 --> 00:52:55,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The limit that might make sense for a two-person household might not make sense for a six-person family.

636
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:03,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we could have different limits, depending on your household size, that might make a big difference for all of us.

637
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:07,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And the tighter our limits are, the more that becomes an issue.

638
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:12,897
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, right now, if we have some spare room, maybe it's not such a big deal that we all have the same limit.

639
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:16,778
[SPEAKER_08]: But when it becomes really tight, I think that'll matter a lot more.

640
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:20,792
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, thank you very much, Daniel.

641
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,016
[SPEAKER_28]: T Silvestro is next.

642
00:53:28,017 --> 00:53:29,838
[SPEAKER_28]: T Silvestro, I'll ask you to unmute.

643
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:30,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Please, your name and address.

644
00:53:30,979 --> 00:53:31,299
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

645
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:36,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

646
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:37,763
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, welcome.

647
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:39,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Tony Silvestro.

648
00:53:40,106 --> 00:53:42,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 5 Royal Street in Medford.

649
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:47,391
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest concern is I live in South Medford and the rat population.

650
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already lost one dog to leptoporosis in 2021.

651
00:53:52,134 --> 00:53:56,096
[SPEAKER_02]: During the height of the pandemic with all the rats

652
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also have two dogs and I have a lot of waste and I'm also a senior citizen.

653
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:10,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So my biggest concern is how do you think the senior citizens are going to be able to reel that cart out two weeks every other week?

654
00:54:11,236 --> 00:54:12,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be heavy.

655
00:54:12,777 --> 00:54:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be full of all kinds of crap.

656
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon my language, but I just, I don't understand it.

657
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to save money, are you going to give it back to us seniors and our tax bill and lower taxes?

658
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my big concerns.

659
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:30,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the biggest one is the rats.

660
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have had to hire exterminator.

661
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:36,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I have rat boxes all around my house.

662
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And the house across the street from me is an apartment building.

663
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:42,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their barrels are so overfilled.

664
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:43,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not funny.

665
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:46,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of it when it blows, blows down my driveway.

666
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my big concerns.

667
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:51,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about all I have to say.

668
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:59,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to tell everybody, please make sure your dogs are vaccinated for leptoprosis because it's not a fun thing to see your dog die from it.

669
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:00,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

670
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:02,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Tony.

671
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:04,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

672
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,161
[SPEAKER_28]: Next up is TK.

673
00:55:08,962 --> 00:55:12,665
[SPEAKER_28]: TK, when I unmute you, please your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

674
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:20,102
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, Tom Cubilis at Toro Avenue in Medford.

675
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:20,622
[SPEAKER_22]: How are you all?

676
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:25,283
[SPEAKER_22]: My comment is essentially around the Pay As You Throw program.

677
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:32,385
[SPEAKER_22]: In other Massachusetts communities, residents have the option to choose their hauler.

678
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:37,245
[SPEAKER_22]: That would mean multiple haulers could potentially go down your street on a given day.

679
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:45,447
[SPEAKER_22]: All it takes is one home to request a haul, and now we have two trash trucks going down the road.

680
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:48,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Has that been thought about?

681
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:57,544
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, is that built into the metrics regarding the use of trucks on roads and the damage to roads and our mission's targets?

682
00:55:57,964 --> 00:55:58,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

683
00:56:00,285 --> 00:56:00,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, TK.

684
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:05,008
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, next up is Erin Dalbeck.

685
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,468
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't recognize that name.

686
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:08,830
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

687
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,950
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

688
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:10,231
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

689
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:14,073
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, there.

690
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:14,673
[SPEAKER_40]: Can you hear me?

691
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:15,954
[SPEAKER_28]: I can, Erin.

692
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:16,294
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome.

693
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:17,783
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

694
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:20,226
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't have a lot to say.

695
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:23,791
[SPEAKER_40]: I just wanted to say I'm in favor of this new trash program.

696
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:32,201
[SPEAKER_40]: I've seen personally how composting has decreased my family's need for weekly trash pickup.

697
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:41,774
[SPEAKER_40]: I have a dog and we have a container that does lock and it stays outside.

698
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:53,447
[SPEAKER_40]: And I've never seen any rats around my compost or in my trash area or in my dog's poop bag area.

699
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:58,210
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, I just really love the idea of how this is sustainable.

700
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,991
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, I like the mission behind it.

701
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,173
[SPEAKER_40]: I like that it's going to save our city money.

702
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:11,758
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, and, um, I feel like it's just the future of our country and what we should all be doing, um, to adapt.

703
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:14,460
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, and I think that's it.

704
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,821
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you for all your work.

705
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:17,182
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

706
00:57:17,242 --> 00:57:19,283
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

707
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:21,885
[SPEAKER_28]: Next is Stephanie.

708
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:32,835
[SPEAKER_28]: When I unmute you, please your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes.

709
00:57:32,895 --> 00:57:33,215
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

710
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:36,477
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Stephanie.

711
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:39,114
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, I'm Stephanie Bama.

712
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:40,315
[SPEAKER_36]: I live on Broadway.

713
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:50,120
[SPEAKER_36]: So Broadway is owned by Medford, but I'm actually not sure how much of this applies to my service because the road is owned by Somerville.

714
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:52,942
[SPEAKER_36]: But anyway, I think it's a great presentation.

715
00:57:52,962 --> 00:57:55,864
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand it's been long in the works.

716
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:05,551
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not an expert in this area, but I do stay abreast of sustainability information, and I, from what I understand, pay as you go.

717
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:17,781
[SPEAKER_36]: And, you know, the composting availability and everything, this is directionally, as maybe was also reflected by the awards and the rankings, like this is directionally where things are going.

718
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:22,985
[SPEAKER_36]: Also, based on my travels in other countries, the places where their waste management is, like,

719
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:24,718
[SPEAKER_36]: you experience it the best.

720
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:27,800
[SPEAKER_36]: They have pay-as-you-go systems like Japan, for example.

721
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:42,072
[SPEAKER_36]: So anyway, I think it's great work, and I want to support it, and my suggestion is that perhaps you could in the future touch more on the plans that the city has with the rollout.

722
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:46,015
[SPEAKER_36]: Could any part of it be progressive or gradual, and

723
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:53,069
[SPEAKER_36]: as it rolls out and people adjust to it, what are the interim points of feedback and possibilities for adjustment?

724
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:58,371
[SPEAKER_36]: For example, if people need loaner bins or, you know, increases in their volumes.

725
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:02,512
[SPEAKER_36]: So perhaps addressing some of that could help assuage concerns.

726
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:03,613
[SPEAKER_36]: Thanks.

727
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:04,973
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Stephanie.

728
00:59:05,113 --> 00:59:05,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Good suggestions.

729
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:07,534
[SPEAKER_28]: Right.

730
00:59:07,574 --> 00:59:09,815
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to Patty Kaya.

731
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,278
[SPEAKER_28]: And Patty Kaya, when I unmute you, could you please list your name and address?

732
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:16,139
[SPEAKER_28]: And you'll have two minutes.

733
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:16,860
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

734
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:20,784
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome, Patty.

735
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,086
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, Patty Kaya, Monument Street.

736
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:26,530
[SPEAKER_39]: And I only have one question, though I do have a couple of comments.

737
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:28,652
[SPEAKER_39]: The question is, how do we stop this?

738
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,536
[SPEAKER_39]: How do we stop this train before it leaves the station?

739
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:43,966
[SPEAKER_39]: I disagree with reducing the cadence of garbage pickup for all the same reasons that many people have said on this call, have said in social media, have said on the 1400

740
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:54,327
[SPEAKER_39]: signatory petition against this reduction in such an essential public service for all of the environmental concerns that we're trying to address.

741
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:59,451
[SPEAKER_39]: My problem is that this should be the absolute last resort.

742
01:00:00,151 --> 01:00:06,336
[SPEAKER_39]: Taking away weekly trash pickup should be the last thing you do, not the first thing you do.

743
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:11,520
[SPEAKER_39]: And there are people on this call that have come up with solutions that would reduce

744
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:24,231
[SPEAKER_39]: some of the volume and the waste product that we're talking about before we would cut people's essential service for all of the health and safety concerns that people are concerned about.

745
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:26,492
[SPEAKER_39]: So we didn't vote on this.

746
01:00:26,853 --> 01:00:27,993
[SPEAKER_39]: We didn't have any input.

747
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:32,437
[SPEAKER_39]: And my last comment is about the way that outreach has been handled by the city.

748
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:44,742
[SPEAKER_39]: It's almost like you think you can educate us into submission, as if we're all too ignorant to understand the environmental context of the problem, the greater problem.

749
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:48,204
[SPEAKER_39]: We think it's the wrong solution to the problem.

750
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:51,065
[SPEAKER_39]: So you can keep trying to educate us.

751
01:00:51,626 --> 01:00:53,867
[SPEAKER_39]: We're not too dumb to understand.

752
01:00:54,347 --> 01:00:56,128
[SPEAKER_39]: We think it's the wrong solution.

753
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:59,130
[SPEAKER_39]: We don't ignore the fact that there's a problem.

754
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,012
[SPEAKER_39]: And we're asking you to rise above.

755
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:04,434
[SPEAKER_39]: and try something else first.

756
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:06,336
[SPEAKER_39]: Try other things first.

757
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:07,917
[SPEAKER_39]: That's the problem.

758
01:01:08,338 --> 01:01:11,641
[SPEAKER_39]: The survey was incredibly leading questions.

759
01:01:12,142 --> 01:01:20,109
[SPEAKER_39]: This educational event tonight isn't about listening, it's about telling us that we're too dumb to understand why you're doing it.

760
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,572
[SPEAKER_39]: I would like some more respect from the city.

761
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:23,513
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much.

762
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:27,522
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Patty.

763
01:01:27,862 --> 01:01:30,123
[SPEAKER_28]: I know I respect every single one of you.

764
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:31,724
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's that.

765
01:01:31,744 --> 01:01:32,665
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

766
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:33,105
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

767
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:35,126
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to Jen.

768
01:01:35,146 --> 01:01:36,446
[SPEAKER_28]: Jen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

769
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:43,310
[SPEAKER_28]: And of course, as a reminder to everybody, I'm trying to do this out of the utmost respect for all of you.

770
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,532
[SPEAKER_28]: So Jen, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

771
01:01:47,752 --> 01:01:48,252
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

772
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,031
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, Jen, so got ski place dead road.

773
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:57,034
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just gonna piggyback a little bit on what Patty was saying.

774
01:01:57,054 --> 01:02:06,906
[SPEAKER_38]: I feel like the city has been, you know, pushing toward having a half of the pickup that we have right now but they're not addressing the fact that.

775
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:11,628
[SPEAKER_38]: There are not currently that many options for reducing the amount of trash that we have.

776
01:02:11,668 --> 01:02:20,092
[SPEAKER_38]: There are certain things like soft plastics and styrofoam in particular that are very hard to recycle or get rid of other than in the trash.

777
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:30,718
[SPEAKER_38]: I think before we implement something like this, the city needs to have a harder push toward finding ways to recycle soft plastics, to recycling styrofoam, so that we can have the room in our bins

778
01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:32,819
[SPEAKER_38]: that it could be a lesser pickup.

779
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:38,021
[SPEAKER_38]: But right now, we live in a society where there's a lot of soft plastic packaging.

780
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:39,661
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a lot of styrofoam.

781
01:02:40,362 --> 01:02:43,983
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, if I get a piece of furniture delivered, it fills up my entire bin for the week.

782
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:45,704
[SPEAKER_38]: There's nothing I can do about that.

783
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,465
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no place to recycle that.

784
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:52,367
[SPEAKER_38]: My other concern is how do we avoid illegal dumping?

785
01:02:53,367 --> 01:03:05,832
[SPEAKER_38]: As we saw with the mattresses, when the city started implementing the having to pay to have mattresses picked up, I've had to call the city more than once for mattresses that have been dumped in random places, like my kid's school, for example.

786
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:11,755
[SPEAKER_38]: How is that not going to happen with trash going forward when people don't have room in their bins?

787
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:17,757
[SPEAKER_38]: And the third thing is, I'm not sure why the city is not pushing for other solutions.

788
01:03:17,817 --> 01:03:29,921
[SPEAKER_38]: Like, for example, we have this great online community called Everything is Free Medford, where people can post things and have other people pick them up, which keeps thousands and thousands of pounds of things out of the trash.

789
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:36,383
[SPEAKER_38]: Why the city is not pushing that more as an option for posting things to keep things out of the waste stream is just beyond me.

790
01:03:36,403 --> 01:03:39,785
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Jen.

791
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:40,605
[SPEAKER_28]: That was good feedback.

792
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:44,127
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to Charlotte Cahill.

793
01:03:46,248 --> 01:03:52,169
[SPEAKER_28]: Charlotte Cahill, I'll ask you to unmute, and please report your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

794
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:55,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, thanks.

795
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Charlotte Cahill.

796
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,931
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you creating this forum tonight and giving us an opportunity to provide some feedback.

797
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:09,792
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to start by just sort of echoing

798
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:19,633
[SPEAKER_21]: some of the public health and sanitation concerns that other people have shared regarding the shift to weekly or biweekly pickup.

799
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:39,457
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to repeat everything that others have said on this, but would just add that I think one thing that's getting lost a little bit in some of the messaging around this is that the city's goal for composting is to have 19,000 households composting.

800
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,996
[SPEAKER_21]: If that goal is achieved, that's three quarters of households in the city.

801
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:49,766
[SPEAKER_21]: meaning that one in four households will still have food waste in their trash.

802
01:04:50,666 --> 01:05:03,189
[SPEAKER_21]: And federal guidelines recommend weekly pickup of all food waste precisely for the kinds of public health reasons that folks here have been raising.

803
01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:06,450
[SPEAKER_21]: So just want to really kind of like emphasize that point.

804
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:11,452
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the other thing that folks haven't, some people have talked some about like,

805
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:13,852
[SPEAKER_21]: cuts to an essential service.

806
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:21,554
[SPEAKER_21]: And what I want to call out really directly is that this is like creating an equity issue when you're cutting an essential public service.

807
01:05:22,414 --> 01:05:40,998
[SPEAKER_21]: What this cut is doing is reframing a public health and sanitation service that should be the responsibility of municipal government and turning that into a conversation about the consumption choices that individual people are making.

808
01:05:42,379 --> 01:05:49,565
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's happening without any real meaningful effort that I can see to provide alternatives.

809
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,468
[SPEAKER_21]: So this isn't just about educating people.

810
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:59,255
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not about telling us that we're going to have access to the same recycling and compost programs that we have now.

811
01:05:59,735 --> 01:06:01,137
[SPEAKER_21]: But what else can be done here?

812
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:03,164
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Charlotte.

813
01:06:03,504 --> 01:06:07,931
[SPEAKER_28]: And just to correct some information that you're putting out there, the compost service will go universal.

814
01:06:07,971 --> 01:06:12,858
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's everybody who has eligible trash service now gets compost as well.

815
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:13,399
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you.

816
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,990
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move to Catherine.

817
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,371
[SPEAKER_32]: Tim, can we just make that a little bit clearer?

818
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:20,391
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure.

819
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,612
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I've seen that out on the web before.

820
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:32,734
[SPEAKER_32]: When we say our goal is 19,000 households composting, 19,000 households is 100% of the households on the city's waste trash system.

821
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:42,256
[SPEAKER_32]: The total number of households in the city that is a higher number, those people are on commercial composting programs that are not run by the city.

822
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:49,044
[SPEAKER_32]: So our goal is 100% composting, 100% of the eligible households composting.

823
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:50,184
[SPEAKER_28]: Correct.

824
01:06:50,224 --> 01:06:50,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Alicia.

825
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:53,926
[SPEAKER_28]: Now we'll move to Catherine.

826
01:06:54,146 --> 01:06:55,466
[SPEAKER_28]: Catherine, I'll ask you to unmute.

827
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,907
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

828
01:06:58,107 --> 01:06:58,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

829
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:05,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

830
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:06,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome.

831
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:07,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

832
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:07,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

833
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:09,558
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I missed it the first time.

834
01:07:09,638 --> 01:07:13,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Catherine Bradshaw Street, Medford, lived here all my life.

835
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:24,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So the couple of people ahead of me did touch upon what was on the list of things that I did want to mention.

836
01:07:24,263 --> 01:07:35,888
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to ask, though, I didn't see how we're going to, the city's going to make out with paying less

837
01:07:36,672 --> 01:07:47,621
[SPEAKER_17]: money to go to the burning and saugus versus the difference that we make in garbage to garden.

838
01:07:48,322 --> 01:07:54,427
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one thing I felt, unless I missed it during the presentation.

839
01:07:54,447 --> 01:08:01,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I did want to bring up the illegal dumping, though.

840
01:08:01,753 --> 01:08:05,516
[SPEAKER_17]: So I travel down commercial to Riverside a lot.

841
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:13,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And before those apartments that are going to go up where CKS is, there's a lot of illegal dumping.

842
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,140
[SPEAKER_17]: It's dark over there.

843
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,000
[SPEAKER_17]: There's TVs, furniture.

844
01:08:17,821 --> 01:08:31,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so I think we're going to see a lot more of that, maybe not only there, but as other people had said, you know, the mattresses being dumped when you get furniture, people leave it out in the street.

845
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,344
[SPEAKER_17]: I've, I just want to mention, I have called,

846
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:40,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Four times from May to September, people leaving furniture out.

847
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,404
[SPEAKER_17]: You're supposed to pay for it.

848
01:08:42,544 --> 01:08:43,805
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want to pay for it.

849
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:48,828
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the city is saying to me, well, where is it?

850
01:08:48,888 --> 01:08:49,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is it there?

851
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:54,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, well, if you live there, like if someone dumps in front of your house, it's your responsibility.

852
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:55,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I didn't put it there.

853
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,955
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I think that may be happening.

854
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And then maybe not to mention,

855
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:06,144
[SPEAKER_17]: possibly the fistfights that will be happening when people are using other people's trash barrels.

856
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:13,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I think those are things I just wanted to put out there, and thank you very much for listening.

857
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:14,627
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Catherine.

858
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:15,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate it.

859
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:19,489
[SPEAKER_28]: OK, I'm going to move on to Nicholas Guirleo.

860
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:21,729
[SPEAKER_28]: Nicholas, I'll ask you to unmute.

861
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:23,930
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could report your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

862
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,530
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

863
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:26,851
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

864
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:28,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Switched real quick.

865
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:29,152
[SPEAKER_28]: Main note of gotcha.

866
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:30,948
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully I did.

867
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:31,729
[SPEAKER_28]: If not, I'll do it again.

868
01:09:34,313 --> 01:09:35,835
[SPEAKER_32]: You may have hit the one next to him.

869
01:09:36,616 --> 01:09:37,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yes, I hit Fred.

870
01:09:37,837 --> 01:09:39,360
[SPEAKER_28]: Fred, I'm going to unmute you again.

871
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, you already did it himself.

872
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:41,242
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Fred.

873
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:43,065
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to try Nicholas one more time.

874
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:47,383
[SPEAKER_26]: Welcome, Nicholas.

875
01:09:48,163 --> 01:09:50,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, Forty Robinson Road.

876
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:56,766
[SPEAKER_26]: I would like to just begin by pointing out that during the existence of the Solid Waste Task Force, a survey was put out.

877
01:09:57,346 --> 01:09:58,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Over 700 people were polled.

878
01:10:00,107 --> 01:10:06,429
[SPEAKER_26]: About 60 percent of the people who were polled in the survey contained a question asking directly, do you want this change?

879
01:10:07,277 --> 01:10:09,500
[SPEAKER_26]: About 60% of people polled said no.

880
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Only about 20% of people could actually commit to a yes response.

881
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:22,274
[SPEAKER_26]: Now you compare this to the survey that was recently released, which doesn't ask directly, do people want the service change, right?

882
01:10:22,354 --> 01:10:25,558
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's full of loaded questions and really, really unscientific.

883
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:26,818
[SPEAKER_26]: in a lot of ways.

884
01:10:27,078 --> 01:10:33,061
[SPEAKER_26]: So my question for the city is very simply, will the city make a decision here that reflects what the majority wants?

885
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:42,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Based on that poll, based on what people are saying here tonight, it seems that overwhelmingly, and based on what people have said leading up to this, it seems overwhelmingly that people don't want this.

886
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:44,525
[SPEAKER_26]: So will the city listen?

887
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Will the city propose an alternative?

888
01:10:46,786 --> 01:10:53,609
[SPEAKER_26]: And I fully understand and respect the financial implications of this tough choice, but will the city propose an alternative here?

889
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:55,370
[SPEAKER_26]: that reflects what the majority wants.

890
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:56,111
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

891
01:10:57,952 --> 01:10:58,933
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure, Nick, you've got a little bit of time left.

892
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:00,374
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to ask a clarifying question.

893
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:04,678
[SPEAKER_28]: Was there a specific element of the program that you were speaking about?

894
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,181
[SPEAKER_26]: The service change, obviously, to bi-weekly trash collection.

895
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:10,563
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, you just didn't say it.

896
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,664
[SPEAKER_28]: I had a feeling that's what you're talking about.

897
01:11:12,684 --> 01:11:13,705
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to make sure it was clear.

898
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:14,306
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

899
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:19,270
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move on to Fred Roach.

900
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:21,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Fred, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

901
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:25,309
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could say your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak.

902
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:26,011
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

903
01:11:26,613 --> 01:11:27,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead.

904
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:33,308
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, hi, 77 Whittier Road in Medford.

905
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:38,731
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to go out there and say that I'm totally opposed to this.

906
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:40,011
[SPEAKER_23]: Big surprise.

907
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:44,394
[SPEAKER_23]: Second thing is I spoke to two landlords today at a social event.

908
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,375
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't live in the city.

909
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:51,037
[SPEAKER_23]: Neither landlord knew anything about a trash change.

910
01:11:53,132 --> 01:11:56,013
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't know what kind of notification's gone out, if any.

911
01:11:57,853 --> 01:12:04,255
[SPEAKER_23]: And this decision's already been made, and this is being rammed down the residents' throats.

912
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:14,058
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've lived in the city for 65 years, and in 65 years, this is gonna be the worst decision I've ever seen from the city of Medford.

913
01:12:14,878 --> 01:12:18,619
[SPEAKER_23]: And second of all, I have scrapped plans to build an ADU.

914
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:21,256
[SPEAKER_23]: because of this.

915
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:29,903
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't know if your millions of dollars in savings is going to calculate what you're going to lose, but that's my thoughts on it.

916
01:12:30,203 --> 01:12:34,767
[SPEAKER_23]: I won't waste my time anymore because I'll be wasting my time.

917
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:36,288
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Fred.

918
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:38,049
[SPEAKER_28]: Just same question I had for Nicholas.

919
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:44,695
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe you were specifying the part of the program where it goes to every other week as opposed to like universal compost or other aspects of the program.

920
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:47,270
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

921
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:49,111
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to clarify.

922
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,953
[SPEAKER_23]: I have some time remaining, so let me comment.

923
01:12:53,273 --> 01:12:58,595
[SPEAKER_23]: There's been no soliciting of the citizens with regard to how they feel.

924
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:01,997
[SPEAKER_23]: And if whatever's been done, it's been disregarded.

925
01:13:02,097 --> 01:13:03,577
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's really unfair.

926
01:13:03,817 --> 01:13:06,899
[SPEAKER_23]: And this decision is going to come back and haunt the city.

927
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:08,179
[SPEAKER_23]: It really is.

928
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

929
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:11,601
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a good night.

930
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:13,147
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Fred.

931
01:13:15,728 --> 01:13:18,890
[SPEAKER_28]: To Sarah Burnt.

932
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:21,871
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

933
01:13:21,951 --> 01:13:22,411
[SPEAKER_28]: Sarah Burnt.

934
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,012
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

935
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:26,373
[SPEAKER_28]: And if we could have your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

936
01:13:26,753 --> 01:13:27,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

937
01:13:32,596 --> 01:13:32,796
[SPEAKER_30]: Hello.

938
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:34,017
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

939
01:13:34,037 --> 01:13:34,557
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome, Sarah.

940
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:36,534
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you hear me?

941
01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:38,475
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, there we go.

942
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:39,776
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, Sarah.

943
01:13:40,196 --> 01:13:41,357
[SPEAKER_30]: Nice to see you all.

944
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:42,197
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you all for being here.

945
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:43,658
[SPEAKER_30]: I live on Sharon Street.

946
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:50,661
[SPEAKER_30]: Echoing what others are saying, waste costs are up because plastic waste is a problem globally now.

947
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:55,764
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think we are going to only compost our way out of this one.

948
01:13:55,784 --> 01:13:59,266
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's going to take a more holistic approach.

949
01:13:59,306 --> 01:14:01,787
[SPEAKER_30]: Our family already composts everything that we can.

950
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:03,868
[SPEAKER_30]: We try to reduce waste as much as possible.

951
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,301
[SPEAKER_30]: We visit the local plastic free refillery on Boston Ave, Trove Green Preservations.

952
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:14,643
[SPEAKER_30]: If you haven't heard of it, it's a great way to cut down on some of that packaging for your household goods.

953
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:18,564
[SPEAKER_30]: But like others have said, I'm also worried about trash sitting.

954
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:28,466
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we're pretty rat free here in West Medford so far, knock on wood, but we really, really don't want to see what's coming from Somerville over here.

955
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:38,940
[SPEAKER_30]: across the river and, you know, dog waste, diapers, like people have said, the food waste, meat packaging, all of those are going to be really, really smelly.

956
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:41,883
[SPEAKER_30]: I think, you know, the program in

957
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:45,398
[SPEAKER_30]: in its intent is really great.

958
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:50,702
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think adoption is going to happen when we make things easier for people, not harder.

959
01:14:51,522 --> 01:14:54,004
[SPEAKER_30]: I think we should be thinking of this more holistically.

960
01:14:54,424 --> 01:14:59,208
[SPEAKER_30]: Like, can we increase soft plastic recycling to keep that part out of the trash?

961
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:04,652
[SPEAKER_30]: Can we provide free compost bags for families to drive them towards the composting program?

962
01:15:05,512 --> 01:15:10,636
[SPEAKER_30]: So if we could just have maybe a little bit more of options instead of feeling like,

963
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:14,058
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, we're punishing residents for having trash.

964
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:20,924
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe we try to think about this as a way to explore other areas for reducing trash overall.

965
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:22,225
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

966
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:23,926
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Sarah.

967
01:15:24,647 --> 01:15:25,528
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate your comments.

968
01:15:26,528 --> 01:15:31,392
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we're going to move to Shayna.

969
01:15:33,594 --> 01:15:34,875
[SPEAKER_28]: Shayna Simenstein.

970
01:15:35,816 --> 01:15:39,419
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could please tell us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

971
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:41,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome, Shana.

972
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:59,307
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, I am on in Hillside, and I just wanted to thank everybody in the city for trying to address the really challenging problem of waste management, because.

973
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:06,091
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, the cost of waste disposal is increasing and like we are running out of places to put trash.

974
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:12,175
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think this is a, and so like I'm in full support of trying to find creative solutions to deal with this.

975
01:16:13,096 --> 01:16:19,180
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and, um, I guess I had just a couple of questions.

976
01:16:19,981 --> 01:16:26,045
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, I think to reiterate a few other folks who have, like are in support of this, but also have some questions.

977
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:28,907
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and one is.

978
01:16:29,758 --> 01:16:35,261
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, what is the city going to do about all of the residential buildings that don't qualify for this?

979
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:38,482
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, because they have more than four or six units.

980
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:39,703
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't remember what the cap is.

981
01:16:40,443 --> 01:16:45,946
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, especially when the 2030 ban on food waste takes effect from the state.

982
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:57,532
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and then my other question, um, is, uh, yeah, like what is the city doing to kind of like holistically address this issue in addition to

983
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:16,188
[SPEAKER_31]: like trying to cut down on the waste stream through trash pickup, but like through reducing plastic at the grocery store or takeout containers, et cetera, just to like help residents achieve the goal of having like half as much trash as they currently do.

984
01:17:16,809 --> 01:17:23,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I think like what I'm hearing is a lot of the concern about this is like fear of not being able to fit everything in your bin.

985
01:17:24,034 --> 01:17:24,655
[SPEAKER_31]: So I feel like,

986
01:17:26,117 --> 01:17:35,844
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, you know, having the city work on, like, tangential issues that could help reduce waste, um, would be really helpful, especially in, like, the next 18 month lead up, uh, to this rollout.

987
01:17:37,906 --> 01:17:38,686
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Shana.

988
01:17:38,806 --> 01:17:39,647
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate the comments.

989
01:17:41,148 --> 01:17:42,749
[SPEAKER_28]: And it looks like we have Alessandra back.

990
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:45,231
[SPEAKER_28]: Alessandra's iPhone is next.

991
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:47,212
[SPEAKER_28]: So go ahead and unmute you.

992
01:17:47,272 --> 01:17:49,134
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could let us know your name and address, you'll have 2 minutes.

993
01:18:00,038 --> 01:18:02,799
[SPEAKER_28]: Alessandra's iPhone, you hear?

994
01:18:08,902 --> 01:18:13,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Kim, she told our troubleshooting staff that she was having trouble clicking the unmute button.

995
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

996
01:18:17,105 --> 01:18:27,769
[SPEAKER_32]: Alessandra, if you want to message your comment to our troubleshooting staff, one of us could read it out for you, or you could email it to waste at medford-me.gov.

997
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:29,684
[SPEAKER_32]: that you see on the screen there.

998
01:18:29,764 --> 01:18:32,325
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm really sorry that you're having technical trouble.

999
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:34,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, sorry about that.

1000
01:18:35,107 --> 01:18:37,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's try it one more time for good measure.

1001
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:40,490
[SPEAKER_28]: That doesn't work.

1002
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:42,911
[SPEAKER_28]: Move to Jim Bennett.

1003
01:18:44,212 --> 01:18:45,673
[SPEAKER_28]: So Jim Bennett, get ready.

1004
01:18:48,074 --> 01:18:52,437
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, Jim Bennett, I'm going to go ahead and ask you to unmute.

1005
01:18:52,457 --> 01:18:54,318
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

1006
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:54,798
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1007
01:18:57,973 --> 01:18:59,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there we go, thank you.

1008
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:11,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have a lot of the concern to a lot of people with this every two week pickup, but some of my I think the intent is good about reducing trash, doing more recycling, but I find our program is not.

1009
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:14,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We do the standard recycling for the state.

1010
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that, but there are a lot of the programs and styrofoam is not very recyclable, but there are places will accept it in there, not in their curbside, but they have places you can bring it.

1011
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:37,780
[SPEAKER_05]: For that fact, the recycling compost we have, I'm there at least every two weeks getting rid of cardboard, because yeah, you can put cardboard in your recycle bin, but try fitting everything in there with cardboard.

1012
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work.

1013
01:19:40,662 --> 01:19:46,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you go to the compactor, you'll find a lot of people just have a lot of stuff that shouldn't be in there.

1014
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:50,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard plastics, baskets, styrofoam.

1015
01:19:51,090 --> 01:20:17,231
[SPEAKER_05]: and I recently I saw someone say that they don't flatten their their cardboard so that that's an issue um and I think that's great that it's there I mean years ago I remember bringing bottles down and breaking them down at the city yard probably in the 80s but what I kind of my other question too is in the contract my understanding is the contract was signed two years ago if that's not correct correct me

1016
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the consideration of the contract, do we look at different vendors?

1017
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we look at dual stream?

1018
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:29,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right now we, we dump all this paper in there with all the other stuff.

1019
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:33,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's a contaminated, more contaminated than a dual stream.

1020
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:36,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a multi stream, which is a step beyond that.

1021
01:20:37,278 --> 01:20:38,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we look into dual stream?

1022
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:40,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know that's available in this area.

1023
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked up a chart on the DEP.

1024
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:52,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that was even considered because you get a better product where you divide in your bottles, your cans and your plastic.

1025
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:55,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know if that was considered or not.

1026
01:20:55,521 --> 01:20:56,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be 1 of my questions.

1027
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:02,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed to be, it would be better recycling cleaner, non contaminated.

1028
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,528
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you agent.

1029
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:10,216
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we did go through a lengthy RFP process just to make sure folks understand that.

1030
01:21:10,316 --> 01:21:11,717
[SPEAKER_28]: So lots of things were considered.

1031
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,541
[SPEAKER_28]: So the RFP process was comprehensive and lengthy.

1032
01:21:17,062 --> 01:21:21,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So that information is comprehensive, but did it consider other streams or.

1033
01:21:22,606 --> 01:21:23,887
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, comprehensive, that's what that means.

1034
01:21:23,907 --> 01:21:26,009
[SPEAKER_28]: So all options were considered, yeah.

1035
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, because single stream, I always, I was never for single stream.

1036
01:21:29,673 --> 01:21:33,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when we did paper and we did our bottles and our cans.

1037
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:34,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jim.

1038
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:35,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was very happy with that.

1039
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:36,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jim.

1040
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,523
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to move on to Ted Blake.

1041
01:21:41,924 --> 01:21:43,366
[SPEAKER_28]: So, Ted, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1042
01:21:43,446 --> 01:21:46,609
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could let us know your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak.

1043
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,929
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1044
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:51,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Ted Blake, Toro Ave.

1045
01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:57,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to skip some of the things that other people have said.

1046
01:21:57,234 --> 01:22:00,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Concerns about dumping was one of the ones.

1047
01:22:00,577 --> 01:22:09,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Concerns about single stream plastics, like making sure this is addressed not just on the citizens and the residents, but on the grocery stores and things like that.

1048
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:13,846
[SPEAKER_16]: The two other things that I just wanted to chime in that haven't been mentioned.

1049
01:22:14,246 --> 01:22:22,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one, kind of going along with dumping is just the idea of like, I anticipate like, I don't know, people just like filling up the bins at the parks and things like that.

1050
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:26,876
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm just wondering if that's taken into account, just like if that there's going to be increased volume there.

1051
01:22:26,896 --> 01:22:34,663
[SPEAKER_16]: And the second one was if there's any potential solution for having a transfer station that's open to residents.

1052
01:22:34,723 --> 01:22:37,285
[SPEAKER_16]: I know other towns have transfer stations you can bring things to.

1053
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:43,230
[SPEAKER_16]: either in addition to or instead of the pay-as-you-go bags.

1054
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:44,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks.

1055
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:45,852
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1056
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:51,057
[SPEAKER_28]: And just to make sure folks know, Bedford does not have a transfer station.

1057
01:22:51,077 --> 01:22:54,501
[SPEAKER_28]: It requires land and a whole different set of permitting, so we don't have one.

1058
01:22:54,521 --> 01:22:55,742
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, thank you.

1059
01:22:56,282 --> 01:22:58,965
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to Christian's iPhone.

1060
01:22:59,926 --> 01:23:03,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Christian's iPhone, when I unmute you, if you could list your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

1061
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:04,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1062
01:23:12,734 --> 01:23:13,395
[SPEAKER_28]: Did I say Christian?

1063
01:23:13,415 --> 01:23:14,075
[SPEAKER_28]: I meant Christine.

1064
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:14,576
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1065
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:15,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1066
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little confused by that.

1067
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:19,222
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know why.

1068
01:23:19,282 --> 01:23:21,104
[SPEAKER_28]: I think, you know, maybe my eyes are starting to cross.

1069
01:23:28,539 --> 01:23:35,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Using this single stream recycling, I'm thinking like how much money we could probably get just on paper and cardboard alone.

1070
01:23:35,888 --> 01:23:46,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of cities and towns use that, but by using a single stream, we're wasting just the chance of getting paper.

1071
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:47,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

1072
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:50,787
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that was a rogue microphone.

1073
01:23:51,247 --> 01:23:51,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1074
01:23:51,607 --> 01:23:51,767
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1075
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to know, like, we're using single stream.

1076
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:59,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be getting money back on paper and and cardboard and all that.

1077
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:04,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to know if the city is paying for the concurrent composting.

1078
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:08,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we received a grant, but what will the future cost be?

1079
01:24:10,107 --> 01:24:11,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get that question out.

1080
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:18,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, Mr. McGiven, I know that you've questioned a couple of people saying, you know, what was it that they were talking about?

1081
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:20,253
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it in regards to?

1082
01:24:20,913 --> 01:24:29,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the actual advertisement for this particular Zoom said, if you wanted, we wanted to hear about our upcoming changes to our waste collection system.

1083
01:24:29,538 --> 01:24:35,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would assume that it would always be regarding the once every two week pickup.

1084
01:24:36,547 --> 01:24:37,227
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why I asked.

1085
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:40,569
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to be sure because we also have universal compost as part of this program.

1086
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's not, that, that doesn't seem to be the concern that most people have.

1087
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:49,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the major concern is that you're asking people to pick up once every other week.

1088
01:24:49,472 --> 01:24:52,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be, you know, that, that's the part that would impact most people.

1089
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:53,574
[SPEAKER_28]: Correct.

1090
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:53,734
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

1091
01:24:53,894 --> 01:24:57,096
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's exactly why I'm asking folks to clarify, to make sure that that goes on record.

1092
01:24:57,136 --> 01:24:57,956
[SPEAKER_28]: If that's the concern.

1093
01:24:58,356 --> 01:24:58,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

1094
01:24:59,377 --> 01:25:00,377
[SPEAKER_28]: That's exactly why I'm asking.

1095
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:01,557
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, ma'am.

1096
01:25:02,578 --> 01:25:02,778
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1097
01:25:03,149 --> 01:25:05,390
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're gonna move on to Ralph Klein.

1098
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:13,113
[SPEAKER_28]: So Ralph Klein, if you could give us your name and address, and you'll have two minutes when I unmute you, or ask you to unmute.

1099
01:25:13,453 --> 01:25:13,754
Thank you.

1100
01:25:23,638 --> 01:25:24,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, can you hear me?

1101
01:25:24,858 --> 01:25:25,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Ralph, yeah, welcome.

1102
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:27,039
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

1103
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:32,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, my concern is with this every other week, I think it's absolutely ridiculous.

1104
01:25:33,486 --> 01:25:45,049
[SPEAKER_24]: For a simple reason, for a bin that's a composting bin that's one tenth the size of the regular barrel, you think people are going to reduce their trash by half per week?

1105
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:47,329
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a little unrealistic.

1106
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:51,550
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember the composting we did back in the 60s.

1107
01:25:52,491 --> 01:25:54,591
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a bucket in your backyard.

1108
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:57,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I gave pictures to the city council of the bin.

1109
01:25:57,812 --> 01:26:01,653
[SPEAKER_24]: You take it out, the swill wagon would go down the street and would stink the street up.

1110
01:26:02,356 --> 01:26:10,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, you have all this money, you're paying for this composting every week, it's supposed to be, from my understanding, but trash is every other week.

1111
01:26:11,178 --> 01:26:18,959
[SPEAKER_24]: Why is this one tenth size bin more important than and cuts the trash in half?

1112
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:20,620
[SPEAKER_24]: That's totally unrealistic.

1113
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,540
[SPEAKER_24]: The second problem is rats.

1114
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,041
[SPEAKER_24]: Wherever you have construction, you have rats.

1115
01:26:25,901 --> 01:26:31,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Route 93, when they redid the rotary, the rats went over to the church and all that neighborhood.

1116
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:37,150
[SPEAKER_24]: On Salem Street, when they did the Sink Building, they're now doing the building on the corner of Park Street.

1117
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,811
[SPEAKER_24]: They talk about doing another one down the street.

1118
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:40,633
[SPEAKER_24]: That's gonna bring rats into the neighborhood.

1119
01:26:40,673 --> 01:26:42,153
[SPEAKER_24]: People say, oh, no, it doesn't.

1120
01:26:43,094 --> 01:26:44,235
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have a rat problem.

1121
01:26:44,775 --> 01:26:45,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we do.

1122
01:26:45,776 --> 01:26:47,937
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen more rats around here than I have in years.

1123
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:50,078
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's crazy.

1124
01:26:50,559 --> 01:26:52,380
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're saying, oh, well, we can stream.

1125
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:56,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, why not make a third collection bin?

1126
01:26:57,118 --> 01:27:01,121
[SPEAKER_24]: for trash, for the plastic recyclables, for the styrofoam, that way there.

1127
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:02,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Or give us a drop-off spot for it.

1128
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:04,084
[SPEAKER_24]: You have a dumpster for cardboard.

1129
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:12,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Why can't you put another dumpster up there for overflow trash and overflow styrofoam or the plastics to be recycled?

1130
01:27:13,651 --> 01:27:14,972
[SPEAKER_24]: It eliminates part of your problem.

1131
01:27:15,112 --> 01:27:19,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, sitting this in composting, yeah, it's wonderful.

1132
01:27:19,355 --> 01:27:19,736
[SPEAKER_24]: It's small.

1133
01:27:19,796 --> 01:27:21,097
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody has a garbage disposal.

1134
01:27:21,577 --> 01:27:26,081
[SPEAKER_24]: For the amount you're going to put in it, it's ridiculous to say, oh, every other week.

1135
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:27,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1136
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:28,911
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Ralph.

1137
01:27:28,931 --> 01:27:29,792
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate the comments.

1138
01:27:31,134 --> 01:27:33,737
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we're going to move on to Gianna Solvelletti.

1139
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:39,465
[SPEAKER_28]: Gianna, when I ask you to unmute, if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

1140
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:46,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, I'm Chiana Salvaletti, Tamar Drive.

1141
01:27:46,946 --> 01:27:50,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to plus plus most of the concerns others have raised tonight.

1142
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:55,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very concerned about the impact this will have on public health and the rodent situation in the city.

1143
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:59,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a dog, and last summer his waist got stuck at the bottom of our bin by mistake.

1144
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we had to wait for the next week for it to be picked up.

1145
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:05,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the summer heat, I ended up getting maggots in my bin.

1146
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:09,785
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm super concerned that this would become the norm for us if we move forward with this plan.

1147
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:18,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And after today's presentation, it sounds like a good area for improvement for our current trash strategy is resolving the contaminated recycling streams.

1148
01:28:18,807 --> 01:28:26,090
[SPEAKER_12]: I think at this point, if folks aren't recycling correctly, I don't have much hope that they'll be able to handle biweekly trash responsibly.

1149
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:33,892
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that would be a good place to start because we should create milestones that we must achieve before implementing something this drastic.

1150
01:28:34,472 --> 01:28:44,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And lastly, I feel like it wasn't previously communicated properly that the Massachusetts Residential Food Waste Ban was just a proposal, and that's how it was presented today.

1151
01:28:45,018 --> 01:28:52,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And by drastically changing our trash schedule this early on, I feel we're being overly proactive for something that's just in the proposal phase.

1152
01:28:52,922 --> 01:29:01,486
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there are much easier milestones we could achieve as a city to positively impact the environment without posing such a significant risk this early on to our city.

1153
01:29:01,887 --> 01:29:02,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1154
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:05,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Gina.

1155
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:06,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Comments are appreciated.

1156
01:29:06,437 --> 01:29:09,918
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, the next person is just named iPhone.

1157
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:13,818
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're just named iPhone, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1158
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:21,760
[SPEAKER_28]: Please let us know your name and address and you will have two minutes.

1159
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:22,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1160
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:23,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1161
01:29:25,121 --> 01:29:26,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm calling from my mom.

1162
01:29:26,261 --> 01:29:27,742
[SPEAKER_10]: She lives on Miami Street.

1163
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:29,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I also live in Medford as well.

1164
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:32,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm calling because

1165
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:34,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, what street?

1166
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:36,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Monument Street in Medford.

1167
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:36,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Monument Street?

1168
01:29:37,378 --> 01:29:37,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1169
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:39,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and I live in Medford as well.

1170
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:46,685
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an equity issue regarding seniors who live in their homes who have incontinence issues.

1171
01:29:47,826 --> 01:29:52,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And my mom has lived in this city for over 60-something years.

1172
01:29:52,349 --> 01:29:53,530
[SPEAKER_10]: She's over 100 years old.

1173
01:29:54,371 --> 01:29:55,392
[SPEAKER_10]: She does not get out.

1174
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:58,054
[SPEAKER_10]: She does not make as much.

1175
01:29:58,254 --> 01:29:59,235
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't make food.

1176
01:30:00,073 --> 01:30:04,095
[SPEAKER_10]: and we use a garbage disposal, but her trash bin is filled every single week.

1177
01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:12,198
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have two trash barrels that she shares with her tenant, and they fill it every week.

1178
01:30:13,219 --> 01:30:17,661
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting boxes almost every week for the stuff that she has to use.

1179
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:19,161
[SPEAKER_10]: We flatten the boxes.

1180
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:22,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Her recycle container is filled every other week.

1181
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:26,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know, because I think this is a done deal, will there be a discount for seniors?

1182
01:30:27,678 --> 01:30:30,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, you talk about the pay to throw.

1183
01:30:31,521 --> 01:30:32,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Some seniors cannot afford.

1184
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:36,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think, I hope you can still hear me.

1185
01:30:37,445 --> 01:30:38,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I lost my part.

1186
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:41,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But some seniors cannot afford.

1187
01:30:41,507 --> 01:30:44,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we, for some people just, oh, just use the pay to throw.

1188
01:30:44,249 --> 01:30:57,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, you don't know the extra cost that can be for a senior to take that on every single month to pay for the bags or a bigger bin.

1189
01:30:57,779 --> 01:30:59,660
[SPEAKER_10]: And I saw some costs about $12 a month.

1190
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:00,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I read it wrong.

1191
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1192
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I said there's an equity issue.

1193
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:09,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Will there be a senior discount, some sort of, and we need to take that into consideration.

1194
01:31:09,942 --> 01:31:12,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Not every senior lives in an apartment building.

1195
01:31:13,183 --> 01:31:17,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, MFIT does not do a good job in notifying residents about issues.

1196
01:31:17,785 --> 01:31:23,026
[SPEAKER_10]: We should not have had to hear this on the news, especially since it was proposed and done since 2023.

1197
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:24,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1198
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:26,227
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

1199
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:28,155
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1200
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:31,417
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a written comment from Alessandra.

1201
01:31:31,477 --> 01:31:31,998
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to read.

1202
01:31:32,258 --> 01:31:34,479
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the person that couldn't get on.

1203
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,240
[SPEAKER_28]: So she submitted a written comment.

1204
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,221
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go ahead and read that.

1205
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:41,724
[SPEAKER_28]: And I also want to clarify that for compost, we don't pay for the tonnage.

1206
01:31:42,304 --> 01:31:45,086
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're paying for the collection, but not the tonnage.

1207
01:31:45,186 --> 01:31:46,827
[SPEAKER_28]: That's important for folks to know.

1208
01:31:46,847 --> 01:31:49,069
[SPEAKER_28]: So it sounds like there was a misunderstanding out there.

1209
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:51,850
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'll go ahead and read this out.

1210
01:31:52,691 --> 01:31:53,792
[SPEAKER_28]: This is from Alessandra.

1211
01:31:54,551 --> 01:32:01,775
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to know how they're going to deal with the Tufts population around here, with four and five adults per apartment throwing out trash.

1212
01:32:02,495 --> 01:32:07,498
[SPEAKER_28]: I live on Yale Street in South Medford, surrounded by two family houses rented to students.

1213
01:32:08,318 --> 01:32:13,261
[SPEAKER_28]: Landlords are absent, and there is no communication to them about this upcoming change in trash pickup.

1214
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:19,464
[SPEAKER_28]: The landlords are not invested in keeping up with our neighborhood, or even their own properties, in many cases.

1215
01:32:20,423 --> 01:32:23,284
[SPEAKER_28]: Additionally, the communication around this was not optimal.

1216
01:32:23,684 --> 01:32:27,144
[SPEAKER_28]: We are hearing about this after the decision has been made.

1217
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:29,885
[SPEAKER_28]: Why weren't residents allowed to vote on this?

1218
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:31,785
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Alessandro.

1219
01:32:31,805 --> 01:32:39,087
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we're going to move to Prabita Natarajan.

1220
01:32:40,067 --> 01:32:43,647
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1221
01:32:43,927 --> 01:32:46,268
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could let us know your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

1222
01:32:46,288 --> 01:32:46,528
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1223
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:51,599
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, this is Pravita.

1224
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:55,483
[SPEAKER_34]: I live on Osborne Road.

1225
01:32:55,804 --> 01:33:01,951
[SPEAKER_34]: I wanted to voice my support for this plan, but I also understand the concerns from a lot of residents.

1226
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:06,876
[SPEAKER_34]: I understand change is hard, but we can do hard things for the greater good.

1227
01:33:08,177 --> 01:33:10,038
[SPEAKER_34]: I wanted to talk about a couple of things.

1228
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:15,561
[SPEAKER_34]: I think the cost perspective, we spoke about that, and it is going to save the city a lot of cost.

1229
01:33:15,801 --> 01:33:22,145
[SPEAKER_34]: But also one thing I wanted to highlight is that, unfortunately, trash is not something that is out of sight, out of mind.

1230
01:33:23,085 --> 01:33:29,148
[SPEAKER_34]: We spoke about Asaga's incinerator, which means there are communities that are living close to the incinerator.

1231
01:33:30,711 --> 01:33:35,898
[SPEAKER_34]: landfill stations, and everything that's getting burned is affecting their air and water quality.

1232
01:33:35,998 --> 01:33:42,287
[SPEAKER_34]: And there is a lot of reports on the health impact for communities that live next to the incinerators.

1233
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:46,252
[SPEAKER_34]: So by reducing our trash, we are indirectly helping them as well.

1234
01:33:48,234 --> 01:33:56,636
[SPEAKER_34]: Another thing I wanted to suggest was that is the, potentially the city can also, so the rat problem has been raised and it is a real issue.

1235
01:33:57,956 --> 01:34:15,580
[SPEAKER_34]: Composting well can prevent rats from getting into your compost, but also would the city also help residents replace kind of damaged or compromised trash cans, so that could keep rats away from their trash cans, potentially with dog poop and whatnot.

1236
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:28,688
[SPEAKER_34]: And then finally, I wanted to say that a small group of Medford residents, we have started an initiative called Zero Waste Medford to work with the residents and help them learn about ways to reduce their waste.

1237
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:32,190
[SPEAKER_34]: And we look forward to the opportunity to work with the city as well.

1238
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:32,931
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1239
01:34:34,452 --> 01:34:36,073
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for those offers, Pradeepa.

1240
01:34:37,654 --> 01:34:38,834
[SPEAKER_28]: And we appreciate your comments.

1241
01:34:39,775 --> 01:34:42,717
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to Niver, she, her.

1242
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:45,577
[SPEAKER_28]: Nevaeh, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1243
01:34:45,657 --> 01:34:48,638
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

1244
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:53,499
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, I'm Nevaeh.

1245
01:34:53,519 --> 01:34:56,200
[SPEAKER_35]: I live on HCSAV.

1246
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,941
[SPEAKER_35]: And I wanted to echo a lot of what people said.

1247
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:06,822
[SPEAKER_35]: I really appreciate the thought that has gone into this and you soliciting opinions now.

1248
01:35:06,982 --> 01:35:08,863
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think it's a really good idea for

1249
01:35:09,743 --> 01:35:12,144
[SPEAKER_35]: us to be thinking about reducing our waste stream.

1250
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:32,716
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been trying to do that all my life basically, but I am concerned particularly about the aspect of these changes for single-family condo townhome owners like myself who are not going to have access to trash and recycling services anymore.

1251
01:35:32,836 --> 01:35:33,497
[SPEAKER_35]: So basically

1252
01:35:34,097 --> 01:35:49,974
[SPEAKER_35]: will still be paying the same taxes to subsidize everyone else's trash and recycling services and then we'll also have to pay for our own trash and recycling and if we want to compost on top of that we'll then also have to pay for that and I'm just concerned that that's

1253
01:35:50,695 --> 01:35:52,156
[SPEAKER_35]: not gonna be accessible to me.

1254
01:35:52,296 --> 01:35:57,739
[SPEAKER_35]: And I wanted to boost some of what other people have said about providing other options.

1255
01:35:57,819 --> 01:36:02,882
[SPEAKER_35]: I would love to have more options of things to recycle, places to recycle them.

1256
01:36:03,002 --> 01:36:07,625
[SPEAKER_35]: I think the reuse communities, people have pointed out a really good idea.

1257
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:18,072
[SPEAKER_35]: I think there are a lot of other solutions that could make this easier for people, but it does feel like someone else said like,

1258
01:36:18,992 --> 01:36:20,353
[SPEAKER_35]: this was rolled out to me.

1259
01:36:20,453 --> 01:36:21,594
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm a pretty new resident.

1260
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:22,815
[SPEAKER_35]: I just moved here this year.

1261
01:36:23,156 --> 01:36:31,143
[SPEAKER_35]: And, um, it feels like almost as soon as I moved here, I got told like, Oh, you're not going to get trash and recycling or compost anymore.

1262
01:36:31,423 --> 01:36:34,826
[SPEAKER_35]: And you also have to reduce it and pay for it yourself.

1263
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,991
[SPEAKER_35]: And, um, but keep paying the same taxes and that just didn't feel right.

1264
01:36:40,331 --> 01:36:40,711
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1265
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:41,892
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1266
01:36:41,912 --> 01:36:42,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Nevaeh.

1267
01:36:42,212 --> 01:36:42,993
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it number 50?

1268
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:43,934
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

1269
01:36:44,775 --> 01:36:45,015
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1270
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:51,637
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, we're gonna move on to Vinny or Vinay.

1271
01:36:53,499 --> 01:36:55,502
[SPEAKER_28]: Vinny or Vinay, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1272
01:36:55,562 --> 01:36:57,544
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could give us your name and address, you will have two minutes.

1273
01:37:00,688 --> 01:37:01,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello.

1274
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, welcome.

1275
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, thank you for the opportunity.

1276
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:05,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Vinay.

1277
01:37:05,782 --> 01:37:07,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from Osborne Road in Medford.

1278
01:37:08,624 --> 01:37:10,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I am for this initiative.

1279
01:37:11,126 --> 01:37:14,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the biweekly trash is the right thing to do.

1280
01:37:15,649 --> 01:37:23,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I cook a lot, and so after the composting, free composting, my compost bin gets filled up more often than my trash can.

1281
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:30,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the city is doing the right thing by getting ahead of this problem, because this is something we'll eventually need to address.

1282
01:37:31,582 --> 01:37:33,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to share my opinion.

1283
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:34,430
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1284
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:35,831
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it Vinnie or Vinay?

1285
01:37:37,631 --> 01:37:40,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, anyway, he's already muted, so you may never know.

1286
01:37:40,733 --> 01:37:41,333
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

1287
01:37:41,353 --> 01:37:45,795
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move on to G. G, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1288
01:37:46,335 --> 01:37:49,316
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could tell us your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

1289
01:37:54,678 --> 01:37:55,879
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, hi, I'm Ben Lindvig Lingler.

1290
01:37:55,899 --> 01:37:57,740
[SPEAKER_25]: I live on Sunset Avenue.

1291
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,801
[SPEAKER_25]: I joined a little bit late, so I'm not sure if this has been asked.

1292
01:38:00,821 --> 01:38:02,902
[SPEAKER_25]: But I was really curious, has the proposal been

1293
01:38:03,888 --> 01:38:22,961
[SPEAKER_25]: Pitched as a big cost savings, I was curious if the city or what the city has been doing to explore actual increased municipal revenues to ensure that we maintain the same level of service as opposed to cutting services and passing on costs to residents as was just described, whether that's.

1294
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:33,606
[SPEAKER_25]: In expanded containers to meet the 2 week requirement or like with the single family condo owners who have to put the bill themselves.

1295
01:38:34,287 --> 01:38:37,828
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems like for a city that I believe we're in the bottom 10% of.

1296
01:38:40,048 --> 01:38:46,711
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, taxes as it relates to other municipalities in the state, we should be considering obviously cost to increase.

1297
01:38:46,751 --> 01:38:49,672
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not a unrealistic thing to be planning for.

1298
01:38:49,752 --> 01:38:53,253
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'd really like to understand how we are increasing municipal revenue.

1299
01:38:53,293 --> 01:38:57,375
[SPEAKER_25]: So we don't end up having to cut not just these services, but others as well.

1300
01:38:58,696 --> 01:39:02,599
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, as it relates to pests, it's not just rats.

1301
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:05,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Where we live near Tufts University, it's rats.

1302
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:06,541
[SPEAKER_25]: It's squirrels.

1303
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:08,983
[SPEAKER_25]: They get into the existing trash bins.

1304
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:16,489
[SPEAKER_25]: We've had to replace the lid on our trash containers twice in the last year due to squirrels and rats.

1305
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:20,352
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that that's only going to be increasing as well.

1306
01:39:20,452 --> 01:39:25,536
[SPEAKER_25]: So I want to make sure that that's understood as a problem, not just being rats, but other pests.

1307
01:39:27,507 --> 01:39:27,907
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1308
01:39:28,987 --> 01:39:34,969
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much, G. We'll move to iPhone.

1309
01:39:35,649 --> 01:39:36,690
[SPEAKER_28]: That's how the name is listed.

1310
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,470
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not sure if it's the same one from before.

1311
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,291
[SPEAKER_28]: If it is, maybe you have a new comment.

1312
01:39:42,551 --> 01:39:43,731
[SPEAKER_28]: OK, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1313
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:45,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Please give us your name and address in two minutes.

1314
01:39:49,373 --> 01:39:51,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Chris from Winchester Street.

1315
01:39:52,594 --> 01:39:52,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

1316
01:39:54,125 --> 01:40:04,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to start off by saying I never heard a thing about this until a couple of weeks ago when it was on the news, radio, WBZ, television.

1317
01:40:04,589 --> 01:40:07,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this even made Jimmy Kimmel, late night talk shows.

1318
01:40:08,551 --> 01:40:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even being reported worldwide.

1319
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:15,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's kind of a crazy idea to go to every two weeks.

1320
01:40:16,894 --> 01:40:18,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about a survey.

1321
01:40:18,988 --> 01:40:20,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the survey came from.

1322
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it mailed to the house or what?

1323
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:23,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Never heard of it.

1324
01:40:23,992 --> 01:40:30,138
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing that I heard about this was in the media just a few weeks ago.

1325
01:40:30,718 --> 01:40:32,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how long you've been working on this.

1326
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:40,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta look at how long has the public known about what you guys are doing.

1327
01:40:41,419 --> 01:40:46,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not feel that trash pickup every two weeks is a good thing.

1328
01:40:47,661 --> 01:40:52,163
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been talking all night long about all the reasons why it's negative.

1329
01:40:52,903 --> 01:40:55,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Rats, there's rats everywhere in South Medford.

1330
01:40:55,964 --> 01:40:57,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you guys don't know that.

1331
01:40:58,004 --> 01:40:58,845
[SPEAKER_06]: They're everywhere.

1332
01:40:59,645 --> 01:41:04,126
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the raccoons, as the other gentleman just mentioned.

1333
01:41:04,646 --> 01:41:11,487
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff, you know, mattresses just dumped because people have to pay a hundred bucks to get rid of them.

1334
01:41:13,128 --> 01:41:18,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that the whole way this is being put out to the people is just not right.

1335
01:41:19,509 --> 01:41:24,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And you should really take a hard look at yourselves for just throwing this out at the public.

1336
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:31,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the other thing that's been brought up is the absentee landlords.

1337
01:41:31,194 --> 01:41:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: A ton of them in South Medford, all over Medford, I'm sure.

1338
01:41:34,335 --> 01:41:36,256
[SPEAKER_06]: A ton of them in South Medford with Tufts.

1339
01:41:36,797 --> 01:41:39,578
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't care a crap less about trash.

1340
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:41,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Trash is everywhere over here.

1341
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you really got to take a hard look at maybe putting this on the ballot for the residents to say what they truly want rather than having this forced on them.

1342
01:41:54,207 --> 01:41:54,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1343
01:41:55,551 --> 01:41:56,472
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, appreciate it.

1344
01:41:57,713 --> 01:42:01,517
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a raccoon that lives near my house too, so I know the raccoon problem.

1345
01:42:03,099 --> 01:42:04,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your feedback.

1346
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:09,626
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, my department picks up and pays for those dumped mattresses.

1347
01:42:09,726 --> 01:42:13,310
[SPEAKER_28]: So I see those costs, and I feel them as well.

1348
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,592
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's pretty deep there.

1349
01:42:15,612 --> 01:42:18,335
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, so I'm going to move on to Sarah.

1350
01:42:19,148 --> 01:42:19,749
[SPEAKER_28]: Calbco.

1351
01:42:19,769 --> 01:42:25,535
[SPEAKER_28]: Sarah, I'm going to ask you to unmute, and if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes to speak.

1352
01:42:25,695 --> 01:42:25,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1353
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,541
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, my name is Sarah help go.

1354
01:42:30,642 --> 01:42:31,603
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm on Avenue.

1355
01:42:31,623 --> 01:42:37,649
[SPEAKER_37]: I am not in favor at this time for the every other week trash.

1356
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:42,854
[SPEAKER_37]: I do already do the composting and we do do the recycling here.

1357
01:42:43,475 --> 01:42:43,635
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm.

1358
01:42:44,997 --> 01:42:48,780
[SPEAKER_37]: In South Medford, and we have over the past couple of years notice quite the uptick and.

1359
01:42:50,043 --> 01:42:50,683
[SPEAKER_37]: different rodents.

1360
01:42:50,883 --> 01:42:56,005
[SPEAKER_37]: So I want to know before something like this goes into effect, what is the city going to do?

1361
01:42:56,025 --> 01:43:00,226
[SPEAKER_37]: I have logged requests, I have neighbors have logged requests, nothing is being done.

1362
01:43:00,246 --> 01:43:05,027
[SPEAKER_37]: I have a whole series of construction vehicles, including a porta potty outside of my house.

1363
01:43:05,807 --> 01:43:10,228
[SPEAKER_37]: And I was told that was gonna be gone two weeks and I'm still staring at it.

1364
01:43:10,628 --> 01:43:17,310
[SPEAKER_37]: They assure me that that's not gonna increase the rodents, but I can sure tell you on my ring cameras, I can see them every day running in and out.

1365
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:22,014
[SPEAKER_37]: And there's just been no accountability by the city and it's really, really frustrating.

1366
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:24,377
[SPEAKER_37]: I have neighbors who are very clean.

1367
01:43:24,637 --> 01:43:31,304
[SPEAKER_37]: There are some neighbors that rent down the street so I'm sure that some of this could be coming from there as well but it's only going to get worse.

1368
01:43:31,564 --> 01:43:35,688
[SPEAKER_37]: I also have animals so I have the waste removal but also to the

1369
01:43:36,749 --> 01:43:39,831
[SPEAKER_37]: woman who has the elderly mother, I really feel for her.

1370
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:42,793
[SPEAKER_37]: And that is a lot of supplies and that's a lot of waste.

1371
01:43:43,294 --> 01:43:45,395
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's terrible when it's in your home.

1372
01:43:45,776 --> 01:43:47,497
[SPEAKER_37]: You're trying to do your best to take care of them.

1373
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:49,418
[SPEAKER_37]: And what are we going to do for these family members?

1374
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:50,859
[SPEAKER_37]: This really needs to be considered.

1375
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:54,142
[SPEAKER_37]: And the communication needs to be better.

1376
01:43:54,162 --> 01:43:57,284
[SPEAKER_37]: The survey was disgraceful.

1377
01:43:57,464 --> 01:44:03,949
[SPEAKER_37]: It was so unprofessionally written for a bunch of people who are on a board that are very well-educated.

1378
01:44:04,049 --> 01:44:04,890
[SPEAKER_37]: So I suggest

1379
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:08,593
[SPEAKER_37]: someone go look into revising that document going forward.

1380
01:44:09,113 --> 01:44:16,541
[SPEAKER_37]: Additionally, I don't know how much of a 20 seconds left is not everyone goes online, not everyone has a phone that text messages.

1381
01:44:16,601 --> 01:44:21,586
[SPEAKER_37]: So then we need to get to the residents that don't text, don't do QR codes.

1382
01:44:22,086 --> 01:44:26,170
[SPEAKER_37]: Like it may be 2026 that many people have flip phones or maybe they can't even afford a phone.

1383
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:28,572
[SPEAKER_37]: We need better communication to all of our residents.

1384
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:38,400
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Sarah, just to just to address a couple of well, 1 thing that you said the, the Board of health has been doing a lot of work.

1385
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,681
[SPEAKER_28]: I know on rodents.

1386
01:44:40,201 --> 01:44:46,645
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I know you don't think that we're doing anything, but I'm not the Board of health, but there's lots of resources.

1387
01:44:47,085 --> 01:44:49,026
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing lots of citywide initiatives.

1388
01:44:49,386 --> 01:44:51,988
[SPEAKER_28]: We do help with them with some even the mapping of the incidences.

1389
01:44:52,408 --> 01:44:59,496
[SPEAKER_28]: in the DPW and also closed containers that hold our food waste is part of reducing rodents as well.

1390
01:44:59,796 --> 01:45:08,305
[SPEAKER_28]: I know a lot of people believe that rodents will increase when you separate and contain the food waste, but that's not what they're finding out there.

1391
01:45:10,767 --> 01:45:12,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, I should have muted you.

1392
01:45:12,048 --> 01:45:13,850
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just trying to address the things that you said.

1393
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,891
[SPEAKER_28]: I apologize.

1394
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:23,877
[SPEAKER_28]: Then the ordinance, the Board of Health and the City Council just passed a road and control ordinance too, that's a bolstering of a previous ordinance that they had.

1395
01:45:24,257 --> 01:45:25,619
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's a lot of action happening there.

1396
01:45:26,259 --> 01:45:29,081
[SPEAKER_28]: And then please call the engineering division about that port-a-potty if you haven't already.

1397
01:45:29,561 --> 01:45:33,404
[SPEAKER_28]: That sounds like it might be a construction project from the engineering division.

1398
01:45:33,805 --> 01:45:34,365
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

1399
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,727
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to move on to Dylan Compton.

1400
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:41,111
[SPEAKER_28]: Dylan, if you could give your name and address and let us know.

1401
01:45:41,131 --> 01:45:43,598
[SPEAKER_28]: So yeah, your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

1402
01:45:43,698 --> 01:45:44,059
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Dylan.

1403
01:45:47,535 --> 01:45:48,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, hi, Tim.

1404
01:45:48,996 --> 01:45:50,377
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks for taking comments tonight.

1405
01:45:50,978 --> 01:45:51,719
[SPEAKER_27]: Dylan Compton.

1406
01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:53,020
[SPEAKER_27]: I live on Sunset Avenue.

1407
01:45:54,461 --> 01:45:57,223
[SPEAKER_27]: Echo a lot of the other comments and concerns tonight.

1408
01:45:58,624 --> 01:45:59,505
[SPEAKER_27]: I compost.

1409
01:46:00,606 --> 01:46:01,307
[SPEAKER_27]: I recycle.

1410
01:46:01,807 --> 01:46:08,853
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually don't run out of space in my trash can, but the biweekly is a concern to me.

1411
01:46:08,933 --> 01:46:11,635
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there's a huge amount of dogs in the neighborhood.

1412
01:46:11,735 --> 01:46:12,136
[SPEAKER_27]: There's.

1413
01:46:14,037 --> 01:46:18,258
[SPEAKER_27]: human waste, there's things that become quite odorous, especially in the summer months.

1414
01:46:18,918 --> 01:46:25,559
[SPEAKER_27]: And so my concern is almost exclusively with the frequency of pickup and not the the waste reduction goals.

1415
01:46:25,639 --> 01:46:34,981
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, you know, one of my sort of, you know, you phrase this is looking for questions, you've been getting a lot of comments, I appreciate you, you hanging with us.

1416
01:46:35,501 --> 01:46:39,482
[SPEAKER_27]: I think one of my questions is, what would it take for us to look at

1417
01:46:40,322 --> 01:46:44,887
[SPEAKER_27]: smaller cart sizes on a weekly basis as opposed to a bi-weekly system?

1418
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:52,534
[SPEAKER_27]: And what would the relative cost savings there be with just the tonnage reduction versus the pickup frequency reduction?

1419
01:46:52,974 --> 01:46:56,258
[SPEAKER_27]: Because that to me feels like potentially a very workable alternative.

1420
01:46:56,858 --> 01:47:00,239
[SPEAKER_27]: that would address a lot of the community concerns around the waste.

1421
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:09,382
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there's still volume concerns, but that's where pay-as-you-throw really is structured well to solve for that potentially, where the frequency, it really isn't.

1422
01:47:09,402 --> 01:47:15,244
[SPEAKER_27]: There's not an option for me to go out and say, hey, I want somebody to pick up my dog's poop every week.

1423
01:47:16,105 --> 01:47:21,386
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, there's a couple of private services for picking up in your yard, but there's nobody who picks up the bagged stuff that we put in our trash right now.

1424
01:47:23,387 --> 01:47:25,708
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, yeah, I just think that's my core question.

1425
01:47:25,888 --> 01:47:40,455
[SPEAKER_27]: Broadly, I understand where this is coming from and appreciate the city trying to solve for it, but would really like to see us think creatively about how to keep the frequency higher and achieve those tonnage reductions in other ways.

1426
01:47:40,995 --> 01:47:41,275
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1427
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:42,916
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Dylan.

1428
01:47:42,936 --> 01:47:43,916
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate the feedback.

1429
01:47:45,537 --> 01:47:47,538
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we'll move to Charlotte Cahill.

1430
01:47:47,798 --> 01:47:51,260
[SPEAKER_28]: Charlotte, if you could give us your name and address, you'll have two minutes.

1431
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:54,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1432
01:47:54,951 --> 01:47:57,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Charlotte Cahill, Central Ave.

1433
01:47:58,074 --> 01:47:59,595
[SPEAKER_21]: I am sneaking in a second comment.

1434
01:47:59,635 --> 01:48:02,157
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't know if I was going to be able to get away with it, but I'll make it really short.

1435
01:48:02,177 --> 01:48:06,141
[SPEAKER_28]: I wasn't keeping track, Charlotte, but I appreciate your honesty.

1436
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:12,586
[SPEAKER_21]: One is to just say, and I appreciate the fact check on my previous comments.

1437
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:26,762
[SPEAKER_21]: comment where I had the proportion of households represented by the city's composting goal wrong, and that doesn't undermine my sort of larger concern about, like, there's going to be food waste in the trash.

1438
01:48:29,304 --> 01:48:32,348
[SPEAKER_21]: 100% compliance is not really feasible, I don't think.

1439
01:48:32,368 --> 01:48:35,231
[SPEAKER_21]: I think your comments still made sense.

1440
01:48:35,351 --> 01:48:49,786
[SPEAKER_21]: The other point I wanted to make was just to say, and really echoing some of what Dylan said just before me, is I would love to have more information in whatever FAQ or whatever else you put together.

1441
01:48:51,047 --> 01:48:58,514
[SPEAKER_21]: on what alternatives to bi-weekly pickup the city has considered and why you decided against them.

1442
01:48:59,115 --> 01:49:02,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate here the waste reduction goal.

1443
01:49:02,738 --> 01:49:06,481
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that a lot of the comments we're hearing are not pushing back on that.

1444
01:49:06,922 --> 01:49:10,305
[SPEAKER_21]: They're pushing back on this particular bi-weekly approach.

1445
01:49:10,705 --> 01:49:15,069
[SPEAKER_21]: And so it would just be really helpful to understand kind of why you thought

1446
01:49:15,349 --> 01:49:16,269
[SPEAKER_21]: this was the approach.

1447
01:49:16,309 --> 01:49:22,092
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think about, you know, lots of other communities in Massachusetts have pay-as-you-throw.

1448
01:49:22,672 --> 01:49:26,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Interestingly, very few of them are right here in the Boston area.

1449
01:49:27,094 --> 01:49:28,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Malden and Brookline are in it.

1450
01:49:29,775 --> 01:49:36,818
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know Malden at least has chosen an option that does maintain weekly trash pickup at a lower volume.

1451
01:49:36,858 --> 01:49:41,900
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just curious about kind of what the options are and why you think this is the right one for Medford.

1452
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,440
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1453
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:43,781
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Charlotte.

1454
01:49:46,313 --> 01:49:48,074
[SPEAKER_28]: Just Charlie, just let you know, your comment did make sense.

1455
01:49:48,114 --> 01:49:51,737
[SPEAKER_28]: I just needed to correct that fact just so folks had the correct information.

1456
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:58,881
[SPEAKER_28]: And a lot of people bringing it up, keep it every week, but reduce the volume.

1457
01:49:59,222 --> 01:50:02,744
[SPEAKER_28]: That is an option that was looked at closely.

1458
01:50:02,844 --> 01:50:03,645
[SPEAKER_28]: Many options were.

1459
01:50:04,345 --> 01:50:10,069
[SPEAKER_28]: And just so folks know, the cost of collection is a lot higher than the cost of disposal.

1460
01:50:12,991 --> 01:50:14,011
[SPEAKER_28]: That information is out there.

1461
01:50:14,731 --> 01:50:20,313
[SPEAKER_28]: Some was presented tonight, and then there'll be more detailed information on the FAQ, I'm sure, once we're done with tonight.

1462
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:23,654
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people seem to be interested in that, which is great.

1463
01:50:23,754 --> 01:50:24,634
[SPEAKER_28]: I love the brainstorming.

1464
01:50:24,714 --> 01:50:26,135
[SPEAKER_28]: I love the ideas, so thank you.

1465
01:50:26,515 --> 01:50:28,555
[SPEAKER_28]: We're gonna move to Big Haas.

1466
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:39,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully, that's your real name, Big Haas, and we're gonna go from there, and if you could let us know your name and address, then you'll have two minutes to speak.

1467
01:50:47,907 --> 01:50:50,168
[SPEAKER_28]: because it looks like maybe you clicked it and then clicked it again.

1468
01:50:50,188 --> 01:50:55,549
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm gonna ask to unmute again, and just this time, just click it slowly.

1469
01:51:03,151 --> 01:51:04,971
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, well, I'm gonna put your hand down.

1470
01:51:05,371 --> 01:51:07,812
[SPEAKER_28]: If you would like to try again, please put your hand back up.

1471
01:51:07,832 --> 01:51:12,413
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I'm gonna move to GTurk.

1472
01:51:13,343 --> 01:51:18,106
[SPEAKER_28]: G-Turk, I'm going to unmute you, and please let us know your name and address, and you'll have two minutes.

1473
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, hi.

1474
01:51:25,532 --> 01:51:30,535
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Gilbert and a Turk, and I live on Woods Road in Metzl.

1475
01:51:31,596 --> 01:51:36,039
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I, you know, I watched the presentation.

1476
01:51:36,139 --> 01:51:41,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, everyone is concerned by, you know, environmental issues and, you know,

1477
01:51:45,886 --> 01:51:49,788
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, make sure that everything is done in a proper way.

1478
01:51:50,568 --> 01:52:04,835
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, you know, as many other citizens and, you know, express the same concern about rodents, I mean, last year we had raccoon in our trash bins, summertime when it's really hot, it's terrible.

1479
01:52:05,815 --> 01:52:14,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I mean, you know, I understand, you know, that, you know, I mean, we're not, you know, I don't think

1480
01:52:15,383 --> 01:52:18,460
[SPEAKER_15]: We were consulted before this program was implemented.

1481
01:52:19,343 --> 01:52:45,032
[SPEAKER_15]: and uh you know just and to convince people that you know having trucks that will run once every other week will put less strain on streets and roads and was cut on pollution i mean it's it's a joke um you know again we're paying also more property taxes and getting less services that's right yeah go and i understand cities have

1482
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:50,436
[SPEAKER_15]: big trouble closing their budgets, everything is going up, the cost of living, everything.

1483
01:52:51,036 --> 01:52:55,740
[SPEAKER_15]: But I believe there's way better ideas to implement stuff.

1484
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:02,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And certainly, the every other week, you know, program is not the right one.

1485
01:53:02,325 --> 01:53:11,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe, you know, Medford is, unless I'm wrong, is the only city which are going to this direction.

1486
01:53:13,494 --> 01:53:14,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure

1487
01:53:14,812 --> 01:53:16,214
[SPEAKER_15]: what the result is going to be.

1488
01:53:17,535 --> 01:53:24,442
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I mean, will you allow to, I mean, to change course if things will not go the right way?

1489
01:53:24,462 --> 01:53:28,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're open to anything new, but I don't know.

1490
01:53:30,469 --> 01:53:31,209
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, G-Turk.

1491
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:32,571
[SPEAKER_28]: We appreciate the comments.

1492
01:53:33,312 --> 01:53:36,315
[SPEAKER_28]: And this is, I'm going to say something, but it has nothing to do with what you just said, just in general.

1493
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:58,048
[SPEAKER_28]: just been notified maybe there was some personal attacks made I was not aware of it didn't seem like it to me and they were masked if there's only a few more speakers left but no personal attacks no veiled personal attacks we're all people we're trying to do our job here okay so thank you we're going to move to

1494
01:53:59,488 --> 01:54:02,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Vinny or Vinay, I believe he has a new comment to make.

1495
01:54:02,794 --> 01:54:07,763
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna ask him to unmute and if you could just say your name and address again.

1496
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:08,384
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Vinny.

1497
01:54:11,237 --> 01:54:11,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Tim.

1498
01:54:11,937 --> 01:54:13,138
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is pronounced Vinay.

1499
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:15,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to clear that up for you.

1500
01:54:16,559 --> 01:54:24,342
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also wanted to add to my previous comment that with composting, I only put my trash out once or twice a month now.

1501
01:54:24,982 --> 01:54:29,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have three big dogs and all of their dog poop goes in the trash bin.

1502
01:54:30,044 --> 01:54:33,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't have a rat problem here in West Medford.

1503
01:54:33,966 --> 01:54:36,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's because my trash can is in good condition.

1504
01:54:37,468 --> 01:54:49,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And someone else also mentioned before that when you separate out all your food waste in a secure container, that really restricts the amount of rats or food that critters in general have access to.

1505
01:54:51,057 --> 01:54:57,341
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a raccoon that tried to get to the compost bin, but it was secure enough that it couldn't open it, figure out how to open it.

1506
01:54:58,041 --> 01:54:59,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to share that as well.

1507
01:55:00,497 --> 01:55:00,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1508
01:55:00,877 --> 01:55:01,357
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Vinny.

1509
01:55:02,237 --> 01:55:03,758
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate your comments and your feedback.

1510
01:55:03,778 --> 01:55:07,899
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, Ralph Klein.

1511
01:55:08,139 --> 01:55:09,979
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe Ralph spoke, but he may have a new comment.

1512
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,000
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to ask him to unmute.

1513
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:15,081
[SPEAKER_28]: If he could give us his name and address again, in about two minutes.

1514
01:55:19,422 --> 01:55:20,062
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, can you hear me?

1515
01:55:21,182 --> 01:55:21,422
[SPEAKER_24]: I can.

1516
01:55:21,783 --> 01:55:22,243
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome, Ralph.

1517
01:55:22,923 --> 01:55:23,563
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, thank you.

1518
01:55:24,603 --> 01:55:27,184
[SPEAKER_24]: All these comments about, you know, the plastic bins.

1519
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:30,576
[SPEAKER_24]: The old containers they used to pick up with metal, they got into them.

1520
01:55:31,136 --> 01:55:37,839
[SPEAKER_24]: My trash bins have very little food in them, but there are animals that have chewed through the plastic.

1521
01:55:38,119 --> 01:55:40,820
[SPEAKER_24]: So these plastic bins should not be used.

1522
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,161
[SPEAKER_24]: They're chewing through the regular trash barrels.

1523
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:48,083
[SPEAKER_24]: What makes you think they're not going to chew through these plastics after a while when they find out there's food in there?

1524
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:52,605
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing is all these heavy trash trucks going down the street, they're saying,

1525
01:55:53,481 --> 01:55:53,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1526
01:55:54,142 --> 01:55:55,983
[SPEAKER_24]: How heavy are they going to be every other week?

1527
01:55:56,503 --> 01:55:57,504
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not reducing it.

1528
01:55:57,944 --> 01:55:59,545
[SPEAKER_24]: You're just pushing it into another week.

1529
01:56:00,626 --> 01:56:05,189
[SPEAKER_24]: All the other things come from, we have no more stores really that are open.

1530
01:56:05,229 --> 01:56:06,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Our stores are closed and left and right.

1531
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:08,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything comes from Amazon, wherever.

1532
01:56:09,092 --> 01:56:11,874
[SPEAKER_24]: That's where everything, that's where all this trash is generated from.

1533
01:56:12,735 --> 01:56:14,816
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to start getting back to local shopping.

1534
01:56:17,798 --> 01:56:19,659
[SPEAKER_24]: Stop and shop where they have the food delivered.

1535
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:21,661
[SPEAKER_24]: They put it in boxes to get rid of their boxes.

1536
01:56:22,335 --> 01:56:23,495
[SPEAKER_24]: when they deliver it to homes.

1537
01:56:24,796 --> 01:56:27,897
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, all we have is all these other trucks going down the streets.

1538
01:56:28,497 --> 01:56:30,538
[SPEAKER_24]: And everybody thinks the electric vehicles are great.

1539
01:56:30,958 --> 01:56:32,158
[SPEAKER_24]: They're destroying our streets.

1540
01:56:32,218 --> 01:56:33,659
[SPEAKER_24]: They're destroying them in California.

1541
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:34,619
[SPEAKER_24]: They have cement roads.

1542
01:56:35,159 --> 01:56:40,761
[SPEAKER_24]: In the summer here, the electric vehicles, and if they're going to electric trucks, they're even heavier.

1543
01:56:40,781 --> 01:56:42,521
[SPEAKER_24]: They're gonna destroy our roads even more.

1544
01:56:43,542 --> 01:56:46,483
[SPEAKER_24]: So why not reduce it by half what you're doing?

1545
01:56:47,283 --> 01:56:47,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1546
01:56:47,663 --> 01:56:50,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate the comments, Ralph.

1547
01:56:51,124 --> 01:57:03,287
[SPEAKER_28]: We've been studying weights of vehicles and impacts of roads for a while, and the weight of the vehicles matters, but the number of trips also matters, and the movements, the wheel friction on the road.

1548
01:57:03,307 --> 01:57:08,368
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's lots of considerations when it comes to impacts of roads, not the environment per se.

1549
01:57:08,388 --> 01:57:10,549
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, I will move on to Gary.

1550
01:57:11,869 --> 01:57:14,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Gary, when my... Can you hear me?

1551
01:57:16,185 --> 01:57:16,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, maybe.

1552
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:18,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this Gary.

1553
01:57:18,608 --> 01:57:19,689
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Gary.

1554
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:19,930
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

1555
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:24,295
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I didn't even know you someone else must have so thank you.

1556
01:57:24,515 --> 01:57:26,077
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi Gary on Paris street.

1557
01:57:26,398 --> 01:57:32,205
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm here tonight to speak against the proposal to reduce the trash pickup schedule to every other week.

1558
01:57:33,506 --> 01:57:41,928
[SPEAKER_42]: On the surface, although cutting back pickups may sound like a simple way to save money, in practice, it creates far more problems than it solves.

1559
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:48,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Problems that affect public health, neighborhood cleanliness, and overall quality of life.

1560
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:55,391
[SPEAKER_42]: First, less frequent trash pickups means more waste sitting longer in homes and on our curbs.

1561
01:57:56,331 --> 01:57:57,952
[SPEAKER_42]: That leads to overflowing bins,

1562
01:57:58,852 --> 01:58:01,413
[SPEAKER_42]: very unpleasant odors and increased pests.

1563
01:58:02,213 --> 01:58:12,457
[SPEAKER_42]: We already have rats, raccoons, insects, and bugs here near Salem Street and Felsway, and these are not minor inconveniences.

1564
01:58:12,517 --> 01:58:18,719
[SPEAKER_42]: They're real health concerns, especially for families with children, seniors, and people living in multifamily homes.

1565
01:58:19,839 --> 01:58:20,980
[SPEAKER_42]: Second, reducing

1566
01:58:22,297 --> 01:58:26,560
[SPEAKER_42]: Hiccup does not reduce waste, it just shifts the burdens onto the residents.

1567
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:33,264
[SPEAKER_42]: Families will be forced to store more trash for longer periods, which is not realistic for most households.

1568
01:58:34,545 --> 01:58:43,571
[SPEAKER_42]: Many properties also lack extra storage space, and the community relies on regular disposal and will struggle to stay clean.

1569
01:58:44,564 --> 01:58:49,125
[SPEAKER_42]: Third, this change risks making our community look neglected.

1570
01:58:49,765 --> 01:58:56,948
[SPEAKER_42]: Overflowing bins and illegal dumping become much more common when people don't have adequate disposal options.

1571
01:58:57,868 --> 01:59:01,629
[SPEAKER_42]: That hurts property values and undermines the pride we take in our community.

1572
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:06,832
[SPEAKER_42]: At my home, we already recycle, and we're already signed up for composting.

1573
01:59:07,652 --> 01:59:09,954
[SPEAKER_42]: Even with that, our bin is always full.

1574
01:59:10,334 --> 01:59:12,635
[SPEAKER_42]: There's never a week when our bin is not full.

1575
01:59:13,356 --> 01:59:20,080
[SPEAKER_42]: We have two young children who are in diapers, and trust me, those diapers smell quite awful.

1576
01:59:21,101 --> 01:59:26,704
[SPEAKER_42]: Our bin already smells awful as is, and I can't imagine what it would be like with every other week pickup.

1577
01:59:27,345 --> 01:59:27,665
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1578
01:59:28,565 --> 01:59:29,106
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Gary.

1579
01:59:29,126 --> 01:59:30,527
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate your comments.

1580
01:59:31,922 --> 01:59:36,930
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to move to, to all one word, Judith Weinstock.

1581
01:59:38,373 --> 01:59:39,735
[SPEAKER_28]: Judith, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1582
01:59:39,895 --> 01:59:44,062
[SPEAKER_28]: If you could give us your name and address for the record, and you'll have two minutes to speak.

1583
01:59:47,862 --> 01:59:49,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name is Judith Weinstock.

1584
01:59:49,322 --> 01:59:51,003
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 144 Burgett.

1585
01:59:52,543 --> 01:59:58,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually a little surprised, not at the comments about going to every other week.

1586
01:59:58,785 --> 02:00:03,167
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually think the city seriously needs to revisit that if it's not too late.

1587
02:00:03,227 --> 02:00:08,188
[SPEAKER_18]: In other words, if a contract's already been signed, then this is all somewhat moot.

1588
02:00:08,828 --> 02:00:17,171
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do think that I would like to comment on the composting program, which I think is pretty phenomenal.

1589
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:26,180
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to focus on it for a second because I think that there's some kudos deserved by the city and by the company that you've contracted with.

1590
02:00:26,661 --> 02:00:33,308
[SPEAKER_18]: I only started doing it about three months ago and it was remarkable how easy I found it.

1591
02:00:33,408 --> 02:00:36,030
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that the city could actually work

1592
02:00:36,751 --> 02:00:44,235
[SPEAKER_18]: much harder on encouraging many, many, many more households to do it, because it is a relatively simple program.

1593
02:00:44,275 --> 02:00:58,702
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also think that the city, just as you did with rain barrel options for people years ago, people do have to go out, they have to buy a bin for their internal collection, they have to buy those bags, they have to buy the bags for their

1594
02:00:59,382 --> 02:01:11,375
[SPEAKER_18]: the bin that you provide for free and I think it would be great if the city could provide some additional resources potentially bulk buying and discounting for in-home bins that people have to use for that program.

1595
02:01:11,695 --> 02:01:17,621
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to see the city at this point with all this feedback decouple these programs and begin to focus

1596
02:01:18,902 --> 02:01:32,987
[SPEAKER_18]: 100% on increasing the number of households who are doing composting now and for the future, and work longer and harder on solving some of the really important issues that people have brought up tonight.

1597
02:01:33,067 --> 02:01:34,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're legitimate.

1598
02:01:34,947 --> 02:01:35,868
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't affect me.

1599
02:01:35,988 --> 02:01:37,728
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a single-person household.

1600
02:01:37,888 --> 02:01:39,069
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't fill my bin.

1601
02:01:39,429 --> 02:01:41,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Please don't come by and drop your stuff here.

1602
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:50,794
[SPEAKER_18]: but I really think you're hearing some really serious concerns that need serious fixes before you implement the program.

1603
02:01:51,294 --> 02:01:52,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for the time.

1604
02:01:52,715 --> 02:01:55,176
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Judith.

1605
02:01:55,196 --> 02:02:00,599
[SPEAKER_28]: I will say comments and feedback are not moot.

1606
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:03,981
[SPEAKER_28]: We're trying to identify gaps, respond to feedback.

1607
02:02:04,261 --> 02:02:06,442
[SPEAKER_28]: There's flexibility within the signed contracts.

1608
02:02:07,007 --> 02:02:12,271
[SPEAKER_28]: There are contractual dates and milestones that we have to meet certain things and make certain decisions.

1609
02:02:12,912 --> 02:02:24,401
[SPEAKER_28]: And because of the pay-as-you-throw relationship, it's actually been coupled as opposed to decoupled because they feed off of each other and it's part of one whole program.

1610
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:28,503
[SPEAKER_28]: So hopefully that helps clarify things for folks.

1611
02:02:28,983 --> 02:02:30,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Definitely not moot at all.

1612
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:40,127
[SPEAKER_28]: This information is incredibly valuable to us to help us fill those gaps and take those flexibilities and continue to design the program over the next year and a half, really.

1613
02:02:41,188 --> 02:02:43,309
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's what we're looking at.

1614
02:02:43,449 --> 02:02:44,209
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1615
02:02:44,489 --> 02:02:46,630
[SPEAKER_28]: That's everybody who has their hands up.

1616
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:53,473
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'll just give, it's 8, 10, if there are other folks who would like to speak.

1617
02:02:54,908 --> 02:02:55,608
[SPEAKER_28]: Now's your chance.

1618
02:02:56,529 --> 02:03:08,575
[SPEAKER_28]: If not, I'm gonna, I suppose, I don't know if we have, I don't recall if we had any closing planned, but I don't know if Steve, you wanted to say anything or anybody else wanted to say anything or if we should just log off.

1619
02:03:09,676 --> 02:03:14,958
[SPEAKER_32]: We have one other comment from the person, Big Hoss, who had trouble unmuting.

1620
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:15,879
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

1621
02:03:15,899 --> 02:03:17,760
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you want me to just read that one?

1622
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure, yeah.

1623
02:03:21,162 --> 02:03:23,823
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Amy and I live on Princeton Street.

1624
02:03:24,318 --> 02:03:29,084
[SPEAKER_32]: I do not appreciate him telling a resident he should have muted her so that he could speak over her.

1625
02:03:29,484 --> 02:03:32,688
[SPEAKER_32]: There seems to be a huge disregard for the residents you are serving.

1626
02:03:33,369 --> 02:03:36,913
[SPEAKER_32]: I am a mother and can't tell you how many diapers end up in my trash weekly.

1627
02:03:36,933 --> 02:03:44,602
[SPEAKER_32]: It's insane to announce this during a cost of living crisis for the population of your residents, which is families, elders, and students.

1628
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:46,940
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1629
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:49,542
[SPEAKER_28]: Just to clarify, I was not being disrespectful in any sense of the word.

1630
02:03:50,602 --> 02:03:56,905
[SPEAKER_28]: The mechanics of this particular meeting and the way it was formatted doesn't give me particularly a lot of flexibility.

1631
02:03:56,965 --> 02:03:59,767
[SPEAKER_28]: That's how we agreed to have a Q&A open dialogue.

1632
02:04:00,107 --> 02:04:06,730
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really to receive feedback, and my role is to correct things that maybe are facts that are wrong.

1633
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:09,632
[SPEAKER_28]: So hopefully that explains it.

1634
02:04:09,732 --> 02:04:12,233
[SPEAKER_28]: I certainly didn't mean anybody any disrespect whatsoever.

1635
02:04:12,833 --> 02:04:14,294
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope you can appreciate that.

1636
02:04:15,342 --> 02:04:20,565
[SPEAKER_28]: With that said, if there's nobody else to speak tonight, we can wrap it up.

1637
02:04:22,486 --> 02:04:26,207
[SPEAKER_28]: And we have other scheduled events.

1638
02:04:26,307 --> 02:04:29,489
[SPEAKER_28]: January 28th is at City Hall.

1639
02:04:29,509 --> 02:04:30,610
[SPEAKER_28]: That's at 6 p.m.

1640
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:35,252
[SPEAKER_28]: January 28th at 6 p.m., Medford City Hall, City Council Chambers.

1641
02:04:36,266 --> 02:04:40,390
[SPEAKER_28]: There were a lot of comments, a few comments at the beginning about how this was only on Zoom.

1642
02:04:40,811 --> 02:04:41,151
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not.

1643
02:04:41,171 --> 02:04:43,694
[SPEAKER_28]: There's educational workshops that are going to be taking place as well.

1644
02:04:44,354 --> 02:04:47,317
[SPEAKER_28]: There's lots planned.

1645
02:04:48,058 --> 02:04:49,940
[SPEAKER_28]: So we appreciate everybody's feedback tonight.

1646
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:51,341
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1647
02:04:55,245 --> 02:04:57,828
[SPEAKER_28]: Steve, do you want to call it, say goodnight?

1648
02:04:58,373 --> 02:05:00,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I didn't see no other questions.

1649
02:05:00,895 --> 02:05:05,198
[SPEAKER_13]: As Tim said, we're going to have an in-person meeting on the 28th of January at 6 p.m.

1650
02:05:05,219 --> 02:05:05,779
[SPEAKER_13]: at City Hall.

1651
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:11,123
[SPEAKER_13]: A recording of this meeting will also be available on our website, on the city's YouTube, and on MCM.

1652
02:05:12,084 --> 02:05:16,448
[SPEAKER_13]: And please head over if you have any other questions after this meeting ends.

1653
02:05:16,688 --> 02:05:20,311
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to answer it, please email us at waste at medford-ma.gov.

1654
02:05:22,192 --> 02:05:29,262
[SPEAKER_13]: And for more information, head over to our website medfordma.org slash waste dash dash system.

1655
02:05:29,663 --> 02:05:29,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1656
02:05:30,864 --> 02:05:31,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good night, everybody.

1657
02:05:31,605 --> 02:05:32,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks a lot.

1658
02:05:32,687 --> 02:05:32,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Ready.

1659
02:05:33,027 --> 02:05:33,368
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye bye.

1660
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:34,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
