[SPEAKER_03]: authorizes public meetings, and the meeting can also be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast Channel 22 and Verizon Channel 43.

00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:22,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Additional questions or comments can be made during the meeting by emailing Melanie McLaughlin at medford.k12.ma.us.

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do have questions or comments, we ask that you submit your first and last name, your Medford street address,

4
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:30,752
[SPEAKER_03]: and your question or comment.

5
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:47,141
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda for today's meeting is we're asking community members to join us as we determine annual goals for our special ed and behavioral health subcommittee, including proposed problem practice and how we can work together to increase meaningful family and community engagement regarding these proposed concerns.

6
00:00:49,075 --> 00:01:16,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks who don't know a little about the history of the Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee, we were formed three years ago, actually, after multiple requests by the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, CPAC, to school committee to ask for a subcommittee specific to special education needs and issues, as there seem to be many, and these were in multiple annual

7
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:21,643
[SPEAKER_03]: reports to the school committee request for the subcommittee.

8
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:28,706
[SPEAKER_03]: It was initially created by Aaron DiBenedetto as school committee while I was chair of CPAC.

9
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how we originated.

10
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really decided on a problem of practice for special education was building friendships, is building friendships between students with disabilities and without disabilities in our schools and our community.

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the ways that we worked on that last year is looking at

12
00:01:50,453 --> 00:02:01,726
[SPEAKER_03]: issues concerning Medford recreation and the creation of an adaptive, I mean, an adaptive, some adaptive programming for Medford recreation and

13
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:07,624
[SPEAKER_03]: an adaptive PE teacher in the schools, as well as unified sports.

14
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:10,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So we feel like we're moving things forward a bit, which is nice.

15
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:11,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see some progress.

16
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for special education, you know, the topic that we had addressed last year, problem of practice, if you will, is helping to create trauma-informed schools.

17
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:31,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some training and professional development that

18
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:36,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Stacey, you were putting forward regarding that, right?

19
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a few meetings on that.

20
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:49,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had parents who are also mental health workers, licensed social workers in the community that participated in those meetings and had some really great ideas about engaging and involving family members.

21
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:58,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did reach out to some community members who were not able to attend tonight, but had asked that we put forward some ideas.

22
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would also just love to hear from

23
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:23,364
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe each of you, and maybe you could talk a little bit about the structure for the meetings for this year, how you requested that it be structured a little bit differently based on just the tight schedule everyone has under the COVID pandemic, everything that you guys are dealing with.

24
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:29,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know which one of you wants to begin, but maybe one of you could start to talk about the difference in planning for this year.

25
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:36,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so I think that, um, as you understand, reducing yourself don't because I'm just thinking about people who are watching.

26
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:37,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

27
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:41,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So hi I'm Joan Bowen I'm director of people services here for med for public schools.

28
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:45,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stacey and I reached out to Melanie about changing these.

29
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: the structure of these meetings just a little bit to alternate between special education and behavioral health every other month.

30
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:57,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will alternate.

31
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,333
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the dates set up.

32
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:07,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Melanie included it in tonight's agenda or an email that will set up, you know, the nights that we will specifically talk about special education.

33
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:11,178
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dates that we will specifically talk about behavioral health.

34
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:22,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully when we identify our problem of practice or our goal for the upcoming year, this will be the topic of discussion and we'll put a plan into place.

35
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:29,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I believe at the end, we present this to school committee or it's brought forward to school committee.

36
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:34,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look forward to working with the community and the subcommittee this year in regards to that.

37
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

38
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:45,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Joan, yeah, so what had been originally created as a special education subcommittee with a new administration in the 2019 term.

39
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:54,490
[SPEAKER_03]: additional subcommittees were created and topics were merged.

40
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we became, we moved from the special education subcommittee to these two really broad topics, behavioral health and special education.

41
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:08,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So last year, we tried to do like an hour and a half meeting where we're splitting it 45 minutes for each topic.

42
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think

43
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:13,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks felt like that maybe was a little bit long and perhaps a little disjointed.

44
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year we will alternate between the meetings, as you said, Joan.

45
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be interesting to see how that goes and where people feel that's useful.

46
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:33,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some people feel that maybe what they thought was going to be nine meetings is now suddenly four or less.

47
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So that seems concerning.

48
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:39,507
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think one of the things that you had mentioned was that you felt maybe we could build some momentum

49
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: on some of the topics in between some of the goals in between the meetings that gave us more time to sort of build some momentum around that.

50
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:48,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

51
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:48,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

52
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the request is just for this year only.

53
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:59,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and we can relook at it at the end of the year, use this year to determine, you know, what was this way that we scheduled it?

54
00:05:59,296 --> 00:05:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work?

55
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need more time?

56
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:10,223
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be, you know, sometimes special education needs more than an hour or maybe behavior health is a great presentation and we may need that.

57
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:16,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's relooking at that, looking at how it goes this year and then determining next year, how we want to proceed.

58
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Stacey, do you want to add anything?

59
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I just echo what Joan said.

60
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:28,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, this was the original format, I think, from two years ago.

61
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,314
[SPEAKER_00]: We alternated the two every other time.

62
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I think COVID presented a unique

63
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:36,794
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of challenge for additional communication.

64
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to meet more frequently.

65
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:44,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just going back to how we had done it for past practice and to see how that goes.

66
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree.

67
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:56,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything can change over time, but we are obviously like still in quite in the pandemic in a very different way than we were last year.

68
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, the, you know, one of the most important things on our plate, which continues to be was communication with the community.

69
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we were doing that as frequently as possible so that we were meeting constantly.

70
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:16,518
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that there has been a bit of a shift to more intensive direct care, students and staff.

71
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:25,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Just changes a little bit, a little bit and allows us to have more time to work together between those meeting times.

72
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,021
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that sounds good.

73
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,882
[SPEAKER_03]: See the superintendent just during us welcome superintendent.

74
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:44,030
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about defining some problems of practice, which when we say problem of practice, just for the community, I wanna let you know that doesn't mean there's a problem.

75
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that we're identifying something to work on together to achieve a goal.

76
00:07:50,852 --> 00:08:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just sort of a phrase that is used in identifying sort of items to work on to achieve some goals.

77
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did have feedback from some of the staff

78
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:33,337
[SPEAKER_03]: families in the special education community, families of children with disabilities who want to continue to grow and foster partnership between Medford Recreation and Medford Public Schools around adaptive and unified programming, and specifically around sports, but also just around education.

79
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:40,294
[SPEAKER_03]: and supporting students with disabilities in our community.

80
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:53,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And just around even some basic symbolic acts, but additionally, appropriate language, sort of reaching out to community sponsors.

81
00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:01,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So there already is some interaction between Medford Recreation and our school system where CCSR students are volunteering for

82
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:16,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the adaptive programming that's occurring in Metro Recreation right now they're currently running a basketball program I mean a yeah basketball no soccer and Wednesday's soccer and basketball starting.

83
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:23,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is some opportunity but I think I know that we're folks are meeting both with Metro Brock and the mayor.

84
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:46,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And tomorrow, there's a meeting with Medford Recreation to sort of start to think about the language around this and how to make sure we're all on the same page regarding language, both in our schools and in our community, and that we are working together to create inclusive programming and

85
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,071
[SPEAKER_03]: in addition to adaptive programming.

86
00:09:51,511 --> 00:10:10,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we can write this in a more eloquent way, and I'm happy to sort of, we can either brainstorm that now or through the chat, or we can bring it back to the meeting for the next month in terms of having a mission statement, or if you will, or problem of practice specific to special education.

87
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:17,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie, can you just speak a little bit to what you, can you clarify what you mean by appropriate language?

88
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so I'm on.

89
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so everybody knows.

91
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Joan, I'm sure you've heard people first language, right?

92
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,441
[SPEAKER_03]: You sort of heard, which for some people that's appropriate and for some people it's not.

93
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:38,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people prefer to have their diagnosis before their, you know, so for example, some people in the autism community prefer to be called autistic, but people perhaps in the Down syndrome community,

94
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:46,386
[SPEAKER_03]: People with autism may prefer to be called an autistic person, man, woman, what have you.

95
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And people, for example, in the Down syndrome community may prefer not to have Down syndrome kid first, have a child with Down syndrome or something.

96
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:03,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of thinking about and educating community members and school staff and, you know,

97
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: recreation staff and what have you around like what is and isn't appropriate language.

98
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I look to people with disabilities themselves to really drive that conversation.

99
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would want to include self-advocates in that conversation and really be able to understand what does that mean.

100
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think just in all of our language, in our school, you know, in our community and in our school brochures, but also in our, on our websites, on our, you know,

101
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,491
[SPEAKER_03]: just sort of universally sort of looking at what is appropriate language.

102
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:44,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when we say integrated, what does that mean?

103
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, inclusive, what does that mean?

104
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:59,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe sort of just identifying what some of these terms actually mean to us and how we define them so that we're all sort of creating a primer, if you will, on what is, you know, acceptable and appropriate language in this way.

105
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:04,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes I think, and what I hear from families is that

106
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: They see something in writing or notice something in a brochure, and it is perfectly well intended it is not meant to hurt or harm by any stretch, but sometimes you don't know what you don't know.

107
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:29,545
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it can be considered, you know, painful to family members of children with disabilities and to children with disabilities themselves or people with disabilities themselves.

108
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So just how are we being more sensitive around some of that?

109
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one way to start.

110
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:40,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Just around, again, brochures, you know, sports brochures, you know, signups, right?

111
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:45,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we talked before about having like, you know, some, you know,

112
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: quote in the signups, for example, that we all know Medford public schools doesn't discriminate based on, you know, race, you know, ability, all those things, but what does that language really look like?

113
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:11,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do we vet that as the special education subcommittee and make recommendations to the school committee so that this is universal language that's used across the districts and, you know, something that hopefully the city will adapt as well.

114
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:12,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

115
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

116
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:13,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

117
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:15,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Heather.

118
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.

119
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:22,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to be here.

120
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:23,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you guys again.

121
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:24,686
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

122
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:28,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the last minute sort of we were just saying that it's been a little bit of a hectic

123
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:38,359
[SPEAKER_03]: month and I think we're all just been running and racing to try to feel like we're playing catch up and we're all shocked that next week is November already.

124
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, we haven't, I feel like I'm just starting to catch my breath and it's like November.

125
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, uh-oh, here come the holidays.

126
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel the same way.

127
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:50,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel exactly the same way.

128
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bananas.

129
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:53,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is.

130
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, I think a big part of it, I was just talking to somebody about this yesterday,

131
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:02,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a big part of it is that, and maybe Stacey, you can talk to this a little bit as well.

132
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:12,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a big part of it is that people are, for the most part, trying to assume a normal, if you will, but it's not in a normal.

133
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:25,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was a setting on a dryer, so I don't wanna sort of put it that way, but assume a regular schedule, I guess, or assume that we're post-COVID when we all know we're really not, and we're still in this sort of limbo of pre-COVID,

134
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:50,378
[SPEAKER_03]: life and post-COVID life and we're sort of not we don't really have our footing yet in terms of what's where we really are right and it does feel like at any moment it can be completely upended right any moment now any moment especially considering what we went through right and then and I think the other thing is that I was saying to somebody yesterday I felt like it's like

135
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:54,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel a little bit like where the Starks and the Game of Thrones, right?

136
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like winter is coming.

137
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all like, you know, we were closed in last year and we were all shut in.

138
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:12,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, we're approaching that time when we start to get shut in again and sort of, you know, when germs can sort of happen more rapidly or whatever.

139
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:14,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think people are just going through a lot.

140
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And Stacey, I'm sure you're seeing a lot of this in your work, right?

141
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: In our schools, a lot of.

142
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that,

143
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:38,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that part of what we're seeing is a typical pattern that we see annually talking about wintertime, so that people get like depressed over the winter, 25% of people in the Northeast experience depressive symptoms due to that are like weather climate right.

144
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:42,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for those people who those symptoms continue in March.

145
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:48,386
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wait a minute, this was supposed to go away once like the sun started coming back out.

146
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:58,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's very similar to what people are experiencing now when we had all talked about like when everyone's vaccinated and things are going to be totally different in the fall and we're going to start to be able to do all these things.

147
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:05,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the ability is there, but not without caution and not without, you know, sort of still thinking about it.

148
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:16,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think for everyone, this creates a mental health disorder, but it does, I think a lot of people, what they're experiencing is adrenaline fatigue.

149
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:22,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just, they've been running, you know, like they've been running a marathon and they expected to sort of have a reprieve.

150
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,671
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not lifted yet.

151
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

152
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:28,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

153
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,654
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my own like personal opinion.

154
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:31,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.

155
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,016
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I understand, yeah.

156
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:33,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

157
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:42,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that the mental load that goes along with the repercussions of COVID is a lot.

158
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:59,436
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, I went to the movies for the first time since pre-COVID last weekend, and I was spraying down the chairs with hand sanitizer and thinking, why didn't I ever think to do this before?

159
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,516
[SPEAKER_06]: This is disgusting.

160
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this whole new,

161
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:08,075
[SPEAKER_06]: germaphobia, it's taken complete toll.

162
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot to carry around all the time.

163
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a lot to carry around all the time.

164
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for articulating that, Heather.

165
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:32,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that we're trying to determine tonight, Heather, and thank you, Carmen, for joining, is, and for folks who don't know Carmen, is the superintendent intern in

166
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:35,964
[SPEAKER_03]: working with Dr. Edouard Vincent.

167
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:37,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for joining.

168
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we're working to do tonight is to identify a goal for the year for each of these particular areas.

169
00:17:46,386 --> 00:18:00,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know for the behavioral health piece, one of the things that I heard a lot from the community last year for those who participated in our meetings and who were specifically talking about behavioral health

170
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:06,593
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard a lot about community family and community engagement.

171
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had several folks who came on board and who wanted to offer support services around like how can we support the schools as professionals, not that we would have, you know, people come in and, you know,

172
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,862
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, volunteer in a professional capacity, but they bring professional expertise to the table.

173
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:36,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking, for example, Heather Rumenak, we know is a licensed mental health worker and, you know, who had identified a number of topics she felt were of concern.

174
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:51,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And so did it, you know, was it an annual event that we host that's sort of around awareness or, you know, was there some other way that we engage community members and especially around some of the

175
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,516
[SPEAKER_03]: behavioral health, mental health stuff.

176
00:18:53,857 --> 00:19:10,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We also had a family that participated regularly last year and I ran into mom recently who was talking a lot about invisible disability.

177
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:33,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think mental health is often, can often be what's perceived as an invisible disability when somebody has mental health needs and they don't necessarily wear those needs on their face or have an IEP accompanying them or a 504 accompanying them, or they may, but they still don't have those identifiable factors.

178
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:41,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And oftentimes what can present, what can be anxiety can present as behavior.

179
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:52,353
[SPEAKER_03]: and can result in negative outcomes for our children in our schools and with our staff.

180
00:19:52,633 --> 00:20:01,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's a really interesting aspect as well to consider as a problem of practice, perhaps to explore.

181
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:09,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we say problem of practice, I think that we think about what this subcommittee can do is offer resources, some research, some ideas

182
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:22,266
[SPEAKER_03]: and then come together to discuss them around how to address this particular problem of practice, hopefully come to some resolution by the end of the year on a couple of recommendations to make to school committee as policy.

183
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:31,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if we want to just popcorn some ideas around perhaps, and Joan, I don't want to assume that we have agreed on the

184
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:45,279
[SPEAKER_03]: know, language and friendship sort of community thing yet either, so I'm just putting that out there, but I want to ask folks what they think specific to behavioral health goal, problem, or practice for this year.

185
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:54,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a specific goal in mind, but I think one thing

186
00:20:56,111 --> 00:21:04,637
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have seen over the past decade, certainly in five years, is somewhat of an over pathologizing of anxiety.

187
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:07,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's really, everyone has anxiety.

188
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It's healthy to have anxiety.

189
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,163
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have anxiety, you don't know that to get out of the way of a fast moving car, cause that might hurt you.

190
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:15,364
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to.

191
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:20,027
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, I often see, you know,

192
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:38,293
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of the things that supports people with specifically an anxiety disorder, also depression, is the education around that 95% of people who have mental health disorders recover in a fairly short period of time with the appropriate care for it.

193
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:45,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And that some people don't, and they have chronic conditions, but because you have anxiety or depression does not mean you are, you know,

194
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:48,349
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be living with that forever.

195
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Melanie, you always do a great job of talking about how disability isn't permanent.

196
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:58,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you are, you know, it could be like temporarily in some certain cases, and you've given great examples of that.

197
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:06,579
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think education around mental health, we've done a lot of it in the past four years, but there's certainly a need for more always.

198
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:14,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're doing a lot in the schools around education to students, but certainly education to parents.

199
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,025
[SPEAKER_00]: is always a gap area.

200
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:27,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a lot of events, but it's hard for, I think, parents with really busy schedules, or perhaps dealing with an anxious child at home to attend those events.

201
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:31,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So problem solving, how to like get that information out in a meaningful, helpful way.

202
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:39,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the thing is that I think that sometimes we think parents are aware of these opportunities.

203
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:45,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think oftentimes, maybe we're not communicating as effectively as we think, not you, Stacy, but

204
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:48,611
[SPEAKER_03]: just in terms of family and community engagement.

205
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:52,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are having a presentation, by the way, on family and community engagement.

206
00:22:53,436 --> 00:23:07,992
[SPEAKER_03]: The audit that was done last year for the district on November 8th in our school committee meeting to talk about some of the things that an independent audit sort of noticed about, you know, ways to consider family and community engagement.

207
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:19,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also providing professional development to staff at the Federation for Children with Special Needs on family and community engagement and have just done a really great course that they offer.

208
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to schools for free as well around train the trainer and you know different ways to engage marginalized communities and I'm happy to share.

209
00:23:30,618 --> 00:24:00,193
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these resources, but that maybe the goal and problem of practice is to come up with some solid ideas on how to reach families and caregivers and students who are experiencing mental health needs around ways to engage them or educate them and people who aren't, I guess, around ways to engage them and educate them.

210
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: around some of these specific school issues.

211
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, Stacey, I think it's really great that you said we're doing a number of things with students in our schools.

212
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, wow, I'd love to know what those are, right?

213
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure as a school committee member, I can find out what those things are, but as a community member, I think there's lots of people who would like to know what those things are.

214
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how are we actually thinking about that and sort of having that feedback and information I think could be interesting.

215
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:29,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Heather, did you wanna add anything?

216
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:34,223
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm sorry.

217
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:36,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking to Henry.

218
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,625
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to mention one thing.

219
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved what you were saying about the person first piece.

220
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:59,193
[SPEAKER_06]: As I've been to a number of conferences where I've come across people who prefer to be called autistic as if this is a part of me and that's how I identify.

221
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:00,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on a second, babe.

222
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:06,116
[SPEAKER_06]: some people who don't wish to be owned by a diagnosis.

223
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:20,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that also speaks to what Stacey was saying when it comes to people with generalized anxiety disorder or depression or any sort of things like this.

224
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:27,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's just, this is a condition that I have and I treat it with the appropriate care and

225
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,630
[SPEAKER_06]: consciousness.

226
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:30,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, about it.

227
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:35,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So those were my sort of thoughts about what was being being said.

228
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:35,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

229
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:36,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that.

230
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Henry.

231
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,217
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting so big.

232
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Henry.

233
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to see you, buddy.

234
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,781
[SPEAKER_06]: He said nice to see you.

235
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:50,903
[SPEAKER_03]: He's talking great.

236
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:51,803
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing a lot.

237
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:52,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

238
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't anxious to see you, Heather.

239
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll

240
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,695
[SPEAKER_03]: After Tuesday, hopefully we can get together.

241
00:25:58,715 --> 00:25:59,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been too long.

242
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:00,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be lovely.

243
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:02,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to disappear for a couple of minutes.

244
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:03,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

245
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:05,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be right back.

246
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:07,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Stacey, do you have some thoughts?

247
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:14,060
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's about really creating something that is tangible for use in the community.

248
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, we

249
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:33,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, last year was a little bit, you know, also difficult, but we sort of talked about professional development and, you know, having trauma-informed schools, but I feel like we didn't necessarily, we had a specific recommendation around funding some professional development for trauma-informed schools.

250
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:37,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like, you know, sort of what was the uptake on that?

251
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the uptake on that?

252
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:45,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would continue to support that recommendation wholeheartedly to carve that out.

253
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:53,358
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I recommended it initially is because it matches well with what the state had originally recommended and didn't fund, right?

254
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:58,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't appropriate that law, but it still sits there and we do follow it.

255
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:07,843
[SPEAKER_00]: The worry though is without like a specific earmark there that it could potentially, you know,

256
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:15,387
[SPEAKER_00]: against better efforts fall sort of to the wayside if it's not like every X amount of years we're doing a specific effort.

257
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:20,629
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, we do have a significant amount of programming coming in.

258
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've partnered with Sandy Hook Promise.

259
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:35,016
[SPEAKER_00]: which I talked about a couple of years ago, which we started doing in 2019, that has been a halted effort due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

260
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:39,378
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ramping up again with them to complete that formal process.

261
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:46,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes talking about mental health awareness, see something, say something, how to connect with others.

262
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,403
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the start with hello program, which we've successfully done in our middle and high schools this year.

263
00:27:53,678 --> 00:28:01,741
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to evolve that process to include our elementary schools as Sandy Hook promising increases the curriculum for that level.

264
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we- Is that happening again this year?

265
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:06,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

266
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you let us know when that's happening?

267
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:09,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

268
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:17,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So the start with hello starts at the beginning of the year because obviously that's what we want people to do and connect with each other.

269
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:21,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll continue on with the see something, say something.

270
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:25,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And who's actually doing this start with hello in the schools?

271
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how does that actually, what does that look like?

272
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:28,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

273
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:32,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like small programming throughout the school.

274
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:36,131
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a presentation, but they also do like small snippets throughout the week.

275
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:37,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a start with hello week.

276
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:41,517
[SPEAKER_00]: At the middle schools?

277
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:42,755
[SPEAKER_00]: In the high school.

278
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:43,675
[SPEAKER_00]: In the high school.

279
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:44,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

280
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:55,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So every day, like a specific theme to it, including like a gratitude tree for the completion at the high school that put things up.

281
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,246
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about connecting the community.

282
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

283
00:28:59,208 --> 00:28:59,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is great.

284
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,329
[SPEAKER_00]: The community, the school community, I mean.

285
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any way that we sort of publicize that and show any of that work?

286
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:11,077
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put it in newsletters, home to families, principals put out information.

287
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:28,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, or we could continue to do, you know, better work on on sending information home to families we're working right now on changing our department of school counseling site, which right now the only one that we have with fairly robust information is the high school guidance.

288
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:33,694
[SPEAKER_00]: that to be the Department of School Counseling, which is the new name for everything.

289
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:35,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.

290
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:44,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's one of the, you know, goals that we consider is how are we actually, you know, doing the, you know, the outreach around the Department of School Counseling, right?

291
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of how are we letting families know?

292
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:58,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what I'm thinking, Stacey, too, is like, I would love to see some examples of the newsletters just to sort of get an idea, because I'm thinking, are they going home and

293
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:06,313
[SPEAKER_03]: backpacks or are they going to home with students that like our school adjustment Councilors have specifically worked with?

294
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going home to the entire population?

295
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just curious how, what does that look like?

296
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:16,575
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that principals send home like their Friday communication to families or weekly communication to families.

297
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,296
[SPEAKER_00]: We are heading to everyone.

298
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:23,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're hopefully is that the start with hello programming is inclusive for all students.

299
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:31,400
[SPEAKER_00]: We are heading towards, you know, one of the goals for this year is to do at least a quarterly counseling newsletter for teens.

300
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

301
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I think part of the problem is that, you know, so I had a son that just graduated last year from the high school.

302
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think as a parent, like I never saw those.

303
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

304
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's part of like part and parcel of a high schooler, right.

305
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone that has a high school or knows that like suddenly.

306
00:30:54,377 --> 00:31:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even in middle school, you start to see this paperwork just you know drop off and suddenly there's not and you're like where are all those notices that used to come home in elementary school and it's like oh they're still coming, but you know, no one ever sees them.

307
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:10,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So thinking about how we could be reaching.

308
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:16,270
[SPEAKER_03]: families across platforms, I think is really interesting.

309
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, I'm thinking about the studio show that we did, Medford Ed Talk last year, right?

310
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:27,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a couple of shows specific to mental health.

311
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:38,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And like one of the ones that I thought was really powerful was one of the last ones where the students were really talking about how they felt during the pandemic and how, and it was so sobering.

312
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:55,862
[SPEAKER_03]: for the community for the students to be able to really be able to talk be talking about this I was like wow, but I think just, you know, there are a number of ways and I know, Dr Edwin Vincent, you know, did video commercials for a while but I'm just thinking about a number of ways from the website to the, to the.

313
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:00,864
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to the TV station, to, you know, CCSR, just a number of different ways.

314
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:05,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are we reaching families around, you know, increasing mental health supports and services?

315
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:11,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we all know, there's an increased need for mental health supports and services with the pandemic for sure, right?

316
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The data is showing that there's so much more need for that.

317
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:22,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in terms of like a school committee person and budget, we're looking at even me talking to some community members.

318
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:24,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when I was in,

319
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,042
[SPEAKER_03]: school, you know, when I was younger, there was no, there was no such thing as a school adjustment Councilor.

320
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,442
[SPEAKER_03]: There was guidance Councilors, right.

321
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:47,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And guidance Councilors sort of fell under the, under the, under the umbrella in my instance of both like dealing with, you know, mental health needs and, you know, any of those issues and vocational, which are like two really different things.

322
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:48,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

323
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:54,849
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder how much of my generation and even the general, you know, you know, sort of parents that are younger than me,

324
00:32:55,313 --> 00:33:06,661
[SPEAKER_03]: even know the differentiation between basics, like school adjustment Councilors and mental health outside consultant supports, if there are any, and or guidance Councilors and what their role is.

325
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:16,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just think it's interesting, because I don't know that, for example, we had somebody, a family that reached out to me last week about something, and they just didn't know where to go.

326
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,309
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't know where to go.

327
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like, do I go to the

328
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:21,085
[SPEAKER_03]: teacher?

329
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I go to the principal?

330
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I go to the guidance Councilor?

331
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, have you talked to the school adjustment Councilor?

332
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:27,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, what?

333
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:46,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just was so interesting that I feel like sometimes we skip over some of the basic language of really, again, and maybe it's getting back to the language, Joan, around some of the understanding the basic language of how this actually works when you have a need and what those

334
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,481
[SPEAKER_03]: and where you reach out and how you get support.

335
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:59,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's even helping to work together to create like a flow chart around like, when you have a need, you have this, you go here, whatever.

336
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And also maybe having some feedback from this subcommittee on the Department of School Counseling Outreach and

337
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:17,810
[SPEAKER_03]: quarterly newsletter and website revamp and what have you.

338
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,591
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of that idea?

339
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:26,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna lose the opportunity, make sort of a proposal for school committee.

340
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:29,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So school committee sort of policy and procedure, right?

341
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Is sort of like our goal end mark of a subcommittee.

342
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:40,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I'm welcome to feedback about anything and I'm happy to present and get that here, but I don't wanna lose our momentum

343
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:45,619
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a presentation to school committee for some sort of policy or procedure.

344
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I couldn't agree more.

345
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:51,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think what, yeah, no, I have I 100% agree.

346
00:34:51,525 --> 00:35:01,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what happens as as we dig into the meat of the matter around a subcommittee, we start to identify what some of the policy needs are and issues around this.

347
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:03,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's how the recommendation comes up.

348
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:22,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And perhaps the recommendation is for additional funding for outreach to families around these particular issues, because as we were working on the problem of practice, we realized that families didn't know the difference between a school adjustment Councilor or didn't know that there was a school, you know, counseling website or that there would be or are not receiving the newsletters or whatever.

349
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:26,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be sort of the basis of the policy ask.

350
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: is the research that we do around these particular things.

351
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:49,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's, again, you know, because one of the biggest concerns I heard last year from the parents that were participating, particularly around behavioral health in this arena, was the disconnect that they felt from the school community, because when your child goes into sort of a triage around some of these things,

352
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:51,617
[SPEAKER_03]: you're in a whole different mode.

353
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:52,698
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know where to find things.

354
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,679
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not necessarily feeling particularly connected.

355
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is we don't know, like we said, disability is natural.

356
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,462
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us knows when our child is gonna be in that particular state or a need of need.

357
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:08,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's better for the entire community to sort of really understand and be educated.

358
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, anyone else have any thoughts?

359
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:18,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the major gaps we're seeing in behavioral health is the,

360
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:27,675
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, availability of our community providers, like that's the biggest challenge we're seeing right now is who has availability.

361
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:40,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is like a state website you can go on to that says who has, you know, how long the wait is or if there's any opening for specific services, but those are only large agencies.

362
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:54,109
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if we have a network of providers, one of the things certainly that we could use assistance for is that outreach and connecting with other providers to say, do you have openings?

363
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you, you know, who are you taking right now?

364
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need insurance?

365
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to see someone on a sliding scale?

366
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,531
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your wait list for that?

367
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:10,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out how do we sort of mimic that state system for wait times

368
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:16,576
[SPEAKER_00]: for our local providers, because that is certainly like a huge gap that we are seeing.

369
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:22,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we sent we have a large community resource book, we send parents to psychology today all the time.

370
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:30,083
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really have a pulse on all our community mental health providers, specifically.

371
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:38,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have openings, or if they're willing, you know, you know, when are they willing to see students and families?

372
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:45,478
[SPEAKER_00]: only the few that I personally connect with and know of, but it would be helpful to increase that net.

373
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's interesting.

374
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'm thinking just to the, I guess flipping that over to the same question that you asked a little while ago, how is that, how does that inform the school committee policy ask?

375
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Psychology Today has a terrific website for looking up providers in your area.

376
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:10,087
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty great.

377
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:19,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't necessarily speak to who has availability, how long the wait time is, but you're able to find providers there.

378
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:34,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's our go-to, that's like the first place that we refer people because it does have some information, but there is sort of that lack of additional sort of availability.

379
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:39,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people say, yes, I'm taking new patients and then you email them and they're overwhelmed too.

380
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like no response for six months.

381
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:49,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so maybe it is again, back to the family and community engagement piece around

382
00:38:49,833 --> 00:39:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: behavioral health, maybe it's working with, you know, stakeholders to determine what resources have been available to them, potentially, you know, sorting resources and creating sort of some recommendations around what to do with this information, whether it's, you know, additional funding to build a comparable sort of, you know,

383
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:27,045
[SPEAKER_03]: a page or something to a website that's like a searchable database or something along those lines.

384
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:36,650
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it could be a combination of the two around engaging families and identifying behavioral health providers and resources.

385
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's the sort of goal.

386
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:42,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we identify those and we figure out what those are,

387
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:45,317
[SPEAKER_03]: the policy ask could potentially be.

388
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:49,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is part of the thing is that this is part of this subcommittee's mission is that it's a process.

389
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,682
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what the policy ask is gonna be.

390
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,143
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole point, right?

391
00:39:53,503 --> 00:39:58,446
[SPEAKER_03]: If we knew what the policy ask was gonna be, we wouldn't even have to have these meetings and then we could just go right to the policy ask, right?

392
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is that we are sort of really having these conversations around these issues and bringing things to the table to sort of consider what they are and how they're helpful to have a policy ask.

393
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:21,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie, I just wanted to mention that, you know, some support groups might be a nice resource for people.

394
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:31,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I lead one through the MFN for parents and caregivers of children with autism.

395
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:37,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, certainly if you come across families that are in need of support,

396
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:44,710
[SPEAKER_06]: and fall under that sort of very niche criteria, please send them my way.

397
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:55,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to meet with them one-on-one or, you know, get them onboarded onto our Facebook group, which is private, and have them join our meetings as well.

398
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Heather.

399
00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been really wonderful.

400
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:00,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we know, there's intersectionality between

401
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, specific disability and mental health needs, right?

402
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:09,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because a child has a disability doesn't mean they're all encompassing of that one disability and they don't have any other needs, right?

403
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,870
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be a lot of intersectionality.

404
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, I appreciate that.

405
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really important.

406
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm liking this idea around a resource guide for behavioral health supports.

407
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:27,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I think that could also inform some of the newsletter and or the counseling website.

408
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:29,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you thinking, Stacey?

409
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:42,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean we, you know, we're, we often use interns or other people to help us create those guides or updates but you know they're doing a lot of direct care work this year so we don't have that sort of support.

410
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:47,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly if we have like more people to if people are like looking to assist right for a need.

411
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:49,997
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a definite need that we have right now.

412
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I think that's an interesting idea.

413
00:41:52,779 --> 00:42:05,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, I would encourage, you know, your staff, interns, whoever to participate in the meetings as well, because I think it's important for us to have some, some conversation around what this actually can look like.

414
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:14,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So not that they, you know, are going to be tasked with sort of more work, but more around this, we're only meeting for an hour anyway.

415
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:18,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But sort of what is the in between time, what can we actually be working on that's helpful?

416
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:33,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you're the director and you've got all these other things going on, but some of the, you know, some of the direct staff, you know, could be really helpful in sort of saying, this is actually what we've seen that we really need a lot with, you know, of work with, can somebody sort of give some thought to this or whatever.

417
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that could be interesting.

418
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:41,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps, you know, the, you know, problem of practices around, you know,

419
00:42:45,013 --> 00:43:04,787
[SPEAKER_03]: identifying resources for behavioral health supports for students and caregivers in our community, working together to propose policy around

420
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:07,536
[SPEAKER_03]: resources or something.

421
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just putting this in the chat as sort of an idea.

422
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:18,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll craft something, you know, a little bit better to bring to school committee.

423
00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably either will report out on November 8 and November 15 on this meeting.

424
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:29,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because we don't have a

425
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:39,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even if we did have Paul and Mia here, we would still bring forward to the school committee to vote on as a whole.

426
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:47,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't necessarily need to vote on what we're, what we decided our problem with practices, but just, you know, to report out to them on what we're working on.

427
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to look at that, Stacy?

428
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:50,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you wanted to add?

429
00:43:55,895 --> 00:43:56,535
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it looks good.

430
00:43:59,116 --> 00:43:59,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

431
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:01,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

432
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:08,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Joan, maybe I'm just getting a Word doc.

433
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:13,408
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Google, yeah, Word doc, I guess you're gonna just put this in here so I don't lose it from the chat.

434
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear with me one second.

435
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:27,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

436
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else made a recommendation yesterday.

437
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:30,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget who it was.

438
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:37,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was somebody from admin made a recommendation yesterday saying like maybe we need to have instead of like a one year

439
00:44:40,674 --> 00:45:02,659
[SPEAKER_03]: subcommittee sort of goal that we're actually doing it on an 18 month basis so that we're taking because we're kind of carrying over some of the stuff, but that we're doing, you know, until November and I was wondering what you guys thought about that sort of carrying over so that we're not starting a new in October and finishing in

440
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:08,888
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, may and only had X amount of meetings, but we can talk about that more at the next meeting.

441
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just giving it some thought, like, do we actually think of this over a year and a half process just because, you know, it allows more time to sort of work together, but I guess we can just sort of see.

442
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:22,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Joan, what do you think?

443
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:22,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

444
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:24,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a terrific idea.

445
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:32,090
[SPEAKER_06]: because I walked into this meeting wondering what happened with the friendship program.

446
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:33,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we get anywhere?

447
00:45:33,472 --> 00:45:37,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we did a summary and we did a report, but we are working.

448
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:52,126
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we're proposing, Heather, is that we continue and expand those goals around identifying ways in which we build community and school friendships.

449
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:02,693
[SPEAKER_03]: among students with and without disabilities, or children without, yeah, students, I guess, with and without disabilities.

450
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:24,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Identifying ways in which to build community and school friendships among students with and without disabilities through recreational programming, after school,

451
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: activities and.

452
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:34,630
[SPEAKER_03]: You know sports.

453
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:42,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Organizations, I guess, as well as in school.

454
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:51,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Inclusive meaningful inclusion or something, so I'll share this with you guys in a second and.

455
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the chat.

456
00:46:59,712 --> 00:47:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write, as well as provide clarifying language for inclusive practice.

457
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:13,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how about developing supportive language?

458
00:47:14,856 --> 00:47:17,857
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as developing supportive language.

459
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:21,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendations.

460
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:27,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendations for inclusive, for best practices.

461
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendations for best practices.

462
00:47:29,988 --> 00:47:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: For best practice.

463
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:33,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

464
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:37,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

465
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:44,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, just so you know, Heather, these are sort of like,

466
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: these are sort of like a evolution of conversations that we've been working on for some time or actions that we've been working on for some time, right, Joan?

467
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:12,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this goes back to multiple CPAC meeting conversations and sort of multiple just like making sure CPAC meetings are included in the city calendar, right?

468
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:14,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Making sure that like,

469
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not, you know, having to constantly remind people to consider, you know, people with disabilities, you know, in either conversations or what have you, that we orient people to the concept of ableism, right?

470
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:32,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of what that actually means.

471
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:38,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, I'm really pleased to see that, you know, the mayor, we've been doing some work with the mayor around this,

472
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:52,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, and recently she was really happy and proud to share and happy to have her come to one of these subcommittee meetings or ask her to come to one of these subcommittee meetings.

473
00:48:52,410 --> 00:49:06,359
[SPEAKER_03]: She was really happy to share some inclusive artwork that they've created at the hockey rinks, at the Medford Hockey Rink, where she actually, on her, she initiated the, it was pictures of children, and she was like,

474
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,022
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to include children with disabilities in these pictures.

475
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:18,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's this great image of a child, I think, with a walker, you know, who's using that to be able to participate in hockey.

476
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:23,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And she talked about how it had been such a great conversation for her family when, you know, the artwork was created.

477
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, symbolism really matters.

478
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think also I'd like to see some cross communication with some of the city organizations like the Medford Disability Commission.

479
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we have talked about.

480
00:49:39,418 --> 00:49:46,985
[SPEAKER_03]: know that they had offered, you know, they've offered some of their resources to the superintendent around identifying some ways to be inclusive in our schools.

481
00:49:47,545 --> 00:50:00,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also just think about, you know, how we can, I think it could be really good that maybe we make a policy recommendation that we have a, you know, liaison from the schools that, you know, also participates with the Disability Commission, right.

482
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that as we're defining and understanding what

483
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:15,467
[SPEAKER_03]: it means to use this language and to be inclusive, that we're including our stakeholders, our very important stakeholders, people with disabilities themselves, around what this really looks like, right?

484
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:18,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And Melanie, I'm on that commission.

485
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

486
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a commissioner on there?

487
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I forgot that.

488
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:24,832
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a new commissioner, right?

489
00:50:24,852 --> 00:50:26,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

490
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:28,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So see, we already have crossover.

491
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:31,016
[SPEAKER_03]: See how far ahead of things we are, you guys?

492
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Heather, you're the best.

493
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:36,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you do all the things that you do, honestly.

494
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:44,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither do I. Well, I guess there's a whole movement, advocate like a mother.

495
00:50:45,062 --> 00:50:46,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do, right?

496
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

497
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:53,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you guys look at that chat or the sort of ideas in the chat?

498
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:55,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll create something a little bit more refined.

499
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:56,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Word document.

500
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:57,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll run this by you guys in it.

501
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:07,634
[SPEAKER_03]: In an email as well, but I think perhaps we have identified some goals for our school our behavioral health special education subcommittee for this year.

502
00:51:07,654 --> 00:51:13,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next meeting in my right to folks feel comfortable that we've identified.

503
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:28,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we do we want to reach out I mean the next meeting just make sure that everyone, you know, if we have more people have more voices just to say this is, you know, this is what we worked on yeah worked on and get more.

504
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:29,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

505
00:51:30,293 --> 00:51:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, absolutely john I think that's a great idea what I'll report out to school committee is that.

506
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:40,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We came up with some ideas, but we want to run them by, you know, the community in our next meeting.

507
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we're also sharing them, you know, at school committees so that if people have feedback, here's how they can reach us and so on and so forth.

508
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:47,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great idea.

509
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

510
00:51:53,802 --> 00:51:57,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to share that our next meeting.

511
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:07,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at the email that we just looked at that I just had so this will be in all of our future agenda feature agendas, I just said future.

512
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:14,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with my Boston accent, um, and all of our future agendas, we will have.

513
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: A list of the meetings, um, so that folks are aware ahead of time.

514
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:31,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And we apologize for the, I mean, we're obviously met the requirements of hosting our open meeting and all those things, but it's nice to have outreach, you know, a week before or more to let folks know.

515
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:37,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, you know, Heather, if you want to share these dates with, um, your, you know, your fellow commissioners, but also.

516
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:43,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know it's an open invitation, obviously, but also let your autism support group know.

517
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:46,971
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll certainly be letting CPAC and other stakeholders know, Stacey.

518
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:53,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Likewise, if with your staff, you can let them know these dates, which I've emailed to you.

519
00:52:54,114 --> 00:52:56,575
[SPEAKER_03]: November 18th is our next meeting.

520
00:52:57,195 --> 00:53:04,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It is special education specific, but we'll start the first probably 10 minutes with these goals in mind.

521
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:16,066
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if we've had any mailers or anything else specific to behavioral health in that goal, we can tweak that as well a bit in the November 18th meeting.
