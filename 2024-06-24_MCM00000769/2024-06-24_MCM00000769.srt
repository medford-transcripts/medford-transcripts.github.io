00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Medford Charter Study Committee for June 20th, 2024.

2
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: We are expecting a few more people, but we do have a quorum so we can get started.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So first order of business is the minutes from last week.

4
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone have a chance to look at them?

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a motion we accept the minutes.

6
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:22,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all in favor?

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:23,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

9
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:25,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

10
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,632
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so

11
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:39,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what we have left to do is to go through some issues in Article 9.

12
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:42,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just going to review the plan.

13
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:43,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I've already said it.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:51,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once we go through those, we will be giving all our materials to the Collins Center, and we will not meet in July.

15
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:58,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll reconvene in August, by which time, hopefully, people will have been able to review the draft that we got from the Collins Center.

16
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:02,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they may have questions for us.

17
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,658
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be, they'll be with us for those meetings.

18
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll finalize that and go ahead.

19
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:12,026
[SPEAKER_07]: But the final report committee will be meeting.

20
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll talk about that a little bit at the end.

21
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:36,440
[SPEAKER_02]: do we know when in august it will be i'm planning on being out of the country for a while so okay well but i'd like to is it the beginning of the month the end of the month or the first thursday and not that's when we usually meet the first thursday first thursday in august okay i'll try to get on but i'm ready

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you would like to be great.

23
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:45,649
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll check in with that I sent out a doodle poll and I'll send it to you too.

24
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:53,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the first so we have, I think, maybe the easiest thing to do is to just share the document.

25
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:53,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first item in Article 9 that we're going to look at is the possible addition of a section on public comment.

27
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:11,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eunice added something from the Fall River Charter, which actually is one of the charters that the Collins Center provided, because when I asked them about this.

28
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So I put the feedback from the Collins Center in brown and

29
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:32,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I left that part in blue, Eunice, is because the Collins Center sent us such examples from other charters, and they did send us Fall River, but they didn't, that part wasn't in what they sent us, so.

30
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:36,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

31
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So, whoops, sorry.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it bigger, too, please.

33
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will.

34
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So, have people had a chance to look at these and,

35
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,064
[SPEAKER_07]: and think about.

36
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:59,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the Collins Center said it's not common, but there are charters that do add something about this.

37
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is specifically about public comment from multi-member boards.

38
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:14,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Collins Center encourages us to allow multi-member boards to have flexibility around how and when they receive feedback from the public.

39
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,506
[SPEAKER_07]: So the examples are Fall River,

40
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people look at these?

41
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we had Amherst and Dedham.

42
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people have a chance to look at them?

43
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:26,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

44
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Fall River does say City Council and School District.

45
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:32,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

46
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:37,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like I said, that wasn't what the call-in center provided, but that was something that Eunice had.

47
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that in the Fall River chart?

48
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,487
[SPEAKER_07]: You broke up a little.

49
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anybody understand Eunice?

50
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

51
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You're breaking up, Eunice.

53
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:04,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Copy and pasted.

54
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,733
[SPEAKER_01]: We just heard crap.

55
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can hear you, Jenna.

56
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:10,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

57
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:11,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

58
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:12,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can.

59
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:14,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

60
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:16,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me now?

61
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:17,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

62
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that came right from the fall river charter copied and pasted and.

63
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:35,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm particularly partial to this one because it addresses the city council and the school committee and the multi-member bodies.

64
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:53,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other reason I'm particularly partial to it is because it says public comment shall not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting, provided that the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the particular body, basically.

65
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the city council does,

66
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:12,167
[SPEAKER_01]: you can speak on an agenda item, and then they have public participation at the end, where you can get up and speak about whatever's on your mind, as long as it's within their jurisdiction.

67
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:26,796
[SPEAKER_01]: For other reasons, the other bodies, well, the school committee at least, the multi-member bodies, I think, obviously, I think you have to talk about what the focus of that body is.

68
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:45,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've had discussion about this, you know, at length, but the fact that this is in a city charter, that's a common center worked with, you know, it speaks to me that this is something that, you know, is.

69
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,218
[SPEAKER_01]: is quite doable for our charter.

70
00:05:50,878 --> 00:06:15,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I've said time and time again, talking about valuing public participation and valuing the public without having to go through writing up a presentation and getting it approved and a whole bunch of hoops to just speak on a topic that's important to you in front of the body that has

71
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: authority to deal with it.

72
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:30,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a section in the Fall River Charter under section 9 that we've been currently talking about.

73
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I am on this.

74
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:33,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

75
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,259
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

76
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:34,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

77
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury?

78
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you muted?

79
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:42,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, now you're on.

80
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:43,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore.

81
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree with anything.

82
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,605
[SPEAKER_00]: more strongly with having this included into our charter.

83
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:51,469
[SPEAKER_00]: The way

84
00:06:53,119 --> 00:07:08,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, without rules or regulations from both the city council, school committee, and then any other committees that they're coming in and that the people that are in control are just dictating how it should be.

85
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,292
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to establish the roles of how these meetings should be.

86
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,374
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move the forward.

87
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:20,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward to even just accept the Far River

88
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:24,258
[SPEAKER_00]: document into our chatter, and I'm going to move that forward.

89
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

90
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to hear from Paulette first, and then we also have some other people that want to comment.

91
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette?

92
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:39,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is definitely a problematic one for me because I certainly understand where Eunice is coming from.

93
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:45,086
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine because you're a member of the school committee or a former member of the school committee and all that.

94
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:48,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Maury, it's really rude to interrupt other people.

95
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:50,168
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really not acceptable.

96
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:52,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to say what I was going to say.

97
00:07:53,148 --> 00:08:06,012
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is, if you've got a public meeting and let's say it's a school committee meeting, and how do you keep your meeting from being hijinked week after week?

98
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:13,594
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you make sure that people are prepared to answer comments

99
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:21,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just, there's a practicality that this is tough.

100
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:27,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I have sympathies towards understanding where Eunice is coming from.

101
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,643
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I'm thinking, oh, my God, how does this really work?

102
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:35,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there used to be what we referred to the game as gotcha.

103
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:39,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody would come down and all of a sudden throw something out.

104
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that was...

105
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:46,512
[SPEAKER_08]: very, you know, cause great, great upset.

106
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:50,877
[SPEAKER_08]: And people weren't prepared for it necessarily, because, you know, it could be anything.

107
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:56,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's sort of like, we want people to be able to speak, but at the same time,

108
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this demand an answer?

109
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this always make someone look stupid?

110
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:06,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

111
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:20,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to hear what other people say, but I am, there are some practical concerns from my time being in the position where, you know, people came up to speak, which, you know, I can understand why you don't want this.

112
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:27,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So either let me hear what other people say, and I'm trying to figure out the wording that makes it better.

113
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,278
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go to Ron and then David.

114
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:37,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when all the committee members have spoken, we'll turn to the member of the public, Ron and then David.

115
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

116
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:43,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Paulette, to your point, the thing I like about this is it doesn't set the rules.

117
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It tells them to set their own rules.

118
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like the city council now does a two-hour discussion, and after two hours, the per-person minutes go down.

119
00:09:53,904 --> 00:10:00,467
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be, this does not regulate as, you know, first of all, public comment is public comment.

120
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not demand a response.

121
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we take in public comment, good or bad, even what we do here.

122
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, if we want to respond, we can respond.

123
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:14,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's a trick question or something we have to get back to them on, I don't think that mandates an answer.

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And thirdly, you know, any group could set the public.

125
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:22,066
[SPEAKER_05]: public speaking to 30 seconds, if you want.

126
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not telling them what the rules are.

127
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just saying there needs to be rules and the public needs some access.

128
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And what those rules are will be dictated by each individual group.

129
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:34,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I like this one is because it doesn't regulate.

130
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got five minutes, three minutes.

131
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of says, hey, this is important.

132
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:46,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Public needs to be involved in these public meetings and set your own rules to make that sure that happens the best way you know how.

133
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:49,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay, thank you.

134
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I, I feel the same way as wrong.

135
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I completely understand that's discomfort.

136
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:57,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been.

137
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:01,666
[SPEAKER_03]: At those meetings where somebody attempts to derail the meeting.

138
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:09,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I feel like this is very reasonable and saying, basically, you have to provide some amount of time.

139
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can be a minute, it can be an hour, it can be a day.

140
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:18,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can set whatever time limits you want on the speakers.

141
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,890
[SPEAKER_03]: You can decide if they can speak multiple times during the public comment or not, right?

142
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a lot of flexibility that this leaves.

143
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's, yeah, I find this to be a fairly reasonable approach.

144
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:35,977
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing I might change is, like, I don't know that every multiple member body

145
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:42,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs to be able to set these times, but I also don't know that we need to go through and make exceptions.

146
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:49,547
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I don't know why our committee would have an agenda item for public comment.

147
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it would hurt anything.

148
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't find it super necessary.

149
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:55,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to be happening.

150
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But all in all, I'm comfortable with this.

151
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

152
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:03,912
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

153
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:05,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury and then Paulette.

154
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:14,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reiterate just what David said and what Ron said, so we don't have to be a dead horse here.

155
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:27,817
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important thing for the public comment, to have it in our charter so that the individual bodies can't change it, that the public always has a speaking thing.

156
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:44,441
[SPEAKER_00]: what a member of the city council may say or what a member of the school committee may say, but it's more important for the charter to be setting how it should be handled than the individual bodies.

157
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:50,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, well, frankly, it's going on today in our city, but that's not what we're here for.

158
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm in favor of exactly what David and Ron said.

159
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Paula.

160
00:12:56,798 --> 00:13:07,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want anybody to misunderstand that the school committee has, as part of its agenda, has and has always had a place for public comment.

161
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:21,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It has asked people if they're going to present to the superintendent's office on the Wednesday prior to the meeting, the topic they wish to speak on.

162
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:43,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this says that they can't do that, that the school committee could no longer require that, and that anybody could come and speak on anything at any time during the public comment period.

163
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what everybody's thinking?

164
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I ask someone to read it?

165
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't have the ability to read it.

166
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:55,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will read it.

167
00:13:56,358 --> 00:14:05,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council, the school committee, and all multiple member bodies shall develop and adopt rules or a policy addressing public comment.

168
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:15,049
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules or policy shall require that public comment periods appear on meeting agendas for all regular and special meetings.

169
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:28,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Public comment shall not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting, provided the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the city council school committee or any multiple member body respectively.

170
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:33,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Public comment at any special meeting shall be limited to items on the meeting agenda.

171
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:44,206
[SPEAKER_07]: There is another paragraph, but Eunice, when you were breaking up, I didn't get the answer whether this blue part actually is from the Fall River Charter.

172
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:48,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you in a minute.

173
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:48,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

174
00:14:48,709 --> 00:15:02,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Paulette, the thing I would add is I don't even personally read this as saying that the school committee couldn't require people to register a week in advance to speak during public comment period and say what they're going to talk about.

175
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:13,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says that it can be, you know, it, you could, I think the city, the school committee or the school city council could absolutely require that.

176
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

177
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:17,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't it doesn't say you have to allow.

178
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever shows up to speak, which maybe that was the intention, but that's not what it says.

179
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a matter of interpretation.

180
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:32,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you interpret it that way, then what the school committee does now is just fine.

181
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:36,942
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that Eunice is trying to say, says it's not.

182
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:49,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to find the balance between yes, we need to allow people to speak, but at the same time, keep the integrity of the meeting and not play the game of gotcha.

183
00:15:51,052 --> 00:16:04,639
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one thing just that I noticed in that segment that you read is that there's one sentence that would, I think if it was omitted, would make it palatable to everyone.

184
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:14,904
[SPEAKER_02]: The sentence where they could talk about anything rather than, you know, what's on, you know, the agenda.

185
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be supportive of that if that

186
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:19,917
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence just was taken up.

187
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:28,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't want someone coming into a meeting about bicycles and start talking about mushrooms.

188
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to create a circus, but we want people

189
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:41,161
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to speak on what's going on at a particular meeting.

190
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just read that sentence again.

191
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:54,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Public comment should not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting provided the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the body.

192
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be relevant to the body.

193
00:16:57,158 --> 00:17:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: to the body, but not to the topic of the meeting.

194
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:10,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the school committee is talking about, you know, recess, somebody can come in and start talking about, you know, we need more art in the school.

195
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:16,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a positive of it, actually.

196
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:20,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if you're an activist who feels that you're

197
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Your view is being ignored, but it's never being spoken about in committee.

198
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:29,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's exactly the goal of this is if you want to go to every city council meeting and say.

199
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need a new rule regarding mushrooms.

200
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:36,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's exactly what it's allowing and I think that that's a good thing.

201
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Council is free to keep ignoring you, but that's I think that's what it's setting up.

202
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, David.

203
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a bunch of committee members want to speak and I do want to make sure we hear from our member of the public as well.

204
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:50,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

205
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:56,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to quickly, to Paulette's point, I think it's not one or the other.

206
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:56,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's both.

207
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:09,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the process of where you have to be verified and vetted before you get to speak is different from what we're, in addition to a 20-minute window at the end of the meeting where public gets to speak.

208
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:18,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a, it's an opportunity for the public to speak on any other subject that is in the jurisdiction of that committee that you're in front of.

209
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:18,905
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is,

210
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:31,892
[SPEAKER_05]: This to me is you can have any rule you want set up the same way, but in a school committee environment, you would then add 30 minutes at the end of a meeting where people can get up and do a two-minute speech.

211
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:37,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Without any interaction necessarily, it just gives you the chance to give a public a speak.

212
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:40,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think you can have them both here.

213
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's what this language is referring to.

214
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

215
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:46,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

216
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:46,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis?

217
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,710
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern is the same sentence that Anthony had.

218
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the public should not be limited to items on the agenda for any Iranian provided the issue is concerned.

219
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:04,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, my fear is that that may, well, people are saying that would give people a voice.

220
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:10,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I think sometimes this just takes things on a road that you can't get back from at a meeting.

221
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:12,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a problem.

222
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:16,078
[SPEAKER_09]: because sometimes you do lose the focus of what it is.

223
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:20,820
[SPEAKER_09]: There can be tangents and there can be talk-offs and things like that.

224
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very bulky the way it's written anyhow.

225
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my humble opinion.

226
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:28,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

227
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:29,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Eunice.

228
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Melvin, to answer your question, the part in blue also came from Fall River as well.

229
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

230
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about

231
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:49,923
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, public comment shall not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting, provided it, you know, is, um, you know, within their jurisdiction.

232
00:19:50,023 --> 00:20:01,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like Paulette said, there is, you know, within school committee, um, you know, you can, you know, write up your presentation and submit it.

233
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore then you're on the agenda.

234
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:09,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or somebody else, I can't remember which one of us said, you know,

235
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:19,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can e-mail the week before or the day before or something and say that you want to talk about the math curriculum.

236
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you're on the agenda.

237
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:30,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But what this says is that it's not limited to either.

238
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:39,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Ron just said, if you want to put public comment at the beginning or the end or the middle, wherever,

239
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:46,535
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the body has dealt with their agenda of all the other things.

240
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You're breaking up again a little bit.

241
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:58,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you want to talk.

242
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of trouble down here.

243
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

244
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:06,167
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to talk about the math curriculum to the school committee, then you should be able to do that.

245
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:13,148
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to talk about trash pickup in front of the city council, and it wasn't on the agenda, you should be able to do that.

246
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,790
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as Ron said, then they can, you know,

247
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:27,710
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know, thank you and we will, you know, put it on next week's agenda and we can discuss it in depth.

248
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least now they're aware of the problem.

249
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:43,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's the piece about, you know, shall not be limited to the items on the agenda as long as it's within that body's jurisdiction is the piece that I feel the most strongly about.

250
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:55,495
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to remain, because if any other way that you do it, writing up a presentation or letting them know, you know, days ahead, that puts you on the agenda.

251
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the- It doesn't, Eunice, can I correct you?

252
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:08,245
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put, it doesn't necessarily, if you, you still come under public participation.

253
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:14,440
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but you clearly just want people to be able to speak on anything at any time.

254
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the jurisdiction of that particular body.

255
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:18,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

256
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

257
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:25,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, more did you have a quick comment and then we're going to go to Matthew.

258
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.

259
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:36,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of use Paulette's term of gotcha, but I'm going to spin that to the constituency.

260
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:41,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't care behind the rail how they feel if

261
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,466
[SPEAKER_00]: We got you.

262
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:44,767
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't have you.

263
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,748
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking legitimate questions.

264
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,689
[SPEAKER_00]: They have legitimate concerns.

265
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:57,015
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way is—and all that's going on is our present city council and school committee.

266
00:22:57,415 --> 00:23:03,979
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dictating the policy and the procedures of how anybody approaches this.

267
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,081
[SPEAKER_00]: this body, and it's all wrong.

268
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:13,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's so important for it to be involved in the charter that the charter sets the rules.

269
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:18,883
[SPEAKER_00]: The individual bodies or elected members to it don't set the rules.

270
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:28,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like being questioned, then don't run for the position.

271
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:41,517
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it's set up right now and the tendencies of city government here is that they're the dictator.

272
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:49,804
[SPEAKER_00]: The public comment has no emphasis at all on what their concerns are.

273
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:52,166
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either their way or the highway.

274
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:56,749
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to, you don't have to follow

275
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,013
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else's city's agenda, we can create our own here.

276
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:05,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're smarter and better than that.

277
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:19,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we should take is the good things from other cities and towns that we see and then indoctrinate it into a Medford concept so that other cities and towns don't have to look at Fall River or Melrose or anything.

278
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll look at Medford for a change.

279
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:24,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

280
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:25,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Maury.

281
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:26,430
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, Matthew.

282
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:31,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very good.

283
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, I want to, you know, thank the commission for the last meeting when I was on the subway, and I could not be heard and you all provided it had a very lamentable outcome.

284
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But that that's a different thing.

285
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:55,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But I, I really, really respect what Paulette said, I think, perhaps more than everybody here, Paulette has years of experience of what can happen.

286
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And

287
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely, with Maury saying that our elected officials are acting as dictators, I think that's extremely problematic.

288
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that people should reflect on.

289
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:18,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Is being on a charter study committee really the right place for you if you believe that the elected officials are dictators, and if you see yourself having a particular position in which you want to counter them?

290
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as this text right here, I have an issue.

291
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:33,971
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I think that a lot of times we defer to organizations like the Collins Center and we see them as putting a lot of thought into this and a lot of insight when they guide other cities.

292
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: However, a lot of the times I feel that there is a tendency to kind of want to do CYA or cover your butt.

293
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:48,120
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're writing a few statements in a way in which they want to say, don't err too much on either side.

294
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're writing these things to the effect of, I think they believe that these things will be read in good faith by reasonable people.

295
00:25:57,304 --> 00:26:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that many of our experiences shows that that's not necessarily the case, that a lot of times people are very angry.

296
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:10,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps they think the city councilors are dictators, or perhaps they're residents that are opposed to what the city council is advocating for.

297
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They will try to cite rules very cynically.

298
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this particular case, there's a loophole that's being created.

299
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the second part of this clause.

300
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:30,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Public comment shall not be limited to items on the agenda for any regular meeting, provided the issues or concerns raised are within the jurisdiction of the city council, et cetera.

301
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So within the jurisdiction is creating a loophole, or it's creating an opportunity for people to, as people were saying earlier, gotcha, to say this particular thing that is being discussed

302
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:42,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outside of the jurisdiction.

303
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:47,879
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's not clear, there's many times where people say this City Council is talking about stuff that is outside of Medford.

304
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,120
[SPEAKER_04]: This ceasefire resolution, it's not within their jurisdiction.

305
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's clear, but I also believe that the City Council does take liberties to talk about things that are not necessarily within

306
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:07,446
[SPEAKER_04]: their jurisdiction, for instance, is if anybody is in attendance, public comment or city Councilors, they want to wish somebody a happy birthday.

307
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:10,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to honor somebody who passed away or had an 80th birthday.

308
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that really within the jurisdiction of the body?

309
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:24,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that by leaving in this within the jurisdiction, you're creating these kinds of opportunities that different individuals can capitalize and weaponize in order to say that the body is in violation in order to shut people down.

310
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really hope that that's considered.

311
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:28,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

312
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:40,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say my reading of this doesn't limit anything that the actual body talks about, but it limits, it's talking about public comment, but I see what you're saying that it could still be.

313
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,640
[SPEAKER_07]: lifted.

314
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that's very understood.

315
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the way when these loopholes are left in, you may say that, and I read it as only for public comment, but there will be cases that are provided in which anybody talking about anything, they'll say, look, look, look, it's without the jurisdiction.

316
00:27:57,748 --> 00:28:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is an argument that people have been making for years when they're opposed to anything that Councilors they don't like or advocating for.

317
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:05,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outside of your jurisdiction.

318
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with Medford.

319
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:07,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand.

320
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:08,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

321
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Paulette.

322
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:39,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so one of the clauses that I would be tempted to add would be, and one of the concerns that I have, shall be limited to items on the meeting agenda and be in accordance with understanding issues of confidentiality and legal negotiations.

323
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:47,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the thing, a parent is angry about something that's happened at school, right?

324
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:55,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're gonna come down and they're gonna start throwing, you know, discussing it in public.

325
00:28:56,652 --> 00:29:04,199
[SPEAKER_08]: And they may not be aware of all, I mean, you know, student information is private.

326
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:10,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of rules around that privacy.

327
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:19,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And now all of a sudden you've got someone in the public making a statement and naming names and in a public forum.

328
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,301
[SPEAKER_08]: That can be difficult in the same way.

329
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:28,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Employees have rights.

330
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Now someone comes down and complains about an employee in public.

331
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:41,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's the school committee members have to follow and know all of those things.

332
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:50,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can't just go out and say, there's times when we'd very much like to say much more than we're able to say.

333
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:58,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think some sort of clause like that, if you support this, I think some sort of clause like that should be added.

334
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, Ron.

335
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:12,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Paul, and I think a simple statement of all comments are within the privacy guidelines of the Massachusetts state general laws.

336
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that covers it.

337
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you, Paul, at 100%.

338
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to... I agree with that also.

339
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that should be added, that guides, that protects everybody.

340
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:26,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Personnel and privacy guidelines or confidentiality issues.

341
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:31,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, confidentiality, privacy issues for the Massachusetts General Laws.

342
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:39,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that somewhere in the Mass General Laws there is that clause, but I think it should be in this section as well, just as a reminder.

343
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to get back quickly to this point.

344
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:48,993
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not taking the power away from these committees to set these agendas, to set the rules.

345
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not saying it must be two minutes.

346
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:55,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We're saying you set the rules the way you want to set the rules.

347
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,999
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to address the rules, and you have to publish the rules.

348
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,819
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we're saying.

349
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not saying, well, this guy has to talk about this, and if it's a good topic, he gets to talk five minutes more.

350
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

351
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about each individual group setting the guidelines.

352
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I think this is a great compromise.

353
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:16,603
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly, I would add the general laws piece just to protect exactly what Paulette said.

354
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add something to that.

355
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:25,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but just to allow people to talk about anything

356
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:33,051
[SPEAKER_02]: is just asking to bring chaos to our committees.

357
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:38,218
[SPEAKER_02]: If it would be limited to what's on the agenda,

358
00:31:39,415 --> 00:32:00,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's valid and we should adopt it, but to just allow time for people who maybe want to run for office to stand up and just control a body to have access to the community.

359
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:31,563
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over and it's written in the charter so they have they have the right to do it and you know and it's free speech if people want to you know talk about some an employee or uh or something they experienced in the city there's there's no mass law that prohibits them from from talking uh you know there's they don't they're not bound by confidentiality if you can't talk you can't talk about personnel issues it's against the law

360
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:33,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can't?

361
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:34,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The public?

362
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they can.

363
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It cannot be part of a public meeting, period.

364
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:40,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannot.

365
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're saying they can talk about anything.

366
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, you didn't hear me, Anthony.

367
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to talk about the trash man in front of my house, I can do it.

368
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:47,668
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no law.

369
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:55,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony, I said the comments should be in line with the privacy and confidentiality laws of the Massachusetts general laws.

370
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:56,955
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.

371
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I also said that

372
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:08,797
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what democracy is, giving somebody a minute to say, gee, is there any way we can get the barrels done out of Hickey Park?

373
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:11,018
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why can't I walk up and say that?

374
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying take over the meeting.

375
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying, you know, we're assuming these are negative things.

376
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:22,048
[SPEAKER_05]: What if somebody wants to come out and say, you know, we're interested in helping out and doing something more?

377
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,029
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we get involved?

378
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way we can form a group to address this issue?

379
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:29,736
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think we're just talking, you know, public opinion can be positive.

380
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I can't believe that we want to block.

381
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: a 30 minute piece of an end of a meeting where anybody can say whatever they want with no response necessary.

382
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, hey, you want to say what you want?

383
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:43,527
[SPEAKER_05]: We hear you.

384
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:44,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

385
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:50,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But to say that you can talk about an employee in a situation, it's 100% against the law for a public meeting.

386
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,516
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think that, Melva, can I just say this?

387
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, go ahead.

388
00:33:56,157 --> 00:34:03,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that one of the key words, too, is that issues or concerns raised within the jurisdiction

389
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:10,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever the body was, the city council, the school committee, they would have to say that is not within our jurisdiction.

390
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:11,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot discuss that here.

391
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:20,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's on each of the different committees, but I think that's another safeguard also, in addition to the confidentiality rules that we have to follow.

392
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

393
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:24,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Daveed?

394
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:30,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I just wanted to briefly, like, Ron, I agree with what you're saying.

395
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:35,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the sentence you want to add is unnecessary, but also not harmful.

396
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:40,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that 1 of the things that makes me comfortable with this is that, like.

397
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:47,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me to leave a lot of power in the hands of the committee, the council, whatever.

398
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:50,496
[SPEAKER_03]: To set the rules to cut people off.

399
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:59,066
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, if there's somebody who they want to ban from speaking, I don't even see this as denying that, right?

400
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:11,955
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody's showing up every week and screaming bloody murder, right, like, I don't see any part of this that says, hey, we're going to say that David can't speak anymore because he just swears at city councilors for two minutes during his time.

401
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a thing that makes me really comfortable with this language.

402
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:18,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

403
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:20,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

404
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:28,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to just start to close that we've had a really good discussion, but I want to make sure that we get to everything else on the agenda.

405
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:32,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to get final quick comments on this.

406
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,869
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Maury did make a motion to vote on it.

407
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So Paulette.

408
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I didn't have lower my hand.

409
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:40,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Maury.

410
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:50,140
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm all good if Ron or the feed want to make an amendment to this.

411
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:56,066
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, we should move forward with it.

412
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

413
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Matthew, did you have another comment?

414
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:00,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have seconded it.

415
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:13,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I just want to make very clear that the both the open meeting law and Robert's rules of order give the presiding officer all of the rights completely to shut down anybody who's disturbing the discussion.

416
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:16,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

417
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:24,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Just before we take the vote, I do want to have that addition of the Massachusetts state laws in there as well.

418
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:24,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

419
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:32,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I will work that in, but I just want to just quickly make sure everybody look at the other two.

420
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:39,127
[SPEAKER_07]: This is definitely the Fall River one is the one that people want to vote on.

421
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Did everyone look at the other two examples?

422
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:45,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

423
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,218
[SPEAKER_07]: The other two examples don't mention city council and school committee.

424
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,750
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

425
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't hear any comments.

426
00:36:57,512 --> 00:36:58,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to stick with this.

427
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,534
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I want to say, well, I want to say a couple of things.

428
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I want to say is I think we, and I don't think this will be a big issue, but we just took us last week.

429
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:16,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I had talked to the call center about was to be careful about using specific language that could box us in.

430
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:23,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So city website, I think, but we talked about last week that they're going to change that language so that it's,

431
00:37:24,228 --> 00:37:33,914
[SPEAKER_07]: adaptable to whatever potential form of communication might be around in eight years, say, before the next charter review.

432
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to suggest when we submit it to the Collins Center that they just make that consistent.

433
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:50,445
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other thing I'm going to throw out, and I don't think it's a big deal because I think the Collins Center will flag it if it really is a conflict, but

434
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it is.

435
00:37:52,466 --> 00:38:03,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We did the initiative petition, which lets people put an item on the agenda, and it sort of limits their ability to put the same item on multiple times.

436
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:10,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think it's a conflict, but I'm also not going to worry about it because I think the Collins Center will tell us if it is.

437
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:16,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the motion as I see it on the table is

438
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:31,430
[SPEAKER_07]: to accept the Fall River language with the addition of a clause ensuring that all comments comply with Mass General Law privacy and confidentiality guidelines.

439
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:44,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, you know, the call-in center will be responsible for adding that and they'll tell us if it's, you know, they'll have a comment about it if they think it's not needed or if whatever.

440
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:46,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so that's the motion.

441
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:49,897
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a second, so we're going to vote.

442
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:52,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

443
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

444
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:55,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice.

445
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:56,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

446
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:57,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis.

447
00:38:58,779 --> 00:38:59,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

448
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury.

449
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

450
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,260
[SPEAKER_07]: David.

451
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:03,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

452
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:05,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette.

453
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:06,361
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

454
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:10,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Maury.

455
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

456
00:39:11,922 --> 00:39:12,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

457
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,063
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

458
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get everybody?

459
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

460
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:19,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Ron, I think.

461
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get you, Ron?

462
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:22,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Just you, Milva.

463
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:27,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just me.

464
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:33,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm going to abstain because I feel like I got to think about it more, so I'm abstaining.

465
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm copping out.

466
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:36,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, Milva.

467
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:37,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

468
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Melba.

469
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Melba, come on.

470
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:41,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

471
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:45,905
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice in the deep end of the water.

472
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:48,847
[SPEAKER_08]: It passes no matter what, so it's just fine.

473
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:49,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It does pass.

474
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:50,688
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

475
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:51,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

476
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:52,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

477
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:59,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the next item is an addition on conflict of interest.

478
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,021
[SPEAKER_07]: and a lot of other things.

479
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:11,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I spoke with the Collins Center, they pointed out that this particular section is usually limited to this very simple language.

480
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:20,647
[SPEAKER_07]: All city employees shall be considered municipal employees under Chapter 26, 268A of the general laws and shall comply with the state conflict of interest laws.

481
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:27,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So while that's standard, there are some communities that add another layer.

482
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:33,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason that most don't is because most of these things are covered in state law.

483
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:42,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And they recommend that if we do add another layer and extra provisions, that we should ensure that none of the provisions conflict with state law.

484
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, again, from Fall River, right?

485
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:49,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's pretty long.

486
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Did everyone look at it?

487
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, should we go part by part?

488
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The first part is the conflict of interest, David.

489
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:17,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, like I gave these a quick scan and they seem complicated and they seem likely if especially if state law changes to start, you know, to fall out of compliance with state law or to contradict it, like,

490
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:24,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're probably, I would be comfortable not including any of this and just kind of letting state law be the guide.

491
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that, like, this seems like a place where we should allow for the flexibility of state law and kind of not stick our noses.

492
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems more likely to me to cause pain than some positive outcome, unless there's something specific that is happening in the city that we want to prevent going forward that isn't covered by state law.

493
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

494
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:50,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else?

495
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:53,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree 100% with what David just said.

496
00:41:54,238 --> 00:42:05,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that this is a higher level of concern that I would want to make sure the Massachusetts General Law is what we are hearing.

497
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:11,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see what the exception would be to the Mass General Laws that we would want to put in here that would make sense.

498
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:24,770
[SPEAKER_07]: One might be the, I think the financial statement, like right now, it's not, I don't think everybody's required to submit a financial statement, I believe.

499
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking about the ethics part?

500
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's ethics, I guess.

501
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:33,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is a pretty long- Are you talking about campaign finance?

502
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:35,753
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

503
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:43,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I under some of this stuff and from fall river.

504
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:50,838
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the conflict of interest section that had.

505
00:42:53,248 --> 00:42:55,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I think three different sections.

506
00:42:56,651 --> 00:43:11,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from Framingham's charter, there was a section on prohibition against self-dealing, which was just a sentence or so long right there.

507
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:20,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Framingham also had an ethics reporting requirement, which is quite lengthy.

508
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:25,211
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, a couple of pages.

509
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two pages worth, I suppose.

510
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:31,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's where the financial interest statement comes in.

511
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:32,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

512
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:45,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that there would be probably some pushback on this, but it intrigues me that both Fall River and Framingham

513
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:55,599
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate these things into their charter, and that the Collins Center worked with both of these communities.

514
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:08,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just say that just because the Collins Center makes recommendations, but just because they work with the charter, it doesn't mean that they just help.

515
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:14,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and they might've said, well, we recommend this.

516
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:17,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the municipality said, well, we're doing this anyway.

517
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:28,275
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but yeah, I think, you know, I, I see where the conflict of interest stuff, you know, would be, could be superseded with a mass general law.

518
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:34,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the ethics part is something that I think I would really like to see in there.

519
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know,

520
00:44:37,195 --> 00:45:04,054
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it's clear that there's no, and it's not just campaign finance, it's indicating that nobody has any financial interest in any particular dealings, the department heads and so forth, the mayor, the Councilors, school committee, superintendent, et cetera, et cetera.

521
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:13,077
[SPEAKER_01]: to file an ethics reporting.

522
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,100
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're kind of talking about a couple of different things here.

523
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:19,404
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just want to go back to the conflict of interest part.

524
00:45:19,444 --> 00:45:19,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

525
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:23,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what we have to decide is how to deal.

526
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we just go one by one and start with the...

527
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:40,860
[SPEAKER_07]: The conflict of interest section, basically, just to be clear, that first section, the letter A section is standard language, and I think that would have just been put into the charter by the Collins Center.

528
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:54,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other part is in addition, but it's, I mean, you know, most of this is covered in state law.

529
00:45:55,308 --> 00:45:56,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if some of that

530
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:03,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when Fall River either wrote its charter or maybe had a review.

531
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:11,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if some of that is a result of the mess that was Fall River.

532
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:11,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

533
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,472
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a big mess there, definitely.

534
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:16,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if this was the answer to that.

535
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:18,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

536
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean it couldn't happen here or any community.

537
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:35,790
[SPEAKER_08]: So your elected officials are required to take an ethics review, and they have to pass the test.

538
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,331
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an hour or something.

539
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:48,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes through all of the conflict of interest and ethics and whatever, and everyone has to have it on file within a certain time period.

540
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same thing that we all did?

541
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:51,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

542
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

543
00:46:53,781 --> 00:47:01,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, I mean, everybody's required to do that so that they're aware of the potential conflicts.

544
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:02,803
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not talking about this.

545
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:12,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna be clear that you're not talking about whether someone can work for the DPW and be an elected official, right?

546
00:47:13,006 --> 00:47:14,546
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what you're talking about at all.

547
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think you're talking about a couple of different things.

548
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:21,748
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about the conflict of interest, it's what it states there.

549
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:39,382
[SPEAKER_01]: than if we're getting to what Framingham is talking about, which is the prohibition against self-dealing, which I guess is similar to the conflict of interest.

550
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:53,292
[SPEAKER_01]: No candidate for public office, elected public official, division head, or department director, so that would be like the head of the DPW, shall have a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any contract

551
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,460
[SPEAKER_01]: made by the municipality.

552
00:47:56,941 --> 00:48:02,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that and the conflict of interest seem to kind of go hand in hand.

553
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:03,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

554
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:21,155
[SPEAKER_01]: The ethics reporting requirement, um, uh, every candidate, and this is candidates, um, you know, so if you're just planning on running for office and filing to be a candidate, so it's candidates or once you're seated, um,

555
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,703
[SPEAKER_01]: shall file a statement of financial interest for the preceding calendar year with the city clerk.

556
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:29,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes on and on and on.

557
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:31,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're talking about a couple of different things.

558
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:34,707
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, let's start with the conflict of interest section.

559
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, did you have a comment about that?

560
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:54,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think to Paulette's point, I mean, it's not about somebody pulling two salaries, but I think it has to do with, you know, this level of ethics and conflict of interest is really, you know, adjudicated at the state level in the Secretary of State's office, I believe.

561
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:58,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another reason why I think we should not be fooling around with it.

562
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more appropriate that, you know, the reporting gets done locally, I'm sure, but, you know, the jurisdiction for these resolutions, I don't believe is at the city hall.

563
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:13,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's at the state house.

564
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:20,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's something to consider, too, when we're starting to craft a whole, unless we're adding something

565
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see what we would add without knowing the full detail of the Mass General Laws.

566
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, to me, it's conflict of interest means the DPW, the housing, the building department board, one of the people wants to build in addition to his house, and obviously he has to recuse himself.

567
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:42,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of obvious.

568
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:46,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that didn't happen, I'm sure they'd go, you know, report it to the state for resolution.

569
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

570
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:57,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I guess maybe I'm repeating myself, but, like.

571
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:02,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I read here, more or less, I agree with and support.

572
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:09,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also don't think that it has that our charter is necessarily the right place to put it.

573
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:12,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that we have the.

574
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:17,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the state should rule these things.

575
00:50:17,696 --> 00:50:22,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just can't imagine this going particularly well.

576
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:33,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I'll say is I worry a little bit, especially since we talked months ago about how hard it was to recruit people to run for, for example, school committee.

577
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:38,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm afraid to put anything more difficult there.

578
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:46,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a piece, like I said, I think all of these things are good.

579
00:50:46,736 --> 00:50:48,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I really am a fan of transparency.

580
00:50:49,558 --> 00:51:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a world where if I thought this was straightforward and it would go really well, where I would absolutely vote for it, I'm not convinced that given the complexities of state law and all that, that this is a reasonable thing for us to do.

581
00:51:04,091 --> 00:51:05,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

582
00:51:06,353 --> 00:51:07,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Matthew.

583
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm really, really glad that this is brought up because I do know of people at City Hall that do have conflicts of interest.

584
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:29,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like particularly with money, but they are people that will oversee, who decide who gets on commissions, who will not appoint people at commissions if they think that they'll be kind of advocates and in their hair and get in the way of

585
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,831
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what they envision.

586
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I applied for a commission last year, and the liaison told me over the telephone that I was not selected because that liaison wanted to get grants.

587
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:53,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not quite the same thing as money, but by appointing NATO commission, that would get in the way of their particular personal drive and stuff, which isn't something commission decided on.

588
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something liaison wanted.

589
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that this is kind of touching on that.

590
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:01,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And if David is saying this is not

591
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:12,744
[SPEAKER_04]: particular, this should be addressed somewhere else when liaisons take advantage of their power to engage in these things, then where does it get addressed?

592
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:20,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that, I guess that's beyond this kind of group to consider, but that kind of, there are department liaisons who will

593
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,842
[SPEAKER_04]: control kind of commissions, not this one, not most of them, but some of them in a way.

594
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:27,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So the commission is hampered.

595
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:35,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, it's just completely in absolute deference to the liaison who see themselves as directors, and chairs and presidents.

596
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe, maybe, maybe this group can do nothing about it.

597
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:42,755
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is something that we should do about and the question is, where can that be done?

598
00:52:42,775 --> 00:52:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, David.

599
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:53,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick response to that the way multi member boards and commissions work and we talked about this in section 3, I think.

600
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:55,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that they are up to.

601
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:57,289
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're right.

602
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:57,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was.

603
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,190
[SPEAKER_03]: The liaison is acting on behalf of the mayor.

604
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:04,271
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor has full appointment power.

605
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We're leaving the mayor with full appointment power.

606
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:12,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you disagree with those kinds of decisions, the person to take it up with is either the city council or the mayor.

607
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:17,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand how it operates, but that's not what's actually in the ordinance.

608
00:53:17,973 --> 00:53:21,854
[SPEAKER_04]: The ordinances do not say the selections will be made by the liaisons.

609
00:53:21,874 --> 00:53:26,515
[SPEAKER_04]: The liaisons are provided to provide staff support and to make sure the commission can do all of this work.

610
00:53:27,323 --> 00:53:28,623
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not in any of the ordinance.

611
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:33,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor is allowed to give their power to whoever they want, more or less.

612
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:34,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not in there.

613
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand all of those.

614
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor is allowed to make the appointments.

615
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:41,368
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the decision is rested in the liaison's hands.

616
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not rest.

617
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:51,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question is, when liaisons personally make decisions based on how they think would personally affect them and their prerogatives, then is there a place to address it?

618
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:54,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to understand how the appointments work.

619
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, is there any way to address those kinds of

620
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: things when liaisons are putting their personal interests above.

621
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: basically the commissions themselves.

622
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:04,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point of information, Melvin.

623
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:08,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're talking about a specific issue.

624
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:18,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand Matthew's frustration there, but I don't think this is the committee that's going to be able to resolve who gets chosen the multi-member boards.

625
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

626
00:54:22,418 --> 00:54:25,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see Matthew's point about this.

627
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,223
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think Matthew, I think you should have brought that back to the mayor's attention.

628
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:36,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you might be smirking, but at least you would have a record that you did that.

629
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:44,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's where when we give up that way, and we don't share our frustrations, we see how something hasn't worked.

630
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:47,883
[SPEAKER_09]: then it doesn't matter, any law we have will not be effective.

631
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:58,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're saying, if I'm hearing you correctly, that a liaison made a decision based on the liaison's personal gain for something from it.

632
00:54:59,186 --> 00:55:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have been all over that and been right back to the mayor, and I think that was your recourse.

633
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:05,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is something that belongs here.

634
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:13,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what you're saying, but some of us do not talk to the mayor because we know that there could be comments, this and that, and there could be mild retaliation.

635
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just something that a lot of people in particular are aware of.

636
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:31,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say as a member of this group, I have heard a lot about people talking about retaliation and this and that, and maybe I'm out of touch, but

637
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:40,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that that's, you know, I'm sorry for your experience, but I will say that there is, you have a way to address that.

638
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:44,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you chose not to, then, you know, I think you should do that.

639
00:55:44,795 --> 00:55:46,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Retaliation for what, how would that be?

640
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just going to stop right there, but I do think there was a recourse for what happened for you.

641
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:52,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

642
00:55:53,202 --> 00:55:56,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I want to hear from Maury and then we're going to

643
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just gonna say in response to that, fellas, I agree with you 100%.

644
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:18,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this isn't the forum that Matthew wants to air his grievances on, but we're here trying to establish a direction for our city in the next five, 10 years, 20 years, wherever we're going here.

645
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:20,757
[SPEAKER_00]: So any individual,

646
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:28,417
[SPEAKER_00]: independent grievance that you may have has no bearing on what we're trying to do here.

647
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:30,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it at that.

648
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

649
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:40,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I think that, you know, the charter, we've talked about this in the past, it tends to

650
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:50,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We want it to be meaningful, but we also want to be careful about too many specifics because the charter is set in stone and it's hard to change.

651
00:56:52,112 --> 00:57:03,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just going to make a motion that we adopt the language under A and not the rest of it under conflict of interest.

652
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:05,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I second that motion.

653
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

654
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,322
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to include the rest of it, you vote no, basically.

655
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

656
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:13,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury.

657
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I make a quick question before we do that?

658
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:17,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

659
00:57:18,532 --> 00:57:20,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would we include the section under A?

660
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like standard language across all charters?

661
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:23,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

662
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:23,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

663
00:57:23,695 --> 00:57:29,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It just says there's conflicts, you know, there's conflict of interest law and you have to follow it basically.

664
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,040
[SPEAKER_07]: You follow state law.

665
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

666
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:39,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So that covers then the first sentence basically covers everything under it?

667
00:57:40,593 --> 00:57:40,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

668
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:41,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

669
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:47,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would not include everything else, but we'll do it section by section.

670
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is under this.

671
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:51,235
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only including A. If you agree with that, you vote yes.

672
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:52,195
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

673
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:54,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So Maury.

674
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:55,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

675
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:56,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

676
00:57:58,097 --> 00:57:58,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

677
00:57:58,817 --> 00:57:59,277
[SPEAKER_07]: David.

678
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:02,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

679
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:03,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice.

680
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:04,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

681
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:06,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette.

682
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:07,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

683
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:09,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

684
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:10,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

685
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:12,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get Phyllis?

686
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:14,166
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but yes for me.

687
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:15,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

688
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm yes.

689
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:19,309
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that.

690
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:30,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we move on to we've got these other sections, prohibition against self-dealing, and then the ethics reporting requirement.

691
00:58:31,794 --> 00:58:36,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was, and there's another section.

692
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:37,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Property.

693
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:41,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I'm just looking at the conflict of interest stuff.

694
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:46,156
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also this section about public contracts.

695
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:50,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is pretty much, it's included in the conflict of interest section.

696
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:54,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So these would be extra layers.

697
00:58:57,622 --> 00:58:58,643
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a discussion.

698
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:01,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody want to make a motion on any of these?

699
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:10,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the ethics part, I think it's important to have something in there, you know, as part of our values, certainly.

700
00:59:10,128 --> 00:59:30,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe we can reword it to, you know, to answer, I think it was maybe Anthony, somebody's question, point of, you know, we have a hard time finding candidates for, you know, our different bodies.

701
00:59:33,732 --> 00:59:42,880
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe instead of every candidate, maybe everyone who is elected.

702
00:59:43,941 --> 01:00:00,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way people know that if somebody wants to run for, if this is in the charter and somebody wants to run for office and they may have,

703
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:18,113
[SPEAKER_01]: something questionable ethics wise they know they don't have to submit anything as a candidate but they know that once they if they were to be elected by the residents then

704
01:00:18,863 --> 01:00:24,166
[SPEAKER_01]: they will need to file this statement.

705
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be- A financial interest.

706
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:28,068
[SPEAKER_01]: A financial interest.

707
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:37,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody is wanting to run for office and has something questionable, then they know that, well, I have to file this financial statement.

708
01:00:38,152 --> 01:00:39,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I better not run for office.

709
01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:41,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

710
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:44,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this also includes, I think, even more

711
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:51,791
[SPEAKER_07]: division heads, but anyway, so that, so that's that.

712
01:00:52,072 --> 01:01:04,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a very specific requirement that that language is requiring electeds to file, regularly file a financial statement, a statement of financial interest.

713
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't exactly know what that means.

714
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:09,643
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that mean?

715
01:01:10,977 --> 01:01:19,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether I have financial interest, so I'm on the school committee, or I've been elected to the school committee, that I have no interest in a textbook company?

716
01:01:19,504 --> 01:01:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that under conflict of interest?

717
01:01:24,508 --> 01:01:32,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Paulette, what you would be required to do is basically provide a list of companies you're invested in, probably a complete list.

718
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:40,106
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a statement of financial interest tends to be.

719
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:46,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only ever had to do that for one job, but basically I had to find every company I own a stock in.

720
01:01:48,474 --> 01:01:57,042
[SPEAKER_03]: If I went in with my brother and we bought a beach house together in Florida, I have a financial interest there, that has to be listed there.

721
01:01:57,643 --> 01:01:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask, who would they

722
01:02:03,738 --> 01:02:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: report it to?

723
01:02:04,658 --> 01:02:12,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a department that would, like, do you report it to the mayor, to the law firm, or to the city council?

724
01:02:13,222 --> 01:02:13,802
[SPEAKER_07]: City clerk.

725
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:15,523
[SPEAKER_07]: City clerk.

726
01:02:15,563 --> 01:02:18,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has no power to do anything about it?

727
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then they would be public record.

728
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:21,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

729
01:02:22,786 --> 01:02:31,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Then a citizen or journalist could look it up and check if you own a 30% stock in the company that collects the trash.

730
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:57,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're, you know, voting on a, you know, housing development in the city, you know, and you're voting favorably, um, you know, you're an investor in, you know, uh, you know, Brown's development, you know, Brown's housing development, um, and you're, you know, voting to allow a 500 unit, you know,

731
01:03:00,253 --> 01:03:03,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Building, but that's covered by conflict of interest.

732
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:07,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what you're saying is by doing this financial that.

733
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:13,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody might pick up might pick up that there's a conflict.

734
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:16,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, it has a lot to do with optics too.

735
01:03:17,279 --> 01:03:18,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a transparency requirement.

736
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

737
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:19,800
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it?

738
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:22,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, go ahead.

739
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:22,862
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

740
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:23,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

741
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:28,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I have I have 2 ideas that I think are worth maybe thinking about 1.

742
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:32,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, like, this type of thing is super important.

743
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:35,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to do it would be really valuable.

744
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:39,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think transparency wise, it's huge to do something like this.

745
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:43,199
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I think it's also a really big, complicated step.

746
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:47,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the 2 ideas I have are 1, a version of this that just says.

747
01:03:49,022 --> 01:03:51,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council will, you know.

748
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Decide some type of ethics reporting requirement for this list of groups.

749
01:03:57,343 --> 01:04:01,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And give them the flexibility to decide what those ethics reporting requirements look like.

750
01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:05,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something I'd be really comfortable with.

751
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:08,509
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I would be super comfortable with is like.

752
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:14,192
[SPEAKER_03]: A subcommittee just for this or a meeting just for this where we take some time and.

753
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Try and figure out what's reasonable here.

754
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is definitely.

755
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:38,852
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those things where, like, it means that to run for any of these offices or to be, you know, an employee at the top level of the city means really kind of showing people your underwear, which is a big thing to add.

756
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:51,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, in terms of, like, preventing ethical lapses and preventing grift, there isn't much that's better than this kind of transparency.

757
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:56,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's super important and could be a really, really good thing to do.

758
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:57,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

759
01:04:57,956 --> 01:05:06,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my two ideas, specific meeting or subcommittee or just giving the city council a lot of flexibility here.

760
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:16,781
[SPEAKER_07]: You did remind me of something that the Collins Center said that is that these issues are often covered in ordinances, so they could be covered in it.

761
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:18,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

762
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we're at a slight disadvantage here, not understanding the state general laws as well as we should in this regard.

763
01:05:28,865 --> 01:05:31,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm moved that we get the call and center opinion on this.

764
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:40,017
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it seems like all these violations, all these transparency issues get resolved in the Secretary of State's office.

765
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:49,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just seems to me that we're creating a whole new line that's only going to be once it goes to be washed by the legal people at the statehouse.

766
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be either matching what's already there or they'll fix it.

767
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:55,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does match.

768
01:05:55,476 --> 01:05:56,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we just.

769
01:05:57,318 --> 01:06:00,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of rewriting every word here, I mean, I get it.

770
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:00,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it.

771
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:08,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I find it hard to believe that I've lived in the city for 60 years and there's no ethics rule and there's no conflict of interest rule.

772
01:06:09,286 --> 01:06:09,727
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

773
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:10,547
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be.

774
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:12,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I would just like to know what that is.

775
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:28,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there definitely are, but I think, and that is what the Callen Center conveyed that most of this is covered in state law, but this financial statement, for instance, is another layer.

776
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:40,323
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not required in state law that every, you know, whatever elected or every department head or whatever fills out a financial state interest of,

777
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:43,777
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you know what I'm saying?

778
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:44,837
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.

779
01:06:46,058 --> 01:06:46,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Maury.

780
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:50,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna agree with David here.

781
01:06:51,460 --> 01:07:00,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should do a little bit of a subcommittee to take a look at this a little stronger and see how we want method to be.

782
01:07:00,144 --> 01:07:09,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear what Ron's saying and all that, but I would move to set up a subcommittee on this subject.

783
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Eunice.

784
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:26,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that I think that's the direction that I would be going with to a subcommittee to touch on this and maybe, you know, sorry to backtrack on the other 2 pieces, you know, maybe, maybe not.

785
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,221
[SPEAKER_01]: But.

786
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:32,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would like to hear what the call and center has to say about this.

787
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:34,831
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, they worked with framing him.

788
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:35,811
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

789
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:47,479
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, what transpired there and I didn't have a chance to, but I'd be happy to take a dive into framing him.

790
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:51,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they, as a matter of fact, I was going to bring it up later.

791
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,062
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a pretty neat section on their website about their charter.

792
01:07:57,462 --> 01:08:13,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't mind taking a deep dive over there and seeing if I could figure out, maybe I can, maybe I can't, how they arrived at putting this in there and why.

793
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:14,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

794
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:15,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

795
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:34,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to say, I'd like to just kind of agree with Ron and that we should really just follow the state law because, I mean, you know, and I'm not just saying this just for time.

796
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:37,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's necessary.

797
01:08:37,866 --> 01:08:46,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We've survived the past, you know, 100 years in Medford without having this incorporated in our charter.

798
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:59,539
[SPEAKER_02]: just to, you know, add verbiage that has to comply with state law is not necessary.

799
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:13,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're going to start going into subcommittees and trying to, you know, really fine tune something that we don't have the manpower in the city to even kind of

800
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:17,612
[SPEAKER_02]: take on something like this, because they're just going to refer it to the state.

801
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Ron 100% on this.

802
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to, I don't know if there's a motion on the floor, but I'd like to just make a motion that we adopt, you know, the, the state, the beginning and just leave it, leave it alone and, and move on because we're just adding stuff that has to comply with state law and

803
01:09:42,923 --> 01:09:44,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not just get rid of state law?

804
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:48,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a couple of motions or ideas on the table.

805
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:52,688
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one, form a subcommittee to take a deep dive into this.

806
01:09:53,388 --> 01:10:02,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, just not include any of this and just keep the section we have about state law.

807
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:07,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And three, include something that this would be decided by ordinance.

808
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:21,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess if we do make a subcommittee, are we specifically talking about a subcommittee on the ethics reporting requirement, which is essentially the financial statement?

809
01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:25,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the part that I was talking about.

810
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:29,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the rest of it is, I assume, very well covered by state law.

811
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

812
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:33,660
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ethics reporting requirement is something that would go above and beyond.

813
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it would.

814
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:35,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be huge.

815
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:38,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could be huge.

816
01:10:39,137 --> 01:10:43,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And Daveed, like the analogy that you used about, you know, your underwear.

817
01:10:44,682 --> 01:10:46,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is definitely intrusive.

818
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:48,905
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no question about it.

819
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:49,786
[SPEAKER_03]: No, super intrusive.

820
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean it's not a good idea, but it is.

821
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:56,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty big thing.

822
01:10:56,592 --> 01:10:58,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury.

823
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second the V's motion.

824
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:06,364
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I think we should go with this.

825
01:11:07,145 --> 01:11:08,225
[SPEAKER_07]: With forming a subcommittee?

826
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:08,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

827
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:24,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so just to be clear about, we're still going to go ahead with our plan, which is handing everything to the Collins Center, but we're just going to say that there's still some decisions to be made on ethics reporting requirement, and we'll add in whatever we decide later.

828
01:11:27,582 --> 01:11:44,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion on the floor is to form a subcommittee to research and ethics reporting requirement in the form of a financial statement.

829
01:11:44,608 --> 01:11:45,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just put it that way?

830
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:48,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that sounds great.

831
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

832
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:49,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

833
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the limit of the subcommittee?

834
01:11:52,728 --> 01:11:59,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's the limit of the subcommittee, you know, but the language here is actually not limited to elected officials.

835
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something I think, you know, that would, which I think, I think if we include it, it should not be limited to elected officials, right?

836
01:12:08,377 --> 01:12:15,321
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to do this kind of thing, I think it's maybe even more important to know what the superintendent is investing in then.

837
01:12:16,454 --> 01:12:17,875
[SPEAKER_03]: a city council or a school committee member.

838
01:12:17,995 --> 01:12:22,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying multi... Are you saying committee should have to supply that information too?

839
01:12:22,476 --> 01:12:22,737
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

840
01:12:22,937 --> 01:12:29,059
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be electeds and municipal officers, people who can make decisions about where money goes.

841
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

842
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:41,724
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be, you know, the only people that would... you'd have any legitimate basis for asking for this information.

843
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:44,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so...

844
01:12:46,632 --> 01:12:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so your superintendent who is comes negotiates the contract with the school committee for their position.

845
01:12:55,855 --> 01:13:00,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's a mandatory clause that says this.

846
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:03,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if we include it.

847
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:04,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

848
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, again, I think that some people would say, what the heck?

849
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:08,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should I work there?

850
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,666
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I think that's super reasonable.

851
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that's just worth discussion in a subcommittee, right?

852
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can see both sides of the argument so well that even I can't imagine answering this question right now, which is why I think a subcommittee is a good idea.

853
01:13:23,715 --> 01:13:24,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's fine.

854
01:13:24,155 --> 01:13:24,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

855
01:13:24,395 --> 01:13:26,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion is not to have this.

856
01:13:26,637 --> 01:13:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to have a subcommittee to look at it.

857
01:13:29,619 --> 01:13:31,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Eunice.

858
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:31,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

859
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:33,462
[SPEAKER_07]: David.

860
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:35,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

861
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury.

862
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

863
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:39,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

864
01:13:40,242 --> 01:13:40,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

865
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:42,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

866
01:13:43,104 --> 01:13:44,785
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

867
01:13:44,845 --> 01:13:45,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis.

868
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:46,306
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

869
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Who didn't I get?

870
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:53,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette.

871
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:54,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette, thank you.

872
01:13:55,092 --> 01:13:58,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was okay if there are people who want to be on the subcommittee.

873
01:13:59,595 --> 01:14:03,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were trying to finish tonight, so I didn't anticipate another subcommittee.

874
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:03,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

875
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:06,356
[SPEAKER_08]: in truth.

876
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay if we have it.

877
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think this is too important not to.

878
01:14:14,581 --> 01:14:15,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll vote yes.

879
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:17,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

880
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:22,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm voting no, which means it's a tie.

881
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:30,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tie and I think tie usually, what does a tie go to?

882
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:31,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I should know this.

883
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: A tie doesn't pass.

884
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:34,645
[SPEAKER_02]: to the runner?

885
01:14:35,686 --> 01:14:38,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's fine.

886
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:44,230
[SPEAKER_07]: But given that there is interest, and there are people there, I assume, are willing to serve on this subcommittee?

887
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

888
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:49,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we don't, you know, we're not, we're an ad hoc committee.

889
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:53,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not like required to follow Robert's rules.

890
01:14:53,794 --> 01:15:01,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm willing to, I'm willing to change my vote if this has nothing to do with the process that we're going to undergo to finalize this document.

891
01:15:02,225 --> 01:15:04,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to, I don't want the subcommittee to hold up.

892
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:10,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we're at to get this charter to the, to the city.

893
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:16,315
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what would happen on the subcommittee would meet and there would be a deadline of.

894
01:15:16,876 --> 01:15:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Our August meeting and the subcommittee would then.

895
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:26,247
[SPEAKER_07]: make a recommendation that we would vote on.

896
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:36,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we would have to limit the discussion because our plan for August is to go through the final charter.

897
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:39,772
[SPEAKER_07]: This subcommittee would be extremely focused.

898
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:41,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be just about this.

899
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have them aim for a very succinct,

900
01:15:51,222 --> 01:15:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Recommendation that just covered the absolutely relevant points that we could then vote on.

901
01:15:57,144 --> 01:15:58,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

902
01:15:59,465 --> 01:16:02,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think it can be done in a couple of meetings.

903
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:04,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Max 3, probably 2.

904
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:16,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, probably to if we have 1 meeting to talk about 1 meeting and if we all agree on everything, we all in the same direction.

905
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we might want to talk to some elected.

906
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:24,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We might want to talk to some experts in between a meeting and a 2nd meeting.

907
01:16:25,944 --> 01:16:30,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, for example, if we go to the school committee and every single person says, if I had to do this, I wouldn't run.

908
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:34,493
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a pretty convincing argument against it.

909
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: David, wake up and spell the coffee.

910
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:44,218
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, in quotation marks, expert on your local politics.

911
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that would be for the subcommittee to decide.

912
01:16:46,579 --> 01:16:56,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I just want this vote to say that it's not going to interrupt the schedule of the charter as we've established it up until this point.

913
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:59,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, that's what I'm saying.

914
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:06,912
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like maybe a 10 to 15 minute presentation slash vote at our August meeting.

915
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:08,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do that?

916
01:17:09,594 --> 01:17:09,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

917
01:17:10,475 --> 01:17:12,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, who wants to be on the subcommittee?

918
01:17:12,756 --> 01:17:13,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be in.

919
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:18,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we've got Maury, Eunice.

920
01:17:19,241 --> 01:17:19,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

921
01:17:20,642 --> 01:17:21,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I see Daveed?

922
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:22,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you saw me.

923
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:24,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And did I see anybody else?

924
01:17:28,512 --> 01:17:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

925
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:31,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be on it because I'm on every subcommittee.

926
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:37,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, I'll just like, you know, okay.

927
01:17:37,697 --> 01:17:42,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So who, um, does anybody want to be in charge of setting up a meeting for that?

928
01:17:44,681 --> 01:17:45,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that.

929
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that.

930
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:48,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

931
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:53,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eunice, you'll, Eunice will send out dates to set up a meeting.

932
01:17:54,487 --> 01:17:54,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

933
01:17:56,408 --> 01:17:56,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

934
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:03,993
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically that section about financial interest.

935
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:15,302
[SPEAKER_07]: The last piece is, are you counting the WALFAM section as part of the?

936
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose that could go with ethics.

937
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally wasn't.

938
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:29,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like it's more connected to the bit we said we didn't want.

939
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:30,792
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of state law.

940
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:50,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So far, just to be clear from this section, under the conflict of interest, we're including the standard language which just says that about municipal employees and that they're beholden to follow mass general laws.

941
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:57,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we are going to have a subcommittee look at the possible extra layer of financial statements.

942
01:18:58,693 --> 01:18:59,633
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my understanding.

943
01:18:59,974 --> 01:19:01,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

944
01:19:02,175 --> 01:19:03,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the property.

945
01:19:05,098 --> 01:19:11,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice, do you want to just give some background about what you're thinking about on this?

946
01:19:11,763 --> 01:19:15,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I pulled this from Framingham.

947
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:21,233
[SPEAKER_01]: In Waltham, I guess, well, there's a couple of different ones.

948
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:23,935
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the naming of property, which came out of Framingham.

949
01:19:23,955 --> 01:19:30,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the purchase or taking land of land, which came out of Waltham.

950
01:19:30,861 --> 01:19:32,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're two different things.

951
01:19:33,723 --> 01:19:34,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

952
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:39,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Property is just that.

953
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:41,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's say we have a,

954
01:19:42,431 --> 01:19:47,155
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, new fire headquarters, you know, coming down the pike in a couple of years.

955
01:19:47,175 --> 01:20:06,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, this would be, you know, uh, real and personal property shall only be dedicated or named by majority vote of the full council upon a recommendation of the mayor, except in the case of school property, which, you know, is under school committee, um, jurisdiction.

956
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:06,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

957
01:20:09,348 --> 01:20:23,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the naming of school property part, I believe, and Paulette will correct me if I'm wrong, but that comes under mass state law, I believe.

958
01:20:24,956 --> 01:20:37,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the naming of city property come under any sort of state law and then

959
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:58,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there was some talk a while back, maybe it was when we were going through the Columbus Mississippi mess, that there was talk about at one point naming of, I don't know if it was city property in general or just school property.

960
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:03,377
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, there was some sort of, maybe it was a gentleman's agreement or something,

961
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:08,378
[SPEAKER_01]: that it had to be named after somebody who was no longer alive.

962
01:21:09,138 --> 01:21:31,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much of this could go into a piece of the charter, but knowing that I believe there's something on the books regarding the school committee and what they are and are not allowed to do,

963
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:40,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It made sense to have something mirroring that for city property.

964
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:47,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the school committee, you're saying comes from state law, right?

965
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so, Paulette.

966
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:50,032
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 percent.

967
01:21:50,532 --> 01:21:53,773
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 percent is state law.

968
01:21:53,793 --> 01:21:57,094
[SPEAKER_07]: My feeling about this is that this is the kind of thing that could be in an ordinance.

969
01:21:58,834 --> 01:21:59,135
[SPEAKER_07]: In what?

970
01:21:59,695 --> 01:22:00,535
[SPEAKER_07]: In an ordinance.

971
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,401
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know how others feel.

972
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:10,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it needs to be addressed, but not in this format.

973
01:22:10,945 --> 01:22:12,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

974
01:22:12,506 --> 01:22:12,626
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

975
01:22:14,487 --> 01:22:18,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, nobody on this call appreciates this law more than I do.

976
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:25,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But being on that committee and learning that law needs to be changed.

977
01:22:25,575 --> 01:22:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But this isn't the venue.

978
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:31,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The charter is not the place to do this, in my opinion.

979
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:39,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any other thoughts about this naming of city property?

980
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

981
01:22:42,751 --> 01:22:51,737
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it just doesn't feel, and I know that there's some history to naming things, but it doesn't seem important enough to go in the charter to me.

982
01:22:51,757 --> 01:22:52,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

983
01:22:53,058 --> 01:22:53,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Maury.

984
01:22:53,499 --> 01:22:55,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We just named the library.

985
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

986
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:56,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Maury.

987
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:06,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron, I'm curious, where do you think this should go, then, if it's not in the chart?

988
01:23:06,846 --> 01:23:12,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like Milva said, it should be by ordinance, because there's definitely something wrong with it.

989
01:23:12,969 --> 01:23:18,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a little kid goes to a Little League baseball game at Columbus Park at Mississippi Tech School.

990
01:23:18,151 --> 01:23:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So that tells you that there's a disjoint somewhere.

991
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:23,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But to me, it's just a...

992
01:23:25,675 --> 01:23:26,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the state law.

993
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's clearly deep in the state law.

994
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're going to ask the city council to approve what we write, I just, you know, I just don't think it's worth the, it needs to be done on a much different basis to force a. Okay.

995
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So do we, does anybody want to make a motion about this?

996
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we, I mean, we've had some discussion.

997
01:23:58,187 --> 01:24:01,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody feel strongly about including it and they want to make a motion or.

998
01:24:01,632 --> 01:24:12,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make a motion that we before before making motion, I just want to say 1 thing that, you know, just in naming things, you know.

999
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:18,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, and Eunice brought up the library, you know, the Bloomberg Library.

1000
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:27,088
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a sizable contribution made to gain, put that name on the library.

1001
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:38,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you know, that, you know, there are other opportunities for, you know, naming things in a way that brings some

1002
01:24:39,715 --> 01:24:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: money into the school system.

1003
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:55,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to leave it up to the City Council just for that fact because they can be kind of some blurry stuff that if we put it in the chat, they may not

1004
01:24:55,888 --> 01:25:07,582
[SPEAKER_02]: They might miss an opportunity to kind of, you know, maybe have a Bloomberg high or something, you know, to that effect, you know, so let's leave it up to the body.

1005
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:13,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there might be an opportunity for the city to to gain.

1006
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:26,408
[SPEAKER_02]: the kids to gain, and I know there's history and people feel strongly about the school naming and things like that, but it doesn't need to be in the charter.

1007
01:25:26,628 --> 01:25:31,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If there needs to be arguments or debate, let it be.

1008
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:36,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the city council and the school committee listen to the people.

1009
01:25:37,494 --> 01:25:38,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they get paid for.

1010
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:40,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1011
01:25:40,276 --> 01:25:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I feel- They're not to exclude it.

1012
01:25:43,462 --> 01:25:46,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want, okay, so you want to make a motion to exclude this section?

1013
01:25:47,345 --> 01:25:47,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1014
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody want to second?

1015
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:53,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second it.

1016
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,850
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that?

1017
01:25:54,411 --> 01:25:54,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1018
01:25:56,733 --> 01:25:57,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1019
01:25:57,313 --> 01:25:57,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony?

1020
01:25:58,994 --> 01:25:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1021
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:00,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron?

1022
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:01,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1023
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:03,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury?

1024
01:26:05,339 --> 01:26:05,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1025
01:26:06,941 --> 01:26:07,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Daveed?

1026
01:26:08,562 --> 01:26:08,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1027
01:26:09,483 --> 01:26:09,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis?

1028
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:10,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1029
01:26:11,965 --> 01:26:12,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette?

1030
01:26:12,886 --> 01:26:15,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1031
01:26:15,969 --> 01:26:17,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's it and I'm voting.

1032
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:23,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought these things forward for discussion.

1033
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:23,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1034
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:25,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1035
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:35,285
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to move on now to the purchase or taking of land.

1036
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:40,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to talk about why you think this is a good idea for the charter?

1037
01:26:43,586 --> 01:26:53,651
[SPEAKER_01]: No particular reason other than that, you know, I found it in another charter in Waltham specifically.

1038
01:26:54,271 --> 01:26:58,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And so clearly it had some meaning to that community.

1039
01:27:00,453 --> 01:27:11,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like something that, you know, should probably end as you seem to say, you know, that it's come up in some other charters as well.

1040
01:27:12,204 --> 01:27:16,847
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was worthy of some discussion.

1041
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:34,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there may have been some talk about taking up some land for, I don't know, maybe it was parking lots or something like that, or something else that the city was going to use, or maybe it's our own land, I don't remember.

1042
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:44,399
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seemed to be something that could easily come up and was worth having a discussion about.

1043
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:58,542
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, I think this was the language that I gave to the Collins Center and they actually had an issue with it because of the language which is outlined in these comments.

1044
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:02,044
[SPEAKER_07]: They also gave these examples.

1045
01:28:02,365 --> 01:28:10,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that I thought is interesting to note is that we actually, it's in Mass General Law for Planned Parenthood, so we technically have this provision.

1046
01:28:10,509 --> 01:28:15,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I feel, you know, there's definitely Mass General Law about this.

1047
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:17,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1048
01:28:17,853 --> 01:28:19,414
[SPEAKER_07]: What about eminent domain?

1049
01:28:19,434 --> 01:28:20,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that apply here for anything?

1050
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:24,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it does.

1051
01:28:24,476 --> 01:28:26,798
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they're taking it by eminent domain.

1052
01:28:28,409 --> 01:28:38,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a it's eminent domain, but is that a process or an action that any municipality or city town anyone can take.

1053
01:28:39,536 --> 01:28:45,879
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just so, since I'm on here, I mean, I think we stick to the Massachusetts general law here.

1054
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:52,622
[SPEAKER_05]: The court system, the process, it's not a city hall issue.

1055
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:53,562
[SPEAKER_05]: This one really isn't.

1056
01:28:53,582 --> 01:28:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's talking about taking your home to drive a highway through.

1057
01:28:57,044 --> 01:29:01,366
[SPEAKER_05]: These are massive court situations that you're not going to rely on.

1058
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:04,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this mass general law is very explicit.

1059
01:29:04,828 --> 01:29:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It tells you exactly how to do it.

1060
01:29:06,749 --> 01:29:12,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, you know, Peabody probably had some construction stuff, major highway stuff going on at the time.

1061
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1062
01:29:13,872 --> 01:29:19,755
[SPEAKER_05]: But to me, this is like, this doesn't happen when the city clerks send you a letter, say, well, your house has been sold for $250,000.

1063
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:25,598
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a major, that's why I'm leaning strongly towards the mass general laws on this one.

1064
01:29:26,799 --> 01:29:27,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1065
01:29:28,039 --> 01:29:28,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else?

1066
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:30,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good with that.

1067
01:29:32,638 --> 01:29:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make a motion that we stick to this mass law and... Seconded.

1068
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:52,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the motion is that we do not include a section about taking of land by city.

1069
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,591
[SPEAKER_07]: That's essentially it, right?

1070
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1071
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:56,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1072
01:29:58,053 --> 01:29:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1073
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:02,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Anthony?

1074
01:30:05,596 --> 01:30:05,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1075
01:30:07,037 --> 01:30:07,757
[SPEAKER_07]: David?

1076
01:30:09,038 --> 01:30:09,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1077
01:30:10,019 --> 01:30:10,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice?

1078
01:30:11,179 --> 01:30:11,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1079
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:12,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron?

1080
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:13,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1081
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:14,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury?

1082
01:30:15,382 --> 01:30:16,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1083
01:30:17,043 --> 01:30:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis?

1084
01:30:17,944 --> 01:30:18,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1085
01:30:18,944 --> 01:30:19,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Paulette?

1086
01:30:19,825 --> 01:30:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1087
01:30:20,986 --> 01:30:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll go yes.

1088
01:30:22,006 --> 01:30:22,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, awesome.

1089
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:29,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so those were the outstanding issues on the list.

1090
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:34,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any other outstanding issues that we need?

1091
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:45,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we do have one, which is the financial statements, but does anybody have any other outstanding issues that we should look at before we are ready to hand things over to the call center?

1092
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:50,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question, did we ever get, I know we talked about this,

1093
01:30:52,592 --> 01:30:54,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Section 8 maybe was public engagement.

1094
01:30:55,233 --> 01:31:07,958
[SPEAKER_01]: We had wanted some more specificity from the Collins Center about where the free petition and referendums were used, like some examples.

1095
01:31:08,919 --> 01:31:09,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we ever get that?

1096
01:31:11,443 --> 01:31:17,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, I'm not, I mean, you know, we already went through that and we voted on that section.

1097
01:31:17,226 --> 01:31:19,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever we got was brought up in a meeting.

1098
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:21,728
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't brought up in a meeting, we didn't get it.

1099
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:24,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm just misremembering.

1100
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:35,494
[SPEAKER_07]: But just remember, I mean, we are gonna get a draft charter from the Collins Center and we're all gonna have the opportunity to read it and then we're all gonna discuss it.

1101
01:31:35,534 --> 01:31:37,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, you know, there's,

1102
01:31:40,055 --> 01:31:44,357
[SPEAKER_07]: there's going to be chances to discuss things that come up for you.

1103
01:31:44,837 --> 01:31:45,418
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm saying.

1104
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:46,598
[SPEAKER_07]: David?

1105
01:31:48,499 --> 01:31:50,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I just wanted to say I think you're all outstanding.

1106
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thanks, David.

1107
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1108
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1109
01:31:56,383 --> 01:31:59,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to thank Matthew for all of his information in the chat.

1110
01:31:59,444 --> 01:32:00,905
[SPEAKER_09]: That was good information, Matthew.

1111
01:32:00,945 --> 01:32:01,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1112
01:32:03,807 --> 01:32:11,350
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so I'm just going to take a moment to talk about the final report committee.

1113
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:15,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Jean, Maury, me, Phyllis, potentially, and Daveed.

1114
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did have a doodle poll, and I'll just tell you the three times that work for Phyllis and you.

1115
01:32:23,595 --> 01:32:25,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm basically checking with Phyllis and Daveed.

1116
01:32:27,136 --> 01:32:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: June 25th, which is this Tuesday, or June 26th from 2.30 to 4.00.

1117
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if day ever works for you, Phyllis.

1118
01:32:38,007 --> 01:32:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday, Monday and Tuesday of next week are no good.

1119
01:32:40,868 --> 01:32:43,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday, I probably could do it.

1120
01:32:43,328 --> 01:32:47,409
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some interviews going on in school, so I know there's definitely some on Tuesday.

1121
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure about Wednesday yet, Milva.

1122
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I didn't respond.

1123
01:32:51,631 --> 01:32:53,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to try to see if they had any more scheduled.

1124
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:54,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1125
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:55,912
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you, David?

1126
01:32:55,932 --> 01:32:56,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Are daytimes out for you?

1127
01:32:58,292 --> 01:32:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Those both work to me.

1128
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:01,153
[SPEAKER_03]: My summer is very free.

1129
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm going to I'm actually going to schedule that I'll send out an agenda.

1130
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:10,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, our first meeting is going to basically be just to make a plan.

1131
01:33:11,594 --> 01:33:16,757
[SPEAKER_07]: About is that going to be Melba Wednesday from 230 to 4. so if you can't come.

1132
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:18,399
[SPEAKER_07]: You think you can come?

1133
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to make sure I don't have anything scheduled for them.

1134
01:33:21,722 --> 01:33:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: The other date that was available was Sunday the 30th from 630 to 8.

1135
01:33:27,147 --> 01:33:34,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right, so we'll do Wednesday the 26th from 234 and then we'll see where we go from there.

1136
01:33:35,055 --> 01:33:36,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, basically, we're going to be making a plan.

1137
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:37,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be.

1138
01:33:38,926 --> 01:33:42,067
[SPEAKER_07]: figuring out sort of how we're going to structure it.

1139
01:33:42,548 --> 01:33:44,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe people will volunteer to write certain sections.

1140
01:33:44,929 --> 01:33:45,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1141
01:33:45,269 --> 01:33:45,969
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure it out.

1142
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:48,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what our meeting is going to be about.

1143
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:50,331
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1144
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:54,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, we're not meeting in July.

1145
01:33:55,053 --> 01:33:59,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will meet the first Thursday in August.

1146
01:33:59,535 --> 01:34:01,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the date handy, but it's our usual.

1147
01:34:02,756 --> 01:34:03,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And you will have.

1148
01:34:05,215 --> 01:34:14,058
[SPEAKER_07]: assuming the call-in center is turnaround is as quick as they told me it is, you will all have had some time with the draft charter.

1149
01:34:14,098 --> 01:34:24,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will be your July homework to read the draft charter and come prepared to go over it with the call-in center in August.

1150
01:34:24,621 --> 01:34:26,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, we'll have a good start on a final report.

1151
01:34:27,682 --> 01:34:27,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

1152
01:34:27,902 --> 01:34:28,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a plan.

1153
01:34:28,522 --> 01:34:30,843
[SPEAKER_07]: The first Thursday in August is August 1st.

1154
01:34:32,144 --> 01:34:32,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

1155
01:34:32,904 --> 01:34:33,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1156
01:34:34,604 --> 01:34:36,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1157
01:34:37,747 --> 01:34:40,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Next meeting, August 1st, with the Collins Center.

1158
01:34:43,072 --> 01:34:46,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And if for some reason they can't come, I'll let you know, but I don't think that's gonna happen.

1159
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:49,458
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Matthew, you have comments?

1160
01:34:51,221 --> 01:35:00,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I just, before everything is sent to the call-in center, sometimes when I watch these meetings, I'm just kind of interested in knowing what is the current state of the draft that you're preparing to send.

1161
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess, I know you're constantly, you all are constantly revising it every week or every other week, particularly the question of the referenda were mentioned and there was uncertainty to what degree that was discussed.

1162
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:18,593
[SPEAKER_04]: If I email you, Milva, would that, would I be able to get like a current copy and we could see if there's any language concerning referenda?

1163
01:35:19,655 --> 01:35:20,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that is Article 8.

1164
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:33,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot in that article, initiative petitions, all kinds of things, recalls, et cetera.

1165
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:38,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I can send you what we have that we voted on.

1166
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, so we have several articles that we have drafted.

1167
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all going to go to the Collins Center.

1168
01:35:45,228 --> 01:35:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the Collins Center will be doing is just sort of

1169
01:35:51,303 --> 01:35:53,344
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for consistency of language.

1170
01:35:53,824 --> 01:35:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: We kept talking about when it says certain number of days, what does that mean?

1171
01:35:57,246 --> 01:36:03,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's going to be that whole definition section, so that'll be what they're going to do for us.

1172
01:36:03,509 --> 01:36:18,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they're going to actually draft Articles 5, 9, and 10, but we actually did vote on some of the language in Article 9, but they'll plug in whatever standard language.

1173
01:36:19,536 --> 01:36:22,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll be looking for consistency of language.

1174
01:36:22,857 --> 01:36:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have questions about what we meant, they'll ask us.

1175
01:36:26,237 --> 01:36:30,538
[SPEAKER_07]: If they see something that they think will maybe cause an issue, they'll tell us.

1176
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:41,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for instance, we didn't end up voting on using that language from WALF-AM about the taking of land, but they felt that it could actually disadvantage the city, and we pointed that out.

1177
01:36:41,261 --> 01:36:47,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they see something like that, they'll point it out to us, and then it will be up to us whether we want to consider what they, you know,

1178
01:36:48,388 --> 01:36:52,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand they will advise and they'll find any kind of things that need to be cleaned up.

1179
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:58,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the current draft for acquiring, I can just email you and see how everything's working.

1180
01:36:58,233 --> 01:37:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, very good.

1181
01:37:00,795 --> 01:37:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: All the documents are public, so you can just send the link over, right?

1182
01:37:04,397 --> 01:37:06,858
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on the website, but they're constantly being revised, right?

1183
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:09,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at least they're live documents.

1184
01:37:11,264 --> 01:37:22,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure the actual drafts are on the, in our committee materials on the website because they're, they're not, they're not our final draft.

1185
01:37:22,611 --> 01:37:36,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, how many do we want floating around say, but I'm perfectly comfortable sharing article eight with you if you just email me and I'll, and I will write very big letters on top that it's in draft form.

1186
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody for this meeting.

1187
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:39,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate all the work that everybody's doing.

1188
01:37:40,033 --> 01:37:40,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1189
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your leadership.

1190
01:37:44,178 --> 01:37:47,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think I agree with David.

1191
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:48,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're all awesome.

1192
01:37:48,803 --> 01:37:50,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has been really a pleasure.

1193
01:37:50,205 --> 01:37:51,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're not done yet.

1194
01:37:51,326 --> 01:37:55,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, let's get you know, so close.

1195
01:37:57,674 --> 01:37:59,316
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're doing really well, yeah.

1196
01:37:59,756 --> 01:38:04,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, I feel like the final report is going to be kind of like writing a dissertation, but maybe not.

1197
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:14,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean is on the committee, and she seems very, you know, she said she writes reports all the time for her work, so she's not intimidated by it at all.

1198
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:16,812
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not deterred by it, yeah.

1199
01:38:17,513 --> 01:38:19,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it'll be good.

1200
01:38:20,595 --> 01:38:22,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to include in

1201
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:33,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we did a lot of work with the word representation stuff, and we had charts and graphs and nice visuals.

1202
01:38:35,184 --> 01:38:37,965
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be including that.

1203
01:38:38,305 --> 01:38:41,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I envision that there will be appendixes.

1204
01:38:41,626 --> 01:38:42,787
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be that.

1205
01:38:42,827 --> 01:38:45,467
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be the survey results.

1206
01:38:45,948 --> 01:38:52,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene did an awesome report, the summary on all the listening sessions.

1207
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:58,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So those will, I think, will be sort of addendums to the report, but we'll discuss that.

1208
01:38:59,394 --> 01:39:03,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I particularly like Somerville's in looking through it.

1209
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:04,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1210
01:39:05,057 --> 01:39:11,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The five or six that you sent us, I noticed, let me just get my piece of paper here.

1211
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thelmuth, Ashland, Newton, and Watertown were

1212
01:39:18,575 --> 01:39:23,624
[SPEAKER_01]: under 75 pages long, but the Somerville one was 125 pages long.

1213
01:39:24,565 --> 01:39:25,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want to get us to do.

1214
01:39:25,968 --> 01:39:31,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was the only one that basically wrote a charter from scratch.

1215
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,281
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones were all revisions.

1216
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of seemed to mirror more of the work that we've done.

1217
01:39:40,342 --> 01:39:44,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty comprehensive.

1218
01:39:44,263 --> 01:39:49,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the charts and graphs, I don't think we have ones for school committee.

1219
01:39:51,245 --> 01:39:57,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll work with either Aubrey or Jean and get you what you need.

1220
01:39:57,507 --> 01:40:01,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that data came from me initially.

1221
01:40:01,755 --> 01:40:06,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when the final report committee meets, if we feel like we need stuff, we'll just ask for it.

1222
01:40:07,422 --> 01:40:07,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Maury?

1223
01:40:09,024 --> 01:40:10,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1224
01:40:12,808 --> 01:40:20,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will see some of you at various subcommittee meetings and the rest of you have a fantastic July.

1225
01:40:23,507 --> 01:40:26,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we're supposed to vote, but I know everybody's okay.

1226
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:27,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1227
01:40:27,442 --> 01:40:27,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1228
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:28,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1229
01:40:28,345 --> 01:40:28,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1230
01:40:28,927 --> 01:40:29,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1231
01:40:29,228 --> 01:40:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
