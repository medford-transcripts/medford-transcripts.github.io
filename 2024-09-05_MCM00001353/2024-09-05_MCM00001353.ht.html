    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=272.921s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Oke, gwo.
 Non mwen se Shelly Gary e mwen travay avèk MHP Mass Housing nan kominote atravè eta a pou ede etabli apwobasyon charter Fund Trusted Housing Affordable Housing epi travay pou ede administratè yo kòmanse fonksyone.
 Pou moun ki pa abitye ak MHP (Mass Housing Partnership), nou se yon ajans teritoryal nan Massachusetts ki gen objektif se travay pou ogmante rezèv ak aksè nan lojman abòdab atravè eta a.
 Nou gen plizyè fason diferan pou akonpli misyon sa a.
 Nou gen yon sant done lojman, kidonk nou gen yon ti ekip moun k ap kolekte, analize ak pataje
 Done ede kreye politik efikas.
 Yo te kreye tou kèk gwo zouti sou entènèt pou kominote a itilize.
 Nou gen yon ekip sansibilizasyon kominotè, kote mwen fè pati, e nou travay anpil ak kominote lokal yo ansanm ak otorite lojman ak devlopè san bi likratif pou ede konstwi kapasite lokal pou sipòte lojman abòdab.
 Kreye epi kenbe lojman abòdab.
 Ekip prete nou an te prete plis pase $1.4 milya dola pou konstwi ak prezève lojman abòdab.
 Apre sa, nou gen yon ekip pwopriyetè kay ki ap travay pou ede ogmante aksè a lojman pou fanmi ki gen revni ba ak modere atravè eta a.
 Aswè a, nou pral kòmanse ak kèk prensip debaz nan règleman Housing Trust Fund epi answit pran yon gade pi pwofon sou operasyon ak pi bon pratik ki baze sou travay nan anpil kominote atravè eta a.
 Nou te aprann kèk bagay, epi apre sa nou pral plonje nan aktivite ki kalifye yo, ki se kalite bagay ou kapab peye.
 Housing Trust Fund, mon ti a kontan ganny enteronpe si mon ti koz tro vit oubyen si en keksoz pa kler.
 Mwen pral sispann epi poze kesyon apre chak seksyon, men santi yo lib pou mande yon moun sispann m 'si mwen pa konprann sijè a, oswa ou ka leve men ou epi mwen pral eseye kalkile li.
 Men, mwen byen kontan yo te entèwonp nan entre-temps la.
 Mwen pa bezwen moun sa a ki pale pou yon tan long ak Lè sa a, pale ankò.
 Premyèman kèk bagay debaz, pwobableman ou deja konnen sa a, men règleman yo pou Fon Trusted Minisipal Lojman Abòdab yo etabli anba Chapit 44, Seksyon 55C nan Lwa Piblik Jeneral la.
 Sa a se reyinyon piblik ou a.
 Menm jan ak lòt konsèy Medford, li se yon antite piblik.
 Li te kreye pa kò lejislatif lokal la, City Council la.
 An reyalite, konsantre a se pito limite.
 Objektif li se kreye ak prezève lojman abòdab pou fanmi ki gen revni ba ak modere.
 Li gouvène pa yon konsèy administrasyon ki nonmen lokalman.
 Paske ou se yon komite piblik, ou sijè a kontra piblik, seleksyon designer, konfli enterè, ak lwa reyinyon ouvè, menm jan ak tout lòt komite minisipal yo.
 An jeneral, kòm yon konfyans ou ka satisfè bezwen an pou lojman abòdab.
 Ou ka sipòte inisyativ kontwòl lojman lokal yo epi antre nan mache lojman an.
 Se konsa, ou ka achte ak vann pwopriyete, epi ou ka ede tou devlopè achte pwopriyete pou lojman abòdab.
 Ou ka pran desizyon alè paske ou pa oblije ale nan Konsèy Vil la pou pran yon desizyon sof si sa di nan òdonans ou a.
 Ou ka ranmase lajan nan diferan sous.
 Se konsa, nou wè kominote yo vin pi kreyatif nan eseye jwenn finansman pou lojman abòdab, espesyalman pou trust yo, pase yo te 5 ane de sa oswa dis ane de sa.
 Lwa a trè kout e li pa trè preskriptif.
 Ankò, ou ta dwe peye atansyon sou dekrè ou a pou wè si ou pa te li l nèt. Ou ta dwe li òdonans lokal ou yo pou wè ki jan Konsèy Vil Medford ap ajoute kèk konsèy.
 Men, lwa a sèlman egzije pou omwen senk administratè.
 Li ta dwe gen ladan CEO a.
 An reyalite, li pa menm idantifye yon moun deziyen, byenke kèk kominote kwè sa a se akseptab.
 Administratè yo nonmen pa majistra a, ki anjeneral gen ladan konsèy vil la.
 Se yon komite espesyal ki sèvi yon manda dezan.
 Anpil kominote pral dekale yo pou yo pa rantre an menm tan, epi nou souvan fè sa ak lòt konsèy san bi likratif.
 Konsèvatè yo se ajan piblik.
 Ou se ofisye minisipal espesyal, menm jan ak lòt konsèy.
 Lwa a etabli 16 pouvwa espesifik.
 Padon, ou deranje si nou poze yon kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=556.382s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Next.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=560.004s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Se konsa, ou mansyone ke nou se anplwaye espesyal minisipal yo.
 Èske nou anplwaye minisipal espesyal oswa jis ajan piblik?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=570.71s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Ajan Piblik, eskize.
 oops.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=573.771s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=574.932s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Padon, petèt mwen te di li mal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=578.594s">[Unidentified]</a>: Oke, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=583.699s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So the statute gives 16 explicit powers.
 These are just some of the big ones of accepting and receiving real property, purchase and retain real or personal property, selling, leasing, exchanging.
 The statute also allows for additional powers to be given to the trust in line with the statute.
 And we do have communities that modify the powers so again, you just want to make sure that you're paying attention to your local ordinance in case the city council did.
 add some restrictions in some communities.
 It might require a certain percentage of the trustees for certain decisions.
 Borrowing seems to have some of the most restrictions about how much a trust can borrow or who has some guidance about that.
 So just make sure that you're paying attention to your ordinance.
 So those are just some very, very basics.
 Getting into operations and best practices.
 So one of the things that we're seeing is that there are more ways that communities are funding their trust today than even just five years ago, five or six years ago.
 So a variety of different ways.
 So certainly the Community Preservation Act is one of the most common and about almost 80% of
 trust communities also have CPA, but it's not a given in every community that
 The trust receives CPA funds every year, or it's not necessarily a set amount every year.
 So it's not necessarily a funding source that every community can count on outside of Cambridge and Somerville for the most part.
 But CPA is a common one.
 Inclusionary zoning in some communities, the inclusionary zoning bylaw or ordinance directs any in lieu of payments to go to the trust.
 And in some communities, it's even like in Swampscot, the trust actually determines what the payment is, what the formula is.
 We have one community in the Cape that has a cell phone tower and the lease payments go to their trust.
 It's not a lot of money.
 It's a small amount, but it's something that they can count on each year.
 We have communities that transfer funds from free cash from the general fund to their trust.
 So Truro, Brookline are communities that have done that multiple times.
 We have one community that we know of that has a municipal bond Medfield established their trust and then they voted to allow for a million dollar bond to see the trust and I don't think that they've drawn on it yet I don't think that they've used it but they do have those resources.
 If they wanted to.
 Or leans on the Cape has established their trust several years ago now and they also voted for a tax override of $275,000 and they see that as a permanent tax override.
 They're the only trust that I know of that's been able to access a line of credit at a bank because they do have this consistent funding source.
 There can be donations to the trust of land or cash.
 There may be developer negotiated fees.
 You need to be very careful with how you do this.
 But we do have a community that received from a friendly 40 B home ownership development.
 They received funds that then the select board directed to the trust.
 Some communities are looking at short-term rental fees and using some of these funds for their trust and or affordable housing development.
 Of course, you likely have heard about real estate transfer fee, the hope of having a real estate transfer fee in the state.
 And communities are still working towards that, even though it didn't end up in the bond bill this year.
 And I hear communities talk about taxes for the marijuana.
 from sales of marijuana, I haven't heard any actually using that at this point.
 So there are a variety of ways, there could be also a special bylaw or ordinance payments that could be directed to the trust.
 And I think there are a couple examples of that.
 So there are a variety of ways that communities are trying to raise additional resources to fund affordable housing.
 As a new trust starting out, we really encourage you to, I'm sorry, I forgot to look this up.
 Do you have a current housing production plan?
 or housing needs than you do.
 So we would really encourage you to be reviewing this, to be familiar with this.
 Some of you likely are more than others, but to really understand the identified needs in the community and to be able to really engage in conversations about that and talk with people about that.
 And to start as a board, to start with those identified needs when you start thinking about setting priorities
 and what you're going to focus on as a board.
 You could also create benchmarks you don't have to but Somerville is a community where their trust is actually written into their ordinance that a certain amount of the resources are to go to lowest income households I think it's under 50% of the area median income.
 So to make sure that they're not just funding at 80% or 100%, but that they are investing in housing for much lower income households.
 So you could create benchmarks like that.
 If there was a particular value that was important at a particular time, you don't have to.
 But we are really encouraging trusts to do some groundwork, to not just jump in, but to really think about what your niche is in the community and how you're going to operate as a board.
 Another part is just using other resources to familiarize yourself with local housing needs.
 So this is Datatown, and some of you likely use Datatown, but it's a resource that MHP developed years ago.
 And there are a lot of different data points for communities all across the state.
 And so on the left, this is just the housing units by building type in Medford.
 And you see that you have a housing diversity that's decent, particularly compared to
 probably I think most other communities in the state, you do have some multifamily housing, which is fantastic.
 On the right, it just gives you a glimpse of the housing burden in Medford.
 So the top is renter households and the bottom is home ownership.
 homeowners, and this is likely in your housing production plan as well, but this is a typical pattern where renters tend to be, there tends to be a greater percentage of renters that are housing cost burdened.
 The greenish color, the 19.2% are households that are spending at least 30% of their gross income on housing.
 And then the blue, the 18.9 are households that are severely cost burdened and they're spending at least 50% of their
 The gross income on housing and then homeowners are are down below.
 So at this point.
 Doing a lot of reading and research and just really getting a handle on the housing needs in the community is a is our first suggestion for trust new trust.
 You can also do a little bit of work learning about affordable housing finance, not to become experts.
 It's very complicated and it's not your job to be experts, but to have a bit more familiarity because of course, the whole point of having a trust is to help support the creation and preservation of affordable housing.
 So we have some tools on the housing toolbox, which is another resource that MHP helps to maintain.
 We have different trainings that have talked through
 financing affordable housing development, we also have a couple that give the developers perspective of how that a developer puts together an affordable housing deal and the way that local communities can support them.
 Another thing that I encourage trust to consider is to invite a developer to come 20 year meetings to talk through
 pro forma with you to help you understand the overall process.
 Again, not to become experts, but just to be more familiar and more comfortable with the process and to learn about the importance of the role of a local trust and local resources and when developers really need those in order to go to the state for state and federal resources.
 So Beverly is a community where they invited two developers, a nonprofit, a community development corporation, as well as the local Habitat branch to come and share, go through a pro forma and talk about their process and what it takes for them to put together a housing deal.
 Winchester recently invited a for-profit developer,
 A man who had been with a larger developer and he's gone out on his own and he has a lot of experience and he came and talked through a recent development and help the trust just better understand the process and and their role in supporting development.
 So those are a couple different things that you can be doing to learn a bit more about affordable housing finance.
 And then once you feel a bit comfortable with, you don't necessarily, this doesn't have to be linear, it can happen at the same time, but once you are feeling fairly comfortable with kind of the needs in the community and you're starting to think about the niche for your board, we really encourage you to create a mission statement if you haven't done this already.
 to really put out there clearly for yourself, but also for the community of how you see your role in the community.
 So just to, I'm sure that probably all of you have been involved in mission statements in one way or another and in different boards and organizations over the years, but something succinct and that ultimately talks about what you do, how you do it, and who you do it for.
 And I just put up Amherst, but
 There's really what they what strikes me about theirs is that they are kind of reiterating that they're an instrument of local government of town government.
 And really, their goal is to their mission is to promote identified priorities in the town.
 So they really wanted kind of collaborative language.
 And you'll if you haven't already, you can figure out what what makes sense for Medford.
 And then we're suggesting that trust spend a little bit of time doing some work considering goals and strategies for your board.
 And really the reason why I've come to this is because I've worked in so many communities over the years and the trust oftentimes will feel pressure to jump in and just do something, to accomplish something.
 There's oftentimes a lot of external pressure or municipal pressure to do something.
 It oftentimes leads to, in my opinion, really a paralysis almost, because the housing needs are so great in all of our communities, the resources are really limited.
 So I'm really encouraging trust to take some time, even if there's external pressure to do something, but take some time to really think through.
 Given what you know about the needs in the community, given the limited resources that you have, what is your niche and what are two or three key things that you're going to focus on in the next few years?
 And really pushing trust to make these measurable goals, smart goals, so that there's really a way to measure how you're
 how you're moving forward.
 Oftentimes, housing production plans have goals that are really general, very, very broad.
 It's like increase the supply of senior housing, age-restricted housing, and it's just so big.
 So I'm really encouraging you to start with your housing production plan, start with what's already been identified, and then from that, really dig into
 focus on two or three key things and write your goals to be measurable.
 And then once you have those goals that are measurable, then work on strategies under each of those goals.
 And then from that, you can really dig into the tasks to be delegating to each other and to be moving things forward.
 But in some cases, this can be a process that takes a few months or six months.
 And I'm just really encouraging trust.
 If that's what it takes, then take that time.
 It doesn't mean you can't be doing some things at the same time, of course, but I think it's best early on.
 And then periodically after that to really be thoughtful and very specific about what you're trying to do so that you don't get into the point of spinning your wheels because we all know that the needs are great and the resources are very limited.
 So I'm just going to give an example of one community.
 This is itty bitty little well fleet out on Cape Cod and they their trust their new trust decided that their niche really was going to be about development and increasing the supply of new housing affordable housing in town.
 year-round housing.
 And so they came up with two goals, two measurable goals.
 One, create 100 units of low-moderate income rental and home ownership housing units over the next five years.
 And so Wellfleet is a community that has less than 5,000 residents year-round, so a very small community.
 So 100 units over five years is actually pretty ambitious for such a tiny little community.
 And then they are second goal raise $1,000,000 annually for 5 years for $5,000,000.
 And this is very ambitious for such a tiny community, even though they may be a more affluent community, there's still a very small community.
 And then under each of those goals, they created specific strategies that they're.
 Working towards to create to get to their goal.
 So this is the kind of work that I'm suggesting that trust do and that I'm working with trust on just to hopefully help help trust really focus and to be effective.
 Another thing that we suggest is that you create guidelines and several trusts have this, but it's in one space putting together a variety of information about the trust and how the trust is going to function.
 One to help keep you focused, but really so that others and people who may come to you for funds that they can get this information in one place.
 So the kind of elements that may be in guidelines are mission statement, goals and strategies to put it in.
 put it there.
 Roles and responsibilities of the trust, if there's anything just to have a place where you're putting some of the general roles and responsibilities of the trust.
 Your priority or eligible funding activities, so the things that you really want to focus on funding.
 Any stipulations for funding, so if you have income limits,
 If you are only funding housing up to 80% of the area at median income because you want everything to be eligible for the subsidized housing inventory, or if you're going to 100%, if you want developments that are mixed income, if you have a requirement around how long units are affordable, if you have a minimum of 20 years or 30 years or in perpetuity,
 information about project monitoring and reporting your expectations of what you'll receive from developments that you fund, application process, selection criteria, what you're looking at in an application form, so that someone who wants to come to the trust for funding doesn't have to go in a variety of different places, that they can have one place that they're getting this information, learning about how you operate, and then, of course, this is a document that you want to review periodically and make sure that you keep up to date.
 And then we suggest early on that you make sure that you're having conversations across boards and possibly even with groups outside of municipal government if that seems appropriate.
 Just to make sure that you're clarifying rules early on, that you are having some conversation about how boards may work together or entities may work together, perhaps identifying places, ways to collaborate, and maybe even a conversation about who funds what.
 So what you see in front of you is just an exercise that Manchester by the Sea did within their housing production plan.
 And you might have something similar, but they created their housing strategies on the left, identified their housing strategies, determined that some are lower, or I'm sorry, shorter term, some are longer term.
 And then they identified the lead board on the right hand side or the couple lead boards.
 So, you know, one, it helps a little bit, hopefully, with not stepping on each other's toes, but it also hopefully creates some accountability for who is responsible for different strategies.
 I think that this kind of an exercise could include a housing authority, depending on your local housing authority.
 It could include a nonprofit organization that does a lot of housing work.
 It could look different in different communities, but we've seen in communities that a trust is established and this conversation doesn't happen and there ends up being tension between different boards.
 If there's a housing partnership or committee, then sometimes there's some tension of just not understanding roles.
 So we really encourage you to have those conversations early and often just to improve your efficiency in your community and really help to strengthen that kind of the housing infrastructure, your ability as a town, as a city to do housing, making sure that you're working, that you're in communication and not duplicating efforts.
 And then
 I just can't say enough to be as transparent as possible.
 Just don't make it difficult for people to understand what your housing trust is all about, what you're working on, what you're funding, who's involved in the work.
 So use the webpage to put your information out there, have your ordinance out there, who are the trustees, ways that they can maybe get in touch with you.
 When you do create goals and strategies put it out on the web page when you invest in different developments promote that.
 decide what boards, you really need to be in.
 communication with, regular communication with, and report back.
 Perhaps sometimes do joint board meetings, if that ever makes sense.
 And in some communities, they like joint board appointments, which it seems like maybe you have done as well, just to help with communication across boards.
 And make sure that the communication is in two directions, that if you have someone from a board that they're reporting back to kind of what that board's doing, if it's really relevant, at the same time that they're kind of reporting back to the board that they also sit on.
 So again, as much transparency as possible.
 We all know that housing development, particularly affordable housing development can be very controversial.
 So just don't create vacuums or spaces where people can make stories, fill it in with what they imagine, make it easy for them to find out what you're doing.
 And it kind of lastly in this section is one thing that you can be working on with other groups such as housing Medford and other boards, the housing authority is really helping to create a culture of support in Medford for affordable housing development.
 This is an idea that really came out of.
 someone who is from Amherst, this idea of culture of support and her acknowledging that they have different boards working collaboratively over a lot of years to help create this general, much broader support for affordable housing than many of our communities have.
 This is a resource that's now maybe seems a little bit dated.
 It's a little bit oldish, but it's I think it's really still fantastic.
 And it just is an effort to test housing messages and wondering why so many of them kind of backfire.
 And they came up with some really, I think, helpful insight.
 You can just Google.
 You don't have to live here.
 It's still out there.
 But it talks about things like balancing people with places and systems.
 We want to talk about the people that need affordable housing, but also what are the systems in place that make it difficult for people to access housing in our communities, telling the story of us and not just them, because we all have communities that rely on low and.
 Kind of middle moderate income jobs and so it's it's not just them it's us it's people in our community that need more affordable housing connecting housing to other social issues we we know with lots of research that.
 health outcomes improve educational outcomes improve when people have access to safe affordable housing.
 We know that where you live affects your outcomes and another thing I think can be helpful is to consider the language that you use how you talk about the need in the community and.
 how you talk about affordable housing.
 In this particular study, they tested home versus housing, and they found that people thought of housing as public housing.
 And in the housing world, we know that public housing is critical.
 It's a critical part of our housing infrastructure.
 But unfortunately, it has some negative connotations for some people.
 They also responded to housing as more of a commodity.
 And with home the word home, they thought more of their family and where they find themselves.
 So even just the way that with the words that we use can impact how people hear what we're saying.
 For me, I, I try, even though in the development world, it's.
 Housing developments are called projects that's just the language and development in the development world but I try really hard not to use projects and communities just because of the housing projects and just how negative that is for people I have people who bring up Cabrini green a very old.
 Huge development public housing development in in Chicago that's been redeveloped years ago and I still have people in communities and bring this development up as like their core idea of affordable housing so you know I tried to use development housing development or developing homes, instead of.
 project.
 So perhaps spending some time of just thinking through how you're going to frame and talk about the need in the community could potentially be helpful.
 And that could be something that you also do with other entities like, like Housing Medford.
 So I wanted to pause and just see if there are any thoughts or questions or feedback at this point.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2038.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 不，没关系。
 不，不，对不起。
 所以现在我将介绍可以融资的项目类型，以及为什么《社区保护法》是信托用于资助住房的主要资源之一，因为有《社区保护法》，而且信托法规是在注册会计师 (CPA) 之后制定的，所以它确实是拥有注册会计师和社区，并拥有这些必须用于经济适用住房的资源，在某种程度上激发了市经济适用住房信托基金的法规。
 所以我将从一些语言开始，因为这些法规密切相关。
 因此，在 CPA 中，您可以使用这些动词“获取”、“创建”、“保留”、“支持”。
 并修复或修复，然后您就拥有了右侧的房子，这样您就可以使用注册会计师资金来购买、创建、保存和维护。
 对于修复和修复，如果单位是使用 CPA 资金购买或创建的，您可以使用 CPA 资金。
 因此，对于住房当局和尚未获得 CPA 资助的现有或现有经济适用房，情况会变得更加复杂。
 您不能使用 CPA 资金来恢复这些单位。
 它们确实必须是通过 CPA 创建或收购的单位。
 但我从这种类型的结构开始，然后给出一些关于它的例子。
 这是巴恩斯特布尔的一个住房开发项目的示例，该项目是一栋现有住宅。
 有些单位价格实惠，但并非全部。
 实际上，我应该说所有这些例子都是由注册会计师或信托基金资助的，但它们都可以由信托基金资助，因为这些法规在这一点上的联系如此紧密。
 信托法规最近进行了修改。
 事实上，已经有好几年了，但让所有具有注册会计师资格的社区住房活动都有资格获得该基金。
 这是一个收购的例子，当地资金被捐赠给非营利开发商 POA，以收购该开发项目。
 现在几乎所有单位都永远可以负担得起。
 其中一些人维持市场价格，因为有些家庭不符合收入要求，不想取代任何人，但用于购买现有住房的却是当地资金，现在这些住房大多是永远可以负担的。
 我们有各种有回购计划的信托。
 因此，小规模的住房所有权计划正在帮助符合收入资格的家庭在城市购买现有住房。
 它们的结构、方式也不同。
 据我所知，诺福克至少有一个案例，您的信托每年都会购买几栋房屋，像您在此处看到的照片一样朴素的房屋。
 然后他们做所有必要的修复工作，然后尝试将它们一起通过彩票出售。
 随着房价上涨，他们每年都在努力完成尽可能多的工作。
 他们尝试每年做三件事，我认为他们已经减少到了一到两次。
 但这是信托实际购买房屋的模式。
 我们还有其他模式，信托有助于促进向具有合格收入的家庭出售规模较小的房屋。
 然后，该信托基金会计算约定的销售价格与收入为该地区中位收入 80% 的家庭所能承受的价格之间的差额。
 然后我们至少有一个基金，他们有价值一定金额的代金券，他们会进行抽奖，比如说，他们有 50,000 美元的代金券，也许他们有 100,000 美元，所以他们有两张代金券，然后他们会进行抽奖，看看谁符合他们的收入水平。
 他们创造了该地区100%的平均收入，然后
 在抽奖中选择谁将收到其中一张代金券，然后该家庭将必须根据某些计划参数出去寻找房子。
 然后他们就有了这张价值高达 50,000 美元的代金券。
 我想是在莱弗里特。
 它们的结构非常不同，但都是小规模的住房所有权计划。
 由于其结构方式，它们的单位补贴往往很高。
 这是单位的缓慢积累，但它可能是帮助人们拥有房屋的一种方式。
 这可能是保护社区中一些规模较小的房屋的一种方式。
 我们的一些社区正在拆除规模较小、自然更经济实惠的住房。
 这可能是慢慢保护城市中一些较小房屋的一种方法。
 我们有许多社区支持新建信托和 CPC 的例子。
 这是社区积极参与的三个例子。
 在诺威尔，这个地点是一个警察局，被认为是盈余，后来转移到住房信托基金。
 他们是发起征求建议书的人。
 他们还接受了非营利开发商 Metro West 的提议，该开发商在那里建造了 18 套年龄限制住房单元。
 信托基金和 CPC 为这一开发项目贡献了约 120 万美元。
 在布鲁斯特，这是一个住房管理局网站。
 有一些剩余的土地属于住房管理局，他们正在努力建造更多的住房。
 该市积极寻求 Mass Saves 的拨款，以开展一些基础设施工作，使这一开发成为可能。
 然后他们向当地捐款 55 万美元。
 他们现在在这里有30套经济适用房，还有额外的出租屋。
 然后在西港，信托确实推动了这一过程，这是一个漫长的过程，但他们拥有市政土地，他们必须购买相邻的土地才能使用市政土地。
 他们进行了额外的开发前工作，发布了提案请求，并为开发做出了贡献。
 现在，通过主要的非营利开发商 Community Builders，他们已经
 西港的这50 个出租单位。
 社区真正积极参与了这三项开发，帮助推进并为其提供资金。
 我们还有一些将建筑物改造成经济适用房的例子，有时还有历史成分。
 在米德尔伯勒，这是一家鞋厂，然后一些非营利组织能够共同将其改造成 25 套出租屋。
 当地捐款仅为 25,000 美元。
 他们当时是一个新的注册会计师社区，他们没有那么多资源，但他们尽其所能地进行了投资。
 在威廉斯敦，这家工厂由开发商在当地出资的情况下改建为 42 套出租屋。
 然后下面两个是学校。
 所以有一些学校被改造成经济适用房的例子。
 在这两种情况下，就像学校经常发生的那样，在建筑物的历史部分建造了一个附属建筑，以增加单位并使其在财务上更加可行。
 左边，Sloan Scott，有38个有年龄限制的出租单位。
 右边是奥本，有 55 个年龄限制的出租单元。
 因此，适应性再利用，您可能已经知道这一点，但通常再利用现有建筑物比新建建筑物争议较小。
 如果对人们、对社区中那些重视历史保护的人来说，有一个历史的组成部分，这可能是双赢的。
 所以你可以帮忙。
 在某些情况下它可以帮助开发。
 然后继续。
 在CPA法规中，我们看到一些社区试图将很多东西置于保存状态，但是保存，CPA中的定义实际上是一个相当高的标准。
 它是保护不动产或动产免遭伤害、损坏或毁坏。
 这不是康复。
 这不仅仅是安装新水槽或台面那么简单。
 它确实比那大得多。
 它可以保护单位免于变得无法居住或失去其可达性限制。
 DHCD（现为 EOHLC）发布了一份备忘录，对
 向住房当局阐明哪些内容符合保护条件，哪些内容实际上需要修复，哪些内容需要维护。
 因此，CPA 资金决不允许用于维护。
 如果您对此不熟悉，您可能想熟悉一下，我可以将其发送给您，以便您可以阅读一些。
 但当我们谈论保护经济适用房时，我们通常指的是限制负担能力。
 许多限制即将到期。
 因此，信托和 CPC 致力于扩大单位的负担能力，以使其在很长一段时间内或在使用 CPA 资金的情况下永久保持负担能力。
 这是阿默斯特的一个例子。
 所以这不是信任，不是由信任驱动的，这是注册会计师，因为他们团结一致。
 但这是阿默斯特的一个开发项目，拥有 41 个经济适用房。
 它们快要过期了。
 他们只有 15 年的限制。
 我认为这是一种大众住房金融产品，当时的业主对扩大负担能力不感兴趣。
 社区对这些单位的损失非常关注。
 他们联系了 MHP 并收到了一份沟通计划。
 呃，我突然忘记开发者了。
 一家大型开发商与 Beacon 接洽，该开发商在 40B 和 Beacon 社区拥有低收入住房税收抵免方面的经验。
 事实上，Beacon当时就与业主洽谈购买该项目。
 因此，社区决定存入 125 万美元的 CPA 资金，以便这 41 套公寓现在永远可以负担得起。
 这就是为什么一些信托机构正在关注即将过期的可访问性限制并参与讨论。
 有时这意味着与中共或规划部门合作。
 但也有一些信托机构正在关注这一点。
 因此，如果这对信托来说是一个合适的角色，他们可能会考虑这一点。
 是的。
 而且还是要预约的。
 是的，继续吧。
 一个关于这个的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2680.813s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Èske antite minisipal yo pral avize lè restriksyon sou aksè ekspire?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2689.419s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Donk gen yon lis ke CDAC jere, ou kapab, m ap voye l ba ou.
 Lè sa a, gen yon lis ak kèk enfòmasyon sa yo.
 Sa a se tou yon bagay ou ta dwe gen kontwòl lokal sou pou lojman abòdab.
 Si ou se Medford, yon moun ka deja ap fè sa.
 Wi, akòz gwosè kominote a, anjeneral gen yon moun ki deja peye atansyon sou li.
 Se poutèt sa, li dwe disponib pou ou.
 Wi.
 Gwo, mèsi.
 Wi, pwoteksyon se tou yon pati nan anpeche domaj epi tou antoure anvlòp bilding lan.
 Sa a se yon egzanp nan Gloucester kote yon inite nan bilding lan te fèmen akòz yon koule, do kay la te koule ak wotè a bezwen bese.
 yo te itilize
 Gen kèk fon CPA, kidonk yo ap mande kèk lajan CPA pou konplete fon fòmil modènizasyon eta a pou ranplase do kay la.
 Lè sa a, ak lòt inite ki riske vin inabitab, yo te itilize kèk nan rezève lajan CPA yo, ansanm ak lòt fon leta, pou ranplase twati yo.
 Se poutèt sa, sa a se yon egzanp lojman ki kalifye pou prezèvasyon nan yon kay ki egziste deja kreye oswa achte ak lajan ki pa CPA.
 Gen yon varyete aktivite ki konsidere kòm akseptab ak sipò.
 Menm bagay la tou pou trusts.
 Se konsa, nan travay pre-devlopman, si ou gen yon moso tè minisipal ke ou enterese itilize pou lojman abòdab, ou ka itilize kèk nan resous ki soti nan fon an fè kèk travay pre-devlopman epi ede prepare yon demann pou pwopozisyon.
 Ou ka itilize resous trust pou mete ajou plan lojman ou, epi èd pou lokasyon yo otorize ekspreseman dapre règleman CPA.
 Sa a se tou yon bagay ke konfyans ka patisipe nan.
 Pandan pandemi an, se te aktyèlman lojman lajan konfyans nan anpil kominote ki aktyèlman inisye ak finanse asistans pou lokasyon ijans.
 Nou wè anpil kominote, anpil trust k ap fè kalite travay sa a.</p>

 Se konsa, li anfòm ak plis nan kalite estanda ke nou wè

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2880.463s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Yon kesyon an patikilye ki te soulve avèk nou se si li ta ka itilize, pou egzanp, pou relasyon oswa kontak rechèch ede kreye yon lòt sous revni pou konfyans nan.</p>

 Mwen vle di, ou ta ka fè agiman opoze a, tankou, se yon pwogram pwodiksyon lojman nesesèman pral fè sa?
 Mwen vle di, sa ta dwe mennen nan sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2921.342s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Se konsa, kesyon an plis se, si fon yo CPA, patikilyèman si fon yo CPA yo se fon byen imobilye, ka fon yo CPA dwe itilize pou objektif sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2932.652s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Non, mwen pa panse ke fon CPA ka itilize pou objektif sa a, non.
 Si mwen te gen lòt resous, petèt mwen ta ka konsidere li, paske si mwen te fè, mwen vle di, mwen panse ke li toujou trè lwen-chache e mwen sèten mwen ta di rès kominote a.
 Se konsa, mwen prefere panse offline, non, si w ap anrejistre sa a ak tout bagay, mwen pa vle chichote, mwen vle yo dwe plis reflechi.
 Men, mwen definitivman pa panse ke fon CPA ka itilize pou anyen fè rechèch sou obligasyon.
 Non, paske sa tou senpleman pa satisfè egzijans yon CPA.
 sa a se pa sou
 Rechèch ki jan yo finanse yon konfyans konsa se pa ka a, non.
 Si w gen lòt resous, petèt nou ka reflechi sou li, oswa mwen jis vle poze w kèk kesyon pou fè w reflechi sou li.
 Okenn nan nou pa ofisye polis ki fè konfyans, kidonk, ou konnen, li fèt lokalman.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle poze kèk kesyon oswa bagay yo reflechi sou ak Lè sa a, ou mesye kalkile li pou tèt ou.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2994.087s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Lè w panse sou sa offline, Sherry, li ta koute $80,000 pou fè yon etid lyen pou ajoute yon eleman lojman pòtab nan pousantaj kosyon nou yo.
 Se konsa, devlopè yo pral finanse pak ak espas ouvè, sekirite piblik, epi nou vle fè yon etid relasyon pou yo ka kòmanse envesti nan katriyèm gwoup la, ki se lojman abòdab.
 Link offline atravè li depi mwen etabli koneksyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3026.65s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Briyan.
 Èske mwen ka ajoute yon kesyon swivi?
 Konpreyansyon mwen genyen sou fon CPA se.
 Pou jwenn sipò, li dwe sipòte kreyasyon yon nouvo ekonomi aksesib.
 Wi, mwen konprann ke CPA gen rapò ak inite lojman oswa rezidans.
 Se konsa, mwen menm tou enstenktif te panse ke sa a ta dwe yon dezavou nan etid la NEXUS, men mwen te konnen pwoblèm nan te louvri, kidonk mwen jis te vle asire w ke nou adrese li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3458.679s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mèsi.
 Penny, sipòte pa Lisa Ann.
 Tout moun dakò?
 Wi.
 Tout moun ki kontre?
 Penny, mèsi anpil pou prezante tèt ou.
 Ou se vis prezidan nou.
 Felisitasyon.
 Mèsi.
 Parey mon’n dir, sa prosen lo azanda se kreasyon en group travay.
 Nou gen premye gwoup travay nou an, Deklarasyon konfyans.
 Kayla, mèsi anpil paske w te volontè pou w ekri deklarasyon konfyans nou an.
 Nenpòt moun ki vle rantre nan gwoup sa a?
 Tcheke sa ki ekri.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3506.416s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Sa a ta ka ede.
 Mwen pa konnen konbyen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3512.3s">[Moogoor]</a>: Mwen devine li depann de kominote a, men apeprè 10 paj oswa mwens.
 Se vre wi.
 Men, nou konprann sa k ap pase nan kominote vwazen yo epi nou ka travay sou li.
 Konseye legal nou an, KP Law, pral sètènman gade nan pwoblèm nan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3532.245s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi, mèsi.

 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3552.74s">[Unidentified]</a>: Nan pwochen reyinyon an nou pral pataje bouyon an pou tout moun ka fè kòmantè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3557.504s">[Moogoor]</a>: Dezyèm gwoup travay la se Trust Action Plan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3576.11s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gen yon maksimòm 3 volontè sou 4.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3578.611s">[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Mwen gen yon kesyon sou gwoup travay sa a, si mwen kapab.
 Alors, ki mannyer sa plan daksyon i enkorpor sa 2 ou 3 lobzektif ki Minis Lasante fek mansyonnen e revizyon plan prodiksyon lozman?
 这是行动计划的一部分还是行动计划其中之一？
 project.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3598.419s">[Moogoor]</a>: Sa a se yon pati nan plan daksyon kote gwoup travay la pral revize plan pwodiksyon lojman an epi answit idantifye objektif ki konsistan avèk plan pwodiksyon lojman an epi answit potansyèlman idantifye objektif mezirab tankou kote MHC a ta dwe rete sou yon sèl sit.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3614.329s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Etabli yon konfyans se yon objektif, dwa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3615.91s">[Moogoor]</a>: Deklarasyon konfyans?
 Non, se enstitisyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3622.133s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.
 Sa a pral youn nan objektif nou yo.
 Wi.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3626.937s">[Moogoor]</a>: Oke, wi, wi, wi.
 Epi ekri yon deklarasyon misyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3633.323s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.
 Depi w ap ekri yon deklarasyon konfyans, ou vle angaje yo nan tou de.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3642.631s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Petèt mwen pral kòmanse ak yon non responsabilite nou.
 Mwen pral mete l nan plas li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3651.308s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Paske se sèl bagay Roberta fè nan tou de pati.
 Donk se Roberta, Penny ak Lisanne.
 Èske li sèlman sipòte twa moun sa yo?
 Èske tout moun dakò?
 Briyan.
 Mèsi tout moun pou volontè ou.
 Nou kapab diskite sou aranjman reyinyon yo pou premye ak dezyèm gwoup yo.
 Konbyen tan gwoup travay la espere rankontre nan yon mwa?
 Gwoup travay yo ka rankontre nòmalman an pèsòn, selon disponiblite manm yo ak fleksibilite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3686.928s">[Moogoor]</a>: Wi, Kayla ak mwen ka diskite sou li epi baze sou prezantasyon ou a, nou ka rankontre anvan pwochen reyinyon an.
 Wi.
 Gwoup Travay, Gwoup Travay 2, èske w konfòtab kowòdone pami manm yo?
 Konbyen fwa ou ta renmen rankontre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3703.735s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Oke, li difisil pou di.
 Nou ta ka bezwen, um, pou mwen, mwen vle di, omwen yon fwa pou kòmanse, ak Lè sa a, petèt, um, yon fwa pa mwa oswa yon fwa chak de semèn ta ase paske ta gen bagay tankou ekri li tèt ou ak Lè sa a, rankontre ak gwoup la.
 Se konsa, mwen koute. Mwen jis vle asire w ke mwen tande li kòrèkteman.
 Wi.
 Pi gwo pase mwens pase 1 depann de konbyen vit nou vle ekri li.
 Se poutèt sa, kantite yo ka limite.
 Nou bezwen gen yon reyinyon pou fè yon plan.
 Se konsa, èske nou fè sa nan yon ti kantite tan?
 Oswa èske l ap pran nou mwa pou nou fini travay la?
 Sa a se reyèlman li.
 Kidonk, èske li gen sans pou nou rankontre an septanm epi retounen an oktòb pou nou fè plan pou konbyen tan? Paske li ba nou tan pou nou konprann epi revize orè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3774.266s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi,wi wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi,wi wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi,wi wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi,wi wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi, wi,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3800.141s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Konbyen tan ak konbyen rapid nou vle gen yon plan aksyon an plas?
 Ki objektif nou pou konplete plan aksyon an?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3812.427s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Pwobableman tout moun gen yon travay aplentan, kidonk nou pa ka fè sa sof si absoliman nesesè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3817.449s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Kidonk, èske gen yon solisyon ki mande pou nou travay bak?
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon bagay nou ka fè
 Mwen pa vle fikse yon lòt delè kounye a paske nou gen diferan orè isit la.
 Men, sa Shirley ap di se pran tan w epi reflechi byen.
 Mwen se yon moun ki renmen konnen ki sa nou pral fè epi apre sa kòmanse kraze etap yo ak Lè sa a, wè konbyen tan li pran pou fè li.
 Mwen pa vle prepare pou yon bagay nou pa prepare pou.
 Ou pral kapab deplase.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3857.917s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: Mwen jis vle klarifye, plan aksyon an gen ladan deklarasyon misyon an ak objektif nou yo, dwa?
 Kidonk mwen panse ke gen bagay ki ka vini anvan lòt bagay ke mwen panse ke nou ka pale sou yo nan reyinyon yo epi prezante bay gwoup la kòm si se yon objektif konplè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3871.103s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Apre sa, dijere plan nou genyen yo, plan pwodiksyon nou genyen yo, ak ki jan nou kraze sa a epi divize li an etap aksyon.
 Yon ane oswa de pral di ou sa ki enposib.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3893.254s">[Moogoor]</a>: Kèk kominote ki ekri plan aksyon kontakte kominote yo epi enplike yo nan ekri plan aksyon, ki pran plis tan.
 Gen kèk kominote ki chwazi pa enplike okenn moun ki gen enterè oswa kominote yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3911.609s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3914.921s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Apre sa, nou gen aplikasyon CPA a.
 Travay sa a dwe byento, kidonk nou bezwen konplete li.
 Mwen pral remèt li bay Aditi epi ann bay yon apèsi sou aplikasyon li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3950.636s">[Moogoor]</a>: Donk, an jeneral, nou gen kat pwojè.
 Kòm Sherry mansyone, pou klarifye, sa yo se devlopman epi yo pa pwojè.
 Se poutèt sa, kesyon an premye se si yo devlope lojman abòdab nan vil yo.
 Mwen jis vle konnen sa ou panse.
 Se konsa, gen de sitiyasyon.
 Senaryo youn, nou ka jwenn pi pre lojman kolektif.
 Yo gen yon pwogram sibvansyon yo rele Housing Production Planning Grant.
 Mwen te gen yon reyinyon avèk yo Vandredi pase a pou wè si Medford ta kalifye paske yo te di sou sit entènèt yo ke sèlman vil pòtay ka aplike.
 Medford elijib epi li aksepte aplikasyon sou yon baz woule.
 Lè konfyans nan pare pou aplike, nou ka ale pi devan epi aplike li.
 Se poutèt sa yo finanse pwojè atravè asistans teknik.
 Pwojè yo koute $50,000 a $100,000, selon gwosè devlopman lojman abòdab.
 Sa a mande pou 10% nan kontrepati lokal la.
 Se konsa, li ta itil si nou mande yon match lokal pou fon CPA.
 Dezyèm senaryo a se ke si nou kapab jwenn yon sibvansyon, nou ka oblije konte sou finansman CPA.
 Ankò, chak pwojè koute anviwon $50,000 pou $100,000.
 Nenpòt panse sou sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4055.882s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Alor mon anvi zis fer sir ki sa, eskize, i pran en letan pour deal avek sa, alor mon anvi asire ki mon konpran.
 Premye ka a se ke ak èd lojman, gen yon obligasyon pou kapab akeri, pou kapab devlope tè sou tè ke vil la deja posede, pou devlope lojman, tè ke vil la posede.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4083.821s">[Moogoor]</a>: Jwenn asistans teknik pou yo ka ede nou atravè tout pwosesis evalyasyon vil la pou sit la, answit fè travay pre-devlopman an, epi ekri RFP la.
 Wi, mèsi.
 Lè sa a, pwojè de se sipòte konstriksyon an nan nouvo lojman abòdab.
 Sa a se yon sijesyon trè jeneral, men si ou gen nenpòt lòt lide sou sa a, nou ka mete yo, men nou jis espere ke nou ka jwenn pwojè sa yo sou tè a.
 Twazyèm pwojè a se pou konstwi yon fèm pou achte tè jan li vin disponib.
 Katriyèm, asistans pou peye anba.
 Mwen panse ke Lisa te pote sa a, men jis pou klarifye, North Suburban Consortium ke nou fè pati gen yon pwogram asistans peman anba.
 Nan senk ane ki sot pase yo, yo te patwone jiska senk rezidan Medford.
 Yo ofri, mwen jis te vle wè ki kantite lajan yo ofri, jiska $10,000.
 Wi, Roberta te fè kèk kòmantè sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4167.389s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Wi, mwen pa fin sèten si lajan CPA yo ka itilize pou kalite asistans pou peman anba, men nan egzanp plan pou peman anba a Shelly te bay pi wo a, yo ka itilize CPA pou plan peman an.
 Men, mwen jis modènize reflete sa nou sot analize nan app a.
 Petèt ou ka sèvi ak sa a kòm yon egzanp olye de yon pwojè.
 Sa yo se egzanp ki kalite pwojè nou ta ka fè paske nou poko gen plan an plas.
 Verite a se, nou pa gen okenn lide kisa pou nou fè ak lajan yo.
 Men, ou ta ka di sa yo se jis egzanp.
 Apati Housing Production Plan, sa i bann fason potansyel ki nou kapab servi sa finansman e nou ava devlop en plan pou gid nou e nou ava donn sa komite avek TPC avan ki sa finansman i ganny servi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4232.912s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Menm bagay la rive ak peman an desann.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4235.983s">[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Èske yo pa gen yon pwogram bonis pou peye anba oswa èske Northern Suburbs Consortium la trè espesifik?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4246.051s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Se poutèt sa, CPA a te egzije nou bay finansman an echanj pou restriksyon alontèm alontèm.
 Se poutèt sa, asistans pou peye anba $5,000 oswa $10,000 se yon kado sèlman epi li pa bezwen rachte.
 Finansman CPA dwe gen yon kontrepati.
 Nou dwe jwenn yon restriksyon sou papye pou nou kalifye.
 Men, sa a se pa ka a, ak restriksyon sou ekri pa nesesèman bezwen pèmanan.
 Ou ka fè sa pou yon tan long.
 Se konsa, ou ta ka fè yon restriksyon sou 25 ane oswa 20 ane, men pa nesesèman
 Lè mwen li sa a, se Nò, Konsèy Sekirite Nasyonal la, e lè mwen te fè rekòmandasyon sa a, lide mwen te pi gwo pase sa Konsèy Sekirite Nasyonal la t ap fè, paske A, ou ta sèlman bay rezidan Medford, achte nan vil Medford, Konsèy Sekirite Nasyonal limite revni a 80% nan AMI, CPA a pèmèt ou ale jiska 100% nan AMI, ak moun ki gen revni modere,
 Moun ki aje ki gen plis pase 81 an toujou gen difikilte pou achte.
 Se konsa, poukisa pa mete lajan sa yo disponib pou fanmi ki gen plis revni?
 Si nou bay plis, sa pral definitivman pran 20 ane. Divizyon dis mil pral fè plis pase sa.
 Men, mwen panse tou ke si nou pral mete egzanp nan asistans pou peye anba sou aplikasyon an, nou ta dwe tou enkli egzanp nan asistans pou lokasyon sou aplikasyon an.
 Mwen te panse sou lwe epi mande sou asistans pou lokasyon, men CPC sanble deja ap ofri asistans pou lokasyon.
 Lè m 'te panse sou sa a, te gen yon panse, ou konnen, ki sa mwen te panse sou
 Mwen abitye travay nan vil la epi yo ofri dezan èd pou lokasyon.
 Yo fè prevansyon.
 Yo fè tout bagay.
 Mwen panse ke sa a pral kontinye atravè CPC ak pafwa.
 Oke, yon kesyon se, ou konnen, si sa a se yon kesyon sou lavni an.
 Paske nou pa gen fon lojman abòdab, òganizasyon yo ale dirèkteman nan Pati Kominis Chinwa a pou lajan an.
 Men, petèt Medford pral devlope plis tankou Somerville, kote tout asistans lojman ale nan Fon Lojman Abòdab olye de CPC.
 Se konsa, nou ka oswa nou pa ka deplase nan direksyon sa a.
 Petèt mwen pral sèvi ak sa a kòm yon egzanp: Se poutèt sa nou bezwen gen yon plan.
 Mwen pral sèvi ak sa kòm yon egzanp, men se pa nesesèman sa nou pral fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4431.76s">[Moogoor]</a>: Kidonk, konsènan pwogram asistans dantè a, èske mwen ta dwe ajoute kèk lang ki baze sou pwogram asistans dantè aktyèl CCP finanse a?
 Sa yo se kèk nan yo, wi, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4453.116s">[Theresa Dupont]</a>: Wi, mwen jis vle di mwen ka pataje lang sa a avèk ou pou nou ka itilize li pou konekte.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4459.638s">[Moogoor]</a>: Mèsi.
 Èske gen lòt egzanp ou ta renmen bay san konte depans pèsonèl yo?
 Roberta te fè kèk kòmantè sou twazyèm kesyon an, kidonk mwen pral mete ajou.
 Nou bezwen detèmine itilizasyon apwopriye ki pèmèt pa CPA a.
 Se konsa, premye egzanp, bati lojman abòdab sou sit ki an sekirite, ta dwe undercreation epi yo pa sipò.
 Egzanp de se kreyasyon, men egzanp twa se akizisyon, ki se akizisyon pwopriyete oswa akeri tè atravè fon CPA.
 Se poutèt sa, nan egzanp kat, asistans peman anba ta dwe sipòte.
 Egzanp senk oswa senk se: Asistans pou lokasyon yo pral sipòte tou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4524.241s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4524.982s">[Moogoor]</a>: Wi.
 Mwen jis pase sa a ba ou, men si ou gen nenpòt kòmantè, tanpri ou lib pou kontakte mwen.
 Nou ap mande $250,000.
 Ak kèk enfòmasyon jeneral sou kèk nan sous finansman posib nou pral eksplore.
 Youn nan yo se gwo sibvansyon pou lojman.
 Dezyèm lan se nou ap travay pou konekte lojman abòdab.
 Nou poko jwenn finansman.
 E sa trwazyenm parti i en developer ki pe devlop en proze lakaz.
 MDDC (Komisyon Devlopman Mystic Valley) te dakò pou kontribye $250,000 nan pwojè a.
 Men, nou toujou bezwen anrejistre akò a, ke nou espere konplete o pli vit posib.
 Lè sa a, fon an pral eksplore lòt sous potansyèl de finansman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4611.952s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: Wi, moun ki fè demann lan nan paj ou sot vizite a nan paj 11 la gen yon erè òtograf.

 Mwen mande sou lòt bagay nou bezwen sipò finansye pou yo.
 Èske nou te janm soumèt yon aplikasyon Sibvansyon Dirab ki sanble pou lojman abòdab?
 Se konsa, petèt kòm yon pwojè dekarbonizasyon pou nenpòt inite lojman, oswa kòm yon nouvo do kay, ak Lè sa a, mwen tou mete solè sou li.
 Èske sa se yon bagay nou fè?
 Si wi, èske nou di la a ke se tankou yon sinerji monetè ke nou genyen?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4690.425s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: Li ta bon pou mete l nan plan nou yo, men li ka twò bonè pou mete l nan aplikasyon sa a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4697.69s">[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Yeah, mwen jis pa konnen si nou gen lòt finansman ke nou ap konsidere oswa lòt sibvansyon ke nou deja genyen ke nou poko konsidere.</p>
