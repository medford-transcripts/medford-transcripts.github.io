 所有反对的人？
 六项肯定，一项缺席。
 会议记录获得批准。
 如果我们中有人使用 Zoom，我们就必须使用 Zoom，因为我们都在。
 我们有马萨诸塞州住房合作伙伴在这里介绍经济适用房信托基金。
 我想邀请 MHP 的 Shelly Goren，我必须代表她发言，为我们提供有关保障性住房信托基金的一对一培训。
 雪莉与社区和非营利组织合作，支持经济适用房的倡议和开发。
 他主要帮助社区建立和运营市经济适用住房基金。
 她是该州建立和利用住房基金以及直接或通过住房基金将《社区保护法》资金应用于经济适用房的社区专家之一。
 谢谢雪莉同意为我们提供这次培训。
 我会把它传递给你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=212.689s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 绝对地。
 非常感谢。
 很高兴今晚能和大家在一起。
 我想知道我是否有机会分享。
 等一下，雪莉。
 我现在就做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=222.313s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 出色的。
 今晚，正如您所分享的，我将指出成员特里·韦弗出席了会议，因此今晚我们有一个完整的委员会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=233.155s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 太棒了，恭喜。
 我希望这种情况经常发生。
 所以我会回顾一些。
 关于经济适用房信托基金的基本知识。
 当然，我认识到你们中的一些人可能比其他人知道得更多。
 这就是为什么我不想让任何人觉得我说得不好。
 我只是想确保我不会认为事情是理所当然的或做出假设。
 我将在这里向您展示一些幻灯片。
 好的，你能看一下幻灯片吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=271.64s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=272.921s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 我是 Shelly Gary，我与 MHP 大众住房协会合作，在全州的社区工作，帮助建立经济适用住房信托基金章程的批准，并努力帮助受托人启动和运行。
 对于那些可能不太熟悉 MHP（大众住房合作伙伴关系）的人来说，我们是马萨诸塞州的一个准州机构，其目标是努力增加全州经济适用房的供应和获得经济适用房的机会。
 我们有几种不同的方式来完成这一使命。
 我们有一个住房数据中心，所以我们有一小群人来收集、分析和分享
 数据有助于制定有效的政策。
 他们还创建了一些非常棒的在线工具供社区使用。
 我们有一个社区外展团队，我也是其中的一员，我们与当地社区以及住房当局和非营利开发商进行了大量合作，以帮助建立当地支持经济适用房的能力。
 创建和维护经济适用住房。
 我们的贷款团队已贷款超过 14 亿美元用于建设和维护经济适用房。
 然后，我们有一个住房所有权团队，正在努力帮助增加全州低收入和中等收入家庭获得住房的机会。
 今晚，我们将从住房信托基金法规的一些基础知识开始，然后根据全州许多社区的工作，更深入地了解运营和最佳实践。
 我们学到了一些东西，然后我们将深入研究符合条件的活动，即您可以负担得起的事情类型。
 住房信托基金，如果我说得太快或者有什么不清楚的话，我很乐意被打断。
 我会在每个部分之后停下来问问题，但如果我不理解这个主题，请随时请某人阻止我，或者你可以举手，我会尽力弄清楚。
 但我很高兴在此期间被打扰。
 我不需要成为那个说很长时间然后再说话的人。
 首先是一些基础知识，您可能已经知道这一点，但市保障性住房信托基金的法规是根据《普通大众法》第 44 章第 55C 条制定的。
 这是你的公开会议。
 与其他梅德福议会一样，它是一个公共实体。
 它由当地立法机构市议会创建。
 事实上，关注的焦点相当有限。
 其目标是为中低收入家庭创造和保留经济适用住房。
 它由当地任命的董事会管理。
 因为你是一个公共委员会，所以你要遵守公共合同、设计师选择、利益冲突和公开会议法，就像所有其他市政委员会一样。
 从广义上讲，作为信托，您可以满足经济适用房的需求。
 您可以支持地方对住房的控制举措并进入房地产市场。
 因此，您可以买卖房产，也可以帮助开发商购买经济适用房的房产。
 您可以及时做出决定，因为除非您的法令中另有规定，否则您无需去市议会即可做出决定。
 您可以从不同的来源筹集资金。
 因此，我们看到社区在努力为经济适用房筹集资金，特别是为了他们的信任方面，比五年前或十年前变得更有创造力。
 该法规非常简短，规定性也不是很强。
 再次强调，你应该注意你的法令，看看你是否没有完全阅读它。您应该阅读当地法令，了解梅德福市议会如何添加一些指导。
 但法规只规定至少有五名受托人。
 它应该包括首席执行官。
 事实上，它甚至没有指明指定的人，尽管一些社区认为这是允许的。
 受托人由市长任命，其中通常包括市议会。
 它是特别委员会，任期两年。
 许多社区会将他们错开，这样他们就不会同时加入，而我们经常与其他非营利组织董事会一起这样做。
 策展人是公共代理人。
 你们是特别的市政官员，与其他议会类似。
 该法规列出了 16 项明确的权力。
 抱歉，您介意我们问一个问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=556.382s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 下一个。
 对不起。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=560.004s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 所以你提到我们是特殊的市政雇员。
 我们是特殊的市政雇员还是只是公共代理人？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=570.71s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 公共代理人，抱歉。
 哎呀。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=573.771s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=574.932s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 抱歉，也许我说错了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=578.594s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=583.699s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  So the statute gives 16 explicit powers.
 These are just some of the big ones of accepting and receiving real property, purchase and retain real or personal property, selling, leasing, exchanging.
 The statute also allows for additional powers to be given to the trust in line with the statute.
 And we do have communities that modify the powers so again, you just want to make sure that you're paying attention to your local ordinance in case the city council did.
 add some restrictions in some communities.
 It might require a certain percentage of the trustees for certain decisions.
 Borrowing seems to have some of the most restrictions about how much a trust can borrow or who has some guidance about that.
 So just make sure that you're paying attention to your ordinance.
 So those are just some very, very basics.
 Getting into operations and best practices.
 So one of the things that we're seeing is that there are more ways that communities are funding their trust today than even just five years ago, five or six years ago.
 So a variety of different ways.
 So certainly the Community Preservation Act is one of the most common and about almost 80% of
 trust communities also have CPA, but it's not a given in every community that
 The trust receives CPA funds every year, or it's not necessarily a set amount every year.
 So it's not necessarily a funding source that every community can count on outside of Cambridge and Somerville for the most part.
 But CPA is a common one.
 Inclusionary zoning in some communities, the inclusionary zoning bylaw or ordinance directs any in lieu of payments to go to the trust.
 And in some communities, it's even like in Swampscot, the trust actually determines what the payment is, what the formula is.
 We have one community in the Cape that has a cell phone tower and the lease payments go to their trust.
 It's not a lot of money.
 It's a small amount, but it's something that they can count on each year.
 We have communities that transfer funds from free cash from the general fund to their trust.
 So Truro, Brookline are communities that have done that multiple times.
 We have one community that we know of that has a municipal bond Medfield established their trust and then they voted to allow for a million dollar bond to see the trust and I don't think that they've drawn on it yet I don't think that they've used it but they do have those resources.
 If they wanted to.
 Or leans on the Cape has established their trust several years ago now and they also voted for a tax override of $275,000 and they see that as a permanent tax override.
 They're the only trust that I know of that's been able to access a line of credit at a bank because they do have this consistent funding source.
 There can be donations to the trust of land or cash.
 There may be developer negotiated fees.
 You need to be very careful with how you do this.
 But we do have a community that received from a friendly 40 B home ownership development.
 They received funds that then the select board directed to the trust.
 Some communities are looking at short-term rental fees and using some of these funds for their trust and or affordable housing development.
 Of course, you likely have heard about real estate transfer fee, the hope of having a real estate transfer fee in the state.
 And communities are still working towards that, even though it didn't end up in the bond bill this year.
 And I hear communities talk about taxes for the marijuana.
 from sales of marijuana, I haven't heard any actually using that at this point.
 So there are a variety of ways, there could be also a special bylaw or ordinance payments that could be directed to the trust.
 And I think there are a couple examples of that.
 So there are a variety of ways that communities are trying to raise additional resources to fund affordable housing.
 As a new trust starting out, we really encourage you to, I'm sorry, I forgot to look this up.
 Do you have a current housing production plan?
 or housing needs than you do.
 So we would really encourage you to be reviewing this, to be familiar with this.
 Some of you likely are more than others, but to really understand the identified needs in the community and to be able to really engage in conversations about that and talk with people about that.
 And to start as a board, to start with those identified needs when you start thinking about setting priorities
 and what you're going to focus on as a board.
 You could also create benchmarks you don't have to but Somerville is a community where their trust is actually written into their ordinance that a certain amount of the resources are to go to lowest income households I think it's under 50% of the area median income.
 So to make sure that they're not just funding at 80% or 100%, but that they are investing in housing for much lower income households.
 So you could create benchmarks like that.
 If there was a particular value that was important at a particular time, you don't have to.
 But we are really encouraging trusts to do some groundwork, to not just jump in, but to really think about what your niche is in the community and how you're going to operate as a board.
 Another part is just using other resources to familiarize yourself with local housing needs.
 So this is Datatown, and some of you likely use Datatown, but it's a resource that MHP developed years ago.
 And there are a lot of different data points for communities all across the state.
 And so on the left, this is just the housing units by building type in Medford.
 And you see that you have a housing diversity that's decent, particularly compared to
 probably I think most other communities in the state, you do have some multifamily housing, which is fantastic.
 On the right, it just gives you a glimpse of the housing burden in Medford.
 So the top is renter households and the bottom is home ownership.
 homeowners, and this is likely in your housing production plan as well, but this is a typical pattern where renters tend to be, there tends to be a greater percentage of renters that are housing cost burdened.
 The greenish color, the 19.2% are households that are spending at least 30% of their gross income on housing.
 And then the blue, the 18.9 are households that are severely cost burdened and they're spending at least 50% of their
 The gross income on housing and then homeowners are are down below.
 So at this point.
 Doing a lot of reading and research and just really getting a handle on the housing needs in the community is a is our first suggestion for trust new trust.
 You can also do a little bit of work learning about affordable housing finance, not to become experts.
 It's very complicated and it's not your job to be experts, but to have a bit more familiarity because of course, the whole point of having a trust is to help support the creation and preservation of affordable housing.
 So we have some tools on the housing toolbox, which is another resource that MHP helps to maintain.
 We have different trainings that have talked through
 financing affordable housing development, we also have a couple that give the developers perspective of how that a developer puts together an affordable housing deal and the way that local communities can support them.
 Another thing that I encourage trust to consider is to invite a developer to come 20 year meetings to talk through
 pro forma with you to help you understand the overall process.
 Again, not to become experts, but just to be more familiar and more comfortable with the process and to learn about the importance of the role of a local trust and local resources and when developers really need those in order to go to the state for state and federal resources.
 So Beverly is a community where they invited two developers, a nonprofit, a community development corporation, as well as the local Habitat branch to come and share, go through a pro forma and talk about their process and what it takes for them to put together a housing deal.
 Winchester recently invited a for-profit developer,
 A man who had been with a larger developer and he's gone out on his own and he has a lot of experience and he came and talked through a recent development and help the trust just better understand the process and and their role in supporting development.
 So those are a couple different things that you can be doing to learn a bit more about affordable housing finance.
 And then once you feel a bit comfortable with, you don't necessarily, this doesn't have to be linear, it can happen at the same time, but once you are feeling fairly comfortable with kind of the needs in the community and you're starting to think about the niche for your board, we really encourage you to create a mission statement if you haven't done this already.
 to really put out there clearly for yourself, but also for the community of how you see your role in the community.
 So just to, I'm sure that probably all of you have been involved in mission statements in one way or another and in different boards and organizations over the years, but something succinct and that ultimately talks about what you do, how you do it, and who you do it for.
 And I just put up Amherst, but
 There's really what they what strikes me about theirs is that they are kind of reiterating that they're an instrument of local government of town government.
 And really, their goal is to their mission is to promote identified priorities in the town.
 So they really wanted kind of collaborative language.
 And you'll if you haven't already, you can figure out what what makes sense for Medford.
 And then we're suggesting that trust spend a little bit of time doing some work considering goals and strategies for your board.
 And really the reason why I've come to this is because I've worked in so many communities over the years and the trust oftentimes will feel pressure to jump in and just do something, to accomplish something.
 There's oftentimes a lot of external pressure or municipal pressure to do something.
 It oftentimes leads to, in my opinion, really a paralysis almost, because the housing needs are so great in all of our communities, the resources are really limited.
 So I'm really encouraging trust to take some time, even if there's external pressure to do something, but take some time to really think through.
 Given what you know about the needs in the community, given the limited resources that you have, what is your niche and what are two or three key things that you're going to focus on in the next few years?
 And really pushing trust to make these measurable goals, smart goals, so that there's really a way to measure how you're
 how you're moving forward.
 Oftentimes, housing production plans have goals that are really general, very, very broad.
 It's like increase the supply of senior housing, age-restricted housing, and it's just so big.
 So I'm really encouraging you to start with your housing production plan, start with what's already been identified, and then from that, really dig into
 focus on two or three key things and write your goals to be measurable.
 And then once you have those goals that are measurable, then work on strategies under each of those goals.
 And then from that, you can really dig into the tasks to be delegating to each other and to be moving things forward.
 But in some cases, this can be a process that takes a few months or six months.
 And I'm just really encouraging trust.
 If that's what it takes, then take that time.
 It doesn't mean you can't be doing some things at the same time, of course, but I think it's best early on.
 And then periodically after that to really be thoughtful and very specific about what you're trying to do so that you don't get into the point of spinning your wheels because we all know that the needs are great and the resources are very limited.
 So I'm just going to give an example of one community.
 This is itty bitty little well fleet out on Cape Cod and they their trust their new trust decided that their niche really was going to be about development and increasing the supply of new housing affordable housing in town.
 year-round housing.
 And so they came up with two goals, two measurable goals.
 One, create 100 units of low-moderate income rental and home ownership housing units over the next five years.
 And so Wellfleet is a community that has less than 5,000 residents year-round, so a very small community.
 So 100 units over five years is actually pretty ambitious for such a tiny little community.
 And then they are second goal raise $1,000,000 annually for 5 years for $5,000,000.
 And this is very ambitious for such a tiny community, even though they may be a more affluent community, there's still a very small community.
 And then under each of those goals, they created specific strategies that they're.
 Working towards to create to get to their goal.
 So this is the kind of work that I'm suggesting that trust do and that I'm working with trust on just to hopefully help help trust really focus and to be effective.
 Another thing that we suggest is that you create guidelines and several trusts have this, but it's in one space putting together a variety of information about the trust and how the trust is going to function.
 One to help keep you focused, but really so that others and people who may come to you for funds that they can get this information in one place.
 So the kind of elements that may be in guidelines are mission statement, goals and strategies to put it in.
 put it there.
 Roles and responsibilities of the trust, if there's anything just to have a place where you're putting some of the general roles and responsibilities of the trust.
 Your priority or eligible funding activities, so the things that you really want to focus on funding.
 Any stipulations for funding, so if you have income limits,
 If you are only funding housing up to 80% of the area at median income because you want everything to be eligible for the subsidized housing inventory, or if you're going to 100%, if you want developments that are mixed income, if you have a requirement around how long units are affordable, if you have a minimum of 20 years or 30 years or in perpetuity,
 information about project monitoring and reporting your expectations of what you'll receive from developments that you fund, application process, selection criteria, what you're looking at in an application form, so that someone who wants to come to the trust for funding doesn't have to go in a variety of different places, that they can have one place that they're getting this information, learning about how you operate, and then, of course, this is a document that you want to review periodically and make sure that you keep up to date.
 And then we suggest early on that you make sure that you're having conversations across boards and possibly even with groups outside of municipal government if that seems appropriate.
 Just to make sure that you're clarifying rules early on, that you are having some conversation about how boards may work together or entities may work together, perhaps identifying places, ways to collaborate, and maybe even a conversation about who funds what.
 So what you see in front of you is just an exercise that Manchester by the Sea did within their housing production plan.
 And you might have something similar, but they created their housing strategies on the left, identified their housing strategies, determined that some are lower, or I'm sorry, shorter term, some are longer term.
 And then they identified the lead board on the right hand side or the couple lead boards.
 So, you know, one, it helps a little bit, hopefully, with not stepping on each other's toes, but it also hopefully creates some accountability for who is responsible for different strategies.
 I think that this kind of an exercise could include a housing authority, depending on your local housing authority.
 It could include a nonprofit organization that does a lot of housing work.
 It could look different in different communities, but we've seen in communities that a trust is established and this conversation doesn't happen and there ends up being tension between different boards.
 If there's a housing partnership or committee, then sometimes there's some tension of just not understanding roles.
 So we really encourage you to have those conversations early and often just to improve your efficiency in your community and really help to strengthen that kind of the housing infrastructure, your ability as a town, as a city to do housing, making sure that you're working, that you're in communication and not duplicating efforts.
 And then
 I just can't say enough to be as transparent as possible.
 Just don't make it difficult for people to understand what your housing trust is all about, what you're working on, what you're funding, who's involved in the work.
 So use the webpage to put your information out there, have your ordinance out there, who are the trustees, ways that they can maybe get in touch with you.
 When you do create goals and strategies put it out on the web page when you invest in different developments promote that.
 decide what boards, you really need to be in.
 communication with, regular communication with, and report back.
 Perhaps sometimes do joint board meetings, if that ever makes sense.
 And in some communities, they like joint board appointments, which it seems like maybe you have done as well, just to help with communication across boards.
 And make sure that the communication is in two directions, that if you have someone from a board that they're reporting back to kind of what that board's doing, if it's really relevant, at the same time that they're kind of reporting back to the board that they also sit on.
 So again, as much transparency as possible.
 We all know that housing development, particularly affordable housing development can be very controversial.
 So just don't create vacuums or spaces where people can make stories, fill it in with what they imagine, make it easy for them to find out what you're doing.
 And it kind of lastly in this section is one thing that you can be working on with other groups such as housing Medford and other boards, the housing authority is really helping to create a culture of support in Medford for affordable housing development.
 This is an idea that really came out of.
 someone who is from Amherst, this idea of culture of support and her acknowledging that they have different boards working collaboratively over a lot of years to help create this general, much broader support for affordable housing than many of our communities have.
 This is a resource that's now maybe seems a little bit dated.
 It's a little bit oldish, but it's I think it's really still fantastic.
 And it just is an effort to test housing messages and wondering why so many of them kind of backfire.
 And they came up with some really, I think, helpful insight.
 You can just Google.
 You don't have to live here.
 It's still out there.
 But it talks about things like balancing people with places and systems.
 We want to talk about the people that need affordable housing, but also what are the systems in place that make it difficult for people to access housing in our communities, telling the story of us and not just them, because we all have communities that rely on low and.
 Kind of middle moderate income jobs and so it's it's not just them it's us it's people in our community that need more affordable housing connecting housing to other social issues we we know with lots of research that.
 health outcomes improve educational outcomes improve when people have access to safe affordable housing.
 We know that where you live affects your outcomes and another thing I think can be helpful is to consider the language that you use how you talk about the need in the community and.
 how you talk about affordable housing.
 In this particular study, they tested home versus housing, and they found that people thought of housing as public housing.
 And in the housing world, we know that public housing is critical.
 It's a critical part of our housing infrastructure.
 But unfortunately, it has some negative connotations for some people.
 They also responded to housing as more of a commodity.
 And with home the word home, they thought more of their family and where they find themselves.
 So even just the way that with the words that we use can impact how people hear what we're saying.
 For me, I, I try, even though in the development world, it's.
 Housing developments are called projects that's just the language and development in the development world but I try really hard not to use projects and communities just because of the housing projects and just how negative that is for people I have people who bring up Cabrini green a very old.
 Huge development public housing development in in Chicago that's been redeveloped years ago and I still have people in communities and bring this development up as like their core idea of affordable housing so you know I tried to use development housing development or developing homes, instead of.
 project.
 So perhaps spending some time of just thinking through how you're going to frame and talk about the need in the community could potentially be helpful.
 And that could be something that you also do with other entities like, like Housing Medford.
 So I wanted to pause and just see if there are any thoughts or questions or feedback at this point.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=1976.232s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢你的介绍，查理。
 委员会有什么问题吗？
 也许只是一个问题。
 他举例说明了该基金的融资方式以及谁是该基金的一部分。
 您能否举例说明该基金如何与开发商合作在马萨诸塞州社区建造经济适用房？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2001.549s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 因此，我将在下一节中给出一些例子，因为我们看到更多地依赖于提供经济适用房，例如，抱歉，为经济适用房提供议会土地。
 我们看到人们对这一过程信心增强。
 在某些情况下，该市实际上正在将土地转让给信托基金，用于建造经济适用房。
 我们有很多信托为住房开发提供资金的例子。
 我们有很多示例，因此我们将在下一节中介绍其中一些示例。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2034.77s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 我以为演示已经结束了，抱歉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2038.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 不，没关系。
 不，不，对不起。
 所以现在我将介绍可以融资的项目类型，以及为什么《社区保护法》是信托用于资助住房的主要资源之一，因为有《社区保护法》，而且信托法规是在注册会计师 (CPA) 之后制定的，所以它确实是拥有注册会计师和社区，并拥有这些必须用于经济适用住房的资源，在某种程度上激发了市经济适用住房信托基金的法规。
 所以我将从一些语言开始，因为这些法规密切相关。
 因此，在 CPA 中，您可以使用这些动词“获取”、“创建”、“保留”、“支持”。
 并修复或修复，然后您就拥有了右侧的房子，这样您就可以使用注册会计师资金来购买、创建、保存和维护。
 对于修复和修复，如果单位是使用 CPA 资金购买或创建的，您可以使用 CPA 资金。
 因此，对于住房当局和尚未获得 CPA 资助的现有或现有经济适用房，情况会变得更加复杂。
 您不能使用 CPA 资金来恢复这些单位。
 它们确实必须是通过 CPA 创建或收购的单位。
 但我从这种类型的结构开始，然后给出一些关于它的例子。
 这是巴恩斯特布尔的一个住房开发项目的示例，该项目是一栋现有住宅。
 有些单位价格实惠，但并非全部。
 实际上，我应该说所有这些例子都是由注册会计师或信托基金资助的，但它们都可以由信托基金资助，因为这些法规在这一点上的联系如此紧密。
 信托法规最近进行了修改。
 事实上，已经有好几年了，但让所有具有注册会计师资格的社区住房活动都有资格获得该基金。
 这是一个收购的例子，当地资金被捐赠给非营利开发商 POA，以收购该开发项目。
 现在几乎所有单位都永远可以负担得起。
 其中一些人维持市场价格，因为有些家庭不符合收入要求，不想取代任何人，但用于购买现有住房的却是当地资金，现在这些住房大多是永远可以负担的。
 我们有各种有回购计划的信托。
 因此，小规模的住房所有权计划正在帮助符合收入资格的家庭在城市购买现有住房。
 它们的结构、方式也不同。
 据我所知，诺福克至少有一个案例，您的信托每年都会购买几栋房屋，像您在此处看到的照片一样朴素的房屋。
 然后他们做所有必要的修复工作，然后尝试将它们一起通过彩票出售。
 随着房价上涨，他们每年都在努力完成尽可能多的工作。
 他们尝试每年做三件事，我认为他们已经减少到了一到两次。
 但这是信托实际购买房屋的模式。
 我们还有其他模式，信托有助于促进向具有合格收入的家庭出售规模较小的房屋。
 然后，该信托基金会计算约定的销售价格与收入为该地区中位收入 80% 的家庭所能承受的价格之间的差额。
 然后我们至少有一个基金，他们有价值一定金额的代金券，他们会进行抽奖，比如说，他们有 50,000 美元的代金券，也许他们有 100,000 美元，所以他们有两张代金券，然后他们会进行抽奖，看看谁符合他们的收入水平。
 他们创造了该地区100%的平均收入，然后
 在抽奖中选择谁将收到其中一张代金券，然后该家庭将必须根据某些计划参数出去寻找房子。
 然后他们就有了这张价值高达 50,000 美元的代金券。
 我想是在莱弗里特。
 它们的结构非常不同，但都是小规模的住房所有权计划。
 由于其结构方式，它们的单位补贴往往很高。
 这是单位的缓慢积累，但它可能是帮助人们拥有房屋的一种方式。
 这可能是保护社区中一些规模较小的房屋的一种方式。
 我们的一些社区正在拆除规模较小、自然更经济实惠的住房。
 这可能是慢慢保护城市中一些较小房屋的一种方法。
 我们有许多社区支持新建信托和 CPC 的例子。
 这是社区积极参与的三个例子。
 在诺威尔，这个地点是一个警察局，被认为是盈余，后来转移到住房信托基金。
 他们是发起征求建议书的人。
 他们还接受了非营利开发商 Metro West 的提议，该开发商在那里建造了 18 套年龄限制住房单元。
 信托基金和 CPC 为这一开发项目贡献了约 120 万美元。
 在布鲁斯特，这是一个住房管理局网站。
 有一些剩余的土地属于住房管理局，他们正在努力建造更多的住房。
 该市积极寻求 Mass Saves 的拨款，以开展一些基础设施工作，使这一开发成为可能。
 然后他们向当地捐款 55 万美元。
 他们现在在这里有30套经济适用房，还有额外的出租屋。
 然后在西港，信托确实推动了这一过程，这是一个漫长的过程，但他们拥有市政土地，他们必须购买相邻的土地才能使用市政土地。
 他们进行了额外的开发前工作，发布了提案请求，并为开发做出了贡献。
 现在，通过主要的非营利开发商 Community Builders，他们已经
 西港的这50 个出租单位。
 社区真正积极参与了这三项开发，帮助推进并为其提供资金。
 我们还有一些将建筑物改造成经济适用房的例子，有时还有历史成分。
 在米德尔伯勒，这是一家鞋厂，然后一些非营利组织能够共同将其改造成 25 套出租屋。
 当地捐款仅为 25,000 美元。
 他们当时是一个新的注册会计师社区，他们没有那么多资源，但他们尽其所能地进行了投资。
 在威廉斯敦，这家工厂由开发商在当地出资的情况下改建为 42 套出租屋。
 然后下面两个是学校。
 所以有一些学校被改造成经济适用房的例子。
 在这两种情况下，就像学校经常发生的那样，在建筑物的历史部分建造了一个附属建筑，以增加单位并使其在财务上更加可行。
 左边，Sloan Scott，有38个有年龄限制的出租单位。
 右边是奥本，有 55 个年龄限制的出租单元。
 因此，适应性再利用，您可能已经知道这一点，但通常再利用现有建筑物比新建建筑物争议较小。
 如果对人们、对社区中那些重视历史保护的人来说，有一个历史的组成部分，这可能是双赢的。
 所以你可以帮忙。
 在某些情况下它可以帮助开发。
 然后继续。
 在CPA法规中，我们看到一些社区试图将很多东西置于保存状态，但是保存，CPA中的定义实际上是一个相当高的标准。
 它是保护不动产或动产免遭伤害、损坏或毁坏。
 这不是康复。
 这不仅仅是安装新水槽或台面那么简单。
 它确实比那大得多。
 它可以保护单位免于变得无法居住或失去其可达性限制。
 DHCD（现为 EOHLC）发布了一份备忘录，对
 向住房当局阐明哪些内容符合保护条件，哪些内容实际上需要修复，哪些内容需要维护。
 因此，CPA 资金决不允许用于维护。
 如果您对此不熟悉，您可能想熟悉一下，我可以将其发送给您，以便您可以阅读一些。
 但当我们谈论保护经济适用房时，我们通常指的是限制负担能力。
 许多限制即将到期。
 因此，信托和 CPC 致力于扩大单位的负担能力，以使其在很长一段时间内或在使用 CPA 资金的情况下永久保持负担能力。
 这是阿默斯特的一个例子。
 所以这不是信任，不是由信任驱动的，这是注册会计师，因为他们团结一致。
 但这是阿默斯特的一个开发项目，拥有 41 个经济适用房。
 它们快要过期了。
 他们只有 15 年的限制。
 我认为这是一种大众住房金融产品，当时的业主对扩大负担能力不感兴趣。
 社区对这些单位的损失非常关注。
 他们联系了 MHP 并收到了一份沟通计划。
 呃，我突然忘记开发者了。
 一家大型开发商与 Beacon 接洽，该开发商在 40B 和 Beacon 社区拥有低收入住房税收抵免方面的经验。
 事实上，Beacon当时就与业主洽谈购买该项目。
 因此，社区决定存入 125 万美元的 CPA 资金，以便这 41 套公寓现在永远可以负担得起。
 这就是为什么一些信托机构正在关注即将过期的可访问性限制并参与讨论。
 有时这意味着与中共或规划部门合作。
 但也有一些信托机构正在关注这一点。
 因此，如果这对信托来说是一个合适的角色，他们可能会考虑这一点。
 是的。
 而且还是要预约的。
 是的，继续吧。
 一个关于这个的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2680.813s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 当无障碍限制到期时，市政实体是否会收到通知？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2689.419s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 所以有一个华助会管理的清单，你可以，我会把它发给你。
 然后有一个列表，其中包含一些此类信息。
 这也是你应该对经济适用房进行地方控制的事情。
 如果您是梅德福，可能已经有人这样做了。
 是的，由于社区的规模，通常已经有人关注它了。
 因此，它必须可供您使用。
 是的。
 太好了，谢谢。
 是的，保护也是防止损坏的一部分，也是围绕建筑围护结构进行的。
 这是格洛斯特的一个例子，该建筑的一个单元由于泄漏而已经关闭，屋顶漏水，需要降低高度。
 他们用了
 一些注册会计师资金，所以他们要求一些注册会计师资金来补充国家现代化公式资金来更换屋顶。
 然后，由于其他单位面临无法居住的风险，他们使用了一些保留的 CPA 资金以及其他国家资金来更换屋顶。
 因此，这是一个非 CPA 资金创建或购买的现有住房中符合保留条件的例子。
 在支持下，有多种被视为允许的活动。
 对于信托来说也是如此。
 因此，在开发前工作中，如果您有一块市政土地，有兴趣用于建造经济适用房，您可以使用该基金的一些资源来进行一些开发前工作，并帮助准备提案请求。
 您可以使用信托资源来更新您的住房计划，并且 CPA 法规明确允许提供租赁援助。
 这也是信任可以参与的事情。
 在大流行期间，实际上是许多社区的住房信托基金真正发起并资助了紧急租赁援助。
 我们看到许多社区、许多信托机构都在从事此类工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2825.958s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 是否需要一些时间来更多地讨论可以包含在支持中的计划类型，或者我们应该在演示后花一些时间来讨论这个问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2840.529s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 你在问我吗？
 是的。
 你的意思是什么可以适合住房计划？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2846.253s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2848.588s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 我们应该花一些时间来讨论这个问题，还是停下来谈谈我们在支持住房计划时可能考虑的例子？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2860.658s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 所以，我的意思是，我们过去看到的是，有时信托资源被用来更新住房生产计划，例如，或进行住房需求分析。
 所以它确实符合我们所看到的更多标准类型
 社区开始的计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2880.463s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 特别向我们提出的一个问题是，它是否可以用于例如关系或联系研究，以帮助为信托创造另一种收入来源。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2898.593s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，一些社区问过我这个问题。
 因此，它只会回归到该基金的目的，即为中低收入家庭创造或保留经济适用房。
 我的意思是，你可以提出相反的观点，比如，住房生产计划是否一定能做到这一点？
 我的意思是，这应该会导致这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2921.342s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 那么更进一步的问题是，如果CPA资金，特别是如果CPA资金是房地产基金，那么CPA资金是否可以用于此目的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2932.652s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 不，我认为注册会计师资金不能用于此目的，不。
 如果我有其他资源，也许我可以考虑它，因为如果我这样做了，我的意思是，我认为它仍然非常牵强，我确信我已经告诉其他社区了。
 所以我更喜欢离线思考，不，如果你正在记录这个和所有事情，我不想低声说话，我想更加深思熟虑。
 但我绝对不认为CPA资金可以用于任何研究债券的事情。
 不，因为这根本不符合注册会计师的要求。
 这不是关于
 研究如何为这样的信托融资不是这样的，不是。
 如果您有其他资源，也许我们可以考虑一下，或者我只想问您几个问题，让您仔细思考。
 我们都不是值得信赖的警察，所以，你知道，这是在当地实施的。
 所以我只想提出一些问题或需要思考的事情，然后你们自己解决。
 但我很高兴我可以离线做更多这样的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=2994.087s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 当你在线下考虑这个问题时，雪莉，进行一项关系研究以在我们的保释率中添加便携式住房部分将花费 80,000 美元。
 因此，开发商将为公园和开放空间、公共安全提供资金，我们想做一项关系研究，以便他们可以开始投资第四组，即经济适用房。
 通过它进行离线链接，因为我建立了连接。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3026.65s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 出色地。
 我可以添加一个后续问题吗？
 我对注册会计师基金的理解是。
 为了获得支持，他必须支持创建新的无障碍经济。
 是的，我了解 CPA 与住房单位或住宅有关。
 因此，我也本能地认为这将是对 NEXUS 研究的否定，但我知道这个问题尚悬而未决，所以我只是想确保我们解决了这个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3060.056s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的。
 我只想说，这绝对不适合拥有 CPA 资金的 NEXUS 工作室。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3066.694s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: 是的，我想，雪莱，如果你有问题要我们在研究领域考虑，我会对此非常感兴趣，以帮助思考哪些可能适用，哪些可能不适用。
 所以，是的，如果你能分享这一点，我会非常感兴趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3083.357s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我会在电子邮件中放入我建议您考虑的一些问题。
 谢谢。
 是的。
 因此，我将在此总结一些最后的想法：我们真的建议信托公司，尤其是新的信托公司，真正考虑他们当地的基础设施，看看土地的情况、需求和资源，并思考他们的利基市场是什么，这样你就不会重复，不会踩到任何脚趾，真正进行调整。
 您在社区中的角色，制定反映已确定需求的目标。
 这就是为什么我们说真正从数据开始。
 我知道这些数据并不能说服所有人，但我们强烈建议您以此为起点，投入资源来反映社区中已确定的需求。
 很多时候，
 议会将倾向于采取阻力最小的道路，这不一定反映真正的需要或社区的真正需要。
 这可能是谣言，也可能是某些有影响力的人想要的，但这不一定是需求的反映。
 因此，我们强烈建议您从确定的需求开始，真实地了解自己的能力，诚实地对待自己能做什么。
 你是一个志愿者委员会，你的资源有限，这就是为什么我一次建议两个或三个目标。
 只是为了确保你能做好一些事情，而不是因为你对自己的期望太高或期望太高而很难做某事而感到沮丧。
 因此，对自己的能力要现实一些。
 并且有很多不同的特点。
 MHP 有一些我们在这里收集的在线资源。
 我们希望成为您的资源。
 因此，我和我的同事在这里帮助回答问题，或者我有一些人拥有我没有的经验，我没有的技术经验，我们在这里帮助他们促进社区的住房建设。
 所以不要害羞。
 还有其他问题、意见或评论吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3800.141s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 我们希望多长时间和多快制定行动计划？
 我们完成行动计划的目标是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3812.427s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 每个人可能都有全职工作，所以除非万不得已，我们不能这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3817.449s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 那么，有没有一个解决方案需要我们逆向工作才能完成呢？
 我认为这是我们可以做到的
 我现在不想再一次设定最后期限，因为我们这里的日程安排各不相同。
 但雪莉所说的是要慢慢来，仔细思考。
 我是一个人，我喜欢知道我们要做的事情，然后开始分解步骤，然后看看这样做需要多长时间。
 我不想为我们没有做好的准备。
 你将能够移动。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3857.917s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: 我只是想澄清一下，行动计划包括使命宣言和我们的目标，对吗？
 因此，我认为有些事情可以先于其他事情进行，我认为我们可以在会议中讨论这些事情并向小组展示，就好像它是一个完整的目标一样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3871.103s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 然后消化我们已有的计划、现有的生产计划，以及我们如何将其分解并分解为可操作的步骤
 一两年的时间就会告诉你什么是不可能实现的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3893.254s">[Moogoor]</a>: 一些编写行动计划的社区联系社区并让他们参与编写行动计划，这需要更长的时间。
 一些社区选择不让任何利益相关者或社区参与。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3911.609s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3914.921s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 接下来我们有注册会计师申请。
 这个任务很快就要到期了，所以我们需要完成它。
 我将把它交给 Aditi，让我们概述一下她的应用程序。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=3950.636s">[Moogoor]</a>: 所以，总的来说，我们有四个项目。
 正如雪莉所提到的，需要澄清的是，这些是开发项目而不是项目。
 因此，首先是要不要在城市发展保障性住房。
 我只是想知道你的想法。
 所以有两种情况。
 情景一，我们可以更接近集体住房。
 他们有一个名为“住房生产规划补助金”的补助金计划。
 上周五我与他们举行了一次会议，看看梅德福是否符合资格，因为他们在他们的网站上说只有门户城市可以申请。
 梅德福有资格申请并滚动接受申请。
 当信托准备好应用时，我们就可以继续应用它。
 这就是他们通过技术援助为项目提供资金的原因。
 这些项目的成本为 50,000 美元至 100,000 美元，具体取决于经济适用房开发的规模。
 这需要本地对应的 10%。
 因此，如果我们要求 CPA 资金进行本地匹配，那将会有所帮助。
 第二种情况是，如果我们能够获得补助金，我们可能不得不依赖CPA资金。
 同样，每个项目大约需要 50,000 到 100,000 美元。
 对此有什么想法吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4055.882s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 所以我只是想确保这一点，很抱歉，我花了一段时间来处理这个问题，所以我想确保我理解。
 第一种情况是，在住房的帮助下，有义务能够获得、能够在城市已经拥有的土地上开发土地，开发住房、城市拥有的土地。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4083.821s">[Moogoor]</a>: 获得技术援助，以便他们可以帮助我们完成该地块的整个城市评估过程，然后进行预开发工作，然后编写 RFP。
 是的，谢谢。
 然后项目二是支持新建保障性住房建设。
 这是一个非常笼统的建议，但如果您对此有任何其他想法，我们可以将它们包括在内，但我们只是希望我们能够开展这些项目。
 第三个项目是建造一个农场，以便在土地可用时购买土地。
 第四，首付援助。
 我认为丽莎提出了这一点，但只是为了澄清，我们所属的北郊财团有一个首付援助计划。
 在过去的五年里，他们资助了多达五名梅德福居民。
 他们提供了，我只是想看看他们提供了多少金额，最多 10,000 美元。
 是的，罗伯塔对此发表了一些评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4167.389s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 是的，我不确定 CPA 资金是否可以用于此类首付援助，但在雪莉上面给出的首付计划示例中，CPA 可以用于首付计划。
 但我刚刚升级，反映了我们刚刚在应用程序中分析的内容。
 也许您可以将其作为示例来代替项目。
 这些是我们可以做的项目类型的例子，因为我们还没有制定计划。
 事实上，我们不知道如何使用这些资金。
 但你可以说这些只是例子。
 从住房生产计划中提取，这些是我们使用资金的潜在方式，我们将制定一项计划来指导我们，并且我们将在使用资金之前与 TPC 一起向委员会提供。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4232.912s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 首期付款也会发生同样的情况。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4235.983s">[MCM00001763_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 他们没有首付奖金计划还是北郊财团制定得非常具体？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4246.051s">[Roberta Cameron]</a>: 因此，注册会计师需要我们提供融资以换取长期契约限制。
 因此，5,000 美元或 10,000 美元的首付援助只是一份礼物，无需兑换。
 CPA融资必须有对应的。
 我们必须获得契据限制才有资格。
 但事实并非如此，对写作的限制并不一定需要是永久性的。
 你可以长期这样做。
 所以你可以做一个 25 年或 20 年的契约限制，但不一定是
 当我读到这篇文章时，这是北方，国家安全委员会，当我提出这个建议时，我的想法比国家安全委员会所做的更大，因为A，你只会把它给梅德福的居民，在梅德福市购买，国家安全委员会将收入限制为 AMI 的 80%，注册会计师允许你达到 AMI 的 100%，以及中等收入的人，
 81岁以上的老人仍然存在购买困难。
 那么为什么不将这些资金提供给高收入家庭呢？
 多给一点，肯定需要20年，一万师要做的还不止这些。
 但我也认为，如果我们要在申请中包含首付援助的示例，我们还应该在申请中包含租金援助的示例。
 我想过租房并询问租金援助，但 CPC 似乎已经在提供租金援助。
 当我思考这个问题时，有一个想法，你知道，我在思考什么
 我已经习惯在这座城市工作，他们提供两年的租金援助。
 他们做预防。
 他们做这一切。
 我认为这种情况会通过 CPC 持续下去，有时也会持续下去。
 嗯，有一个问题是，你知道，这是否是一个关于未来的问题。
 因为我们没有保障性住房基金，所以组织直接向中共要这笔钱。
 但也许梅德福会发展得更像萨默维尔那样，所有住房援助都通过经济适用住房基金而不是 CPC 进行。
 所以我们可能会也可能不会朝这个方向前进。
 也许我会以此为例：这就是我们需要制定计划的原因。
 我会以此为例，但这不一定是我们要做的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4431.76s">[Moogoor]</a>: 那么，关于牙科援助计划，我是否应该根据目前中共资助的牙科援助计划添加一些语言？
 这些是其中的一些，是的，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4453.116s">[Theresa Dupont]</a>: 是的，我只是想说我可以与你分享这种语言，这样我们就可以用它来联系。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4459.638s">[Moogoor]</a>: 谢谢。
 除了私人费用之外，您还想举出其他例子吗？
 罗伯塔对第三个问题做了一些评论，所以我会更新。
 我们需要确定 CPA 允许的适当用途。
 因此，第一个例子，即在安全的地段上建造经济适用房，将是创造不足，也不是支持。
 示例二是创建，但示例三是获取，即通过 CPA 资金获取财产或获取土地。
 因此，在示例四中，首付援助将受到支持。
 例子五或五是：租金援助也将得到支持。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4524.241s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4524.982s">[Moogoor]</a>: 是的。
 我只是将其传达给您，但如果您有任何意见，请随时与我联系。
 我们要求 250,000 美元。
 以及有关我们将探索的一些可能的资金来源的一些一般信息。
 其中之一就是巨额住房补贴。
 第二个是我们正在努力连接经济适用房。
 我们尚未确定资金。
 而这个第三方就是一个正在开发住房项目的开发商。
 MDDC（神秘谷发展委员会）同意为该项目捐款 25 万美元。
 但我们仍然需要注册协议，我们希望尽快完成。
 该基金随后将探索其他潜在的融资来源。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001353&t=4611.952s">[Penelope Taylor]</a>: 是的，您刚刚访问的第 11 页页面上的请求者有一个拼写错误。

 我想知道我们需要财政支持的其他事情。
 我们是否曾经提交过类似的可持续发展补助金申请，用于经济适用房？
 因此，也许可以作为任何住房单元的脱碳项目，或者作为新屋顶，然后我还在上面安装了太阳能。
 这是我们做的事情吗？
 如果是这样，我们是否在这里说这就像我们拥有的金钱协同效应？</p>
