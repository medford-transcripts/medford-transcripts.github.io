00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:42,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Penny?

17
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:43,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

18
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:43,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

20
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,039
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, she was amazing.

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And myself present.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have six present one absent as of right now.

24
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:56,422
[SPEAKER_06]: You may attend a little bit.

25
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:02,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We have approval of the meeting minutes from the August 7, 2024 meeting.

26
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:07,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Aditi, if you don't mind providing us an update.

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting minutes were updated as of yesterday.

29
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:20,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Trustee Roberta Cameron had some edits on page 2.

30
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:25,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the allowable uses, there are some edits on the description of the allowable uses and on

31
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Page 4, paragraph 2, Trustee Roberta Cameron clarified how CPC has historically voted to reserve more funds for affordable housing.

32
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a bit of clarification on that, and that has been updated.

33
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:47,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Apart from that, the meeting minutes have been the same since I've shared it with the Board of Trustees.

34
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:50,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

35
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:52,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval of the minutes?

36
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,706
[SPEAKER_07]: May I make an edit or is it too late to do so?

37
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:04,512
[SPEAKER_07]: On page 1, it states, I work in the Office of Housing Stability.

38
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,574
[SPEAKER_07]: The Office of Housing is a different office.

39
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:10,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm standing in the D. Office of Housing Stability.

40
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:10,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

41
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

42
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:11,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

43
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:19,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval with Penny's amendment.

44
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:22,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, I'll make a motion.

45
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:23,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

46
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:26,054
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

47
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,458
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

48
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

49
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting minutes are approved.

50
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:42,445
[SPEAKER_06]: If one of us is ever on Zoom, then we'll have to be, since we're all present.

51
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,372
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Massachusetts Housing Partnership here to present about Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

52
00:02:51,392 --> 00:03:01,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to invite Shelly Goren, I have to pronounce for her, from MHP to give us a one-on-one training on Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

53
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:07,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Shelly's been working with the communities and nonprofits to support affordable housing initiative and development.

54
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:13,304
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been primarily helping communities establish and operate municipal affordable housing trusts.

55
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:25,486
[SPEAKER_06]: She is one of the state community experts in establishing and utilizing housing trusts and applying Community Preservation Act funds for affordable housing, whether directly or through a housing trust.

56
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:29,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Shelly, for agreeing to provide this training to us.

57
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll pass it over to you.

58
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

59
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:33,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

60
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,370
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to be here with you this evening.

61
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if I've been given the ability to share yet.

62
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a minute, Shelly.

63
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do that right now.

64
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:42,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

65
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:52,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight, while you share, I'm just going to note that Member Terry Weaver is present, so we have a full committee tonight.

66
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic, congratulations.

67
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:56,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it happens often.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to go through some

69
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,791
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty much some basics around affordable housing trust funds.

70
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And I of course acknowledge that some of you likely know more than others.

71
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't wanna leave anyone feeling like I'm talking down.

72
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:15,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna make sure that I'm not assuming, making any assumptions.

73
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna pull up some slides here.

74
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:30,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, can you see the slides?

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:31,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

76
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

77
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:50,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am Shelly Gary and I work with MHP mass housing partnership, and I do work in communities all across the state, helping to establish will pass to accept the affordable housing trust fund statute as well as trying to help trustees get up and running.

78
00:04:51,319 --> 00:05:03,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those of you who may not be as familiar with MHP, Mass Housing Partnership, we are a quasi-state agency in Massachusetts that's all about trying to increase the supply of affordable housing and access to affordable housing across the state.

79
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:07,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a few different ways that we work on this mission.

80
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:12,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a Center for Housing Data, so we have a small group of people that are collecting, analyzing, and sharing

81
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:16,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Data to help inform effective policy.

82
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:20,550
[SPEAKER_08]: They also have created some really fantastic online tools for communities to use.

83
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:32,643
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the community assistance team that I'm part of and we work a lot with local communities as well as housing authorities and nonprofit developers to help build local capacity to support affordable housing.

84
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,205
[SPEAKER_08]: the creation and preservation of affordable housing.

85
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:42,066
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lending team that's lent over $1.4 billion to create and preserve affordable housing.

86
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:50,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have a homeownership team that is working diligently to help increase access to homeownership for low and moderate income households across the state.

87
00:05:52,927 --> 00:06:05,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, we're going to go through start with just some really basics of the housing trust fund statute and then get a little bit into operations and best practices just based on working in a lot of communities across the state.

88
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:13,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things that we've learned and then we'll dig into eligible activities, the kinds of things that you can be supporting as an affordable.

89
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:21,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Housing Trust Fund, and I'm more than happy for you to interrupt me if I'm speaking too fast, if something isn't clear.

90
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:31,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I will stop after each section and just ask for questions, but feel free for someone to interrupt me if I don't notice, or you can put up your hand and I'll try to notice.

91
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:34,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm more than happy to be interrupted during this.

92
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be me just speaking for a long time and then talking.

93
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:51,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So first is just some of the basics, and you likely know this already, but the Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund statute is under Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 55C.

94
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,951
[SPEAKER_08]: It is your public board.

95
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,072
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a public entity like your other Medford boards.

96
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,433
[SPEAKER_08]: You're created by the local legislative body, your city council.

97
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:05,627
[SPEAKER_08]: The focus really is fairly narrow.

98
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:11,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to create and preserve affordable housing for low and moderate income households.

99
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It's led by a board of trustees that's appointed locally.

100
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:26,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And because you are a public board, you are subject to public procurement, designer selection, conflict of interest, and public meeting laws, just like all your other municipal boards.

101
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Very broadly as a trust, you can address affordable housing needs.

102
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:37,512
[SPEAKER_08]: You can support local control of housing initiatives and engage in real estate activity.

103
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:44,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can buy and sell real estate or you can help developers buy real estate for affordable housing.

104
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:51,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You can make timely decisions because unless it's written into your ordinance, you can make decisions without going back to the city council.

105
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,855
[SPEAKER_08]: You can collect money from a variety of sources.

106
00:07:56,975 --> 00:08:08,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're seeing communities be more and more creative than what they were even just five or 10 years ago in trying to raise funds for affordable housing and specifically for their trust.

107
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:17,253
[SPEAKER_08]: The statute is very short and it's not very prescriptive.

108
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:30,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, you want to make sure that you're paying attention to your ordinance to see if you haven't read through it yet, you should read your local ordinance just so that you understand the way that Medford City Council has perhaps added some direction.

109
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:34,405
[SPEAKER_08]: But the statute just says a minimum of five trustees.

110
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to include the chief executive officer.

111
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:42,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't actually say or an appointee, although some communities interpret that as being allowable.

112
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:49,276
[SPEAKER_08]: The trustees are appointed by the mayor, and oftentimes this includes the city council in a town.

113
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,997
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the select board, and they're two-year terms.

114
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:59,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And many communities will stagger these just so that you never have everyone turning over at the same time, which we oftentimes do with other boards of nonprofits.

115
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And the trustees are public agents.

116
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You're special municipal employees similar to other boards.

117
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:13,101
[SPEAKER_08]: The statute list 16 explicit powers.

118
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, do you mind if we just interrupt with a question?

119
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

120
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

121
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So you mentioned that we're special municipal employees.

122
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:29,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like specifically that we're special municipal employees or just that we're public agents?

123
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Public agents, sorry.

124
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

125
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

126
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

127
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I maybe spoke wrong.

128
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:39,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

129
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:49,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So the statute gives 16 explicit powers.

130
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:57,306
[SPEAKER_08]: These are just some of the big ones of accepting and receiving real property, purchase and retain real or personal property, selling, leasing, exchanging.

131
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:03,590
[SPEAKER_08]: The statute also allows for additional powers to be given to the trust in line with the statute.

132
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:13,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have communities that modify the powers so again, you just want to make sure that you're paying attention to your local ordinance in case the city council did.

133
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:18,438
[SPEAKER_08]: add some restrictions in some communities.

134
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It might require a certain percentage of the trustees for certain decisions.

135
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:35,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Borrowing seems to have some of the most restrictions about how much a trust can borrow or who has some guidance about that.

136
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:37,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So just make sure that you're paying attention to your ordinance.

137
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are just some very, very basics.

138
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting into operations and best practices.

139
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:56,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the things that we're seeing is that there are more ways that communities are funding their trust today than even just five years ago, five or six years ago.

140
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So a variety of different ways.

141
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:05,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So certainly the Community Preservation Act is one of the most common and about almost 80% of

142
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:12,045
[SPEAKER_08]: trust communities also have CPA, but it's not a given in every community that

143
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,343
[SPEAKER_08]: The trust receives CPA funds every year, or it's not necessarily a set amount every year.

144
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:26,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not necessarily a funding source that every community can count on outside of Cambridge and Somerville for the most part.

145
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,672
[SPEAKER_08]: But CPA is a common one.

146
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:37,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Inclusionary zoning in some communities, the inclusionary zoning bylaw or ordinance directs any in lieu of payments to go to the trust.

147
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:44,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some communities, it's even like in Swampscot, the trust actually determines what the payment is, what the formula is.

148
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:50,365
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one community in the Cape that has a cell phone tower and the lease payments go to their trust.

149
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a lot of money.

150
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:53,727
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a small amount, but it's something that they can count on each year.

151
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:59,910
[SPEAKER_08]: We have communities that transfer funds from free cash from the general fund to their trust.

152
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:04,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So Truro, Brookline are communities that have done that multiple times.

153
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:23,149
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one community that we know of that has a municipal bond Medfield established their trust and then they voted to allow for a million dollar bond to see the trust and I don't think that they've drawn on it yet I don't think that they've used it but they do have those resources.

154
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,671
[SPEAKER_08]: If they wanted to.

155
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:37,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Or leans on the Cape has established their trust several years ago now and they also voted for a tax override of $275,000 and they see that as a permanent tax override.

156
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:44,801
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the only trust that I know of that's been able to access a line of credit at a bank because they do have this consistent funding source.

157
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: There can be donations to the trust of land or cash.

158
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,794
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be developer negotiated fees.

159
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,894
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be very careful with how you do this.

160
00:12:55,614 --> 00:13:02,476
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have a community that received from a friendly 40 B home ownership development.

161
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:06,777
[SPEAKER_08]: They received funds that then the select board directed to the trust.

162
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:17,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Some communities are looking at short-term rental fees and using some of these funds for their trust and or affordable housing development.

163
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:23,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you likely have heard about real estate transfer fee, the hope of having a real estate transfer fee in the state.

164
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:27,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And communities are still working towards that, even though it didn't end up in the bond bill this year.

165
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear communities talk about taxes for the marijuana.

166
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:39,569
[SPEAKER_08]: from sales of marijuana, I haven't heard any actually using that at this point.

167
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:45,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are a variety of ways, there could be also a special bylaw or ordinance payments that could be directed to the trust.

168
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there are a couple examples of that.

169
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:54,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are a variety of ways that communities are trying to raise additional resources to fund affordable housing.

170
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:05,001
[SPEAKER_08]: As a new trust starting out, we really encourage you to, I'm sorry, I forgot to look this up.

171
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a current housing production plan?

172
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,149
[SPEAKER_08]: or housing needs than you do.

173
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:15,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would really encourage you to be reviewing this, to be familiar with this.

174
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:28,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you likely are more than others, but to really understand the identified needs in the community and to be able to really engage in conversations about that and talk with people about that.

175
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And to start as a board, to start with those identified needs when you start thinking about setting priorities

176
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,985
[SPEAKER_08]: and what you're going to focus on as a board.

177
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:52,297
[SPEAKER_08]: You could also create benchmarks you don't have to but Somerville is a community where their trust is actually written into their ordinance that a certain amount of the resources are to go to lowest income households I think it's under 50% of the area median income.

178
00:14:53,898 --> 00:15:02,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So to make sure that they're not just funding at 80% or 100%, but that they are investing in housing for much lower income households.

179
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could create benchmarks like that.

180
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:08,185
[SPEAKER_08]: If there was a particular value that was important at a particular time, you don't have to.

181
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:19,070
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are really encouraging trusts to do some groundwork, to not just jump in, but to really think about what your niche is in the community and how you're going to operate as a board.

182
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:27,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Another part is just using other resources to familiarize yourself with local housing needs.

183
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:33,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is Datatown, and some of you likely use Datatown, but it's a resource that MHP developed years ago.

184
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:38,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a lot of different data points for communities all across the state.

185
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:42,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And so on the left, this is just the housing units by building type in Medford.

186
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:47,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And you see that you have a housing diversity that's decent, particularly compared to

187
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,683
[SPEAKER_08]: probably I think most other communities in the state, you do have some multifamily housing, which is fantastic.

188
00:15:55,264 --> 00:16:02,689
[SPEAKER_08]: On the right, it just gives you a glimpse of the housing burden in Medford.

189
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:07,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So the top is renter households and the bottom is home ownership.

190
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:19,081
[SPEAKER_08]: homeowners, and this is likely in your housing production plan as well, but this is a typical pattern where renters tend to be, there tends to be a greater percentage of renters that are housing cost burdened.

191
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:28,684
[SPEAKER_08]: The greenish color, the 19.2% are households that are spending at least 30% of their gross income on housing.

192
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:35,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the blue, the 18.9 are households that are severely cost burdened and they're spending at least 50% of their

193
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:41,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The gross income on housing and then homeowners are are down below.

194
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point.

195
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:55,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing a lot of reading and research and just really getting a handle on the housing needs in the community is a is our first suggestion for trust new trust.

196
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,352
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also do a little bit of work learning about affordable housing finance, not to become experts.

197
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:15,899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very complicated and it's not your job to be experts, but to have a bit more familiarity because of course, the whole point of having a trust is to help support the creation and preservation of affordable housing.

198
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:21,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some tools on the housing toolbox, which is another resource that MHP helps to maintain.

199
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We have different trainings that have talked through

200
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:35,728
[SPEAKER_08]: financing affordable housing development, we also have a couple that give the developers perspective of how that a developer puts together an affordable housing deal and the way that local communities can support them.

201
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that I encourage trust to consider is to invite a developer to come 20 year meetings to talk through

202
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,954
[SPEAKER_08]: pro forma with you to help you understand the overall process.

203
00:17:47,034 --> 00:18:04,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, not to become experts, but just to be more familiar and more comfortable with the process and to learn about the importance of the role of a local trust and local resources and when developers really need those in order to go to the state for state and federal resources.

204
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:20,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So Beverly is a community where they invited two developers, a nonprofit, a community development corporation, as well as the local Habitat branch to come and share, go through a pro forma and talk about their process and what it takes for them to put together a housing deal.

205
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Winchester recently invited a for-profit developer,

206
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:41,289
[SPEAKER_08]: A man who had been with a larger developer and he's gone out on his own and he has a lot of experience and he came and talked through a recent development and help the trust just better understand the process and and their role in supporting development.

207
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:46,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are a couple different things that you can be doing to learn a bit more about affordable housing finance.

208
00:18:49,751 --> 00:19:10,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once you feel a bit comfortable with, you don't necessarily, this doesn't have to be linear, it can happen at the same time, but once you are feeling fairly comfortable with kind of the needs in the community and you're starting to think about the niche for your board, we really encourage you to create a mission statement if you haven't done this already.

209
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:19,943
[SPEAKER_08]: to really put out there clearly for yourself, but also for the community of how you see your role in the community.

210
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:36,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to, I'm sure that probably all of you have been involved in mission statements in one way or another and in different boards and organizations over the years, but something succinct and that ultimately talks about what you do, how you do it, and who you do it for.

211
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just put up Amherst, but

212
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:49,130
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really what they what strikes me about theirs is that they are kind of reiterating that they're an instrument of local government of town government.

213
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, their goal is to their mission is to promote identified priorities in the town.

214
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So they really wanted kind of collaborative language.

215
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:03,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll if you haven't already, you can figure out what what makes sense for Medford.

216
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:14,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're suggesting that trust spend a little bit of time doing some work considering goals and strategies for your board.

217
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:23,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And really the reason why I've come to this is because I've worked in so many communities over the years and the trust oftentimes will feel pressure to jump in and just do something, to accomplish something.

218
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:28,909
[SPEAKER_08]: There's oftentimes a lot of external pressure or municipal pressure to do something.

219
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:43,725
[SPEAKER_08]: It oftentimes leads to, in my opinion, really a paralysis almost, because the housing needs are so great in all of our communities, the resources are really limited.

220
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:50,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really encouraging trust to take some time, even if there's external pressure to do something, but take some time to really think through.

221
00:20:51,328 --> 00:21:02,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Given what you know about the needs in the community, given the limited resources that you have, what is your niche and what are two or three key things that you're going to focus on in the next few years?

222
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:10,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And really pushing trust to make these measurable goals, smart goals, so that there's really a way to measure how you're

223
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,206
[SPEAKER_08]: how you're moving forward.

224
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:17,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oftentimes, housing production plans have goals that are really general, very, very broad.

225
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like increase the supply of senior housing, age-restricted housing, and it's just so big.

226
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:31,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really encouraging you to start with your housing production plan, start with what's already been identified, and then from that, really dig into

227
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:38,360
[SPEAKER_08]: focus on two or three key things and write your goals to be measurable.

228
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:44,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once you have those goals that are measurable, then work on strategies under each of those goals.

229
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:52,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from that, you can really dig into the tasks to be delegating to each other and to be moving things forward.

230
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:58,474
[SPEAKER_08]: But in some cases, this can be a process that takes a few months or six months.

231
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just really encouraging trust.

232
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:04,581
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's what it takes, then take that time.

233
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:10,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean you can't be doing some things at the same time, of course, but I think it's best early on.

234
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:25,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And then periodically after that to really be thoughtful and very specific about what you're trying to do so that you don't get into the point of spinning your wheels because we all know that the needs are great and the resources are very limited.

235
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:28,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just going to give an example of one community.

236
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:42,663
[SPEAKER_08]: This is itty bitty little well fleet out on Cape Cod and they their trust their new trust decided that their niche really was going to be about development and increasing the supply of new housing affordable housing in town.

237
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:44,024
[SPEAKER_08]: year-round housing.

238
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:47,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they came up with two goals, two measurable goals.

239
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: One, create 100 units of low-moderate income rental and home ownership housing units over the next five years.

240
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:58,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Wellfleet is a community that has less than 5,000 residents year-round, so a very small community.

241
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:05,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So 100 units over five years is actually pretty ambitious for such a tiny little community.

242
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:11,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they are second goal raise $1,000,000 annually for 5 years for $5,000,000.

243
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:18,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is very ambitious for such a tiny community, even though they may be a more affluent community, there's still a very small community.

244
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And then under each of those goals, they created specific strategies that they're.

245
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Working towards to create to get to their goal.

246
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:39,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the kind of work that I'm suggesting that trust do and that I'm working with trust on just to hopefully help help trust really focus and to be effective.

247
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:55,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that we suggest is that you create guidelines and several trusts have this, but it's in one space putting together a variety of information about the trust and how the trust is going to function.

248
00:23:55,905 --> 00:24:04,850
[SPEAKER_08]: One to help keep you focused, but really so that others and people who may come to you for funds that they can get this information in one place.

249
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,553
[SPEAKER_08]: So the kind of elements that may be in guidelines are mission statement, goals and strategies to put it in.

250
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:11,553
[SPEAKER_08]: put it there.

251
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:21,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Roles and responsibilities of the trust, if there's anything just to have a place where you're putting some of the general roles and responsibilities of the trust.

252
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:27,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Your priority or eligible funding activities, so the things that you really want to focus on funding.

253
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:32,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Any stipulations for funding, so if you have income limits,

254
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are only funding housing up to 80% of the area at median income because you want everything to be eligible for the subsidized housing inventory, or if you're going to 100%, if you want developments that are mixed income, if you have a requirement around how long units are affordable, if you have a minimum of 20 years or 30 years or in perpetuity,

255
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:29,730
[SPEAKER_08]: information about project monitoring and reporting your expectations of what you'll receive from developments that you fund, application process, selection criteria, what you're looking at in an application form, so that someone who wants to come to the trust for funding doesn't have to go in a variety of different places, that they can have one place that they're getting this information, learning about how you operate, and then, of course, this is a document that you want to review periodically and make sure that you keep up to date.

256
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:45,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we suggest early on that you make sure that you're having conversations across boards and possibly even with groups outside of municipal government if that seems appropriate.

257
00:25:46,769 --> 00:26:04,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to make sure that you're clarifying rules early on, that you are having some conversation about how boards may work together or entities may work together, perhaps identifying places, ways to collaborate, and maybe even a conversation about who funds what.

258
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:12,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you see in front of you is just an exercise that Manchester by the Sea did within their housing production plan.

259
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:22,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And you might have something similar, but they created their housing strategies on the left, identified their housing strategies, determined that some are lower, or I'm sorry, shorter term, some are longer term.

260
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they identified the lead board on the right hand side or the couple lead boards.

261
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:39,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, one, it helps a little bit, hopefully, with not stepping on each other's toes, but it also hopefully creates some accountability for who is responsible for different strategies.

262
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:45,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this kind of an exercise could include a housing authority, depending on your local housing authority.

263
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:50,054
[SPEAKER_08]: It could include a nonprofit organization that does a lot of housing work.

264
00:26:50,675 --> 00:27:02,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It could look different in different communities, but we've seen in communities that a trust is established and this conversation doesn't happen and there ends up being tension between different boards.

265
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:09,797
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a housing partnership or committee, then sometimes there's some tension of just not understanding roles.

266
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:35,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really encourage you to have those conversations early and often just to improve your efficiency in your community and really help to strengthen that kind of the housing infrastructure, your ability as a town, as a city to do housing, making sure that you're working, that you're in communication and not duplicating efforts.

267
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:39,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And then

268
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:46,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't say enough to be as transparent as possible.

269
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:55,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't make it difficult for people to understand what your housing trust is all about, what you're working on, what you're funding, who's involved in the work.

270
00:27:56,993 --> 00:28:06,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So use the webpage to put your information out there, have your ordinance out there, who are the trustees, ways that they can maybe get in touch with you.

271
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:16,349
[SPEAKER_08]: When you do create goals and strategies put it out on the web page when you invest in different developments promote that.

272
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,651
[SPEAKER_08]: decide what boards, you really need to be in.

273
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,689
[SPEAKER_08]: communication with, regular communication with, and report back.

274
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:29,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps sometimes do joint board meetings, if that ever makes sense.

275
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:39,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some communities, they like joint board appointments, which it seems like maybe you have done as well, just to help with communication across boards.

276
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:55,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And make sure that the communication is in two directions, that if you have someone from a board that they're reporting back to kind of what that board's doing, if it's really relevant, at the same time that they're kind of reporting back to the board that they also sit on.

277
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:58,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, as much transparency as possible.

278
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:03,403
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that housing development, particularly affordable housing development can be very controversial.

279
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:13,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So just don't create vacuums or spaces where people can make stories, fill it in with what they imagine, make it easy for them to find out what you're doing.

280
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:31,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And it kind of lastly in this section is one thing that you can be working on with other groups such as housing Medford and other boards, the housing authority is really helping to create a culture of support in Medford for affordable housing development.

281
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,166
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an idea that really came out of.

282
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:53,924
[SPEAKER_08]: someone who is from Amherst, this idea of culture of support and her acknowledging that they have different boards working collaboratively over a lot of years to help create this general, much broader support for affordable housing than many of our communities have.

283
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,766
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a resource that's now maybe seems a little bit dated.

284
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit oldish, but it's I think it's really still fantastic.

285
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:08,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just is an effort to test housing messages and wondering why so many of them kind of backfire.

286
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:13,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And they came up with some really, I think, helpful insight.

287
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:14,122
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just Google.

288
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:14,983
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to live here.

289
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:15,824
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still out there.

290
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:20,549
[SPEAKER_08]: But it talks about things like balancing people with places and systems.

291
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:36,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to talk about the people that need affordable housing, but also what are the systems in place that make it difficult for people to access housing in our communities, telling the story of us and not just them, because we all have communities that rely on low and.

292
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:55,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of middle moderate income jobs and so it's it's not just them it's us it's people in our community that need more affordable housing connecting housing to other social issues we we know with lots of research that.

293
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: health outcomes improve educational outcomes improve when people have access to safe affordable housing.

294
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:11,007
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that where you live affects your outcomes and another thing I think can be helpful is to consider the language that you use how you talk about the need in the community and.

295
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,147
[SPEAKER_08]: how you talk about affordable housing.

296
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:21,069
[SPEAKER_08]: In this particular study, they tested home versus housing, and they found that people thought of housing as public housing.

297
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the housing world, we know that public housing is critical.

298
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a critical part of our housing infrastructure.

299
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,491
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, it has some negative connotations for some people.

300
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:37,092
[SPEAKER_08]: They also responded to housing as more of a commodity.

301
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:42,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And with home the word home, they thought more of their family and where they find themselves.

302
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:48,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So even just the way that with the words that we use can impact how people hear what we're saying.

303
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,812
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, I, I try, even though in the development world, it's.

304
00:31:55,832 --> 00:32:10,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Housing developments are called projects that's just the language and development in the development world but I try really hard not to use projects and communities just because of the housing projects and just how negative that is for people I have people who bring up Cabrini green a very old.

305
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:27,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Huge development public housing development in in Chicago that's been redeveloped years ago and I still have people in communities and bring this development up as like their core idea of affordable housing so you know I tried to use development housing development or developing homes, instead of.

306
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:28,546
[SPEAKER_08]: project.

307
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:37,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps spending some time of just thinking through how you're going to frame and talk about the need in the community could potentially be helpful.

308
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And that could be something that you also do with other entities like, like Housing Medford.

309
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:53,474
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to pause and just see if there are any thoughts or questions or feedback at this point.

310
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:57,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the presentation, Charlie.

311
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:00,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions from the committee?

312
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:03,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe just one question.

313
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:09,620
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave examples of ways to fund the trust and who's on the trust.

314
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:20,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give us an example of how the trust has worked with a developer to build affordable housing in a community in Massachusetts?

315
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:35,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm actually going to get into a few examples in this next section on that, because we're seeing more trust engage in disposing of affordable housing, for example, I'm sorry, disposing of municipal land for affordable housing.

316
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,137
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing more trust engaged in that process.

317
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:44,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some cases where the town is actually transferring land to the trust to dispose of for affordable housing.

318
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:50,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have many examples of trusts that are contributing funds towards housing development.

319
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a lot of examples, so we'll do some of that in this next section.

320
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the presentation was over, sorry.

321
00:33:58,173 --> 00:33:58,613
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's okay.

322
00:33:58,653 --> 00:33:59,313
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm sorry.

323
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:19,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I'm just going to get into the kinds of things that you can be funding and because the Community Preservation Act is one of the key resources that people that trust use to fund housing because you have the Community Preservation Act and because the trust statute came after CPA, so it really was

324
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:28,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Having CPA and communities and having these resources that had to go to affordable housing that led to, it kind of inspired the Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund statute.

325
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:35,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to start with some of the language just because these statutes are so closely tied.

326
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:41,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So in CPA, you have these verbs acquire, create, preserve, support.

327
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:53,171
[SPEAKER_08]: and rehab or restore so and then you have the housing on the right hand side so you can use cpa funds to acquire and to create preserve and to support.

328
00:34:54,377 --> 00:35:01,541
[SPEAKER_08]: For rehab and restore, you can use CPA funds if the units were acquired or created with CPA funds.

329
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:08,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So this becomes a little bit more tricky with housing authorities and existing or existing affordable housing that was not funded with CPA.

330
00:35:09,204 --> 00:35:11,725
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot use CPA funds to rehab those units.

331
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,507
[SPEAKER_08]: They really have to be units that were created or acquired with CPA.

332
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:19,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But I start with this kind of frame and then give some examples around that.

333
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:24,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an example of a housing development in Barnstable that was existing housing.

334
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the units had been affordable, but not all of them.

335
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:41,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were, I actually should say that all of these examples were either funded with the CPA or the trust, but they could all be funded by a trust because of the way that these statutes are so closely tied at this point.

336
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:45,534
[SPEAKER_08]: The trust statute was modified recently.

337
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:54,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually been several years now, but to allow for all activities under community housing with the CPA statute to be eligible for the trust.

338
00:35:55,262 --> 00:36:03,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an example of acquiring where there were local funds that were contributed to a nonprofit developer, POA, to acquire this development.

339
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:07,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And now almost all the units are affordable in perpetuity.

340
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:22,117
[SPEAKER_08]: A few of them remained market rate because there were households that were not income qualified and they didn't want to displace anyone, but it was local funds that were used to acquire existing housing that is now primarily affordable in perpetuity.

341
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:29,001
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a variety of trusts that have a buy-down program.

342
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:36,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's small-scale homeownership programs that's helping income-qualified households purchase an existing home in town.

343
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:40,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're structured differently, a variety of different ways.

344
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:52,115
[SPEAKER_08]: In at least one case that I know of, Norfolk, their trust seeks to purchase a few homes each year, modest kind of homes, like the picture that you see here.

345
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:59,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they do any kind of rehab work that's necessary, and then they try to sell them together in a lottery.

346
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:06,704
[SPEAKER_08]: As housing prices have increased, they struggle to get to do as many of these each year.

347
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,226
[SPEAKER_08]: They've tried to do three a year, and I think that they're down to maybe one or two.

348
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:13,708
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's one model where the trust actually buys the homes.

349
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:22,694
[SPEAKER_08]: We have other models where the trust helps to facilitate the sale of a more modest size house to an income qualified household.

350
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:32,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the trust puts in the difference between the agreed upon sale price and what makes it affordable to a household earning 80% of the area median income.

351
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:51,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have at least one trust where they have vouchers that are worth a certain amount of money, and they will do a lottery for, say, they have $50,000 vouchers, maybe they have $100,000, so they have two vouchers, and then they'll do a lottery to see who is qualified within their income level.

352
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They do 100% of the area median income, and then they

353
00:37:56,143 --> 00:38:05,713
[SPEAKER_08]: pick through lottery who gets one of these vouchers and then that household that family has to go out and find the home and around certain parameters of the program.

354
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:09,657
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have this voucher that's that's worth up to $50,000.

355
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is in out in Leverett.

356
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're structured really differently, but it's homeownership, their homeownership programs, small scale.

357
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:22,402
[SPEAKER_08]: They tend to be high subsidy per unit because of the way that they're structured.

358
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:28,186
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a slow accumulation of units, but it can be a way to help folks access home ownership.

359
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:33,811
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be a way to preserve some of the more modest size housing in communities.

360
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:39,295
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some communities where there's teardowns of the smaller, more naturally affordable housing.

361
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:44,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this can be a way to slowly kind of preserve some of those smaller homes in town.

362
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:53,158
[SPEAKER_08]: We have many examples of communities supporting new construction of trusts as well as CPCs.

363
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,560
[SPEAKER_08]: These are three examples of ones where the community was very engaged.

364
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:06,103
[SPEAKER_08]: In Norwell, this site had been a police station that was deemed surplus and then actually transferred to the Housing Trust Fund.

365
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:08,885
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are the ones that put out the request for proposals.

366
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:15,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And they accepted a proposal by a nonprofit developer, Metro West, who built 18 units of age-restricted housing at this location.

367
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:21,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Between the trust and the CPC, they contributed about $1.2 million to this development.

368
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,211
[SPEAKER_08]: In Brewster, this is a housing authority site.

369
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:31,675
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some surplus land that the housing authority owned, and they were working towards building additional housing.

370
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:39,839
[SPEAKER_08]: The town was actively engaged in seeking a Mass Saves grant to do some infrastructure work to make it doable for this development to happen.

371
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they put in a local contribution of $550,000.

372
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have 30 units of affordable rental housing here, additional rental housing.

373
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:57,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in Westport, this is one that the trust really drove this process and it was it was a long process, but they had a municipal site, they had to acquire an adjacent one to be able to access municipal site.

374
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:05,457
[SPEAKER_08]: They did additional pre development work and put out a request for proposals and then also contributed towards the development.

375
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:11,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And now through the community builders, a large nonprofit developer, they have

376
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,306
[SPEAKER_08]: these 50 units of rental housing in Westport.

377
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:22,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So three developments where the community was really actively engaged in helping to move it forward as well as helping to fund them.

378
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:31,172
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have quite a few examples of reusing buildings for affordable housing, and sometimes there's a historic component.

379
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:39,736
[SPEAKER_08]: In Middleborough, this had been a shoe factory, and then a couple of nonprofits were able to work together to redevelop it into 25 units of rental housing.

380
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:42,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The local contribution was only $25,000.

381
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:47,580
[SPEAKER_08]: They were a new CPA community at the time, and they just didn't have that many resources, but they put in what they could.

382
00:40:48,808 --> 00:40:57,854
[SPEAKER_08]: In Williamstown, this had been a factory that a developer redeveloped into 42 units of rental housing with a local contribution as well.

383
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:00,496
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the two on the bottom are schools.

384
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:04,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are quite a few examples of schools being redeveloped into affordable housing.

385
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:18,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And in both of these cases, and which is oftentimes the case with schools, is that there was an addition built onto the historic part of the building in order to add units to make it more financially feasible.

386
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:22,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the left, Sloan Scott, it's 38 units of age-restricted rental housing.

387
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:27,148
[SPEAKER_08]: On the right is Auburn, and it's 55 units of age-restricted rental housing.

388
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:36,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So adaptive reuse, and you may already know this, but oftentimes the reuse of existing buildings is less controversial than new construction.

389
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can be kind of a win-win for if there's a historic component for people, for those in the community that appreciate historic preservation.

390
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:47,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can help.

391
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It can help a development in some cases.

392
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And then preserve.

393
00:41:55,015 --> 00:42:04,630
[SPEAKER_08]: In the CPA statute, we do see some communities trying to put a lot of stuff under preserve, but preserve, the definition in CPA is actually a pretty high bar.

394
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,177
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the protection of personal or real property from injury, harm, or destruction.

395
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:12,760
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not rehab.

396
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just putting in new sinks or countertops.

397
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:19,525
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is much greater than that.

398
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:25,409
[SPEAKER_08]: It's protecting the units from not being habitable or losing their affordability restriction.

399
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:31,153
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a memo that was put out by DHCD, now EOHLC, that helped

400
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:40,017
[SPEAKER_08]: articulate this to housing authorities of what would qualify for preserve, what would really be rehab and what would be maintenance.

401
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:42,037
[SPEAKER_08]: So CPA funds are never allowed for maintenance.

402
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:49,959
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you are not familiar with this, you might want to be familiar with this and I can send it over just so you can read through a little bit.

403
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:58,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talk about preserve affordable housing, we are oftentimes talking about the affordability restriction.

404
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:01,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Many restrictions are set to expire.

405
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:13,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there are trusts as well as CPCs that are engaged in extending affordability on units to keep them affordable for a longer period of time or in perpetuity if you're using CPA funds.

406
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:15,309
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an example in Amherst.

407
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:19,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was not a trust, this was not the trust driven, this was CPA because they bonded.

408
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:25,957
[SPEAKER_08]: But this was a development in, it's a development in Amherst that has 41 units that are affordable.

409
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,017
[SPEAKER_08]: They were set to expire.

410
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: They only had 15 year restrictions.

411
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:37,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a financing product, I think, with mass housing and the owner at the time was not interested in extending the affordability.

412
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:39,468
[SPEAKER_08]: The community was very concerned about losing these units.

413
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:44,693
[SPEAKER_08]: They reached out to MHP and a plan was brought up to reach out to.

414
00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:50,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, I'm forgetting the developer offhand.

415
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:59,212
[SPEAKER_08]: A large developer that has experience in low-income housing tax credits in 40B and Beacon communities reached out to Beacon.

416
00:43:59,312 --> 00:44:03,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Beacon actually negotiated with the owner at the time to buy the development.

417
00:44:03,453 --> 00:44:11,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the community decided to bond $1.25 million of CPA funds so that these 41 units are now affordable in perpetuity.

418
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:19,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So some trusts are paying attention to affordability restrictions that are set to expire, and they're a part of the conversation.

419
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:23,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes that's working with the CPC or with the planning department.

420
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are some trusts where they're paying attention to that.

421
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:33,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something you could consider if that seems an appropriate role for the trust.

422
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:34,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

423
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:36,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And also with reserve.

424
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:37,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, go ahead.

425
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:39,517
[SPEAKER_08]: One question about that.

426
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:49,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the municipal entity get a notice when affordability restriction is going to expire?

427
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:55,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a list that CDAC manages that you could, I'll send that to you.

428
00:44:56,124 --> 00:45:00,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a list that does have some of that information.

429
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:06,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something also just with your local monitoring of affordable housing that you should

430
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,896
[SPEAKER_08]: If Medford, you might already have someone that's doing that.

431
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:18,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because of the community of your size that typically there's someone is already kind of paying attention to that.

432
00:45:18,506 --> 00:45:21,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So it should be available readily available to you.

433
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:21,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

434
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

435
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:33,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, so with preserve also part of what comes out of protecting from harm is work around kind of the envelope of the building.

436
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:44,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an example in Gloucester where they had a unit that was already shuttered in this building because of leaking, the roof was leaking and you need to get down.

437
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:47,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And they used

438
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:56,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Some CPA funds, so they requested some CPA funds to supplement state modernization formula funding in order to replace the roof.

439
00:45:56,133 --> 00:46:07,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So because other units were at risk of no longer being habitable, they used some CPA funds under preserve along with these other state funds to replace the roof.

440
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:15,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an example of what could qualify under preserve with existing housing that wasn't created or acquired with CPA funds.

441
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:22,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And then under support, there are a variety of activities that have been seen as allowable.

442
00:46:23,557 --> 00:46:26,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is the same for the trusts.

443
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:38,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So pre-development work, if you have a municipal site that you're interested in seeing used for affordable housing, you could potentially use some trust resources to do some pre-development work and to help put together a request for proposals.

444
00:46:39,573 --> 00:46:48,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You could potentially use trust resources to update your housing plans and rental assistance is explicitly allowed in the CPA statute.

445
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:51,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's also something that the trust could be engaged in.

446
00:46:51,381 --> 00:47:01,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And during the pandemic, it was actually the housing trust in several communities that were the ones that really instigated and that funded emergency rent assistance.

447
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:04,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've seen several communities, several trusts engaged in that kind of work.

448
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:17,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It may take some time to talk more about types of plans that can be included in support, or should we take some time later after the presentation to talk about that?

449
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:21,049
[SPEAKER_08]: You're asking me?

450
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

451
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,412
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean what could fit under housing plans?

452
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:26,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

453
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:38,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we take some time later to talk about it or pause for a moment to talk about examples of what we might consider for our support for housing plans here?

454
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:49,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, what we've seen in the past is that sometimes the trust resources are used to update the housing production plan, for example, or to do a housing needs analysis.

455
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:57,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really in line with kind of what we've seen as kind of more of the standard kind of

456
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,703
[SPEAKER_08]: plans that communities start with.

457
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:16,812
[SPEAKER_05]: A question that came up specifically for us is whether it could be used for, say, a nexus study or a linkage study to help generate another source of income for the trust.

458
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:21,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have had communities ask about that.

459
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:27,778
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just go back to the purpose of the trust, which is to create or preserve affordable housing for low and moderate income households.

460
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:35,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, you could make arguments otherwise, like is a housing production plan necessarily doing that?

461
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's to lead to that.

462
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:51,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So a step further then is whether CPA funds, specifically if CPA funds are what are going to be housing trust, can CPA funds be used for that purpose?

463
00:48:52,652 --> 00:48:54,814
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think the CPA funds could be used for that, no.

464
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:04,623
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had other resources, you maybe could consider that, because if it's, I mean, I think it's still really a stretch, is what I'm sure that I've told other communities.

465
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:12,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd rather kind of think it through offline a little bit and not, if you're recording this and all that, like, I don't want to kind of misspeak, I want to be more thoughtful.

466
00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:21,407
[SPEAKER_08]: But I definitely don't think that CPA funds could be used for anything studying linkage.

467
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:24,648
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because that's not at all in line with what CPA is.

468
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:25,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not about

469
00:49:26,688 --> 00:49:29,310
[SPEAKER_08]: researching funding a trust like that, that's not, no.

470
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:38,175
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have other resources, you know, like we can maybe think it through a little bit or I would just wanna kind of put out some questions for you to think through.

471
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:44,758
[SPEAKER_08]: None of us are the trust police and so, you know, it's implemented locally.

472
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:50,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just wanna like put out kind of questions or things to think about and then you would work through it yourself.

473
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:53,063
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm happy to do more of that kind of offline a little bit.

474
00:49:54,087 --> 00:50:04,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And while you're thinking about it offline, Shelly, it would be $80,000 to do a nexus study to add a portable housing component to our linkage fees.

475
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:20,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So developers would be paying into parks and open space, public safety, and we would like to do a nexus study so they start paying into a fourth bucket, which would be towards affordable housing.

476
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:26,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Offline link through it because I've made a connection.

477
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

478
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:29,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add a follow up question?

479
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:32,656
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding with CPA funds was.

480
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:39,944
[SPEAKER_05]: For support, it had to support the creation of a new of affordable.

481
00:50:40,882 --> 00:50:48,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's my understanding that CPA is either related to housing units or to households.

482
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:58,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was my instinct also that that would be a no for the NEXUS study, but I knew that the question was in the air, so I just wanted to make sure that we covered it.

483
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:00,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

484
00:51:00,636 --> 00:51:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say definitely not for a NEXUS study with CPA funds.

485
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:18,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think Shelley, if you do have questions to kick back to us to consider around the research area, I'd be super interested in that to help think through what it could apply to or not.

486
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:23,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, very interested if you could share that.

487
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:28,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I will put that in the email, just kind of some of the questions that I would suggest that you think through.

488
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

489
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:31,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

490
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:50,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just going to wrap up here that just kind of some final thoughts is to that we're really suggest that trust, especially new trust that you really consider your local infrastructure that you kind of look at the lay of the land, the needs and the resources and think through what is your niche, so that you're not duplicating, you're not stepping on any toes and really articulate

491
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:56,774
[SPEAKER_08]: your role in the community, develop goals that reflect identified needs.

492
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we really say, start with the data.

493
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:16,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that data doesn't convince everyone, but we really strongly urge that you start with that and that you are investing your resources with a reflection of the needs that have been identified in the community.

494
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:18,381
[SPEAKER_08]: So often,

495
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:27,997
[SPEAKER_08]: boards will be tempted to do kind of take the path of least resistance that is not necessarily a reflection of the true need or the real need in the community.

496
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:33,519
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be hearsay or might be what certain influential people want, but that's not necessarily a reflection of needs.

497
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:40,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really suggest that you start with identified needs and that you be real about your capacity, honest about what you can do.

498
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a volunteer board, you have limited resources, and that gets back to why I really suggest two or three goals at a time.

499
00:52:47,443 --> 00:52:59,107
[SPEAKER_08]: just to make sure that you can do a few things well instead of being really frustrated with having a hard time doing anything because you have really high expectations for yourself or too high of expectations.

500
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:00,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So be real about your capacity.

501
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:02,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there are a lot of different resources.

502
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:05,770
[SPEAKER_08]: MHP has a bunch of online resources that we've put together here.

503
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,151
[SPEAKER_08]: and we want to be a resource for you.

504
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:24,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, as well as my colleagues, are here to help answer questions, or I have some that have experience that I don't have, technical experience that I don't have, and we're here to help you move housing forward in your community.

505
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:25,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't be shy.

506
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:34,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there other questions or thoughts or comments that anyone wants to share?

507
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:43,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very thorough and thank you so much for the presentation and being with us on a Wednesday night and giving us your time.

508
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:47,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions from the committee?

509
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:48,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

510
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:49,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

511
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:49,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

512
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:50,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you.

513
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:11,496
[SPEAKER_06]: The main officers, we have volunteers to serve as chair, vice chair, and treasurer.

514
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:20,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two volunteers for chair, Lisa Ann and Penny.

515
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:26,066
[SPEAKER_06]: We have three for vice chair, Kayla, Lisa Ann, and Penny.

516
00:54:26,506 --> 00:54:28,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And for treasurer, we have Carrie.

517
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:30,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for volunteering.

518
00:54:36,952 --> 00:54:39,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a nomination for the treasurer?

519
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:40,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie?

520
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:49,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I will admit, I've never done the treasury, so I will need to, but I just said I wanted help to get more involved.

521
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

522
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the city's treasurer is going to manage the funds, and you will just communicate that?

523
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

524
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you may be able to sign here.

525
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,753
[SPEAKER_06]: to nominate Carrie as treasurer.

526
00:55:06,773 --> 00:55:10,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seconded by... I think you do not have to.

527
00:55:10,214 --> 00:55:11,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Roberta.

528
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:14,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Penny and Roberta with the nominations.

529
00:55:14,975 --> 00:55:17,115
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

530
00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:18,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

531
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:18,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

532
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:19,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

533
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:19,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

534
00:55:19,636 --> 00:55:21,736
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

535
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Carrie, thank you.

536
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:24,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations, you are our treasurer.

537
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:26,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go with the chair first, because there are two...

538
00:55:34,172 --> 00:55:35,533
[SPEAKER_06]: two people that volunteered.

539
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:38,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Roberta and I did too, but nobody else did.

540
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:42,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did not volunteer for anything.

541
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:51,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We said we'd do it, but I didn't want to be, one election every two years isn't good for me.

542
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa Ann Davidson and Penny, and then we vote for vice chair too.

543
00:55:56,162 --> 00:56:03,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just so everybody knows, we have Kayla, thank you so much for volunteering to work on the Declaration of Trust.

544
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:12,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the action plan, Roberta, Kayla, Penny, and Lisa-Ann, and we can only do up to three.

545
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:15,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know probably want to spread the love.

546
00:56:17,505 --> 00:56:18,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the full picture.

547
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:20,547
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go through the chair first.

548
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:23,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Lisa-Ann and Penny.

549
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:28,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So we chatted, either one.

550
00:56:33,074 --> 00:56:34,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, easygoing.

551
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:36,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those things, though.

552
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:40,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I put my name in for either one, just not knowing who was going to be there.

553
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:49,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to serve as the chair, but tell me what you want to know, and we'll work from there.

554
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:52,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I would nominate you to be the chair.

555
00:56:57,107 --> 00:56:58,088
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll do the same way.

556
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

557
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great idea.

558
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:01,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try nominating.

559
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I nominate Lisa Ann.

560
00:57:04,272 --> 00:57:04,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

561
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:05,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

562
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:05,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

563
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:05,813
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

564
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:05,993
Aye.

565
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:06,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a 7-0 vote.

566
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:08,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations, Lisa Ann.

567
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:08,634
[SPEAKER_06]: You are our chair.

568
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

569
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:11,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

570
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:30,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And for vice-chair, we have Kayla and Penny.

571
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:38,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with maybe the declaration of trust in my court, officially, I can.

572
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:39,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

573
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:40,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

574
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Penny, seconded by Lisa Ann.

575
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,000
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

576
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:45,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

577
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

578
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:56,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Penny, for stepping up.

579
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:57,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You are our vice chair.

580
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

581
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

582
00:58:02,343 --> 00:58:07,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, the next item agenda up is to establish working groups.

583
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our first working group, which is the Declaration of Trust.

584
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Kayla, thank you so much for volunteering to participate in drafting our Declaration of Trust.

585
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:20,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anybody like to join this group?

586
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:26,236
[SPEAKER_06]: review what's written.

587
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:26,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I could help.

588
00:58:27,176 --> 00:58:32,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much.

589
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:38,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends on the community, but roughly maybe 10 pages or less.

590
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:41,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah.

591
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have exactly what happens from the neighboring communities and we can work on that.

592
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And KP Law, our legal counsel will definitely review it.

593
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:52,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

594
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:54,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

595
00:58:54,548 --> 00:58:56,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also happy to review and ask a lot of questions.

596
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

597
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,123
[SPEAKER_09]: In the next meeting, we'll share the draft so everybody can provide comments.

598
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:17,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

599
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And working group number two is the trust action plan.

600
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,071
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 volunteers can only have up to 3.

601
00:59:38,611 --> 00:59:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do have a question about that working group if that's okay.

602
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:53,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So in what way does the action plan kind of incorporate what MHP just talked about in terms of 2 or 3 goals and reviewing the housing production plan?

603
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:56,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that part of the action plan or is the action plan like 1 of those?

604
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:58,339
[SPEAKER_04]: items.

605
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:14,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the action plan where the working group will review the housing production plan and then identify goals that would align with the housing production plan and then probably identify measurable goals like MHCs have to stay in one place.

606
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:15,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And setting up a trust is a goal, right?

607
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The declaration of trust?

608
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:21,853
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the establishing.

609
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:22,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

610
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:23,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a goal of ours.

611
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:24,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

612
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:26,396
[SPEAKER_06]: To establish what we just learned about.

613
01:00:26,937 --> 01:00:29,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And drafting a mission statement.

615
01:00:33,323 --> 01:00:38,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

616
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:42,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you're drafting a declaration to trust you want to be involved in both.

617
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll start with just declaration.

618
01:00:46,134 --> 01:00:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put you on the spot.

619
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:56,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would be the only thing Roberta is doing as far as these two sections.

620
01:00:57,131 --> 01:01:00,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be Roberta, Penny, and Lisanne.

621
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And will she just support those three?

622
01:01:02,975 --> 01:01:05,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

623
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:05,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

624
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:09,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody, for volunteering.

625
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,561
[SPEAKER_06]: We can discuss the meeting schedule for group one and group two.

626
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:17,503
[SPEAKER_06]: How often would the working groups prefer to meet in a month?

627
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:26,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The working groups can be virtually in person based on the members availability and flexibility.

628
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:32,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Kayla and I can discuss and based on your introductory, we can meet before the next meeting.

629
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:32,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

630
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:39,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And the working group, second working group, would you feel comfortable to coordinate between the members?

631
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:42,122
[SPEAKER_02]: How often would you like to meet?

632
01:01:43,735 --> 01:01:45,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's hard to say.

633
01:01:45,996 --> 01:02:09,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably we need, um, to me, I mean, at least once to start off and then probably, um, like once a month or every couple of weeks would be sufficient because there's going to be some like drafting on our own and then bringing that together with the group.

634
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:15,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm hearing I just want to make sure I'm hearing correctly.

635
01:02:15,472 --> 01:02:15,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

636
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:23,082
[SPEAKER_05]: More than less than 1, it's it depends how quickly we want to have this drafted.

637
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:26,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, there's probably a finite number of.

638
01:02:27,191 --> 01:02:29,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Meetings that we need to have to draft the plan.

639
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:33,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So, are we getting that work done in a short span of time?

640
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are we going to take a few months to get that work done?

641
01:02:38,774 --> 01:02:40,235
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's really the.

642
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:53,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So, does it make sense if we meet during the month of September and come back in October with a plan of how long because it gives us time to kind of wrap our heads around it look at schedules.

643
01:02:54,266 --> 01:03:16,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

644
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:24,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how long would, how quickly would we like to have an action plan?

645
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:29,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what, what is our goal for having an action plan completed?

646
01:03:32,427 --> 01:03:37,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody probably has full-time jobs, so we can't do as long as it doesn't take.

647
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:43,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is there a solution that we need to like work backwards from to have it completed?

648
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:46,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's something that we can, it would be

649
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't want to put a time frame on it right now, only again, because of all of our different schedules that we have here.

650
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Shelly was saying is take our time and really think it through.

651
01:03:57,662 --> 01:04:10,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm somebody, I like to have what we're going to do and then start breaking down the steps and then see how long it's going to take to do it that way.

652
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to set us up with something that we're not

653
01:04:16,076 --> 01:04:17,057
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be able to move.

654
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:17,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

655
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:22,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanted to clarify, the action plan includes both the mission statement and our goals, correct?

656
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:30,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there are some things that might come before other things, which I think we can talk about in our meeting and present the group as like a whole goal.

657
01:04:31,103 --> 01:04:42,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And then digesting the plan that we already have, the production plan that's there, and how can we make it down and break it down into doable steps with

658
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:53,214
[SPEAKER_05]: one or two years exactly what shall it show and nothing unattainable.

659
01:04:53,254 --> 01:05:05,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Some communities, those who have drafted the action plan have approached the community and involved them in drafting the action plans that has taken much longer.

660
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:11,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And some communities have chosen not to have a stakeholder engagement or community engagement as well.

661
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

662
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:18,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, we have our CPA application.

663
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:24,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's due very soon, so we need to finalize that.

664
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:29,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it over to Aditi to provide us an overview of your application.

665
01:05:50,636 --> 01:05:56,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So in big picture way, we have four projects.

666
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Shelly mentioned, they are developments and not projects, to clarify.

667
01:06:07,123 --> 01:06:12,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is to develop affordable housing on city or not.

668
01:06:13,188 --> 01:06:15,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know your thoughts.

669
01:06:15,249 --> 01:06:16,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two scenarios.

670
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:19,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Scenario one, where we could approach mass housing.

671
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a grant program called Planning for Housing Production Grant.

672
01:06:26,598 --> 01:06:34,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did have a meeting with them last Friday to check if Medford is eligible, because on their website they said that only gateway cities could apply.

673
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:40,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is eligible to apply and they accept applications on a rolling basis.

674
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:44,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the trust is ready to apply, we can go ahead and apply.

675
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:51,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have funded projects through technical assistance.

676
01:06:51,987 --> 01:07:00,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cost of the projects have been $50,000 to $100,000 based on the scale of the affordable housing development.

677
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:04,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would require a 10% local match.

678
01:07:05,665 --> 01:07:13,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we apply for CPA funds to have a local match, that would be helpful.

679
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:23,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And scenario two is if we are successful in getting the grant, then we would probably have to rely on CPA funds.

680
01:07:23,515 --> 01:07:25,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that would be roughly between $50,000 to $100,000 per project.

681
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on that?

682
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:43,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanna make sure that I, and I'm sorry, it takes me a little bit to process, so I wanna make sure that I'm understanding.

683
01:07:45,007 --> 01:08:03,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Scenario one is to, with the help of, housing, thank you, to be able to acquire, to be able to develop land on already city-owned land, develop housing, city-owned land.

684
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:16,037
[SPEAKER_02]: to acquire technical assistance so they can help walk us through the whole process to assess the city on lots and then do pre-development work and then draft an RFP.

685
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:16,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

686
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:17,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

687
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:30,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And then project two is support construction of new affordable housing.

688
01:08:30,926 --> 01:08:42,633
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very general proposal, but if you have any further thoughts on this, then we could include that, but this is just hoping that in the pipeline we have these projects.

689
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:50,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And then project three is to build a farm to purchase land where it becomes available.

690
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:57,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the fourth one, down payment assistance.

691
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:07,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Lisa proposed this, but just to clarify, North Suburban Consortium that we are part of has a down payment assistance program.

692
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:15,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have funded up to five Medford residents in the last five years.

693
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:21,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And they provide, I'm just trying to see what's the amount that they provide, up to $10,000.

694
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:26,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and Roberta had some comments on this.

695
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:42,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not sure that CPA funds can be used for that type of down payment assistance, but the example that Shelly gave earlier of a buy-down program, CPA could be used for a buy-down program.

696
01:09:43,515 --> 01:09:50,601
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just had up a level, a thought about what we've just looked through on the application.

697
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps instead of project, you could frame it as example.

698
01:09:55,865 --> 01:10:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are examples of the types of projects that we might do, because we haven't developed a plan yet.

699
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,773
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't actually know how we want to use the funds.

700
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:09,596
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could frame it that these are examples.

701
01:10:10,557 --> 01:10:30,611
[SPEAKER_05]: drawn from the housing production plan and that these are potential ways that we might use the funds and that we'll be developing a plan that will guide us which we will provide the committee with with the TPC before using the funds.

702
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:35,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So would down payment

703
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:46,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you not have the voucher program to provide down payment or is the North Suburban Consortium doing very specific?

704
01:10:46,051 --> 01:10:54,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would be required for CPA is that we would give the funding in exchange for a long-term deed restriction.

705
01:10:55,478 --> 01:11:02,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So that $5,000, $10,000 down payment assistance is just a gift without any requirement in return.

706
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:06,079
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be a quid pro quo for CPA funding.

707
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to be acquiring the deed restriction for it to be eligible.

708
01:11:11,523 --> 01:11:16,366
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't, the deed restriction doesn't necessarily have to be in perpetuity.

709
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do a long term.

710
01:11:19,368 --> 01:11:24,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can do a 25, a 20 year deed restriction and it doesn't have to be

711
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: how I read that, that that's the North, the NSCs, like when I proposed it, I was thinking something bigger than what NSC does, because A, you're gonna give it to Medford residents only, purchasing in the city of Medford, NSC caps the income at 80% of AMI, CPA allows you to go up to 100% of AMI, and people who are making a moderate,

712
01:11:52,772 --> 01:11:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: which is 81 and up, they still are finding it difficult to purchase.

713
01:11:58,396 --> 01:12:05,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not make that funding available for higher income households?

714
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:14,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just giving more, and it will definitely need to be for 20 years, 10,000 division needs to do a little bit more than that.

715
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:26,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also felt that if we're going to put in the application an example of down payment assistance, that we should also put in the application an example of rental assistance.

716
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:37,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about doing the rental, asking about rental assistance, but it sounds like the CPC is already doing rental assistance.

717
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:42,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are an idea when I was thinking about it, you know, I'm thinking about what

718
01:12:43,018 --> 01:12:49,864
[SPEAKER_05]: The city of some of what I'm used to working with, and they do do 2 years worth of rental assistance.

719
01:12:49,924 --> 01:12:51,085
[SPEAKER_05]: They do prevention.

720
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,546
[SPEAKER_05]: They do all of this.

721
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:58,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured that that would continue through the CPC and sometimes.

722
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:03,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a question whether, you know, like, that's a question about the future.

723
01:13:05,445 --> 01:13:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we didn't have an affordable housing trust, the organizations applied directly to the CPC for that money.

724
01:13:11,868 --> 01:13:25,716
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe Medford will evolve to something closer to what Somerville does, where all of the housing assistance goes through the affordable housing trust and not the CPC.

725
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:31,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might or might not change in that direction.

726
01:13:32,572 --> 01:13:38,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would maybe as an example, like this is why we need to develop the plan.

727
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:44,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd include it as an example, but that's not necessarily what we're going to do.

728
01:13:51,760 --> 01:14:01,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So regarding dental assistance program, do I include some language on that based on the current dental assistance program that is funded by CPC?

729
01:14:08,895 --> 01:14:12,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are some of the, yeah, go ahead.

730
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:18,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just gonna say, I can share with you that language so we can connect with that.

731
01:14:19,638 --> 01:14:20,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

732
01:14:21,838 --> 01:14:27,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other examples that you would like to include apart from private fees?

733
01:14:39,977 --> 01:14:45,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And Roberta had some comments on question three, so I'm going to update it.

734
01:14:46,383 --> 01:14:51,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to identify the appropriate CPA allowable uses.

735
01:14:51,608 --> 01:15:00,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So example one, which is to build affordable housing on secure lots would be under create and not support.

736
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:10,595
[SPEAKER_02]: example two is create, but example three would be under acquire, that's acquiring property or purchasing land through CPA funds.

737
01:15:11,275 --> 01:15:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And then example four, down payment assistance would be under support.

738
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And example five or fifth one would be, that's rental assistance would also be under support.

739
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:24,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

740
01:15:24,982 --> 01:15:27,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

741
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:35,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just go over this, but if you have any comments, please feel free to talk to me.

742
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:39,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We are asking for $250,000.

743
01:15:40,009 --> 01:15:53,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And some background information of some of the potential funding sources that we would explore.

744
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,860
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the mass housing grant.

745
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:05,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one is we're looking at affordable housing linkage.

746
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: We still don't identify funds.

747
01:16:07,903 --> 01:16:16,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And this third one is a developer that's developing housing developments.

748
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: The MDDC, that's the Mystic Valley Development Commission, has agreed to contribute $250,000 to the

749
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:33,532
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are yet to record the agreement and hopefully we'll have that coming soon.

750
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:41,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Then other potential fund resources is something that the trust will explore.

751
01:16:51,952 --> 01:16:56,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a typo under applicant on the page you just got to page 11.

752
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:08,627
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I saw it like last night.

753
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back to the one you just clicked to.

754
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:11,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, go forward, I guess.

755
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:12,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Go forward one more.

756
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:13,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

757
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,192
[SPEAKER_07]: No, all the way to where we were.

758
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:17,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, where the budget page.

759
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:22,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so an applicant, affordable has the double A at the beginning on the top right.

760
01:17:22,937 --> 01:17:23,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

761
01:17:23,317 --> 01:17:24,298
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of time.

762
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:31,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

763
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:41,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering for other things that we're applying for financial support.

764
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:50,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we ever put in any like sustainability grant applications that would be used for affordable housing?

765
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:57,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe like decarbonization projects for any of the housing units or like

766
01:17:57,436 --> 01:17:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: new roof and then also put solar on it.

767
01:18:00,178 --> 01:18:02,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that we do?

768
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:09,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, do we call it out here that it's like a synergy pot of money we have?

769
01:18:10,425 --> 01:18:17,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great thing to put in our plan, but it might be premature to put it in this application.

770
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:17,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

771
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:25,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just didn't know if we had existing other funds that we're thinking about or other grants that we already have, but we haven't considered.

772
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:27,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Solar ordinance.

773
01:18:27,214 --> 01:18:28,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of any other grants.

774
01:18:30,636 --> 01:18:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I should check with our climate planner if there are other grants.

775
01:18:34,718 --> 01:18:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any comments on the budget?

776
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,143
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just tentative.

777
01:18:45,544 --> 01:18:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it will change.

778
01:18:50,646 --> 01:18:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we require a letter from the mayor.

779
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:53,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

780
01:18:57,953 --> 01:19:02,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So the application deadline is next week on Monday.

781
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:09,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So update it based on your comments and then share that with you before I submit it.

782
01:19:09,139 --> 01:19:13,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

783
01:19:15,522 --> 01:19:18,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to clarify Penny's question.

784
01:19:18,943 --> 01:19:26,107
[SPEAKER_02]: If a municipal employee can serve as a treasurer, the KP law has clarified that.

785
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, if you're employed in another city.

786
01:19:29,738 --> 01:19:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

787
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:37,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

788
01:19:38,226 --> 01:19:39,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Great meeting.

789
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that is on our agenda.

790
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate you being here and the work ahead.

791
01:19:45,873 --> 01:19:48,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all the committees and Kayla.

792
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:53,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I see a lot of other items or just on the agenda.

793
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:56,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You can call, you can talk to the DP myself.

794
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just can't talk to more than the forum to make sense of something else.

795
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:03,812
[SPEAKER_06]: The meetings, and if you have one in a gender item, you can reach out to.

796
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

797
01:20:21,802 --> 01:20:22,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

798
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:24,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Secretary, can you drop me?

799
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:25,024
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

800
01:20:25,044 --> 01:20:25,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

801
01:20:25,204 --> 01:20:25,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

802
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:26,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting is adjourned.

803
01:20:26,385 --> 01:20:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a date?

804
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:31,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on October 2nd at 6 p.m.

805
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,630
