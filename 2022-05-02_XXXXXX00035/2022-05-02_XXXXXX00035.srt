1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're trying something a little bit new.

3
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:11,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with my co-host for today, Chelly.

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everybody, this is Chelly.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we did an interview with Mia Mastone from the school committee.

6
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:20,365
[SPEAKER_00]: We both really enjoyed talking with her and I hope you do too.

7
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,821
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you both for being here today.

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:33,629
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying something a little bit different where I have a co host here with me today.

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:38,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll remind you all that my name is Danielle, I use she and her pronouns.

10
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And today my co host

11
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:41,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.

12
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Chali Keshavan.

13
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thrilled to be here.

14
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:46,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle is a game changer.

15
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:49,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to be participating in this work.

16
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the human rights chair.

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the VP at West Medford Community Center, and I serve on the board at Medford Health Matters.

18
00:00:56,593 --> 00:01:03,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're a couple hats in the city of Medford, and I'm about to add mom in the Medford Public Schools.

19
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:06,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thrilled to be here with Mia for this particular conversation.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,941
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guests, if you could introduce yourself.

21
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:10,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So with your name, pronouns, a bit about yourself.

22
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:12,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.

23
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,225
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Mima Stone.

24
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: She and her pronouns.

25
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,529
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the beginning of my fourth term on the school committee.

26
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:22,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I was elected in 2015.

27
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Time flies.

28
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:29,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently I have four children in Medford Public Schools.

29
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:37,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a junior at Medford High, an eighth and a seventh grader at the Andrews, and a fourth grader at the Roberts Elementary.

30
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for having me.

31
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:40,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first question for everybody is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

33
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:53,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So because all the kids have different favorite places, we try to make the rounds.

34
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Rowan loves Collette's Bakery.

35
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: She loves the bread there.

36
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:02,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Nevin and Declan are partial to Colleen's and their ice cream.

37
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Teagan and Cullen are big Tenoch people.

38
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Quinn, who's now in school in Vermont, but when she's home, I'm trying to think of what Quinn's go-to probably is.

39
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:22,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she'd probably say she would want, oh I know, a sandwich at the Magnificent Muffin.

40
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,425
[SPEAKER_02]: She loves their breakfast sandwiches.

41
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:25,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

42
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:26,687
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?

43
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that's a good point.

44
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:38,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Tim and I can sneak out, it's usually to Salvatore's because it's close to home and it's good food and it's quick and we know we're not far from the house.

45
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:39,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

46
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:43,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you wouldn't be alone in answering that question based on your kids needs.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's our lives too.

48
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Which place do we go to today?

49
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:47,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

50
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:48,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

52
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:50,097
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

53
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:56,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start out, if you could talk a little bit about how you decided initially to run for school committee.

54
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:57,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

55
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:06,062
[SPEAKER_02]: People probably who follow Method Politics are probably tired of this story, but I will share it again.

56
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015, in the summer, a young man announced he was running John Emerald, and he had a press release in the paper, and I read it.

57
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:14,829
[SPEAKER_02]: He had great ideas.

58
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:17,371
[SPEAKER_02]: He was an Arlington High School teacher,

59
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:29,302
[SPEAKER_02]: He was probably, I would think, maybe mid 20s, but the ideas escape me now, but I thought, well, this young man has great ideas for the students.

60
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dad was over and I was saying, Dad, I'm going to hold a sign for this young man.

61
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:55,880
[SPEAKER_02]: know when he has a sign hold out in the square what have you and my dad said why don't you hold your own damn sign so I said oh okay so he said Mia you're always at the schools you're always you know trying to make things work at the Roberts at the time I only had kids at the Roberts this is um

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Quinn was at the Andrews.

63
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:03,342
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, um, so the kids were around and they said, yeah, mom, you should do it.

64
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You should do it.

65
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:09,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what prompted to me to run as well as at the same time.

66
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:19,045
[SPEAKER_02]: The kindergarten powers were only half day and whoever was in kindergarten at the time had a pretty.

67
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:24,290
[SPEAKER_02]: um, large class with only a half-time para.

68
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:32,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had attended a school committee meeting right before I probably had the conversation with my dad saying, could we have full-time paras?

69
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And the school committee at the time was very receptive.

70
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it didn't happen immediately.

71
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I ran and when I was sworn in, it was still a topic.

72
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

73
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:48,265
[SPEAKER_02]: it was probably six months into my first term that full-time aides were approved in the budget.

74
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:52,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the real, I really just, that's what I ran on.

75
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The first election was full-time kindergarten in Paris.

76
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,830
Thank you.

77
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:58,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

78
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, I am stepping back into Medford, but this time with my mom hat on.

79
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:10,341
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of us who are new, how do I learn about the school committee?

80
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the spaces in Medford where I can get that information?

81
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:17,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how do I become in the know?

82
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:18,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

83
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in your same exact spot.

84
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:26,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I could have named one school committee member before I went to that first meeting.

85
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:48,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is an excellent question, because there is not a thorough explanation of the school committee on our city's website about our roles and responsibilities, about our policies, which we're working on now.

86
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:50,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We just did pass an 18-page

87
00:05:51,912 --> 00:06:00,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Policy so that, you know, if you were to be a new member of the school committee, you would have this policy book to know how the school committee meetings run.

88
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:13,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think going to the school committee meetings is probably the most helpful because you see, oh, the agenda is posted the Friday before the meeting.

89
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:17,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So the agenda is the most helpful because then you know what the topics are that will be addressed.

90
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:26,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But then attending in person to hear from the community members that speak, to hear from the other school committee members who share their questions or ideas.

91
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:50,146
[SPEAKER_02]: you're right it's almost you have to get right into the groundwork and go to the meetings to find out what the topics are and how um because there's not even a place after the meetings to find out until the minutes are released of what the votes were on the different resolutions or motions sure and i think i guess i'm also wondering like how do i learn

92
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: like as a parent, what services are available through the committee, like for what reasons would I reach out?

93
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,668
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of like, you know, do I go to the principal for this concern?

94
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I go to school?

95
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I go to superintendent?

96
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what really maybe the structure looks like?

97
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an excellent question.

98
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not clearly defined.

99
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:17,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I think school committee members ourselves sometimes have differing opinions of what is appropriate for us to

100
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to a parent, you know, we have, I'm just saying, in recent times that I can remember, we've received emails about the after school program.

101
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,393
[SPEAKER_02]: the length of recess, the food service options.

102
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:42,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them we can address or say where it's been discussed at past meetings.

103
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:48,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Some we do have to recommend they get in touch with the person who is that's under their jurisdiction.

104
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, I think

105
00:07:52,769 --> 00:08:11,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Any parent with any question is welcome to email us and I try to find the right person to connect them with because I do know more of the administration and the staff and the directors because it is overwhelming to try to figure out which person would a person need a parent need to reach out to to get an answer.

106
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to connect.

107
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:29,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there spaces or evenings where, and I realized that lockdown has colored everything but in the past where there are times where a school committee convened so that folks had sort of access where they're like public events that maybe were not school committee meetings or more social.

108
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:37,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So the office hours would be the best place to share your concerns or questions or thoughts.

109
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:47,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have three or more school committee members have an open forum because then it's broken, breaking open meeting law because there'd be no official posting our agenda.

110
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could meet with three school committee members, which has happened in the past, if there's a specific concern, you know, before COVID, we had met with students, high school students who worked

111
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:15,484
[SPEAKER_02]: for the after school program about wages, so that I'm just trying to think of specific meetings that were not school committee recognized, but were three members.

112
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:17,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

113
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:23,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like you've been on the school committee, what, like six or seven years at this point?

114
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:23,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

115
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be my seventh year.

116
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

117
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you feel like at this point, school committee's doing well?

118
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,451
[SPEAKER_00]: What are kind of areas for improvement?

119
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's think.

120
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:42,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we have a very active or engaged school committee.

121
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:48,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, let me do the math, one, two,

122
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:54,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, four, six of us have students currently in Metro Public Schools.

123
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think having that

124
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:09,550
[SPEAKER_02]: point of view or being in the buildings, we have the ability to talk to parents, you know, off the cuff, just to hear what's happening.

125
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:22,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that's probably the biggest advantage of the what's the most helpful is that the school committee members, we're all someone had said to me years ago, when I first ran, well, you have skin in the game, right?

126
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the schools to be great for every student, including your own kids.

127
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what we do well, is that we're all very engaged.

128
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:42,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I'm trying to think now with all of us, we don't have, no, I was gonna say, we don't have a parent with children in every elementary school.

129
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:58,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We have parents who have children at the Brooks, the Roberts, and then we have kids at the McGlynn and the Andrews in the high school.

130
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:10,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anyone listening there, and if you live in the Mississippi neighborhood or the McGlynn Elementary neighborhood, please consider running, because I do think it's important to have representation from all the schools.

131
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,716
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, we're not a ward-based system, so we're all citywide.

132
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:26,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be great to have people from every school be able to participate in the school committee and encourage the administration on what needs to be done or what needs to be improved.

133
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:44,382
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought up something that stuck out to me just now about the ward based system and that's sort of a crossover for something we talked about with city councillors is the charter review and I hadn't thought about how that would change or benefit like representation of the school committee as well.

134
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

135
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:49,004
[SPEAKER_02]: To have every school have parents on the school committee.

136
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not every school is the same, right?

137
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:54,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Different schools have different needs and they all need to be addressed.

138
00:11:58,574 --> 00:11:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

139
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:14,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you see space for collaboration with other school districts, fully acknowledging that other districts are probably managing with a budget that may or may not look similar to ours.

140
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:28,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if there's space for sharing in the name of learning and connecting over where there's space for improvement or other pieces that Medford's getting right right now that could be of support to other districts.

141
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:37,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, so our and I don't have the exact numbers, so I don't want to misspeak.

142
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:42,802
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have Everett students who are in our vocational program.

143
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:50,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if that's where if you're thinking along those lines that we are partnering that our vocational school is growing.

144
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Our vocational school is is really

145
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,202
[SPEAKER_02]: room by leaps and bounds.

146
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: One concern that I have received emails about is that there is unfortunately no plumbing shop.

147
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Fallon, who is a terrific director of the vocational school, he has spoken about how plumbers in this market are doing really well.

148
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to give up if you own your own plumbing business to give up to teach.

149
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is something that they're constantly trying to

150
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: look for candidates to start a plumbing shop.

151
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, yeah, I can't think of other partnerships we've done with other surrounding towns.

152
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:37,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only one that I can think of offhand.

153
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:51,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure if it's a proposal that you're familiar with in another part of the state or another country, we're always up to looking into how to bring good programs here.

154
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

155
00:13:56,076 --> 00:14:02,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I am somewhat known for like really big broad questions in Medford so I'm going to throw one of them at you.

156
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:15,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other night I appreciated our commentary around systemic policy, and I'm a person who thinks of the classroom as sort of a microcosm of how policy.

157
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,156
[SPEAKER_03]: is effectual, I guess.

158
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:34,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're also in a moment in Medford where we're talking about how displacement and gentrification have affected our population, how sort of immigrant populations, ESL speakers, just

159
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,438
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Medford is evolving.

160
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:53,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you speak to how you see sort of policy change or sort of existing policy manifest in the classroom and what it means for learning and outcomes?

161
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:54,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

162
00:14:55,081 --> 00:15:01,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great question because that is one of the few things that school committee actually has jurisdiction over.

163
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:01,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So

164
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:09,387
[SPEAKER_02]: We hire and supervise the superintendent with a yearly evaluation and that contract negotiation.

165
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:14,750
[SPEAKER_02]: We balance the, I shouldn't say balance the budget.

166
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We go through the budget hearing process and then vote on the budget we put forward that then would go to the city council.

167
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:27,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we set school policy, which I think for a long time,

168
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,609
[SPEAKER_02]: the school committee and me included.

169
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about myself in my early years.

170
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't take advantage of how policy is so beneficial in how making policy is beneficial for the students.

171
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:46,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that is new to I think almost the culture of school committee.

172
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's moving along, you know, with the policy

173
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: with the free lunch last year and it's going to be continued.

174
00:15:54,408 --> 00:16:00,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul had done a policy about dental care and that was implemented.

175
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:07,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when, with the policy is where you really get all the rubber hits the road, I would say, right?

176
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:13,332
[SPEAKER_02]: People can talk about, oh, we're going to try this in the classroom, but unless it's in a policy, no one has to follow it.

177
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it's, it is really important when, and I'm learning, I'm still learning, you know, seven years in,

178
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:27,797
[SPEAKER_02]: when you write a resolution or a motion to have exactly what you want to see come forward.

179
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:42,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sharon just wrote a great resolution about social emotional supports and really to see where we are and where we need to go and how it's being addressed.

180
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:48,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really pinpointing the wording of all this, but policy is definitely

181
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,675
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to move things forward.

182
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:52,418
Yes.

183
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:53,864
Thank you.

184
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:58,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we, I mean, we're not saying this, but we had a conversation before this.

185
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was your office hours.

186
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:09,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we talked a little bit about how like sort of the wealth of resources in Medford and surrounding communities that could have that sort of impact.

187
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saying like, I remember as like a white student, I didn't have to think about like, am I being represented in the curriculum?

188
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I being represented in these policies?

189
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Have people considered my needs, right?

190
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:21,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And Medford is, you know, we have a lot of non-white students.

191
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and thinking about like,

192
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:33,504
[SPEAKER_00]: royal house, different resources within our city that could have an impact on how those children see themselves in the curriculum, see themselves in the policy.

193
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:37,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you're saying that's something that the school committee can have some impact on.

194
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, for sure.

195
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

196
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:52,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to transition a little bit to like, we had talked about, or we've been hearing some rumblings about teacher contracts and the teacher contract negotiation.

197
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:58,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this can feel like a maybe like a sensitive topic or like one that's we sometimes have to be careful how we talk about it.

198
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:04,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm wondering, like, what you can share about the contract process or how things are going for the teachers?

199
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:18,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't share much, but what I can share is that there is a negotiating team the you the teachers union has their executive board and then the administration has their represent representatives.

200
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:25,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no school committee members on the negotiating team when no one is in the meetings that take place.

201
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:33,174
[SPEAKER_02]: We do hear periodically through executive session an update of how the union negotiations are going.

202
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:41,122
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not public right now, so I cannot share what is happening or how they're going.

203
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:52,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that we've received some emails from parents saying we want to make sure you support a fair contract for the teachers and it seems

204
00:18:54,688 --> 00:19:00,210
[SPEAKER_02]: someone else had recommended an email and I wish I had Googled the term before I started speaking with you.

205
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cities and towns do an open negotiation.

206
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:13,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that has more success or more beneficial or people feel better about it than the negotiations that are happening now.

207
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting

208
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:25,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I should probably try to find a school district who does it and see what the pros and cons are for whether they are private negotiations or public negotiations.

209
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:35,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about it to have an opinion yet, but it is something that someone had emailed asking if that was something that was ever talked about in MedFed.

210
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something I wanted to find out more about it.

211
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:40,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

212
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:49,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the situation right now though, is that the contract expired in Medford and that it's been not been like agreed upon in negotiations yet.

213
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,296
[SPEAKER_00]: So for about a year, right.

214
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:54,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who comes to the table for those negotiations?

215
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:57,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who's involved in that process right now?

216
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: There are administrators, forgive me that I don't know exactly which administrators go.

217
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:08,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they all go to the, every meeting or if, um,

218
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:15,884
[SPEAKER_02]: know, they take turns for, I don't even know how often they meet with the Medford Teachers Association's executive board.

219
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:23,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine we'll be hearing an update, I would think in the next few weeks.

220
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a meeting, our next regular scheduled meeting is Monday.

221
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:31,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I didn't even look to see if there is an executive session scheduled yet.

222
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not look because they, it would be posted today if there was an executive session on Monday.

223
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: But if not, I would think soon we'll have an update of what where they are, where they're, where they're meeting or not meeting or there's a big divide.

224
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say between the two sides.

225
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:04,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, I don't know, it doesn't, it seems like there should be a better way to make it work for teachers and administration to

226
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know what it is.

227
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

228
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,810
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like it's like the union that represents the teachers.

229
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have an executive board.

230
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't know how many of the administrators are part of the administration negotiating team.

231
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:22,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

232
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:25,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the school committee decides like the budget or not?

233
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's the school committee's role in that?

234
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:34,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I think they reach those two parties reach an agreement, then they come to us and we do approve the contract.

235
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:40,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they meet, and they have it in on paper, then we approve that contract.

236
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:46,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that contract would be put into the budget for the budget of this year.

237
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often does this process happen?

238
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many years?

239
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:51,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

240
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:55,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've done it before.

241
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's

242
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one time in the last six years.

243
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:00,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

244
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:02,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

245
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I look forward to the hearing more at this.

246
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:05,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

247
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:06,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the name of sort of.

248
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:23,750
[SPEAKER_03]: growth and learning, I have been wondering about what continuing ed opportunities might look like for teachers in Medford and if school committee has wrapped their heads around what could be.

249
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so that might be a good place right for a policy there.

250
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean teachers can, I don't know what the stipend is now but they can have a course approved and be reimbursed for a course.

251
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:38,542
[SPEAKER_02]: There are the professional development days that

252
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:49,240
[SPEAKER_02]: we were given a presentation, I'd say a few months back of what the teachers, what the topics were the teachers covered.

253
00:22:50,380 --> 00:23:06,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that's always a concern that there could be more reimbursement for teachers for classes, but that would be a budget constraint for the cost of teachers and classes.

254
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:10,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a requirement for continuing ed for teachers?

255
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:17,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a requirement for like, I know for my like professional license, I have to keep up like a certain number of like continuing it.

256
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:18,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

257
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:19,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

258
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same for teachers?

259
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.

260
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:26,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is a year the PDPs that they're they need to have to keep going.

261
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:27,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

262
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:43,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Be interesting to think about how that informs that like bigger picture of like what's happening in the classroom like what are the priorities for continuing and like we want to teach us to focus on like equity and those sorts of issues and how do we sort of how does that kind of come out of those requirements.

263
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:45,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, right.

264
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:59,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that sort of spectrum of equity questions, we're curious if you have any thoughts or beliefs about what you want as a goal for students.

265
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:06,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So when students are moving through the Medford Public Schools, when they finish, what do you want that end goal to be for them?

266
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:18,380
[SPEAKER_02]: an excellent question that I will try to make concise.

267
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:37,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I think children, all children, I hope they find school, right, a warm and safe and welcoming place, but also their interests are encouraged in that

268
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard because I am a product of parochial school.

269
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,331
[SPEAKER_02]: K-8, I went to St.

270
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis, then I went to Arlington Catholic, and then I went to Boston College.

271
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard for me to think outside the box.

272
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I appreciate all the other school committee members, because everyone's coming from different schooling experiences.

273
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one size doesn't fit all.

274
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:06,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, for me, myself, it's hard to get out of that.

275
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:18,296
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to make sure to have the classroom have different opportunities of learning for students who learn in different ways.

276
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:28,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how you do it, but I know that that's how kids would grow and learn and blossom.

277
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:33,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, for my own children, I can only speak for my own children.

278
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: They all went to the Roberts, they all had,

279
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,253
[SPEAKER_02]: great teachers.

280
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think every year that their previous teacher was their favorite teacher, and then they go to the next grade, they're like, oh, that's my favorite teacher.

281
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:47,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've all just had exceptional teachers there.

282
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:52,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the middle school, my older kids, they had a great time at the middle school.

283
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:57,997
[SPEAKER_02]: For Teagan, not Teagan, sorry, for Nevin and Rowan, it's kind of been hard.

284
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:05,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nevin's the eighth grader, she went out on COVID in sixth grade, was hybrid seventh grade, came back trying to learn like

285
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:14,119
[SPEAKER_02]: get the lay of the land for eighth grade so I think they've had a they've had a unique relationship with middle school Nevin and Rome because it was during COVID.

286
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:18,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, who am I forgetting?

287
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and even Tegan.

288
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:21,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tegan's a junior at the high school.

289
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:28,817
[SPEAKER_02]: She went out her freshman year of COVID, sophomore year, you know, and I'm glad she was, the prom is coming May 20th.

290
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:30,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, are you going to go to the prom?

291
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:31,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, I don't know.

292
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Tegan, you know, if COVID never happened, you would have went to the prom.

293
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what, you just would have done it.

294
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's so hard to get back into the high school culture that it's just, it's, that's,

295
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:58,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's part of, I want these kids to experience high school events as well, you know, and I want all the kids at the high school to be able to experience all the events, make sure they're all accessible.

296
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:11,654
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that reflection on sort of the like social and emotional experience of school rather than the like, they will make it to the algebra level that we want them to like, they'll be getting in these test scores and things like that.

297
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, yeah, um, I think we touched on this just tiny bit earlier.

298
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:26,683
[SPEAKER_03]: To that effect, I'm wondering about our curriculum and how and when

299
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe the non-white families are able, are our kids seeing themselves in our curriculum and through what mediums?

300
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it reading?

301
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it literacy?

302
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:38,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it art?

303
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:38,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it music?

304
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it language?

305
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:50,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe by extension, are the grownups who love these little guys also seeing sort of representation in the materials that come home?

306
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the spaces for discussion?

307
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:55,177
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have thoughts on that.

308
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

309
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I definitely think the curriculum needs to be addressed.

310
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:09,476
[SPEAKER_02]: A curriculum subcommittee meeting will probably be happening, I would think, in May or June.

311
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget right now who's the chair, but I know that is coming.

312
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with the school committee, we're all white.

313
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:25,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would love for families of color to

314
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:44,737
[SPEAKER_02]: think about school committee, because it is important when students come to, whether they give a presentation or the symphony, some of the kids could be in the symphony, but the orchestra comes and plays, or we have student reps who are on the school committee, but I think it would be, it would be

315
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: would be better for our city if our school committee reflected our city's population.

316
00:28:53,473 --> 00:29:01,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I have said publicly and people tease me that they think I'm full of baloney but this will be this is my last term.

317
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:09,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I think eight years is a good amount of time to serve and then let it go on to families with

318
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: younger children and go up the grades with them.

319
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:23,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So if any of the people on this Zoom would like to... I bet some of them are thinking about it.

320
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:28,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think too you bring up a good point of like incumbency in Medford, right?

321
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:32,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Like without somebody choosing to step down, I think it's very rare that they're replaced, right?

322
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:39,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And other barriers to like why non-white people aren't running for those positions or aren't being elected to those positions.

323
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And also maybe the value of seeing mentorship and baton passing as a skillset to grow and cultivate, because it's super valid and also very much needed.

324
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:52,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

325
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:53,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to help.

326
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and Paul teases me all the time, and I own it and I appreciate it.

327
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,762
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first ran, Declan wasn't in preschool yet, but the other five were in Medford public schools.

328
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:17,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So just walking around at different events, and I could say I have five children and that's in public schools and it's important to me and I know it's important to families in the city.

329
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So he teases me that I didn't have to campaign that real hard.

330
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:35,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to show a picture of all my kids, which is true, but I am happy to help because I've worked on other campaigns now of the logistical part of the, it's tough to ask for money to do mailings and it's tough to ask for money to

331
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: do prints and ads and what have you.

332
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:44,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am ready and willing and happy to help anyone who's interested.

333
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:49,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be exciting.

334
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:49,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

335
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:56,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wonder if some folks are saying to themselves, I ideologically would like to run, but what does it cost?

336
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:57,582
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the hours?

337
00:30:58,043 --> 00:31:01,045
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean for the logistics of family life?

338
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:01,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

339
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:01,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

340
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:08,547
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of insider information on what that, how that pans out.

341
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:15,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I started this podcast, it was partially to interview candidates running in the last municipal election.

342
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:19,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, some folks couldn't actually record the podcast, but would send me emails.

343
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:27,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was Paul who said that his kids really wish that he wasn't on the school committee because of the time commitment and like all that.

344
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:27,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

345
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:31,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes, it is a big time commitment, but it's important.

346
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important, but it is a big time commitment.

347
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do, I really, I feel like eight years is a sweet spot.

348
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm not burnt out.

349
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's time.

350
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:52,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do feel like for the last seven years, really, you know, I've responded to emails, and I've tried to lead people in the right direction.

351
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:52,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And

352
00:31:53,162 --> 00:32:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: try to have healthy conversations with folks that we might not see eye to eye, but we all have our kids and the kids of Medford front and center.

353
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:13,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your work and I'm sure it's not, you're not going to suddenly disappear even after.

354
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't disappear on us.

355
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:27,256
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is a terrible joke and if Tim listens to this, he's going to say seriously, but I do joke that God forbid Tim came to an untimely death, I would run to a convent and be in a monastery.

356
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:32,479
[SPEAKER_02]: A life of solitude.

357
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe I will disappear.

358
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:37,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next election is 2023.

359
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:37,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

360
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:40,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So November of 2023 is the next election.

361
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:40,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the calendar.

362
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:56,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been really like excited about, I think as part of doing this podcast, like hearing more about what's going on in our community, being able to be involved.

363
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Last night I went to took my son to the STEM.

364
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:00,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

365
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,279
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.

366
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:01,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

367
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:06,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really cool to see like, um, everyone's involvement in the community.

368
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So one exciting event, I think for Medford is our upcoming pride celebration.

369
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:16,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if school committee is involved in that or, um, if you guys are going to be like.

370
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am not involved.

371
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:27,863
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor had sent out, it must have been an email with the press release to say they were looking for members for the committee.

372
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:39,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw the patch announcement with the committee members, but I have not reached out to the committee members to see if there's a role that the school committee can help.

373
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:39,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

374
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure my kids and I will head down just because it will be a fun outdoor activity with food trucks and music I think is what the release the press release said, but that is not.

375
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's coming out of the mayor's office, so I don't think there's any role for school committee except to just go and have a good time.

376
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:21,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Podcast is selling t-shirts to help support the GSA and you know I think it's something like to think about is like how is homophobia and racism like how are those things present in the schools right and so and I think Medford's GSA is something that Medford is really proud of and has had like a pretty strong history.

377
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:23,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I just wonder like

378
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,892
[SPEAKER_00]: the involvement of like the schools, I think, and especially the high school are pretty going to be pretty involved in that celebration.

379
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:31,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how, how does the, how does the school committee think?

380
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:31,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

381
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:32,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

382
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Dr. Maurice will give us an update or invite us all at a school committee meeting.

383
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:43,157
[SPEAKER_02]: She's very good at during her remarks, her opening remarks to highlight events in the city.

384
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine it's there.

385
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:46,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

386
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:55,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any like, worry about like, so you're a resident of Medford, obviously, and like a parent and on the school committee.

387
00:34:55,041 --> 00:35:07,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any like, is there ever like, like a conflict of interest ever arise where like, can I can I donate to the GSA or like anything as a school committee member or is it is there?

388
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:08,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had that.

389
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:13,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is how I've dedicated the GSA is the middle school teacher in COVID

390
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,374
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing a fundraiser with flags and bracelets and she delivered them to our house.

391
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So she and not just what like anyone who wanted to purchase them during COVID.

392
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty amazing.

393
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't.

394
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:28,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

395
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:33,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Different things have, you know, over the years have come up.

396
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:34,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm

397
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:42,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say it's about homework or about a club or something.

398
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have a concern.

399
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:48,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm escaping what the concern is.

400
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always say, I most likely wouldn't email as a parent.

401
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not

402
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm not a emailer, like I think it will, it will work.

403
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm going to make this clear.

404
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:15,720
[SPEAKER_02]: But if someone brings it to my attention, like if I knew it as a parent, but I'm not the one to bring it out as a parent, but if someone brings it to my attention as a school committee member, then I feel like that's my obligation.

405
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:23,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a parent, I kind of like, my kids are, they've had great teachers, they like their activities, what have you.

406
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if I know about it, but it's not something that,

407
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say it.

408
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:33,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a school committee member, I'm always going to bring it forward.

409
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:35,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't feel like there's a conflict of interest.

410
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:35,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

411
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,752
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not filtering things as a parent through what you bring to school committee?

412
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

413
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:41,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

414
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:48,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I'll always, no matter what someone asks me as a school committee member, I'm not going to feel like it's a conflict because it's two separate things.

415
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing it as a parent.

416
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:53,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing it as someone who reached out to me as a school committee member.

417
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:55,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that makes sense.

418
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:56,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

419
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sort of skipped, I think I kind of steamrolled Shelly a little bit.

420
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:04,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

421
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think this really nicely dovetails into combining a couple of the questions.

422
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:22,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next sort of comment asks about sort of racism and homophobia and maybe what are the mechanisms by which folks can bring concerns to the school committee and then what maybe the actions look like.

423
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think your commentary, Mia, around like how you

424
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:51,932
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely feel an obligation to share when you're wearing your school committee hat for me dovetails nicely into the very first comment around how do I learn more about whose school committee is and what do they do and then what are the where do I learn about the mechanism for how to communicate and then how does that inform what the response looks like so for me that kind of combines

425
00:37:53,069 --> 00:38:08,201
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns, kind of events, like sort of episodes maybe of, you know, what something racial or homophobic could look like, but also just wanting to learn more about the system, I guess.

426
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:12,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so many reasons why I guess folks would want to

427
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:18,470
[SPEAKER_03]: make contact, learn more about you, begin to build trust and feel comfortable.

428
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:21,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.

429
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that importance of representation, right?

430
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:31,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if I'm a non-white person reporting racism, you know, I think it would be harder to do that to an all-white school board.

431
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:32,699
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.

432
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

433
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:35,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So consider running.

434
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if only we had.

435
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:45,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've reached the end of our questions for you.

436
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:49,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you wanted to make sure to mention.

437
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think we covered a lot.

438
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, oh man, am I going to be able to, I don't like to talk too long.

439
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:00,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, well, I have enough to say, but apparently I had plenty to say.

440
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

441
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think for the people listening, please know that everyone on the school committee are all very receptive and dedicated to making the schools.

442
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the schools have been great for my children.

443
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:26,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But just like I can do things better as a mom, I'm sure we can do things better as a school committee in a school district.

444
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just things that never even have crossed my mind that people recommend or write about or suggest.

445
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, that's a great idea.

446
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:40,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the more we hear from folks all over the city, the better we can make the school.

447
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way for us to communicate that is what?

448
00:39:48,258 --> 00:39:51,240
[SPEAKER_02]: email us or show up to the school committee meetings.

449
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I mean, we get very few participants on a regular basis.

450
00:39:57,424 --> 00:40:02,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we get a large group of participants, but for most meetings, it's very few participants.

451
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:06,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Office hours, I think mostly everyone

452
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:08,726
[SPEAKER_02]: has office hours.

453
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:15,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Sharon, Paul, Jenny, Melanie, the mayor, Kathy, myself.

454
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

455
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So just watch for office hours.

456
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause that's a nice, like, it's more comfortable and it's not that you're presenting in front of a formal body in city hall.

457
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's more, um, laid back.

458
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

459
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And your regular meetings are on Mondays?

460
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:33,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.

461
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:33,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

462
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:34,533
[SPEAKER_00]: At what time?

463
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:36,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Six.

464
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:37,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be 630.

465
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:38,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're six.

466
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:39,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

467
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:42,188
[SPEAKER_00]: And those can still be accessed both in person and on Zoom?

468
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

469
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:43,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

470
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:43,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

471
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:44,048
[SPEAKER_02]: With Zoom.

472
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

473
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:48,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the subcommittee meetings, those are more sporadic.

474
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost when an issue comes up from the regular school committee meeting and then is recommended to go to a subcommittee.

475
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have eight subcommittees now.

476
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's another place to speak.

477
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:05,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much.

478
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:06,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

479
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:07,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

480
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, co-host.

481
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a great job for the first co-hosting episode.

482
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

483
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:14,064
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

484
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:15,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

485
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:15,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye everybody.

486
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to Mia and Shelly.

487
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,980
[SPEAKER_00]: At tonight's school committee meeting, there will be a discussion of the current teacher's contract negotiation.

488
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:33,484
[SPEAKER_00]: You can participate in that meeting in person or over Zoom.

489
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:40,732
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been thinking about supporting the GSA by purchasing a Pride t-shirt, don't wait as sales end on May 4th.

490
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:46,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning to wear mine to the Pride flag raising at City Hall, and I hope you all can too.

491
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,617
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link in today's show notes to be able to purchase those.

492
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:52,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for listening to today's episode.
