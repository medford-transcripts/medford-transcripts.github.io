1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:01,364
This isn't a dumpsy thing.

2
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:03,505
This is just bread.

3
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,608
It's not a dumpsy, it's a dumpsy thing.

4
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:09,029
It's a recycling bin, not a trash barrel.

5
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:12,412
I have a little bit, yeah.

6
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:17,615
Well that's good, you can make sure you recycle.

7
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:17,715
Yes.

8
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:18,936
Oh Jesus Christ!

9
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:20,277
The latest Mustang report.

10
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,018
Oh my goodness.

11
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:23,279
You should probably check it out in case you haven't seen it.

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,521
Well if you haven't seen it, you should probably check it out.

13
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,062
What do you think we're doing right now?

14
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:33,170
Oh my god, I wish I could have it.

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,831
How you doing?

16
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:35,312
I'm Anthony.

17
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,594
This is... Oh, Jesus.

18
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:39,755
She thinks they might be important?

19
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:40,516
Yes.

20
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:45,079
They don't have gloves on.

21
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:45,679
No.

22
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,922
Welcome to the Mustang Report.

23
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:54,466
What's that?

24
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:59,670
Um, you ran out for coffee, watched the gold, peed back in two shakes of Olanto, kept...

25
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:01,864
Where's the gold?

26
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:02,905
I don't know.

27
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:03,826
I don't see it.

28
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:04,766
Does anyone see the pot?

29
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:05,267
No.

30
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:07,288
Where could it be?

31
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,229
There's no gold in this pot.

32
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,710
What?

33
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,350
Hayley!

34
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:16,054
Alright guys, we all have to run out and go find the gold as quick as we can, okay?

35
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:17,455
Where's the gold?

36
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:35,998
Has anyone seen the gold?

37
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:36,579
Where's the gold?

38
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:42,546
Has anybody seen the pot of gold?

39
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:16,103
Has anyone seen the gold?

40
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,064
No!

41
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:26,128
Wait, where's Dempsey?

42
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,048
Not sure.

43
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:30,970
I haven't seen him today.

44
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,530
Wait, guys, what's this?

45
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,512
Finish the mission, find the gold.

46
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,233
Well, I guess we have to go find the gold.

47
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:39,933
Let's go.

48
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:42,174
Wait, you're going to need this.

49
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:43,295
Thanks, Nick.

50
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:48,667
Have you guys seen the gold?

51
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:56,150
No.

52
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,071
It's locked.

53
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,151
Why is it locked?

54
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,472
How are we going to get in?

55
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:01,553
Wait, I know the code.

56
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:05,074
We have to say lucky leprechaun three times.

57
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:05,594
Ready?

58
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,355
One, two, three.

59
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,456
Lucky leprechaun, lucky leprechaun, lucky leprechaun.

60
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:11,977
Oh, there we go.

61
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,512
Mustang?

62
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:30,533
Please, softball.

63
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:32,293
Well, let's go join.

64
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,034
Mustang?

65
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:36,435
Do you know where our gold is?

66
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:37,855
Yeah, right here.

67
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:39,576
This is your prize for today.

68
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:45,558
But you can get the real pot of gold on Sunday, March 12th at the American Legion at 10.30 in the morning.

69
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:46,058
See you there.

70
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,005
Let's say you guys are really, you're really short on time because it's getting cold.

71
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:57,688
By the time you guys are done, you're going to be, you're going to be cold.

72
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,933
Don't waste your time cutting.

73
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:10,201
Use what is around you that you can get something up quickly because you're going to spend so much energy on something and you don't know what's going to be really useful.

74
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:13,923
Matt, how are we doing over here?

75
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:14,223
So good.

76
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:14,664
So good.

77
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:15,644
Is there shelter this far?

78
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,144
Oh my god.

79
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:16,765
It's made of wood mostly.

80
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:17,045
Paradise.

81
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:17,745
Or just a moss.

82
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:17,885
Yep.

83
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:18,205
Paradise.

84
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,926
It's getting there.

85
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,387
I don't know about paradise, but.

86
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:21,727
It's close.

87
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:22,367
We're getting there.

88
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,509
Oh yeah, the saw's right over there.

89
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,771
All right, so guys let's

90
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:16,956
Unfortunately, our next inductee, Arantia King, Medford High School, 2007, is also unable to be with us today, but her mother, Brelyn, is here.

91
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:24,980
Arantia is in London right now, and she's finishing up her degree at Georgetown University for going as an attorney.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,182
But in high school, she was the New England Gatorade Athlete of the Year three years in a row, 05, 06, 07.

93
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,845
She was the world youth long jump champion.

94
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:43,050
She was a four-time Massachusetts long jump champion, a two-time national long jump champion, and a one-time triple jump champion.

95
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,453
At Stanford, her highlights and PRs are 12 100 meters, 24.7 in the 200 meters, 21.6 in three quarters,

96
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:58,098
in the long jump in a 42-foot, 5.25-inch triple jumper.

97
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:07,904
Her professional highlights include two appearances at the two Olympic Games in 08 and 12, competing for Bermuda.

98
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:12,827
She holds the Bermuda National Indoor and Outdoor long jump records, and her PRs are 11.88, 21.8, 44.6.

99
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:19,591
So let's please welcome Aracha King, represented by her mother, into the athletes hall of fame.

100
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:30,242
Let's go, Maya!

101
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:30,422
Nice job!

102
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:30,662
Keep it up!

103
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:30,982
Come on, Maya!

104
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:31,322
Let's go, Amber!

105
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:31,742
Come on, Ruben!

106
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:32,083
Come on, Amber!

107
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:33,363
Just an award-winning champion this time.

108
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:16,632
Do one of those

109
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:58,008
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what.

110
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,270
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough.

111
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,893
And every time I step up in the building, everybody's hands go up.

112
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,735
And they stay there.

113
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,936
And they say yeah.

114
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,790
Deal.

115
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:15,892
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what Got money on my mind, I can never get enough And every time I step up in the building, everybody's hands go up And they stay there, and they stay there, and they stay there

116
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,982
This is Nick Kenniston with the Mustang Report and I'm here with Haley DiPietro Antonio.

117
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:44,965
And since we couldn't make the Patriots Parade today, we're here to talk a little bit about the Patriots game.

118
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:46,906
Haley, what was your favorite moment from the game?

119
00:09:47,456 --> 00:10:14,827
my favorite moment of the game definitely it was a little bit made that insane catch i think that was a great moment because the pages fans specifically have known uh... to experience i kind of catch before specifically david tyree ins in the super bowl in two thousand four and i'm going to have a super bowl in two thousand seven both against the giants the patriots have been the victim of that sort of thing so many times so it was great for the pages actually be on the other end uh... on the victorious and of of that

120
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:21,068
Would you want to be at the parade today, even though it's kind of blizzard-like conditions out here?

121
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:28,074
I think it would be cool to be down there, definitely supporting my team and my city, but it's also my duty to be here at school.

122
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:36,121
And we're also here to talk a little bit about the upcoming leprechaun race, which is why we're wearing these two pretty funky hats.

123
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,503
Are you planning to be running at all?

124
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,479
I'd like to run it.

125
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:50,442
It seems like a really cool event to be a part of and yeah, so come on down to it at the American Legion on March 12th and show your leprechaun spirit.

126
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:55,283
And lastly, what is your favorite thing to do when it's snowing outside?

127
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,284
Do snow angels.

128
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:06,486
How do you feel about the new Mustang jerseys, Haley?

129
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,498
I think they're really cool.

130
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:09,518
I really like them a lot.

131
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,182
Would you prefer New Balance or would you prefer another brand like Nike or Adidas?

132
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:16,023
I really like the New Balance ones.

133
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,064
I think they're really fitting for us.

134
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:19,965
Watch your step.

135
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,349
Did you see Destiny Fitzgerald's game the other night?

136
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:26,690
Yeah, I did see that.

137
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,853
She ended up with 41 points and a ridiculous 22 rebounds.

138
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:31,653
That's crazy.

139
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,795
Did you happen to attend the boys' senior night?

140
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:35,996
Yeah, I did.

141
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:36,937
It was really emotional.

142
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:45,593
The boys had their senior night on Sunday, and it was kind of sad to see them play for the last time, because a lot of them are seniors.

143
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,074
They have five seniors.

144
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,356
Yeah, it's hard to think that the winter sports season is almost over.

145
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,617
That means spring sports now.

146
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:56,099
And what spring sport are you most excited for?

147
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,821
Definitely softball, by far.

148
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:02,983
Do you think the softball team will be very different from last year, knowing that you've lost a lot of seniors?

149
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:08,202
Yeah, I think they're still going to be really good though and really pull through.
