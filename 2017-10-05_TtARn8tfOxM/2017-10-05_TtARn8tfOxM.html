    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=294.374s">One</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=295.015s">Uh,</a>  when will, uh, do we know when the work's taking place?</p>

    <p>[XA7wYJ4TI4w_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=299.077s">I</a>  would assume, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=302.353s">I'm</a>  not positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=303.894s">I</a>  would assume once this passes, I would think the customer would get started on a week or two, I would assume.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=308.716s">And</a>  do we know how long it's going to take?</p>

    <p>[XA7wYJ4TI4w_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=310.157s">Oh,</a>  it should be 15 feet, so I would think it would be a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=313.258s">It's</a>  all going to be done on the grass strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=314.659s">It's</a>  not going to interfere the road itself, which is going to be the grass strip.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=318.62s">And</a>  if I may, really quick, Councilor Scott, probably brought up a good point about a pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=325.624s">I</a>  got a call the other day about a pole at the corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=329.792s">It</a>  was a double pole, and now it's one and a half poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=332.294s">They</a>  literally cut it in half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=334.195s">It's</a>  like a stump.</p>

    <p>[XA7wYJ4TI4w_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=334.796s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=336.137s">There's</a>  nothing on it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=337.238s">There's</a>  nothing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=337.838s">It's</a>  about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=339.099s">It's</a>  kind of odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=340.94s">You</a>  have one single pole, and there's a pole next to it that was a double pole at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=345.744s">And</a>  now it's just about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=348.025s">To</a>  me, it's a bit of a safety hazard if you have a smaller child that's walking by or running in trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=352.429s">And</a>  I think it's a problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=355.451s">I</a>  will take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=356.372s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=357.172s">It's</a>  a corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=360.282s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=361.362s">Councilor</a>  Knife.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=362.643s">Mr.</a>  President, the gentleman at the podium answered my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=365.103s">By</a>  looking at the diagram, I had a question as to whether or not any street excavation was going to take place and whether or not there was going to be a need for a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=372.486s">He's</a>  informed us that it's all going to take place on the grass strip, that it's 15 feet of conduit, that it's going to take one day to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=377.127s">So</a>  I have no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=378.007s">I</a>  would second Councilor Scapelli's motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=380.808s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=381.568s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=385.07s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=544.78s">I'd</a>  be happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=545.861s">Mr.</a>  President, through you to the members, this is a very straightforward request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=550.185s">It</a>  is to establish a revolving fund that will allow fees and costs associated with delinquent tax cases to be put into this fund and then <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=564.817s">would</a>  be able to pay the costs associated with those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=568.639s">It</a>  wouldn't be subject to appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=570.72s">It</a>  would be pretty much a pass-through account where when we get a bill for our legal fees or our fees from the registry, they would already have been paid by the delinquent taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=584.207s">We</a>  take it out of that account and pay the fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=587.982s">The</a>  Department of Revenue has made a general recommendation that all cities and towns accept this statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=595.224s">It's</a>  a cleaner, more transparent way to see how funds are being expended to recoup tax title funds.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=604.566s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=605.326s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=606.787s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=609.067s">If</a>  you could explain, I guess, the process we use now and also it sounds like our expenses are going to be taken out of this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=617.406s">What</a>  about properties that are seized or sold? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=620.248s">Those</a>  money's going to come in and then we're going to expend from the same account?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=623.89s">So</a>  what happens now is when we pursue a tax title case, taxes, interest, fees, everything, the money has been put forward by the city to pursue those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=635.737s">And</a>  when the delinquent taxpayer seeks a redemption, they only get a redemption once all those costs have been paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=644.5s">The</a>  taxes under this revolving fund, the taxes and the interest would go into the general fund, and the costs would then come back to the treasurer, who could then use them to pursue other cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=656.091s">Right</a>  now, I have a line item of $3,500 to use toward tax title cases, and just this year, we've already filed 30 cases <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=668.062s">And</a>  that's $75 per filing fee, so we're up at about $2,500 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=673.604s">So</a>  it doesn't leave a lot of money to pursue some of the larger cases that require filings in land court, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=680.087s">So</a>  with this, when those fees come in, we can build that up and use it going forward.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=687.81s">So</a>  this will allow you to—money that is brought in from delinquent properties or money owed can then be—we can use more of it towards <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=696.688s">collecting</a>  from other properties versus, right now you're limited to the $3,500 and you'd have to ask the mayor's office to appropriate more.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=704.891s">So</a>  this is a way for us to- And this is really being paid back by the delinquent taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=709.653s">So</a>  it's the city getting their money back from the delinquent taxpayer and then using those funds to continue to pursue other delinquent taxpayers.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=718.437s">Now,</a>  what if we recouped so much money and this account became obviously extremely high, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=725.696s">would</a>  we be able to transfer out of it?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=727.997s">Well,</a>  I'm not certain if you can transfer out of it, but you can close it, which I would assume then would then go to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=735.861s">I</a>  don't foresee it really gaining and growing that much because the fees aren't that great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=744.124s">But</a>  if legal fees are being paid by a taxpayer, then we're going to have to pay the legal bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=749.427s">So</a>  it goes in and goes out pretty regularly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=753.624s">And</a>  what's the purpose of the DOR recommending this?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=756.545s">I</a>  think they think it's cleaner and it's more transparent for cities and towns to show how much money is spent and how much money is recouped through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=769.027s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=771.348s">Councilor</a>  de la Ruche. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=772.428s">Mr.</a>  President, as one who's always been an advocate and supporter of efficiency in government, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=783.412s">and</a>  in the pursuit of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=789.456s">I</a>  support this resolution in motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=794.48s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Del Rosario.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=796.141s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=796.962s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=798.543s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and thank you, Anne, for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=802.826s">Do</a>  you know what was expended the last three years to collect for these taxed delinquent properties?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=809.371s">It's</a>  been $3,500 on the line item, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=812.947s">It's</a>  gone into deficit, I'm sure, at some point.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=815.068s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=815.589s">So</a>  we don't have an accounting over the last three years how much has been expended to collect each and every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=820.772s">I</a>  realize your budget line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=822.452s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=822.653s">Over</a>  and above the budget line item.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=825.374s">I</a>  can tell you how much has been spent in this year, which is $112,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=830.957s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=831.718s">So</a>  what I'm trying to do is get a picture of what we've done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=838.701s">Have</a>  we hired outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=840.102s">Because</a>  I assume that <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=841.81s">Part</a>  of this money will go to outside attorneys, is that not correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=844.472s">Yes,</a>  and we have hired outside counsel.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=846.494s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=847.035s">What</a>  we've expended in the past, what are percent that we've gained from expending this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=852.5s">So</a>  just say in a given year we expend $100,000 and we get back $300,000 in tax title. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=861.488s">Do</a>  we have an estimate on every year?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=864.19s">Yeah,</a>  I can give you a breakdown right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=867.398s">I</a>  checked it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=868.338s">We've,</a>  um, I want to see a few years, not just, well, I would have to look back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=873.34s">I've</a>  only been here for a little over a year, so I would look back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=876.741s">But</a>  right now, um, under mayor Burke's tenure, we've brought in $2.25 million and spent, um, about $110,000 to do that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=888.132s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=888.512s">So</a>  I'd like to see a picture, Mr. President, if we could, on maybe the last five years, what has been, in addition to the line item that was mentioned, what has been expended by the Treasurer-Collector's Office and how much money has been taken in for that period of time so we can get a handle on whether or not we're expending too much money or whether or not we're getting our bank for our buck by hiring these attorneys, and what the practice has been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=916.279s">Has</a>  it always been outside attorneys? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=918.54s">So</a>  maybe if we get a breakdown of what the expenses were, too, over the past five years, compared to collections. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=925.144s">I,</a>  as one member, think that would be helpful to make a decision.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=928.366s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=930.067s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, is seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=933.91s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=935.011s">Just</a>  to make sure I completely understand it, I thought any monies recouped would go into this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=941.775s">So</a>  if we had this account open now and we would have $2.2 <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=946.927s">to</a>  $5 million minus the $110,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=949.209s">Oh,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=950.389s">Only</a>  the cost and fees that we recoup would be in the revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=957.514s">And</a>  then that would give us sort of the seed money to continue prosecuting, not prosecuting, but getting those cases to come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=966.2s">And</a>  the taxes and the interest that we get goes to the general fund.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=972.543s">So</a>  the $2.25 million would go to the general fund?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=975.765s">That</a>  has already gone to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=977.847s">Right,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=978.547s">And</a>  that includes, included in that are all of the legal fees, because the delinquent taxpayer pays the legal fee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=988.035s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=988.895s">So</a>  if this happened next year, $2.25 minus the $1.12 of costs and fees, $1.12 would go into this new account, and then the rest would go into the general fund.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=999.715s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1000.055s">Provided</a>  that those, you know, it's a ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1002.478s">So</a>  it's def, it's always difficult for the treasurer to know how much needs to be expended to, to get these monies back. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1009.945s">Sometimes</a>  it's one letter and sometimes it's, it's a case in land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1014.129s">So</a>  it's difficult to know how much, um, needs to be expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1019.514s">And</a>  we did spend a lot of time in the beginning looking through the cases and then, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1025.848s">grouping</a>  them into group A, B, and C. And group A, we're just finishing those cases up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1032.029s">And</a>  those were the ones that were, if you will, the easier ones, that there were no issues with title or issues with taxpayers no longer living in the city or owning the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1046.652s">Most</a>  of those cases are coming to fruition now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1049.112s">We</a>  have a bunch still in land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1051.073s">And</a>  then we're going to move on to batch B, which <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1054.47s">are</a>  going to be more difficult because they have issues.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1060.052s">And</a>  then the $75 filing fee, that's not lien court. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1063.773s">What</a>  is that, a filing fee for you mentioned?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1065.954s">So</a>  when the city takes the property, once we send notice and the taxpayer ignores the notice, then we record the lien. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1076.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1076.657s">Then</a>  we just advertise to, and then we record it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1080.679s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1081.119s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1082.785s">Vice</a>  President Mux. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1084.626s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1085.407s">So,</a>  and I'm not sure if you're prepared to answer it tonight, but based on the $2 million figure you just gave, is that something that your office has been working on in the past year and a half? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1095.655s">Or</a>  is that something that may have been initiated three or four years ago that finally went through land court and settled?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1102.04s">No,</a>  that was, um, that's money that has been come into the city starting January 4th, 2016 to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1112.514s">And</a>  that has all been a result of the work that our office has done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1119.496s">So</a>  that was work that was tracked down recently within the past year and a half, letters sent and so forth.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1127.399s">When</a>  I arrived, there was over four, I'm going to say $4.2 million out on the street in tax money.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1136.161s">Currently</a>  right now?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1137.182s">No,</a>  when I arrived. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1139.102s">When</a>  you arrived. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1140.062s">What</a>  do we have in delinquent taxes right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1142.543s">We're</a>  below 2 million right now.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1146.325s">For</a>  the entire city, we're below 2 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1148.326s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1150.127s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1150.387s">I</a>  thought it would be much higher than that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1152.428s">Well,</a>  it grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1153.088s">I</a>  mean, we're going to hit the next quarter, May 1st, and then we're going to get people who are delinquent then, and we're going to add new cases to the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1164.414s">And</a>  this amount reflects also anyone that is delinquent in their water and sewer, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1170.335s">Water</a>  and sewer goes on to your, when you don't pay your water and sewer bill, that goes on to your real estate bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1174.718s">It's</a>  leaned on your real estate bill.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1176.079s">And</a>  then if you don't pay real estate, do we know what percentage out of that 2 million was water and sewer?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1182.244s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1182.804s">I'd</a>  have to, I would have to look at that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1184.565s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1185.486s">And</a>  my last question back some years ago, well before your time here as treasurer collector, uh, there was a proposal offered, uh, by the previous administration, uh, to look at a tax amnesty. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1197.835s">Uh,</a>  where do you stand on tax amnesty?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1200.739s">I'm</a>  opposed to a tax amnesty because I believe I see a lot of people who come in and pay their taxes in a timely manner and they're making sacrifices and they're not doing all the things that they may want to do, maybe not taking a trip or buying the new car, but they're making sure that their taxes are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1221.237s">And</a>  I think that those people <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1224.814s">are</a>  doing the right thing by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1226.375s">And</a>  I think when people choose not to, and I understand there are people who can't, and we work with those people, but when people choose not to pay their tax bills or their water and sewer bills, we still have bills as a city that have to get paid every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1239.579s">And</a>  so to allow people to forego any interest or penalties and come in and pay the tax just doesn't seem fair to me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1248.182s">So</a>  just educate me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1251.323s">If</a>  someone is delinquent for years, and just say there are a number <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1255.082s">of</a>  people that are delinquent for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1256.883s">Do</a>  we assess the taxes based on those that are delinquent? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1263.448s">Like</a>  you're saying, geez, we have people that are repeat offenders. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1266.71s">They</a>  haven't paid their taxes or their water bill in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1269.712s">Do</a>  we take that into consideration when we set our tax numbers and our budget numbers?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1278.131s">Right,</a>  because those are accounts receivable that we haven't brought in, that we can't get to come in.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1283.932s">No,</a>  but are we charging other taxpayers more money based on the fact that those delinquents aren't paying?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1290.194s">If</a>  the delinquency goes on the recap, and then those are receivables that we can't get, then yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1297.975s">But</a>  I would have to, Alicia would be able to answer that better than me, where the receivables would appear.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1304.737s">If</a>  she could, I'd like to get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1307.59s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1308.911s">Alicia</a>  Dunlea, Finance Director, City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1311.913s">No,</a>  they're not directly increased based on those losses, on those people that are not collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1317.016s">That's</a>  why she's trying to actively do tax title. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1319.718s">And</a>  we could actually do foreclosures if we felt like going that far.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1325.162s">So</a>  we absorb, meaning the city absorbs those delinquents?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1329.945s">Well,</a>  they're kept as accounts receivable outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1332.707s">So</a>  we're going to keep trying to get them in tax title. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1335.089s">And</a>  we do have the ability, if we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1337.418s">recoup</a>  that money to try to take it through foreclosure.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1340.54s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1341.001s">So,</a>  so at what point do we reach out? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1344.003s">Is</a>  it when the, uh, amount of property that's owed or the amount of money that's owed surpasses what the assessed value is? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1350.968s">At</a>  what time do we go out and start pursuing those legal avenues?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1354.971s">Um,</a>  that would be a discussion I would have with the mayor and with the treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1358.053s">I</a>  can't give an exact answer on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1360.355s">So</a>  are they ongoing those discussions?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1362.69s">Well,</a>  if I may, we, we are always, I have a running list of tax title accounts and I'm always reviewing it and, uh, seeing how we can get to these people and get these monies in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1376.895s">Um,</a>  it's not something we review once every six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1379.976s">It's</a>  a, it's a continuing effort on the part of my office to bring that money back to the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1386.119s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1387.359s">And</a>  my last question is, uh, based on, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1390.375s">What</a>  we've brought in, you said, over $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1393.617s">How</a>  many properties does that actually account for? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1397.919s">Are</a>  we talking one large commercial property? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1400.08s">Are</a>  we talking 300 small properties?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1403.442s">They're</a>  probably, I want to say, I had a report the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1407.664s">I'm</a>  going to say 50 plus properties brought in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1412.206s">I'm</a>  going to say probably that's about 60 properties because we had some that were in litigation and some that resolved short of litigation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1420.007s">about</a>  60 properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1421.488s">So</a>  I would just ask, Mr. President, that we receive the questions that were asked tonight regarding the three or five years, which, you know, either one would be fine with me, of number of the amount of money that was requested, not just within the budget, but requested by the treasurer-collector to collect on these tax delinquents over the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1449.783s">And</a>  what percent have we brought in based on those particular years? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1454.687s">So</a>  if we could see a run and tally for the past three years.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1457.469s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1586.256s">Would</a>  you explain the proposal?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1587.616s">Absolutely,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1588.857s">So</a>  what we would like to do is combine the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund for reporting since everything is under MWRA here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1599.899s">It</a>  just makes more sense for reporting to have it all in one fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1605.161s">Yes,</a>  for financial reporting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1612.002s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1623.151s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1624.132s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1626.394s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1628.295s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1631.618s">Knowing</a>  that there's always been a distinction between the water and the sewer accounts through this enterprise account, and also the budgeting is based on <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1642.403s">or</a>  some of the budgeting is based on what is in with these particular accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1647.226s">I</a>  was just wondering, what else, maybe if Alicia can specify, why else, other than this makes it easier for accounting, why else would we change over, knowing that, to me, like the budget, having separate budget line items is more accountable than having just one total budget line item when it talks about appropriations and to making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1671.47s">money</a>  is spent, the taxpayer money is spent appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1674.753s">So</a>  what other reasons can you give us for this change?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1678.277s">Well,</a>  it's easier also for tracking for expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1680.699s">So</a>  instead of trying to split it up between how much somebody is working on sewer versus how much somebody is working on water, for recording fixed assets, it's easier for me than to see what I want to attribute to water, what I want to attribute to sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1695.039s">We</a>  could also break it up within the one fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1696.96s">It</a>  could still have those separate lines showing a water revenue, a sewer revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1701.523s">It</a>  would just be in one fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1703.344s">So</a>  it wouldn't be necessarily it's one line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1706.886s">It</a>  would still show those differences, but in one fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1710.488s">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1711.568s">But</a>  if you're still taking the time to account for them within one fund, what's the big cost?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1716.311s">It</a>  gives more flexibility as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1718.452s">So,</a>  for instance, when I had to come to you guys in December and I had to get that appropriation to cover <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1724.916s">The</a>  $563,000, I believe, about, I was short in the sewer fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1728.518s">If</a>  they were in one fund, if I have a surplus in one and a deficit in the other, I can put them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1734.581s">I</a>  don't have to go forward and it can clean itself up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1739.144s">And</a>  it's all going to MWRA anyway.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1741.845s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1742.406s">What</a>  do we have currently within the combined accounts?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1748.649s">Now,</a>  when you're saying you're asking me as far as revenues, you're asking me as far as expenses.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1752.402s">No,</a>  what do we have in the water and sewer enterprise accounts?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1754.884s">That's</a>  what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1755.545s">Are</a>  you asking me as far as money and revenue collections?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1758.588s">Money.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1758.848s">What</a>  do we have in there for money?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1764.153s">In</a>  the sewer account, I have $10,297,330.19. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1765.675s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1765.895s">And</a>  in the water fund, I have $8,213,355.33.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1782.16s">And</a>  what do we anticipate the surplus to be in these accounts?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1791.403s">I</a>  would have actually had to bring that with me from the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1794.304s">I</a>  actually didn't bring that with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1795.265s">I</a>  apologize, but I can provide that to you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1797.365s">Are</a>  we looking at about $8 million, $9 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1799.106s">Because</a>  that's the last figure I heard.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1801.467s">No,</a>  that's as much as revenue that's come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1803.268s">That's</a>  not a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1804.688s">That's</a>  just revenue that's come in near to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1806.309s">This</a>  figure, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1807.169s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1807.569s">But</a>  what do we anticipate to have as a surplus?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1810.587s">That's</a>  what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1811.067s">I</a>  don't have that figure with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1812.247s">I'd</a>  have to get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1812.848s">You</a>  don't have a ballpark estimate? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1814.708s">I</a>  didn't bring that paperwork with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1816.749s">But</a>  I do have it from when we did the Water and Sewer Commission when we were looking at rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1820.29s">We</a>  did look at what the projected would be, and I can get that to you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1827.032s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, this council has requested on several occasions within the past six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1836.554s">One</a>  time we took a unanimous vote, I believe it was, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1839.952s">to</a>  ask the Water and Sewer Commissioners whether or not they're looking to implement a connectivity fee in water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1849.334s">And</a>  we have yet to get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1851.775s">And</a>  I know Councilor Lungo-Koehn asked recently about new construction and having a connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1858.516s">But</a>  the issue that I brought up several months ago was through a conversation I had regarding the Water and Sewer Commissioners voting <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1868.769s">on</a>  creating what they refer to as a baseline charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1872.09s">And</a>  I'm not sure if you're familiar with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1873.53s">Are</a>  you familiar with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1874.431s">Yes,</a>  I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1876.071s">As</a>  far as I know, Mr. President, the Water and Sewer Commission has just recently voted to implement the baseline charge to every water and sewer ratepayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1886.974s">And</a>  you can call it a baseline charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1889.135s">You</a>  can call it connectivity fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1890.935s">You</a>  can call it Mickey Mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1892.316s">You</a>  can call it whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1894.356s">What</a>  it is is a connection charge that they're charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1898.627s">And</a>  I've been told that this baseline charge is going to be roughly about $1.5 million, divided among all of our ratepayers in the community that pay water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1912.535s">And</a>  I think it's extremely important now, before we change any accounts or consolidate any accounts, that we get a handle, Mr. President, not only on this paper and the ramifications this paper may have on the accounting and <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1927.717s">tracking</a>  and transparency in this community, but also, Mr. President, on the recent vote by the Water and Sewer Commission on this baseline charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1938.265s">I</a>  think it's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1940.167s">I</a>  would ask my fellow colleagues that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting with the Water and Sewer Commissioners, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1945.931s">Nunley,</a>  and anyone from the mayor's office to discuss the baseline charge and also discuss this paper, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1953.952s">and</a>  see if really it provides the benefits that's mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1959.656s">And</a>  what impact will the baseline charge have on residents in this community that are already overpaying? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1967.922s">We</a>  have surplus in the water and sewer enterprise accounts, over $8 million lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1972.425s">I</a>  remember the surplus account was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1975.127s">And</a>  now we're adding what I refer to as another hidden charge that supposedly will eventually be used <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1983.427s">to</a>  offset rates, but I think this council really needs to get a handle on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=1990.953s">And</a>  I would respectfully ask my colleagues to lay this on the table for two weeks until we have a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss this very important baseline issue, which has a lot to do with water and sewer charges on behalf of every ratepayer in this community.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2007.967s">Motion</a>  by Councilor, Vice President Mox, to table this for two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2012.1s">Second</a>  and by the whole the committee hold me and do I have a committee the whole bit second and by Is it okay if I make a comment to you Through you the chair to Councilor Marks in regards to the connectivity fee Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2026.334s">I</a>  just wanted to elaborate just a little bit The can I was at the water and sewer commission meeting and the connectivity fee is actually for more of a maintenance fee <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2036.09s">We</a>  have to give them that service and provide that service to the people to give them the water and the sewer and the upkeep of those pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2043.019s">And</a>  actually, they need to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2044.721s">And</a>  that's actually a common theme throughout different cities.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2048.245s">And</a>  right now, that's part of what we pay as water and sewer rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2052.55s">We</a>  pay for personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2054.433s">We</a>  pay for maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2057.634s">And</a>  this is in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2059.135s">So</a>  we've been providing these services all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2062.416s">And</a>  I don't buy the fact that this is now going to be used for upkeep of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2067.238s">Who's</a>  been upkeeping the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2069.019s">We,</a>  the ratepayers, have been.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2070.54s">It's</a>  a part of upkeep and the administration and the people that are going out and tracking, that are maintaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2075.402s">That's</a>  a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2076.342s">But</a>  we do have the paperwork that shows the need for the fee that's included.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2080.404s">I'm</a>  not doubting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2081.743s">I</a>  think this council should be privy when everyone gets their water bill, and they're going to be built, by the way, just so you know, it's depending on the size of the pipe that comes into your home, and they're going to be built every pay period. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2093.066s">So</a>  residential homeowners could be seeing an additional $25 or $30 every pay period that's listed on their bill as a baseline charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2103.449s">So</a>  these are the things, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2105.99s">I</a>  think that we have to discuss, because we should be the first to know about when residents call us and say, hey, what's this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2112.314s">And</a>  believe me, they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2113.615s">What's</a>  this additional $30 that I'm seeing on my bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2116.357s">And</a>  then we're going to have to explain, well, ma'am, that is for infrastructure and maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2121.901s">Well,</a>  why do you have $8 million surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2123.782s">What's</a>  that for? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2125.541s">So</a>  these are the questions I think we need answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2127.622s">I'm</a>  not saying it's not a bad idea or a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2130.664s">I'm</a>  saying it deserves deliberation and dialogue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2134.246s">And</a>  we should be in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2135.266s">Did</a>  anyone know about this baseline charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2138.308s">Anybody</a>  know about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2139.528s">Seven</a>  Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2141.009s">No</a>  one knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2143.25s">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2144.211s">When</a>  is it starting? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2145.131s">It</a>  was approved by the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2147.632s">I</a>  don't know when it starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2149.133s">And</a>  that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2150.294s">So</a>  these are the questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2152.775s">I</a>  don't think we should be quick to act on anything tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2155.332s">and</a>  get some answers.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2304.008s">Since</a>  the motion to table has been removed, I have a couple of things I'd like to point out and a question through the chair to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2313.153s">Nunley.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2314.594s">First,</a>  I'd like to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2317.417s">In</a>  recent years, we have not seen such activity, research, seriousness, and sophistication from the Water and Sewer Commission, and we should be grateful for that and for their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2330.844s">It</a>  would be helpful for us to have some information from them regarding what has been presented by my colleague as some sort of service fee, an additional fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2346.847s">I</a>  can only speculate at what that might be directed towards, but I won't do that out loud, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2355.573s">I</a>  would like to request kindly, because what seems to me is the question doesn't necessitate or prevent us from addressing a very pertinent issue, which my colleague has brought up, a very serious issue that we need to address as a body, and I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2375.463s">We're</a>  dealing with what seems to me to be an accounting issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2379.946s">How</a>  do we keep the books? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2383.008s">What</a>  style do we use? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2384.85s">I</a>  can only imagine that when this water and sewer enterprise account was initiated some many decades ago, that it was a style of accounting that might not be in practice today to have them divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2400.781s">Yet,</a>  they will on the books appear separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2404.88s">The</a>  money will just be in one pot, if I understand correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2408.343s">So,</a>  through the Chair, to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2409.564s">Nunley,</a>  if I could ask, is there precedent for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2412.887s">Is</a>  there a new guideline that has come out from the Commonwealth? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2415.95s">Is</a>  this a practice that is being adopted by cities and towns who have a water and sewer enterprise account?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2423.176s">Through</a>  the Chair, Councilor Dello Russo, yes, Winchester actually has a combined water and sewer fund, and it is permissible to combine it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2432.363s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2433.264s">Just</a>  an accounting reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2434.445s">Yes,</a>  there would still be separate lines within the one fund.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2437.147s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2438.808s">Mr.</a>  President, I have no problem with this matter before us as far as seeking permission, because we are the authorizing body, obviously, to address this matter of bookkeeping, a matter of bookkeeping and account keeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2459.007s">It</a>  in no ways, in my opinion, abdicates or, uh, minimizes, uh, the matter that my colleague, uh, brought up, which we should have a clear and a significant, uh, uh, conversation with the water and sewing commission about, especially as we're entering the budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2478.256s">So</a>  I move approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2481.798s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2485.499s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2487.578s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2487.758s">Nunley,</a>  in reading the memorandum that you put together for the Water and Sewer Commission, it explains a little bit about a lot of duplication of efforts that your office performs now because you have these two separate funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2498.225s">Could</a>  you go into that a little bit for me and make me understand it a little bit better, please?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2502.027s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2502.407s">So</a>  as far as personnel is concerned, we have to split them between the two for reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2507.25s">And</a>  if I had it in one fund, if they were working on the enterprise fund, they could be 100 percent just charged the enterprise fund instead of trying to figure out, okay, they're spending 60 percent of their time doing sewer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2517.521s">40%</a>  of their time doing water, then trying to split out their benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2522.484s">The</a>  different liens, when we're billing liens, we can now just put it in one fund instead of having to put liens into two separate items. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2528.487s">It</a>  makes it a lot easier, a lot cleaner.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2529.968s">And</a>  that's in terms of operations and in terms of administration?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2534.87s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2540.093s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2540.793s">Dunley.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2547.364s">As</a>  I stated originally, I'm not opposed to this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2551.445s">They're</a>  asking for a consolidation of accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2554.686s">I'm</a>  not saying whether it's a good or bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2556.766s">The</a>  issue that I brought up regarding the baseline charge, where this money actually goes into these accounts, I think is only appropriate at the time that we look at both, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2566.688s">You</a>  know, it only makes sense to me to review both issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2569.948s">You</a>  know, this is an accounting issue or a bookkeeping issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2573.143s">If</a>  it's such a simple issue, why hasn't the administration been before us in the past 25 years saying, how do we simplify this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2580.428s">And</a>  it's great that you're taking the initiative, if it was your, if it came from the mayor, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2585.772s">But</a>  I'm glad to see them streamlining, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2589.054s">But</a>  there's no rush to do this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2591.836s">This</a>  is how it existed for 25 years in this community and awaiting two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2597.182s">to</a>  sit down with all the interested parties and find out about this paper and also about the baseline charge, I think is prudent government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=2605.984s">And</a>  I will support tabling the issue, Mr. President, and ask for a roll call vote on the table and that we meet within two weeks as a committee of the whole.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3058.189s">Move</a>  forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3058.709s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3059.269s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3060.049s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3062.35s">John</a>  Sorella, 20 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3065.131s">Mr.</a>  President, I would respectfully urge this council to table this motion, and I'll tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3075.753s">What</a>  we're doing here is appointing nine people to this preservation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3082.675s">Now,</a>  all of the taxpayers are going to pay this surtax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3086.636s">This</a>  really is a surtax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3089.051s">on</a>  the property tax, which, by the way, has a limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3093.213s">This,</a>  but this is not sub-subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3094.993s">This</a>  exceeds the limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3097.855s">That's</a>  illegal, but they're doing it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3100.696s">But</a>  the point I want to make is that when you look at these lists of people, and it doesn't matter if someone was instrumental or not in passing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3107.338s">That's</a>  history. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3108.359s">What</a>  matters is who's on this preservation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3113.201s">Now,</a>  we have eight wards in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3115.822s">Don't</a>  you think all of those taxpayers should be represented? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3119.04s">We</a>  have nine appointments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3121.282s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3123.403s">When</a>  the ordinance was crafted, there is language that's included in the ordinance that says that the appointees that are put forward by the mayor will do their best to represent all geographic areas of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3133.531s">And</a>  if we look at the individuals who have been appointed and where they live, um, we will see that the appointees that are before the city council, um, are spread out and relatively decently across the community in separate wards, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3146.32s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3147.872s">I</a>  beg to differ, Councilor, half of the wards are not represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3151.693s">We</a>  have 16 precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3153.433s">Half</a>  of those precincts are not represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3155.674s">These</a>  also pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3158.134s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3159.814s">I</a>  never made a reference to a ward or a precinct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3162.015s">I</a>  made reference to a geographic area, which is what the ordinance speaks to.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3165.075s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3166.776s">Well,</a>  Mike, we vote by wards, and these people are all taxpayers, and they're in the wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3174.873s">If</a>  you look at this list of nine people, half of them are from West Medford or from borderline areas of the city close to West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3186.838s">Now,</a>  that is not the way to do it in an equitable way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3190.639s">What</a>  we should do is give everybody representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3193.901s">I</a>  think a new list should be offered, and we should have representation throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3201.144s">That</a>  way, a taxpayer will feel <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3205.264s">that</a>  the people on this committee are offering solutions that will also benefit his particular area of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3212.93s">And</a>  it should be so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3214.351s">All</a>  areas should be benefited equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3217.354s">And</a>  when you have a group of nine people, and maybe six of them come from West Medford or West Medford contiguous areas, that simply is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3227.982s">That's</a>  the reason I am urging a table on this motion and requesting the mayor to submit another list <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3235.329s">that</a>  applies to all the people of the city, and it's more democratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3239.533s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3240.233s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cerello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3243.596s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3245.298s">Thank</a>  you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Mefford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3250.842s">I'm</a>  not gonna get into the West Mefford and South Mefford or East Ford, although Dr. Cerello may have brought up some reasonable points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3264.857s">However,</a>  I would like to say the implication that Mr. Sorella made was it was in effect an override of prop two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3276.7s">In</a>  effect, we could say that, but it really wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3279.061s">It</a>  was under the Massachusetts law of the Community Preservation Act, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3285.182s">However,</a>  I'd say when it was voted in by, however it was voted in, and that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3293.16s">kind</a>  of an understatement of how it got approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3297.722s">Um,</a>  I just wanted to say, if I was had input to what to use as one and a half million dollars, if that's what it is, the first thing I would do is they talk about Shibali auditorium as having being the crown jewel of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3317.084s">However,</a>  as you pull into Medford Square from the Rotary, Route 93, Interstate Route 93, on Salem Street, as you're going past the old Medford Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, and on the right-hand side there, after that church, is, I believe it's Martin Pastry, or Mike's, I think it's Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3340.834s">However,</a>  that steeple has not been there since, we shouldn't pull it, Joe's pool room back in 68. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3348.263s">I</a>  would think maybe it's not a crown jewel that's missing, but at least put, as they say on a Christmas tree, a finial on top of that steeple. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3356.545s">It</a>  doesn't have to be a full blown out structure, because it might come down with another windstorm or hurricane and get condemned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3363.767s">It</a>  could be a reasonable facsimile that goes up 20, 30, 40 feet, made of some sort of carbon or plastic material. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3373.149s">At</a>  least the center of the square <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3377.785s">We'll</a>  look a little bit more with a cap on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3383.408s">Make</a>  a better presentation to the outsiders and also to myself as I'm driving my bicycle around City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3390.312s">I</a>  think it's a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3391.693s">People</a>  might think it's not important, but I think we'll make a big presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3398.097s">I</a>  would thank you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3400.438s">The</a>  money gets appropriated into several different categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3404.121s">All</a>  the money does not get spent in one particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3406.638s">There's</a>  different categories where it's a... Yes, I understand.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3410.241s">One</a>  of the major parts of it, if I recollect, is architecture and housing, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3417.366s">But</a>  talk about architecture, historical society should have been on that one 25 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3424.131s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3424.891s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3426.012s">Council</a>  Member O'Kurin. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3427.393s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3429.274s">I</a>  just wanted to go back and review which sections of the city that everybody was... <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3436.756s">lives</a>  in because I do, I agree with the language, with the way the ordinance was drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3441.859s">I</a>  also agree with what Dr. Estrella had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3445.001s">We</a>  want every geographic location represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3448.342s">And</a>  I know to do that would almost be close to impossible because we don't have enough nominees. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3453.105s">But</a>  if you do look at it, you have four appointments from the mayor, which, you know, we do have the resumes attached tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3460.569s">They're</a>  all very good resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3462.23s">Two</a>  are up in the Heights, which everybody spoke about, Joan and Roberta. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3467.035s">One,</a>  and then two are from the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3469.416s">And</a>  then with regards to the appointees that are picked by the commissions, you do have two West Medford, one South, one Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3476.437s">I</a>  think there's another West that was pulled because he's been hired by the OCD to work in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3484.138s">And</a>  then there are, I think, another commission or two that are voting on their member this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3488.699s">So</a>  it's pretty well, I always like to look at that myself, and it is pretty well represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3495.261s">So</a>  we have North. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3497.234s">Wellington,</a>  West, South, and the Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3500.577s">I</a>  think we've covered, you know, everything with the eight nominees that we're voting on tonight, and I just wanted to point that out for the public.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3509.525s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3510.886s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3511.887s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3514.369s">And</a>  I agree with all my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3515.91s">I</a>  think we have a great list of candidates that were presented by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3522.236s">The</a>  one difference I do have, Mr. President, is <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3525.711s">And</a>  I'm not sure about the new Councilors, but it's been past practice of this council that for any appointments, whether it's a confirmation of the mayor's appointment or our own appointment, which we don't have many of, we've always requested that the person appear before the council so we can thoroughly vet them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3546.465s">And</a>  even before that, Mr. President, dating back some eight to 10 years ago, we used to have committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings to interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3555.432s">I</a>  remember sitting across the table asking people questions on why they want the appointment, what do they plan on doing, what do you see the position as. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3565.94s">So</a>  you can get a feel of the person, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3568.522s">It's</a>  great we got the resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3570.283s">And</a>  I know many of these people, so this is not a dig on <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3573.318s">who</a>  applied and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3575.459s">I</a>  think we have to be consistent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3578.219s">We</a>  all talk about transparency, and I think we have to be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3582.56s">If</a>  I'm going to request that someone on the Liquor Board or someone on the Community Development Board appear before us for a confirmation, then you better believe any other confirmations should appear before us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3594.092s">This</a>  council has been great over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3597.013s">In</a>  particular, we have voted to tighten up our rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3602.574s">We</a>  no longer waive third readings, which does away with the public right to come up when we enact an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3613.237s">And</a>  the third reading would allow them to come up and stand before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3617.658s">And</a>  we used to waive that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3619.078s">We</a>  no longer waive that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3621.932s">When</a>  we voted for council president and vice president, there's a conflict, an inherent conflict, because the council president and vice president used to vote on their own pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3632.959s">And</a>  that's not me saying it, that's the ethics commission saying there's a conflict of interest on voting on anything that you have a monetary gain to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3641.404s">And</a>  we no longer do that, Mr. President, if you look at the way we handle our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3646.835s">All</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, no one wants to stall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3649.996s">No</a>  one wants to remove these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3651.977s">Give</a>  them the same opportunity to appear before us and let the council ask questions and thoroughly vet them out, Mr. President, not only for this council, but for the purview of the people watching at home, Mr. President, and the purview of transparency, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3668.204s">So</a>  that's what I would offer tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3670.085s">Let's</a>  invite them up before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3672.166s">This</a>  has been a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3674.107s">Councilor</a>  Knight and other councilors have done yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3676.712s">and</a>  pushing this forward to get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3679.474s">And</a>  I don't think vetting these candidates out, which will have the purse strings of every taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3685.498s">There</a>  is a check and balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3686.498s">We</a>  end up voting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3688.019s">But</a>  they make the recommendation to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3691.101s">And</a>  they do have the purse strings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3695.388s">And</a>  I think, at the very least, we have to do our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3698.55s">The</a>  mayor may have done hers, and we have to do ours, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3702.012s">So,</a>  I would respectfully ask that this be laid on the table, Mr. President, until all the nominees appear before the council for proper vetting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3785.193s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3787.594s">It</a>  was back in July 2016, the mayor came out with the City of Method information technology strategic plan, and that plan was supposed to take place <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3799.1s">from</a>  2016 to 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3800.761s">And</a>  they were going to upgrade many of the computer systems at City Hall, which I think Microsoft Office was back in 2001 that they were using here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3813.166s">Needless</a>  to say, the systems were very outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3815.947s">They</a>  looked into a new phone system, which I believe they have currently on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3820.869s">And</a>  coupled with that, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3822.643s">This</a>  new initiative was also to train employees that were used to working on outdated and archaic systems on the latest and greatest of technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3833.887s">And</a>  as part of the proposal, Mr. President, and that's why I offer this tonight, is there was a section for open government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3841.49s">And</a>  it stated, the city is in the process of studying the use of social networking for providing all city residents equal and timely access to information. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3851.343s">I</a>  have yet to see that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3853.064s">Maybe</a>  there is something in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3855.246s">But</a>  I can tell you right now, there's no social networking going on here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3860.53s">And</a>  there's no community outreach, as far as I can see, from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3864.293s">Other</a>  than, Mr. President, maybe an inundation of reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3870.738s">And</a>  maybe, Mr. President, that we're still using wooden A-frame boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3875.822s">There's</a>  one on Main Street in front of Dunkin' Donuts, alerting people that they're doing street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3882.091s">I</a>  mean, the A-frame boards we used back in the Depression, Mr. President, when people that were jobless were walking around with A-frame signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3890.515s">And</a>  we're still using them in the city of Medford now to let residents know what is going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3897.497s">So</a>  one thing, Mr. President, I want to find out what the social networking that opens it up to every city resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3904.26s">You</a>  know, I got a call last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3906.481s">There's</a>  going to be street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3907.662s">I</a>  said, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3908.562s">They're</a>  alerting me when there's street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3911.608s">Go</a>  onto the city website, you'll find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3915.01s">Why</a>  call, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3916.911s">Why</a>  call residents to let them know there's street sweeping if you're not gonna tell me when the street sweeping is? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3922.755s">And</a>  the system has the ability and the capability of alerting residents by ward, precinct, street, address. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3931.62s">It</a>  has all sorts of capability and the city's not using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3935.162s">I</a>  finally got a call tonight saying there's street sweeping in my neighborhood this, I think it's Wednesday or Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3941.072s">to</a>  move the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3942.252s">So</a>  that's my first question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3944.313s">Where</a>  do we stand with the study that was proposed under the mayor's information technology strategic plan on social networking? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3952.797s">And</a>  the second one was customer service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3954.958s">And</a>  it states information technology is studying the use of payments via the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3960.28s">Wow,</a>  that's unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3962.661s">Imagine</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3963.921s">We</a>  just got a call waiting on the phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3966.662s">So</a>  now you can call and leave a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3968.903s">That</a>  must have been a new, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3970.742s">creation,</a>  and now we're going to have the ability to make payments over the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3975.444s">Imagine</a>  if Amazon couldn't make payments over the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3979.605s">What</a>  would they do, carry a pigeon? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3982.266s">Is</a>  that how they deliver the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3985.228s">So,</a>  Mr. President, it's great to put this stuff out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3988.349s">It</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3989.449s">You</a>  know, when you read it, open government, customer service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3992.971s">We</a>  still have a C-Click Fix program that's not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=3997.245s">Anytime</a>  we ask for the administration to give us the statistics and reports on it, we get no results from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4004.048s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, it's a complete and utter failure, that C-Click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4008.989s">And,</a>  you know, the mayor's talking about automatic transfers of payments and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4014.171s">Has</a>  that happened yet, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4016.412s">It's</a>  been a year and four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4020.073s">It's</a>  been 16 months now, has that happened yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4023.214s">So</a>  those are my questions, Mr. President, regarding social networking and where we stand with payment via the internet on this particular item that was offered by the mayor back in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4034.899s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4039.16s">I</a>  can't say that I do see Facebook things coming from different departments here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4045.323s">So</a>  I know they do do some networking.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4048.504s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4049.764s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4050.524s">Uh,</a>  I just wanted to, uh, while we're on the topic of, uh, information technology, uh, budget season will be upon us soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4058.408s">So,</a>  uh, I'd like to, if we can, if I can amend the resolution, uh, just to see if we can get a report from the, uh, technology department here at city hall to find out, uh, basically what new software has been purchased this year and what is being planned for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4075.897s">And</a>  if we can get an update as to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4078.545s">As</a>  far as the current software that we're using, what version of software are we using? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4082.906s">I</a>  mean, we're in the 21st century here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4085.027s">Our</a>  software should be fairly up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4087.807s">And</a>  I know last year during the budget hearings, we were lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4092.188s">And</a>  I want to see what type of progress we made. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4095.069s">And</a>  it's important to find out before we actually go into a budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4098.69s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4182.113s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4183.314s">This</a>  issue came up last week during the community police meeting at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4190.579s">During</a>  that time, there was a lot of discussion regarding the traffic on, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4194.295s">Harvard</a>  Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4195.015s">And</a>  it seems like this has become a definite quality of life issue where it's getting to the point where it's really tough to even cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4205.0s">The</a>  traffic is heavier. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4206.4s">It's</a>  quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4206.86s">It's</a>  faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4207.481s">So</a>  this is just basically if we could contact the chief of police, have him increase patrols in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4214.664s">And</a>  if we could also have the portable radar unit put down there as well to monitor traffic and speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4223.495s">to</a>  protect the residents in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4226.017s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4226.377s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4227.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4228.078s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4272.697s">Remember</a>  the issues of speeding cars? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4276.219s">We</a>  resolved this issue, or thought we were resolving part of the issue, by implementing a pilot program back some, I think it was three or four years ago, under the McGlynn administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4286.584s">We</a>  carried out one of the three on Winthrop Street, which, by the way, needs to be painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4291.486s">You</a>  can't even see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4292.487s">You</a>  go over it, it's like hitting just a giant hurdle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4297.69s">But,</a>  Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4299.332s">We</a>  were promised the Winthrop Street, which happened, Harvard Street, which is a very dangerous road and highly trafficked, and Central Ave, another long stretch that residents complain about quite frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4312.163s">I</a>  receive complaints, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4314.165s">And</a>  I've sent this administration several requests, where do we stand, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4319.609s">And</a>  if you can find a paper that responds to that request, I'll be a monkey's uncle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4325.19s">Okay,</a>  if you could find that paper, Mr. President, that talks with public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4330.758s">You</a>  know, the mayor's preaching complete streets, we're doing this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4334.323s">What</a>  about the basics, Madam Mayor, that we've already spoke about? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4338.508s">Go</a>  to Ring Road back here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4341.539s">Remember</a>  we installed back some eight years ago the crosswalk that blinks for $50,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4348.562s">We</a>  could have thermoplastic the whole city for $50,000, as you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4352.743s">Now</a>  go buy it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4354.564s">All</a>  the blinkers in the street were torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4357.105s">Go</a>  buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4357.805s">There's</a>  all holes with no more blinkers in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4360.606s">We</a>  just spent $50,000 for that crosswalk, and it's gone, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4366.353s">You</a>  know, and you have the mayor touting about complete streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4369.456s">You</a>  know, it just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President, that when you talk public safety issues and you expect results, or at least expect follow-up, you get no response from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4382.068s">No</a>  response at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4383.929s">And</a>  I want to say it's four or five direct votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4386.231s">I</a>  know I offered them personally that were voted on by this council and we have yet to get a request on where we stand with the raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4394.479s">The</a>  residents in those areas that were told, I just had a gentleman the other day at stop at shop say to me, when are we getting our raised crosswalk on central Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4403.168s">And</a>  I said, your guess is as good as mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4405.33s">I've</a>  asked a dozen times and I'm honestly, I'm getting tired of asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4408.982s">the</a>  same question over and over again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4411.483s">So,</a>  once again, I would ask my colleague if I can amend his paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4414.985s">Once</a>  again, we'll send the paper to the mayor and ask, where are the other two raised crosswalks that were promised to this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4421.828s">When</a>  are we going to see them implemented in the interest of public safety?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4428.431s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4429.792s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President, another issue did come up during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4434.314s">A</a>  number of issues came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4435.234s">It</a>  was actually a very productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4436.997s">A</a>  great conversation about a number of issues, but speed did come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4443.784s">And</a>  the point that Councilor Marks had made earlier in the year about lowering the speed limit to 25, that we all voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4450.25s">And</a>  it was a great resolution and something that we all supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4455.255s">The</a>  question was, when are those 25 mile per hour signs coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4459.979s">And</a>  from what I'm hearing, they haven't been procured yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4463.02s">So</a>  if we could get an update as to when they're going to be procured and installed, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4468.922s">Spring</a>  is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4470.543s">And</a>  as we know, people, you know, tend to get out and drive and there's a lot more people walking around. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4475.864s">So</a>  I think it's in everybody's best interest that we get those signs installed as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4481.286s">So</a>  if we could get an update on that, greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4484.067s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4824.043s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, this has been an ongoing issue in the community for quite some time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4828.784s">I</a>  feel like every 90 days I'm making a phone call to Code Enforcement or the Board of Health to go down and take a look at Stone and Skillet and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4836.326s">Now,</a>  don't get me wrong, Stone and Skillet's a great business, and they're doing a great business, and they've absolutely outgrown the location that they're currently located at. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4844.068s">If</a>  you aren't familiar, Stone and Skillet right now is located at the old Marty's for Parties, the old Pranzi's location, right on Winthrop Street on the corner of Winthrop and West Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4854.436s">In</a>  past months, we've seen 18 wheelers double parking on Winthrop Street to load up the truck with product from Stone and Skillet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4861.822s">We've</a>  seen grease trap problems and border health issues that have been rectified in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4866.206s">We've</a>  seen rodent problems because of the border health issues in the past, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4870.549s">And</a>  quite frankly, the neighborhood's a little bit frustrated with it, and they've had enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4875.464s">I</a>  had the opportunity last Thursday evening at 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4878.085s">with</a>  a screaming child in the backseat of my car to drive by Stone and Skillett and see that all the lights were on and the place looked like a nightclub. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4885.066s">And</a>  that's something that's not suitable or appropriate for a residential neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4889.387s">So</a>  I'm asking that the Code Enforcement Office go down and meet with the individuals that operate Stone and Skillett and reiterate the city ordinances that are in place and if need be, levy citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4901.671s">It's</a>  also brought to my attention, Mr. President, that at that location, there were late hours when Prenzies was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4907.455s">And</a>  any special permit or any approval that the city council issued relative to late hours should really go with that business, Prenzies, and not a muffin wholesale that's operating through all hours of the night that's really far outgrown its location, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4922.053s">We're</a>  seeing legitimate 18-wheelers parked on the corner of West Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4925.274s">Legitimate</a>  18-wheelers parked right in front of Molten Seafood in the address 186 Winthrop Street during rush hour, normal business hours, blocking the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4934.597s">It's</a>  gotten to the point of frustration that something needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4937.618s">Something</a>  needs to happen sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4939.899s">I'd</a>  like to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4940.719s">O'Connor</a>  at the Board of Health and Mr. Bavuso and code enforcement because they've been working with me for the past year on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4946.741s">And</a>  I've spoken with them both relative to the filing of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4950.776s">It's</a>  time that something happens down there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=4952.617s">So</a>  I'm asking that my colleagues support this initiative.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5023.357s">Across</a>  the street, across the street too.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5025.257s">Yeah,</a>  I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5025.918s">Third</a>  world. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5027.398s">Yes,</a>  it looks very bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5029.739s">If</a>  the DPW can take care of that immediately, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5034.845s">President,</a>  just while we're in suspension.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5036.326s">While</a>  we're under suspension, Councilor Marks, Vice President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5041.448s">I</a>  move to approval, Mr. Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5042.949s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5045.73s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5047.031s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5048.992s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5049.732s">Just</a>  if I could, Mr. President, a public announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5052.093s">A</a>  very worthy cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5054.394s">On</a>  April 13th, at the Malden Irish American, they're having their first annual music bingo fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5061.778s">The</a>  Volk alumni put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5064.346s">in</a>  the hopes and anticipation to raise some funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5067.868s">As</a>  we heard from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5070.17s">Riccio,</a>  Director Riccio, that was before us, I believe it was last week, regarding all the great initiatives that are taking place at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5079.997s">This</a>  is the alumni, I think it's the first of its kind as far as I know, reaching out to the community on behalf of the vocational students and the school itself to improve the vocational education <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5092.575s">in</a>  our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5093.296s">So</a>  I would urge anyone in the community that has a few extra dollars in their pocket, 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5099.282s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5100.563s">April</a>  13th at Irish American Music Bingo, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5105.148s">And</a>  I heard you're one of the singers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5106.89s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5107.551s">I</a>  am.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5108.131s">I</a>  will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5109.473s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5109.873s">So</a>  I just want to urge everyone to get out there, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5113.296s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5114.04s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5115.001s">If</a>  I can, thank you for, Vice President Marks for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5118.704s">I</a>  think it's a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5121.106s">I</a>  think, I believe, so people understand it's not for the school, but it's actually for the tools that, I believe that part of it is going for our students as they graduate to assist them in purchasing the tools they need in their trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5135.677s">I</a>  think that's what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5136.458s">Riccio</a>  said. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5136.958s">I</a>  thought that was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5138.36s">And</a>  the other thing is that evening, right around the block is, at John Brewer's is, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5144.094s">the</a>  HEMO fundraiser for the Buzz Off, where I've been banned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5150.258s">They</a>  won't allow me in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5151.539s">But</a>  I suggest everybody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5155.582s">There'll</a>  be two events. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5157.963s">That</a>  would be great to stop over and play a little musical bingo, and then see some great people over at John Brewer's for a great cause for the Buzz Off. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5167.55s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5169.371s">I'd</a>  go to the Buzz Off second.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5171.269s">That's</a>  what I say, because you want to look good.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5173.451s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5173.851s">So</a>  Councilor Falco and Scarpelli, they don't get any, you don't get anything buzzed off?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5178.235s">We're</a>  going to bring, we're going to bring.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5187.483s">Motion</a>  by Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5189.785s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5192.087s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5195.95s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5198.752s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5201.588s">17348,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of the late State Senator Charles E. Shannon as April 5th, 2017 marks the 12th anniversary of his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5217.945s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5219.694s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5221.095s">It's</a>  amazing how time flies. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5222.775s">I</a>  remember walking into Senator Shannon's office when I was 19 years old and getting my first big boy job, as I like to call it, and I sat down at a desk next to your son, Richard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5232.076s">And</a>  I logged on to a computer that Councilman Moxley used to sit at, and I began my career in public service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5238.242s">And</a>  through the relationship I have with Senator Shannon and the many moments of teaching that he allowed me to participate in through his guidance and his wisdom, I really <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5251.56s">miss</a>  him and bring this matter forward annually in his remembrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5255.943s">Senator</a>  Shannon did a great deal of work for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5258.165s">He</a>  was a gentleman who, as they like to say, brought home the bacon to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5262.588s">And</a>  that type of representation is something that we need here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5267.371s">And</a>  I was pleased to be a part of it in the senator's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5270.573s">He</a>  worked on a number of important issues that we're seeing come to fruition now, like the extension of the Green Line, marriage equality, just to name a few, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5278.263s">So</a>  it's with a heavy heart that I bring this resolution forward this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5282.866s">However,</a>  it's important to me to remember somebody that's meant so much to me and so much to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5288.269s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask that my colleagues join me in endorsing the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5292.351s">And</a>  if I could reiterate that, you know, Councilor, Senator Sheehan and I first got involved with him when I was involved with youth hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5298.915s">And</a>  he's the one back in the early nineties when the state was going to tear down that La Conte rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5306.05s">Senator</a>  Shannon stepped in and got the funding to keep that building open. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5309.451s">And</a>  since then, he became both a friend and a mentor to me and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5313.253s">So</a>  again, I commend him for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5314.873s">If</a>  we could all stand for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5327.958s">Petitions,</a>  presentations, and similar matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5330.959s">17349,</a>  petition by John Starello, 20 Metcalf Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5335.872s">to</a>  address the council with a template for the upcoming 2018 budget.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5344.233s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5345.974s">Mr.</a>  Starello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5346.254s">John</a>  Starello, residing at 20 Metcalf Street here in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5362.597s">Thank</a>  you for your patience, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5365.62s">I</a>  do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5368.844s">I</a>  did want to <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5395.313s">So,</a>  thank you, Mr. President, and thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5424.991s">all</a>  six councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5428.353s">Uh,</a>  I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you and I want to thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5433.455s">I</a>  want to say the title of my discourse tonight is a template for the upcoming 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5442.559s">In</a>  January, 2016, the Medford city council under the leadership of Councilor John Falco voted unanimously for a template for the 2017 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5455.492s">I</a>  had to look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5456.672s">According</a>  to the dictionary, template means a guide or a model. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5463.374s">The</a>  template was never provided by the administration, so I am offering my anticipation of the fiscal year 2018 budget now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5474.477s">The</a>  city of Boston has already put forth its budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5480.459s">Now,</a>  this is not so difficult to do because there are legal <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5485.07s">parameters</a>  for proposed budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5488.692s">Is</a>  it too early now to discuss a budget to be passed at the end of June? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5493.434s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5495.475s">It</a>  is never too early to discuss the budget because the budget is a lifeblood of the people of Medford in a material sense, of course, not in a spiritual sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5510.563s">There</a>  are senior citizens on fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5514.126s">There</a>  are handicapped young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5517.007s">There</a>  are under educated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5520.187s">There</a>  are drug addicted people and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5524.048s">And</a>  the department heads all tell us of how they all need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5532.13s">The</a>  budget as presented by the executive will be passed automatically by a majority of this council in the last week of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5540.792s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5542.51s">because</a>  that is what has happened every year for almost 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5549.396s">This</a>  year will not be an exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5554.039s">The</a>  council, as is well known, can shape the budget with a majority line-item veto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5562.286s">But,</a>  alas, it does not, forgetting that it has taken an oath to serve the people of Medford, not the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5574.255s">The</a>  council and the audience have been given a copy of the anticipated 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5580.156s">This</a>  year's 2017 budget is $162 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5582.877s">The</a>  anticipated 2018 budget, this is the budget that I am suggesting will be in effect, is $169 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5588.178s">That</a>  is $7 million more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5604.13s">a</a>  4.3 percent increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5606.391s">How</a>  can a 4.3 percent increase be justified? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5611.234s">Social</a>  Security payments to our seniors are flat or diminished. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5616.576s">Ten-year</a>  United States bonds pay only 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5621.499s">Local</a>  banks pay interest to savers as low as one-hundredth of 1 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5628.723s">And</a>  inflation is only 1.3 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5634.44s">Our</a>  city needs 4.3% to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5638.861s">How</a>  can we rationalize such an inequity? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5642.502s">Now,</a>  look at the template for the 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5649.684s">Look</a>  at how we arrive at these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5652.904s">Some</a>  numbers are rounded numbers and some numbers are estimated because we do not have access to official numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5660.806s">But</a>  we will find that we are near accurate because <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5664.685s">They</a>  are based on historical numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5669.329s">Now</a>  about this budget, if you look at it, this is how it happens every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5675.153s">It's</a>  routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5675.954s">You</a>  can predict what's going to happen, because it happens this way every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5680.138s">And</a>  that's when Councilor Falco asked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5684.821s">He</a>  could have followed this here and anticipated the budget, as it's going to be presented, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5691.207s">We</a>  start out with the last levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5693.608s">which</a>  was $104 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5695.95s">Now,</a>  we add to that Proposition 2.5 percent, which is a law, by the way, which is another $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5704.596s">Now,</a>  new growth, I had to estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5706.877s">Usually,</a>  new growth comes to about $1 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5710.92s">Now,</a>  I'm estimating for this year $1.5 million because we have a lot of building going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5717.124s">So,</a>  we arrive at a levy limit <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5720.044s">of</a>  $108 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5722.125s">Now,</a>  that levy limit of $180 million is what the homeowners pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5728.329s">That's</a>  the real estate tax, $108 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5731.691s">And</a>  that is what the people of Medford who own homes will be paying, $108 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5738.816s">We</a>  have to add to that all the other taxes, like, for instance, local fees, state aid, school grants, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5750.227s">return</a>  earnings, and the Enterprise Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5753.049s">I'm</a>  putting the Enterprise Fund in at $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5756.531s">We</a>  discussed that earlier, as you remember, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5759.813s">And</a>  the reason I'm putting that in is because every year it's about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5762.855s">We</a>  have $24 million or $25 million or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5765.517s">And</a>  because water and sewer rates are being raised, I'm estimating it at $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5772.022s">Now,</a>  we arrive at an available budget of $169 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5779.188s">Remember</a>  that number, $169 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5786.23s">Now</a>  about this budget, this budget means tax increases in all our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5792.752s">After</a>  all, the $7 billion must come from somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5800.115s">Only</a>  the city council can reduce the budget as presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5804.356s">But</a>  there are many items that cannot be legally reduced like <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5808.088s">contracted</a>  compensation for our worthy employees, like principal and interest on borrowed money of bonds, like insurance, like pension contributions, like state assessments, like legal liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5829.874s">So</a>  the only item, as far as I can see, that we can reduce is the cost <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5838.135s">of</a>  waste in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5840.636s">Yes,</a>  waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5843.036s">And</a>  there is waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5845.097s">And</a>  it could add up to that $7 million that we were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5848.858s">After</a>  all, it is now only 4% of the $169 million budget, not 4.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5851.919s">There</a>  is surely at least 4% waste in our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5853.999s">The</a>  people of Medford expect honesty, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5867.596s">and</a>  truthfulness from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5870.917s">That</a>  requires an expenditure of time and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5875.358s">The</a>  people expect generosity and kindness from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5883.64s">That</a>  requires, well, the other was truthfulness that required transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5888.862s">That</a>  was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5890.962s">But</a>  generosity and kindness require the expenditure of time and energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5897.053s">The</a>  people expect humility from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5900.154s">That</a>  means no arrogance, no elitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5904.895s">The</a>  people expect courage from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5908.495s">That</a>  means taking some personal risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5911.816s">And</a>  finally, the people expect devotion to the people from our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5920.478s">And</a>  that requires altruism, honesty, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5927.3s">Generosity,</a>  humility, courage, devotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5935.323s">Individuals</a>  who do not embrace those qualities should not be in government because in the pact with government, the people surrender part of their most precious right in return for some service. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5952.949s">That</a>  most precious right is <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5956.693s">their</a>  liberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5959.494s">Marcus</a>  Aurelius, who died in 180 A.D., said, life is short. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5967.818s">That's</a>  all there is to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5970.459s">Get</a>  what we can from the present, thoughtfully, justly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5975.981s">Now,</a>  the two most important words there are thoughtfully, justly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5979.563s">And</a>  he says, get what we can from the present, with thought and with justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=5987.162s">So</a>  when we talk about, I've said this before to the council, they're probably tired of hearing it, but someone must expect responsibility for the increase in taxes constantly, year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6002.945s">Sorry</a>  to say this, I like all of you personally, believe it or not, but sometimes I regret your political actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6014.948s">You</a>  can depend on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6017.446s">I</a>  know you'll never need me, but if you do, I'm available. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6021.328s">But</a>  I want to say that the increase in taxes is unfortunately the responsibility of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6031.052s">The</a>  city council can do something about it, but it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6036.875s">Therefore,</a>  when taxes are increased on the poor, on the people who cannot afford it, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6043.585s">Other</a>  people find difficulty. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6045.547s">Not</a>  the prosperous people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6047.088s">There</a>  are many. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6048.229s">They</a>  can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6049.85s">If</a>  they want to pay more taxes, they should, but they should not impose it on the poor people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6056.555s">That's</a>  one thing that I'm sorry about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6059.558s">One</a>  of the flaws of human nature is that people want to control other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6066.323s">They</a>  ought not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6068.445s">If</a>  you want to pay more taxes, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6071.305s">but</a>  don't compel other people to do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6075.467s">Thank</a>  you very much, councillors.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6076.868s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Stirola. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6082.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6096.597s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6100.703s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6105.447s">It's</a>  hard to follow Dr. Starella, he's so eloquent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6112.553s">And</a>  my education is not so good, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6116.537s">From</a>  Tuspac, I was educated at Woodstock, and I went to BU once. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6121.381s">I</a>  did go to BU once, Boston University I think it's called, but it was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6127.866s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6129.321s">What</a>  really fries my backside is this new growth that's projected at about $1.5 million, it is not, never has been deducted from Prop 2.5 before you raise the real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6156.052s">If</a>  it did last year, the $1.7 million, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6160.65s">of</a>  new growth deducted that first from the two and a half percent of 100 million, two and a half million, you would have had like $800,000 increase instead of two, three, $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6181.404s">Approximately,</a>  I would say, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6188.465s">The</a>  real estate tax was never going up like $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6190.466s">It</a>  probably would have went up $80. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6192.608s">Probably</a>  would have saved 80% on the tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6199.633s">I</a>  don't know why it's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6204.497s">Furthermore,</a>  I don't understand why we can't do what Somerville, Everett, Malden does, Boston, Brookline, and I believe Martha's Vineyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6217.418s">to</a>  give the owner-occupied who live in their one home, doesn't matter if it's a condo, single, two, three family, or 100 family, marauder home, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6228.547s">They're</a>  all gonna get the same 20% exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6232.49s">Actually,</a>  now I'm talking, since it's never been done here, 35% to make it worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6239.436s">So</a>  no one's real estate tax will go up, even if you live in it, because the cap would be <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6247.587s">much</a>  higher than last year's projected $600,000 or thereabouts, it'll go up to $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6254.191s">And</a>  if it does go up, because you live in a house that's valued over $1 million, it's going to be a minuscule increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6260.936s">And</a>  don't forget, at 20%, if that was adopted, it would have been, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6277.537s">I'm</a>  losing track because it's highly unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6282.078s">And</a>  I kind of understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6283.859s">And</a>  if you give the city more money, even on the side, I'm sure they'll take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6291.16s">But</a>  Dr. Sorella brings up some good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6294.501s">I</a>  still understand why we don't use that new growth, because the new growth, we might as well not have it because we don't need more congestion in East Ford, South Medford, because <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6306.174s">They</a>  don't help the real estate tax because it's been carrying the load for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6311.058s">They</a>  hurt us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6312.779s">Need</a>  more police, more fire, schools, school teachers, infrastructure, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6323.126s">So</a>  where does that come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6325.648s">We</a>  need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6327.55s">And</a>  the real estate tax, thanks to Barbara Anderson, rest her soul, is about two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6333.714s">But</a>  like Dr. Stirella says, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6335.405s">last</a>  year's increase or his projected increase for 2018 will be like over 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6340.026s">So</a>  that's a fallacy also, Prop 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6345.588s">How</a>  much more can you tax the lower middle class? <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6348.028s">I</a>  really don't care too much for rich people, and I'm not really in the poor people's corner either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6354.73s">I'm</a>  for the lower middle class, because without the lower middle class, which is the majority, you're not gonna have a society worth a damn, and I repeat, <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6364.068s">and</a>  it might be time for a second revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6367.209s">That's</a>  how this country was founded when we threw out the English. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6371.711s">Give</a>  him a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6374.211s">Please,</a>  help the taxpayer, the average person, please help them for a change, just once.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6381.994s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6384.975s">The</a>  records were passed to Suspension of the Rules by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=6392.381s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo.</p>
