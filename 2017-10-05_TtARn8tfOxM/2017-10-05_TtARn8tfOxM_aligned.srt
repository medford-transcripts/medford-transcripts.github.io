National Grid will restore damaged pavement and loom and seed the landscaped island.

John Jankowski, 170 Medford Street in Malden, Mass.

37
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,738
I'm representing National Grid.

38
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,118
And you are in favor of this?

39
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:43,719
I am.

40
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,059
Do we have anyone else in favor of this?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,180
Hearing none and seeing none, that part of the hearing is closed.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,841
Do we have anyone in opposition to this?

43
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:59,342
Hearing none and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

44
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,502
Councillor Scarpelli.

45
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:03,103
Thank you, Mr. President.

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:13,116
I'm reviewing the records, and I see that all of our departments and paperwork are in order to move forward.

47
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:17,439
The questions I have is that there are no double poles involved with this?

48
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,081
No, not at all.

49
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:28,086
And all the sites are safe and in regulations for the handicapped accessibility?

50
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:32,449
Actually, for the NWRA, they requested a service.

51
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:39,755
MWRA or their contractors will do the digging, they'll put the conduit, they'll pull in the secondary conductor and stuff.

52
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,135
So we'll just have you on the poll.

53
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:42,035
Okay.

54
00:03:42,895 --> 00:04:02,641
Uh, just for, I, I see everything in order just off the record though on Fulton street, if there are the questions I had, there's a pole on Fulton street right at the corner of Salem and Fulton and they have, uh, it's obviously, uh, uh, one of your poles and it has, um, a cable line that's anchored to the sidewalk.

55
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,307
And it's been pulled off of the sidewalk.

56
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,887
And that cable is now almost into the street.

57
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:14,248
And there was a cone over the existing hole.

58
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,208
But that's been dangling there for weeks.

59
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:17,828
I know that we put something in.

60
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:23,609
If you can look into that, is that the type of, are we going to have that type of construction when we lay these poles in?

61
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,750
Are these going fixed in and then being?

62
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,750
No, that's obviously, yeah.

63
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,851
So that's Salem and Fulton?

64
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,291
Salem and Fulton, actually right in front of the,

65
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:37,685
the oil, oil, uh, I think it's Jiffy loop right at the corner.

66
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,526
But if you can look at that, miss Jay Kosky, I really appreciate it.

67
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,207
And I find everything else in order.

68
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,168
Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:48,371
Motion for approval by councilor Scott seconded by councilor Del Rosso.

70
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,252
All those in favor.

71
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:51,553
Oh, excuse me.

72
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:53,053
Councilor Falco.

73
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:54,995
One quick question.

74
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,596
Uh, when will, uh, do we know when the work's taking place?

75
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,678
I would assume, um,

76
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:03,253
I'm not positive.

77
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:08,456
I would assume once this passes, I would think the customer would get started on a week or two, I would assume.

78
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,916
And do we know how long it's going to take?

79
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:12,298
Oh, it should be 15 feet, so I would think it would be a day.

80
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,619
It's all going to be done on the grass strip.

81
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not going to interfere the road itself, which is going to be the grass strip.

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,903
And if I may, really quick, Councilor Scott, probably brought up a good point about a pole.

83
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,905
I got a call the other day about a pole at the corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring.

84
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,134
It was a double pole, and now it's one and a half poles.

85
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,155
They literally cut it in half.

86
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:34,776
It's like a stump.

87
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,097
Oh, OK.

88
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:36,877
There's nothing on it.

89
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:37,818
There's nothing on it.

90
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,059
It's about four feet off the ground.

91
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:39,919
It's kind of odd.

92
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,644
You have one single pole, and there's a pole next to it that was a double pole at one point.

93
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,685
And now it's just about four feet off the ground.

94
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,369
To me, it's a bit of a safety hazard if you have a smaller child that's walking by or running in trips.

95
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:55,431
And I think it's a problem that needs to be addressed.

96
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,352
I will take a look at it.

97
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,052
Thank you very much.

98
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,514
It's a corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring.

99
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:00,542
Thank you.

100
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:01,923
Councilor Knife.

101
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,863
Mr. President, the gentleman at the podium answered my question.

102
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:11,926
By looking at the diagram, I had a question as to whether or not any street excavation was going to take place and whether or not there was going to be a need for a traffic management plan.

103
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:17,007
He's informed us that it's all going to take place on the grass strip, that it's 15 feet of conduit, that it's going to take one day to do.

104
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:17,987
So I have no problem.

105
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,968
I would second Councilor Scapelli's motion for approval.

106
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:21,508
Thank you, Councilor.

107
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:25,030
On the motion by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

108
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,450
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

109
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:32,125
Yes.

110
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:33,405
Councilor Falcone?

111
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:33,865
Yes.

112
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:34,926
Councilor Knight?

113
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:35,586
Yes.

114
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,026
Councilor Locker?

115
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:37,166
Yes.

116
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:38,446
Vice President Monk?

117
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:38,526
Yes.

118
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,387
Councilor Scarpelli?

119
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:42,727
Yes.

120
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:44,007
President Caviello?

121
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:44,527
Yes.

122
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,448
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

123
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,988
The motion passes.

124
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:49,808
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:50,248
Thank you.

126
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,868
Mr. President.

127
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,769
Councilor Dela Russo.

128
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,970
Mr. President, I move suspension of the rules to take papers, communication for the mayor,

129
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:09,647
17350, 17351, and 17352, while we have the pertinent department heads present.

130
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,548
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

131
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,293
On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso to suspend the rules, seconded by Councilor Knight.

132
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,054
All those in favor?

133
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:20,174
Aye.

134
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:21,775
Motion passes.

135
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,877
Communications from the Mayor.

136
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:27,859
17350, to the Honorable President and members

137
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,471
of Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Mass., RE, acceptance of Mass.

138
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,331
General Laws, Chapter 60, Section 15B.

139
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:48,615
Dear Mr. President, City Councilors, I respectfully move that your Honorable Body approve the following City of Medford, Massachusetts, acceptance of Mass.

140
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:57,418
General Laws, Chapter 60, Section 15B, establishing revolving fund for tax title collection, be it resolved

141
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:10,633
that the Medford City Council accept the provisions of Mass General Laws, Chapter 60, Section 15B, to allow the city to establish by a vote a tax title collection revolving fund for the treasurer collector.

142
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:27,357
Funds collected pursuant to Chapter 60, Section 15B, shall include any fees, charges, and costs collected upon the redemption of tax titles and sales of real property acquired through foreclosures of tax titles, fees, charges,

143
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:35,084
and costs incurred by the treasurer-collector may be satisfied through such revolving fund.

144
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:41,189
However, expenditures shall not be made from this revolving fund in excess of the balance of the fund.

145
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:48,574
All interest earned on the tax-dollar collection revolving fund balance shall be treated as general fund revenues.

146
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,856
Sincerely, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

147
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:56,820
And Anne-Marie Irwin, City Treasurer, will be in attendance for our questions.

148
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:58,475
Name and address for the record, please.

149
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,297
Anne-Marie Irwin, Treasurer, City of Medford.

150
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,198
Thank you.

151
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:04,580
If you'd like to explain this, we'd be happy to.

152
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,521
I'd be happy to.

153
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:09,904
Mr. President, through you to the members, this is a very straightforward request.

154
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:23,996
It is to establish a revolving fund that will allow fees and costs associated with delinquent tax cases to be put into this fund and then

155
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,139
would be able to pay the costs associated with those cases.

156
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,560
It wouldn't be subject to appropriation.

157
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:44,187
It would be pretty much a pass-through account where when we get a bill for our legal fees or our fees from the registry, they would already have been paid by the delinquent taxpayer.

158
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,128
We take it out of that account and pay the fees.

159
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:54,744
The Department of Revenue has made a general recommendation that all cities and towns accept this statute.

160
00:09:55,224 --> 00:10:03,526
It's a cleaner, more transparent way to see how funds are being expended to recoup tax title funds.

161
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:04,866
Thank you.

162
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,106
Council Member Kern.

163
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,747
Thank you, President Carviello.

164
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:16,529
If you could explain, I guess, the process we use now and also it sounds like our expenses are going to be taken out of this account.

165
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:19,968
What about properties that are seized or sold?

166
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:23,330
Those money's going to come in and then we're going to expend from the same account?

167
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:35,617
So what happens now is when we pursue a tax title case, taxes, interest, fees, everything, the money has been put forward by the city to pursue those cases.

168
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:43,522
And when the delinquent taxpayer seeks a redemption, they only get a redemption once all those costs have been paid.

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:55,651
The taxes under this revolving fund, the taxes and the interest would go into the general fund, and the costs would then come back to the treasurer, who could then use them to pursue other cases.

170
00:10:56,091 --> 00:11:05,040
Right now, I have a line item of $3,500 to use toward tax title cases, and just this year, we've already filed 30 cases

171
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:13,464
And that's $75 per filing fee, so we're up at about $2,500 already.

172
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:19,587
So it doesn't leave a lot of money to pursue some of the larger cases that require filings in land court, et cetera.

173
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:26,309
So with this, when those fees come in, we can build that up and use it going forward.

174
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:36,133
So this will allow you to—money that is brought in from delinquent properties or money owed can then be—we can use more of it towards

175
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:44,871
collecting from other properties versus, right now you're limited to the $3,500 and you'd have to ask the mayor's office to appropriate more.

176
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:49,573
So this is a way for us to- And this is really being paid back by the delinquent taxpayers.

177
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:57,877
So it's the city getting their money back from the delinquent taxpayer and then using those funds to continue to pursue other delinquent taxpayers.

178
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:04,580
Now, what if we recouped so much money and this account became obviously extremely high,

179
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,237
would we be able to transfer out of it?

180
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:15,600
Well, I'm not certain if you can transfer out of it, but you can close it, which I would assume then would then go to the general fund.

181
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:24,044
I don't foresee it really gaining and growing that much because the fees aren't that great.

182
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:29,307
But if legal fees are being paid by a taxpayer, then we're going to have to pay the legal bill.

183
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:32,548
So it goes in and goes out pretty regularly.

184
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,924
And what's the purpose of the DOR recommending this?

185
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:48,527
I think they think it's cleaner and it's more transparent for cities and towns to show how much money is spent and how much money is recouped through the process.

186
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:49,367
Thank you.

187
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:52,288
Councillor de la Ruche.

188
00:12:52,428 --> 00:13:01,650
Mr. President, as one who's always been an advocate and supporter of efficiency in government,

189
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:08,316
and in the pursuit of transparency.

190
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,120
I support this resolution in motion for approval.

191
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,641
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.

192
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:16,942
Second.

193
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,802
Vice President Marks.

194
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:21,185
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Anne, for coming tonight.

195
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:28,530
Do you know what was expended the last three years to collect for these taxed delinquent properties?

196
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:30,211
It's been $3,500 on the line item,

197
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:35,048
It's gone into deficit, I'm sure, at some point.

198
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:35,469
Right.

199
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,351
So we don't have an accounting over the last three years how much has been expended to collect each and every year?

200
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:42,112
I realize your budget line item.

201
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,593
Right.

202
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:43,853
Over and above the budget line item.

203
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:50,717
I can tell you how much has been spent in this year, which is $112,000.

204
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:51,477
Right.

205
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:57,441
So what I'm trying to do is get a picture of what we've done in the past.

206
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,082
Have we hired outside?

207
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,403
Because I assume that

208
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,452
Part of this money will go to outside attorneys, is that not correct?

209
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,214
Yes, and we have hired outside counsel.

210
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:06,654
Right.

211
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:12,180
What we've expended in the past, what are percent that we've gained from expending this money?

212
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,867
So just say in a given year we expend $100,000 and we get back $300,000 in tax title.

213
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:24,170
Do we have an estimate on every year?

214
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,793
Yeah, I can give you a breakdown right now.

215
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,238
I checked it today.

216
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:33,060
We've, um, I want to see a few years, not just, well, I would have to look back.

217
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,261
I've only been here for a little over a year, so I would look back.

218
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:42,503
But right now, um, under mayor Burke's tenure, we've brought in $2.25 million and spent, um, about $110,000 to do that.

219
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:48,492
That's great.

220
00:14:48,512 --> 00:15:15,738
So I'd like to see a picture, Mr. President, if we could, on maybe the last five years, what has been, in addition to the line item that was mentioned, what has been expended by the Treasurer-Collector's Office and how much money has been taken in for that period of time so we can get a handle on whether or not we're expending too much money or whether or not we're getting our bank for our buck by hiring these attorneys, and what the practice has been in the past.

221
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,699
Has it always been outside attorneys?

222
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,564
So maybe if we get a breakdown of what the expenses were, too, over the past five years, compared to collections.

223
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:28,026
I, as one member, think that would be helpful to make a decision.

224
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,307
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

225
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,650
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, is seconded by Councilor Falco.

226
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,911
Councilor Longo-Kern.

227
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:41,675
Just to make sure I completely understand it, I thought any monies recouped would go into this account.

228
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:46,198
So if we had this account open now and we would have $2.2

229
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:49,008
to $5 million minus the $110,000?

230
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,189
Oh, no.

231
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:57,074
Only the cost and fees that we recoup would be in the revolving fund.

232
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:05,519
And then that would give us sort of the seed money to continue prosecuting, not prosecuting, but getting those cases to come to fruition.

233
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,243
And the taxes and the interest that we get goes to the general fund.

234
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,745
So the $2.25 million would go to the general fund?

235
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,747
That has already gone to the general fund.

236
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:18,367
Right, OK.

237
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:28,014
And that includes, included in that are all of the legal fees, because the delinquent taxpayer pays the legal fee.

238
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:28,075
OK.

239
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:39,463
So if this happened next year, $2.25 minus the $1.12 of costs and fees, $1.12 would go into this new account, and then the rest would go into the general fund.

240
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:39,895
Right.

241
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,458
Provided that those, you know, it's a ballpark.

242
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:49,845
So it's def, it's always difficult for the treasurer to know how much needs to be expended to, to get these monies back.

243
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:53,988
Sometimes it's one letter and sometimes it's, it's a case in land court.

244
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,433
So it's difficult to know how much, um, needs to be expended.

245
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:04,698
And we did spend a lot of time in the beginning looking through the cases and then, um,

246
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:11,949
grouping them into group A, B, and C. And group A, we're just finishing those cases up now.

247
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:25,612
And those were the ones that were, if you will, the easier ones, that there were no issues with title or issues with taxpayers no longer living in the city or owning the property.

248
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:29,032
Most of those cases are coming to fruition now.

249
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,653
We have a bunch still in land court.

250
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:33,053
And then we're going to move on to batch B, which

251
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,692
are going to be more difficult because they have issues.

252
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,873
And then the $75 filing fee, that's not lien court.

253
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,394
What is that, a filing fee for you mentioned?

254
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:55,957
So when the city takes the property, once we send notice and the taxpayer ignores the notice, then we record the lien.

255
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:56,557
Yes.

256
00:17:56,657 --> 00:18:00,279
Then we just advertise to, and then we record it.

257
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:00,939
Gotcha.

258
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,379
Thank you.

259
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:03,766
Vice President Mux.

260
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:04,967
Thank you.

261
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:15,095
So, and I'm not sure if you're prepared to answer it tonight, but based on the $2 million figure you just gave, is that something that your office has been working on in the past year and a half?

262
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:21,600
Or is that something that may have been initiated three or four years ago that finally went through land court and settled?

263
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,326
No, that was, um, that's money that has been come into the city starting January 4th, 2016 to today.

264
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:39,216
And that has all been a result of the work that our office has done.

265
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:45,738
So that was work that was tracked down recently within the past year and a half, letters sent and so forth.

266
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:54,981
When I arrived, there was over four, I'm going to say $4.2 million out on the street in tax money.

267
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:56,802
Currently right now?

268
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:58,382
No, when I arrived.

269
00:18:59,102 --> 00:18:59,622
When you arrived.

270
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:01,643
What do we have in delinquent taxes right now?

271
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,044
We're below 2 million right now.

272
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,306
For the entire city, we're below 2 million?

273
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:08,546
Mm-hmm.

274
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:10,367
Wow.

275
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:11,968
I thought it would be much higher than that.

276
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:13,028
Well, it grows.

277
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:23,174
I mean, we're going to hit the next quarter, May 1st, and then we're going to get people who are delinquent then, and we're going to add new cases to the roll.

278
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:29,817
And this amount reflects also anyone that is delinquent in their water and sewer, correct?

279
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,658
Water and sewer goes on to your, when you don't pay your water and sewer bill, that goes on to your real estate bill.

280
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,019
It's leaned on your real estate bill.

281
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,163
And then if you don't pay real estate, do we know what percentage out of that 2 million was water and sewer?

282
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:42,744
I don't know.

283
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:44,145
I'd have to, I would have to look at that.

284
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:44,825
Okay.

285
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:57,094
And my last question back some years ago, well before your time here as treasurer collector, uh, there was a proposal offered, uh, by the previous administration, uh, to look at a tax amnesty.

286
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,696
Uh, where do you stand on tax amnesty?

287
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:20,677
I'm opposed to a tax amnesty because I believe I see a lot of people who come in and pay their taxes in a timely manner and they're making sacrifices and they're not doing all the things that they may want to do, maybe not taking a trip or buying the new car, but they're making sure that their taxes are paid.

288
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:23,179
And I think that those people

289
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,235
are doing the right thing by the city.

290
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:38,959
And I think when people choose not to, and I understand there are people who can't, and we work with those people, but when people choose not to pay their tax bills or their water and sewer bills, we still have bills as a city that have to get paid every month.

291
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:46,901
And so to allow people to forego any interest or penalties and come in and pay the tax just doesn't seem fair to me.

292
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,683
So just educate me.

293
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:54,604
If someone is delinquent for years, and just say there are a number

294
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,383
of people that are delinquent for years.

295
00:20:56,883 --> 00:21:00,926
Do we assess the taxes based on those that are delinquent?

296
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:06,390
Like you're saying, geez, we have people that are repeat offenders.

297
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,312
They haven't paid their taxes or their water bill in 10 years.

298
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:17,177
Do we take that into consideration when we set our tax numbers and our budget numbers?

299
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:23,832
Right, because those are accounts receivable that we haven't brought in, that we can't get to come in.

300
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:29,714
No, but are we charging other taxpayers more money based on the fact that those delinquents aren't paying?

301
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:36,715
If the delinquency goes on the recap, and then those are receivables that we can't get, then yes.

302
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:44,016
But I would have to, Alicia would be able to answer that better than me, where the receivables would appear.

303
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,377
If she could, I'd like to get an answer on that.

304
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,591
Name and address of the record, please.

305
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,273
Alicia Dunlea, Finance Director, City of Medford.

306
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:56,916
No, they're not directly increased based on those losses, on those people that are not collecting.

307
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,218
That's why she's trying to actively do tax title.

308
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:04,802
And we could actually do foreclosures if we felt like going that far.

309
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:09,285
So we absorb, meaning the city absorbs those delinquents?

310
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:12,687
Well, they're kept as accounts receivable outstanding.

311
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,989
So we're going to keep trying to get them in tax title.

312
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,950
And we do have the ability, if we can't

313
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,300
recoup that money to try to take it through foreclosure.

314
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,700
Right.

315
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,603
So, so at what point do we reach out?

316
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:30,668
Is it when the, uh, amount of property that's owed or the amount of money that's owed surpasses what the assessed value is?

317
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:34,610
At what time do we go out and start pursuing those legal avenues?

318
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:37,533
Um, that would be a discussion I would have with the mayor and with the treasurer.

319
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,734
I can't give an exact answer on that right now.

320
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:42,116
So are they ongoing those discussions?

321
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:56,195
Well, if I may, we, we are always, I have a running list of tax title accounts and I'm always reviewing it and, uh, seeing how we can get to these people and get these monies in.

322
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:59,876
Um, it's not something we review once every six months.

323
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:05,218
It's a, it's a continuing effort on the part of my office to bring that money back to the city.

324
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,399
Okay.

325
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,200
And my last question is, uh, based on,

326
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,897
What we've brought in, you said, over $2 million.

327
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:15,698
How many properties does that actually account for?

328
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,020
Are we talking one large commercial property?

329
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,902
Are we talking 300 small properties?

330
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:26,583
They're probably, I want to say, I had a report the other day.

331
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,006
I'm going to say 50 plus properties brought in.

332
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:39,530
I'm going to say probably that's about 60 properties because we had some that were in litigation and some that resolved short of litigation.

333
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:40,887
about 60 properties.

334
00:23:41,488 --> 00:24:08,981
So I would just ask, Mr. President, that we receive the questions that were asked tonight regarding the three or five years, which, you know, either one would be fine with me, of number of the amount of money that was requested, not just within the budget, but requested by the treasurer-collector to collect on these tax delinquents over the past three years.

335
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,526
And what percent have we brought in based on those particular years?

336
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:17,049
So if we could see a run and tally for the past three years.

337
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:18,350
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

338
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,690
Thank you.

339
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:25,536
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso and seconded by Councilor Falco as amended by Vice President Motz.

340
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,117
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

341
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,199
Councilor DelaRusso?

342
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:30,439
Yes.

343
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,861
Councilor Falco?

344
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:32,101
Yes.

345
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,610
Councilor Knight?

346
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,130
Yes.

347
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,451
Councilor Lockhart?

348
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:35,551
Yes.

349
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,151
Vice President Marks?

350
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:37,511
Yes.

351
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:38,932
Councilor Scarpelli?

352
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:39,372
Yes.

353
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:40,752
President Caprio?

354
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,172
Yes.

355
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:44,673
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

356
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:46,154
Motion passes.

357
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:48,755
17-352.

358
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:54,696
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Metro-Mass.

359
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:57,257
Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:03,481
17351 to the Honorable President, members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, and Memphis Mass.

361
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:20,047
Dear Mr. President and City Councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve combining the Water Enterprise Fund and Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund per Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53,

362
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:24,626
F1 and 2.

363
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:29,908
To that end, I hereby, I recommend your approval of the following resolution.

364
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:49,299
Be it resolved that the City of Medford accepts the provisions of Chapter 44, Section 53 F1 and 2 of the Massachusetts General Laws and combines the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund, effective fiscal year 2018, attached

365
00:25:52,125 --> 00:26:02,968
is the combined Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds Memorandum that was provided to the Water and Sewer Commission, highlighting the benefits of consolidating the two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund.

366
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:07,669
Also, a letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided, which demonstrates their support.

367
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,251
Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any questions from the council regarding this matter.

368
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:16,392
Good evening.

369
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:17,952
Name and address of the record again.

370
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,453
Alicia Nunley, Finance Director, City of Medford.

371
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,176
Good evening, Honorable President and Councillors.

372
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:27,036
Would you explain the proposal?

373
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:28,337
Absolutely, yes.

374
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:39,219
So what we would like to do is combine the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund for reporting since everything is under MWRA here.

375
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,740
It just makes more sense for reporting to have it all in one fund.

376
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,661
Yes, for financial reporting.

377
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:52,482
Any questions?

378
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:56,986
Councilor Nyeth.

379
00:26:57,506 --> 00:27:02,791
It's my understanding that this matter has made its way through the Water and Sewer Commission, and that's a recommendation that they've made?

380
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:03,371
Yes.

381
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:04,452
Thank you.

382
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,214
Vice President Mox.

383
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,256
Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:20,625
Knowing that there's always been a distinction between the water and the sewer accounts through this enterprise account, and also the budgeting is based on

385
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:26,546
or some of the budgeting is based on what is in with these particular accounts.

386
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:50,883
I was just wondering, what else, maybe if Alicia can specify, why else, other than this makes it easier for accounting, why else would we change over, knowing that, to me, like the budget, having separate budget line items is more accountable than having just one total budget line item when it talks about appropriations and to making sure that

387
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,713
money is spent, the taxpayer money is spent appropriately.

388
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:57,496
So what other reasons can you give us for this change?

389
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,599
Well, it's easier also for tracking for expenses.

390
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:13,211
So instead of trying to split it up between how much somebody is working on sewer versus how much somebody is working on water, for recording fixed assets, it's easier for me than to see what I want to attribute to water, what I want to attribute to sewer.

391
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,900
We could also break it up within the one fund.

392
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,363
It could still have those separate lines showing a water revenue, a sewer revenue.

393
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:23,244
It would just be in one fund.

394
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:26,525
So it wouldn't be necessarily it's one line item.

395
00:28:26,886 --> 00:28:29,787
It would still show those differences, but in one fund.

396
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:31,188
Does that make sense?

397
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:36,131
But if you're still taking the time to account for them within one fund, what's the big cost?

398
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,972
It gives more flexibility as well.

399
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:43,355
So, for instance, when I had to come to you guys in December and I had to get that appropriation to cover

400
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,418
The $563,000, I believe, about, I was short in the sewer fund.

401
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:54,321
If they were in one fund, if I have a surplus in one and a deficit in the other, I can put them together.

402
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:57,223
I don't have to go forward and it can clean itself up.

403
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:01,085
And it's all going to MWRA anyway.

404
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:02,386
Right.

405
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:05,968
What do we have currently within the combined accounts?

406
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,631
Now, when you're saying you're asking me as far as revenues, you're asking me as far as expenses.

407
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,744
No, what do we have in the water and sewer enterprise accounts?

408
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:15,445
That's what I'm saying.

409
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,428
Are you asking me as far as money and revenue collections?

410
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:18,808
Money.

411
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:19,889
What do we have in there for money?

412
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,574
In the sewer account, I have $10,297,330.19.

413
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:25,574
$10,297,330.19?

414
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:25,875
Yep.

415
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,216
And in the water fund, I have $8,213,355.33.

416
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,902
And what do we anticipate the surplus to be in these accounts?

417
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,284
I would have actually had to bring that with me from the Water and Sewer Commission.

418
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,245
I actually didn't bring that with me.

419
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:56,825
I apologize, but I can provide that to you.

420
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,066
Are we looking at about $8 million, $9 million?

421
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:00,386
Because that's the last figure I heard.

422
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,248
No, that's as much as revenue that's come in.

423
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,308
That's not a surplus.

424
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:06,269
That's just revenue that's come in near to date.

425
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,149
This figure, correct.

426
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:07,329
Yes.

427
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,750
But what do we anticipate to have as a surplus?

428
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:11,047
That's what I'm saying.

429
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,207
I don't have that figure with me.

430
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:12,808
I'd have to get that.

431
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:14,448
You don't have a ballpark estimate?

432
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,129
I didn't bring that paperwork with me.

433
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,230
But I do have it from when we did the Water and Sewer Commission when we were looking at rates.

434
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,951
We did look at what the projected would be, and I can get that to you.

435
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:34,854
Mr. President, if I could, this council has requested on several occasions within the past six months.

436
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:39,375
One time we took a unanimous vote, I believe it was,

437
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:48,514
to ask the Water and Sewer Commissioners whether or not they're looking to implement a connectivity fee in water and sewer.

438
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,994
And we have yet to get a response.

439
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:57,976
And I know Councilor Longo-Kern asked recently about new construction and having a connectivity fee.

440
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:08,038
But the issue that I brought up several months ago was through a conversation I had regarding the Water and Sewer Commissioners voting

441
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,470
on creating what they refer to as a baseline charge.

442
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,510
And I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.

443
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,271
Are you familiar with that?

444
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:15,591
Yes, I am.

445
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:26,274
As far as I know, Mr. President, the Water and Sewer Commission has just recently voted to implement the baseline charge to every water and sewer ratepayer in this community.

446
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:28,715
And you can call it a baseline charge.

447
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,595
You can call it connectivity fee.

448
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:32,275
You can call it Mickey Mouse.

449
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,756
You can call it whatever you want to call it.

450
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:37,717
What it is is a connection charge that they're charging.

451
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:51,674
And I've been told that this baseline charge is going to be roughly about $1.5 million, divided among all of our ratepayers in the community that pay water and sewer.

452
00:31:52,535 --> 00:32:07,163
And I think it's extremely important now, before we change any accounts or consolidate any accounts, that we get a handle, Mr. President, not only on this paper and the ramifications this paper may have on the accounting and

453
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:17,505
tracking and transparency in this community, but also, Mr. President, on the recent vote by the Water and Sewer Commission on this baseline charge.

454
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:19,827
I think it's extremely important.

455
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:25,891
I would ask my fellow colleagues that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting with the Water and Sewer Commissioners, Ms.

456
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:33,117
Nunley, and anyone from the mayor's office to discuss the baseline charge and also discuss this paper, Mr. President,

457
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,996
and see if really it provides the benefits that's mentioned.

458
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:47,162
And what impact will the baseline charge have on residents in this community that are already overpaying?

459
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:52,405
We have surplus in the water and sewer enterprise accounts, over $8 million lost.

460
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:54,707
I remember the surplus account was.

461
00:32:55,127 --> 00:33:03,013
And now we're adding what I refer to as another hidden charge that supposedly will eventually be used

462
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:10,633
to offset rates, but I think this council really needs to get a handle on this, Mr. President.

463
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:26,786
And I would respectfully ask my colleagues to lay this on the table for two weeks until we have a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss this very important baseline issue, which has a lot to do with water and sewer charges on behalf of every ratepayer in this community.

464
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,510
Motion by Councilor, Vice President Mox, to table this for two weeks.

465
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:46,294
Second and by the whole the committee hold me and do I have a committee the whole bit second and by Is it okay if I make a comment to you Through you the chair to council marks in regards to the connectivity fee council marks.

466
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:55,703
I just wanted to elaborate just a little bit The can I was at the water and sewer commission meeting and the connectivity fee is actually for more of a maintenance fee

467
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:02,578
We have to give them that service and provide that service to the people to give them the water and the sewer and the upkeep of those pipes.

468
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,621
And actually, they need to have that.

469
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:08,225
And that's actually a common theme throughout different cities.

470
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:12,110
And right now, that's part of what we pay as water and sewer rate payers.

471
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,832
We pay for personnel.

472
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:17,134
We pay for maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure.

473
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:18,795
And this is in addition.

474
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:21,476
So we've been providing these services all along.

475
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:26,938
And I don't buy the fact that this is now going to be used for upkeep of the system.

476
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:28,979
Who's been upkeeping the system?

477
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,099
We, the ratepayers, have been.

478
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,342
It's a part of upkeep and the administration and the people that are going out and tracking, that are maintaining.

479
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:36,222
That's a part of it.

480
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:40,083
But we do have the paperwork that shows the need for the fee that's included.

481
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:41,144
I'm not doubting that.

482
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:52,586
I think this council should be privy when everyone gets their water bill, and they're going to be built, by the way, just so you know, it's depending on the size of the pipe that comes into your home, and they're going to be built every pay period.

483
00:34:53,066 --> 00:35:02,889
So residential homeowners could be seeing an additional $25 or $30 every pay period that's listed on their bill as a baseline charge.

484
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,570
So these are the things, Mr. President,

485
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:12,234
I think that we have to discuss, because we should be the first to know about when residents call us and say, hey, what's this?

486
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:13,195
And believe me, they will.

487
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:15,997
What's this additional $30 that I'm seeing on my bill?

488
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:21,261
And then we're going to have to explain, well, ma'am, that is for infrastructure and maintenance.

489
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,742
Well, why do you have $8 million surplus?

490
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:24,383
What's that for?

491
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,382
So these are the questions I think we need answered.

492
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:30,364
I'm not saying it's not a bad idea or a good idea.

493
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:34,005
I'm saying it deserves deliberation and dialogue, Mr. President.

494
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,086
And we should be in the loop.

495
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,047
Did anyone know about this baseline charge?

496
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,188
Anybody know about this?

497
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:40,389
Seven counselors?

498
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:41,809
No one knew about it.

499
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,070
That's a good question.

500
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:44,931
When is it starting?

501
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:46,832
It was approved by the Water and Sewer Commission.

502
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:48,713
I don't know when it starts.

503
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,254
And that's a good question.

504
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:52,495
So these are the questions, Mr. President.

505
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,936
I don't think we should be quick to act on anything tonight.

506
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:56,133
and get some answers.

507
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:00,137
On the motion by Mr. President, the table by Councilor Marks.

508
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,120
Mr. President, Councilor Marks has the floor.

509
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:07,164
Do you yield Councilor Marks?

510
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:08,745
I yield to the gentleman, Mr. President.

511
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,189
Name and address of the record, please.

512
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:15,192
Mr. President, John Stirol, 20 Metcalfe Street.

513
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:18,319
Councilor DelaRusso, point of order.

514
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:20,339
Mr. President, he cannot speak.

515
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,081
There has been a motion made to table.

516
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,801
Have you read Robert's Rules of Debate?

517
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,782
Councilor DelaRusso has asked for a point of order.

518
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:29,722
He cannot do it.

519
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:34,184
According to the Rules of Debate, he cannot speak and neither can Councilor Marks.

520
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:35,584
Nobody here can speak.

521
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:37,465
Once a motion is made...

522
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:47,010
to table, all debate is closed, and a vote must be taken immediately, and it's not even necessary to second.

523
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:50,833
Now you should follow the rules.

524
00:36:52,073 --> 00:37:07,583
Mr. President, it was my intention, with all due respect, to kindly point out that there was a motion to table on the floor, which ended debate, yet we continued on in debate, and I wanted to kindly

525
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,688
and respectfully point that out.

526
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:09,908
Thank you.

527
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:14,370
And hope that we can take a vote on this or dispose of the matter.

528
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,151
On the motion by Councilor Marks, the table for two weeks.

529
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:22,493
Mr. President, if the gentleman would like to speak, I'll withdraw my motion and then I'll, if Mr. Strong- Do you want to withdraw your motion?

530
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:24,134
I'll withdraw my motion so Mr. Strong can speak.

531
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,335
Councilor Marks has withdrawn his motion.

532
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:29,456
May I speak as a member of this body, Mr. President?

533
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:33,238
Mr. President, the motion has been made.

534
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,419
Councilor Marks has withdrawn his motion.

535
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,200
Well, if you withdraw your-

536
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:38,708
He's withdrawing his motion.

537
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:39,388
I'll allow you to speak, John.

538
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,148
You want to speak or no?

539
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:41,009
Do you want to speak?

540
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:41,529
Yes, I do.

541
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:42,449
I am speaking.

542
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:42,569
Yes.

543
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:44,710
He withdrew his motion so you can speak.

544
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,130
Please, no interruptions.

545
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,891
Now, a motion has been made to table.

546
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:53,132
Debate has to be closed immediately.

547
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:55,692
None of the counselors can speak.

548
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:57,873
A second is not needed.

549
00:37:58,353 --> 00:38:04,174
You should have a copy of Robert's rules here and a vote should be taken immediately.

550
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,635
It is tabled or it is not tabled.

551
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:09,000
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

552
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,103
Section 17 of Robert's Rules of Order would say, to lay a matter on the table, you move to lay a question on the table.

553
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:15,924
A second is required.

554
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:17,224
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

555
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,967
Councilor March, do you want to take Councilor Del Rosso?

556
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:33,093
Since the motion to table has been removed, I have a couple of things I'd like to point out and a question through the chair to Ms.

557
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:33,573
Nunley.

558
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:36,615
First, I'd like to say that

559
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:49,924
In recent years, we have not seen such activity, research, seriousness, and sophistication from the Water and Sewer Commission, and we should be grateful for that and for their efforts.

560
00:38:50,844 --> 00:39:04,012
It would be helpful for us to have some information from them regarding what has been presented by my colleague as some sort of service fee, an additional fee.

561
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:15,013
I can only speculate at what that might be directed towards, but I won't do that out loud, Mr. President.

562
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:33,806
I would like to request kindly, because what seems to me is the question doesn't necessitate or prevent us from addressing a very pertinent issue, which my colleague has brought up, a very serious issue that we need to address as a body, and I agree.

563
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:38,725
We're dealing with what seems to me to be an accounting issue here.

564
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,007
How do we keep the books?

565
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,309
What style do we use?

566
00:39:44,850 --> 00:40:00,320
I can only imagine that when this water and sewer enterprise account was initiated some many decades ago, that it was a style of accounting that might not be in practice today to have them divided.

567
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:04,183
Yet, they will on the books appear separately.

568
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,883
The money will just be in one pot, if I understand correctly.

569
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,524
So, through the Chair, to Ms.

570
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:12,807
Nunley, if I could ask, is there precedent for this?

571
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:15,470
Is there a new guideline that has come out from the Commonwealth?

572
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:21,915
Is this a practice that is being adopted by cities and towns who have a water and sewer enterprise account?

573
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:31,384
Through the Chair, Councilor Del Rosso, yes, Winchester actually has a combined water and sewer fund, and it is permissible to combine it.

574
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:32,683
Correct.

575
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,425
Just an accounting reporting.

576
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,746
Yes, there would still be separate lines within the one fund.

577
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:37,987
Thank you very much.

578
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:58,203
Mr. President, I have no problem with this matter before us as far as seeking permission, because we are the authorizing body, obviously, to address this matter of bookkeeping, a matter of bookkeeping and account keeping.

579
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:17,736
It in no ways, in my opinion, abdicates or, uh, minimizes, uh, the matter that my colleague, uh, brought up, which we should have a clear and a significant, uh, uh, conversation with the water and sewing commission about, especially as we're entering the budget season.

580
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:19,817
So I move approval, Mr. President.

581
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,999
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, Councilor Knight.

582
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,800
Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

583
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:27,718
Ms.

584
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:38,185
Nunley, in reading the memorandum that you put together for the Water and Sewer Commission, it explains a little bit about a lot of duplication of efforts that your office performs now because you have these two separate funds.

585
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,906
Could you go into that a little bit for me and make me understand it a little bit better, please?

586
00:41:42,027 --> 00:41:42,307
Sure.

587
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:46,990
So as far as personnel is concerned, we have to split them between the two for reporting.

588
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:56,196
And if I had it in one fund, if they were working on the enterprise fund, they could be 100 percent just charged the enterprise fund instead of trying to figure out, okay, they're spending 60 percent of their time doing sewer work.

589
00:41:57,521 --> 00:42:01,263
40% of their time doing water, then trying to split out their benefits.

590
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:08,447
The different liens, when we're billing liens, we can now just put it in one fund instead of having to put liens into two separate items.

591
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,948
It makes it a lot easier, a lot cleaner.

592
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:14,690
And that's in terms of operations and in terms of administration?

593
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,110
Yes.

594
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:20,773
Thank you very much, Ms.

595
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:21,033
Dunley.

596
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:21,754
Very welcome.

597
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:23,675
Thank you.

598
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,136
Vice President Mox.

599
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:30,785
As I stated originally, I'm not opposed to this, Mr. President.

600
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:34,245
They're asking for a consolidation of accounts.

601
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,386
I'm not saying whether it's a good or bad idea.

602
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:45,748
The issue that I brought up regarding the baseline charge, where this money actually goes into these accounts, I think is only appropriate at the time that we look at both, Mr. President.

603
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:49,608
You know, it only makes sense to me to review both issues.

604
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:52,649
You know, this is an accounting issue or a bookkeeping issue.

605
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:59,968
If it's such a simple issue, why hasn't the administration been before us in the past 25 years saying, how do we simplify this?

606
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:05,351
And it's great that you're taking the initiative, if it was your, if it came from the mayor, who knows?

607
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:08,774
But I'm glad to see them streamlining, Mr. President.

608
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,576
But there's no rush to do this, Mr. President.

609
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:16,579
This is how it existed for 25 years in this community and awaiting two weeks.

610
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:25,464
to sit down with all the interested parties and find out about this paper and also about the baseline charge, I think is prudent government, Mr. President.

611
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:36,466
And I will support tabling the issue, Mr. President, and ask for a roll call vote on the table and that we meet within two weeks as a committee of the whole.

612
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:43,748
On the motion by Councilor Marks to table this for two weeks, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

613
00:43:43,928 --> 00:43:44,728
All those in favor?

614
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:45,368
Aye.

615
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,710
The Chair seems to be in doubt.

616
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,491
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

617
00:43:55,773 --> 00:43:56,753
Councilor DelaRusso?

618
00:43:56,953 --> 00:43:57,274
No.

619
00:43:58,254 --> 00:43:59,015
Councilor Falco?

620
00:43:59,075 --> 00:43:59,275
Yes.

621
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:00,676
Councilor Nye?

622
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:01,036
Yes.

623
00:44:02,036 --> 00:44:02,857
Councilor McKernan?

624
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:03,077
Yes.

625
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:04,878
Vice President Barks?

626
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:05,318
Yes.

627
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,499
Councilor Scott Kelly?

628
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:07,199
Yes.

629
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,880
President Caviello?

630
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,341
Yes.

631
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:13,323
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

632
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:14,083
Motion passes.

633
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:23,216
I will do my best to get this done in the next two weeks, Vice President Marks.

634
00:44:23,236 --> 00:44:25,857
We may have to do it on a Wednesday or Monday night.

635
00:44:25,877 --> 00:44:26,858
We just took a vote, right.

636
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:31,120
Because a lot of the Tuesdays are already full up, up until the end of the month.

637
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,321
Point of personal interjection.

638
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:54,531
Well, the matter previously before us is closed, and while this has no parliamentary root whatever, I'll just kindly point out that for 25 years, people have been complaining about the way the books have been kept.

639
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:56,532
I'm delighted we're having an update.

640
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:57,113
Thank you.

641
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:01,575
Vice President Miles.

642
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:09,080
Well, considering my fellow colleague has never spoken on the issue and has yet to recognize the taxpayers of this community,

643
00:45:09,504 --> 00:45:15,388
I feel it's only appropriate, Mr. President, as an elected official in this community, to make sure each and every rate payer is heard.

644
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,249
And that's what we did tonight, Mr. President.

645
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:18,370
Thank you very much.

646
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:22,252
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

647
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:28,516
17352, to the Honorable President and members of the Methodist City Council, City Hall, Method Mass.

648
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:39,163
Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body confirm appointments to the Community Preservation Committee as follows.

649
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:42,504
Joan Sear, two-year term.

650
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,885
Roberta Cameron, three-year term.

651
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,567
Elizabeth Carey Sewell, one-year term.

652
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,728
Joseph Pecora, one-year term.

653
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:57,870
Copies of their resumes have been provided in our package.

654
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:09,775
Additionally, please be advised that in accordance with the Massachusetts General Law relating to the Community Preservation Committee, the following boards have voted and appointed Heidi Davis,

655
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,829
From the Conservation Commission, a three-year term.

656
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:20,054
David Fields, from the Community Development Board, to a three-year term.

657
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:23,917
Doug Carr, from the Historical Commission, for a two-year term.

658
00:46:24,317 --> 00:46:26,859
Michael Cugno, Park Commission, two-year term.

659
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:31,262
Michael Lewis, Housing Authority, one-year term.

660
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:40,009
Since the vote of the Community Development Board, Mr. Fields has been offered and accepted an appointment in the Office of Community Development.

661
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:48,453
The matter of a vote for a new designee to the Community Preservation Committee will be held at the earliest date possible.

662
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:48,893
Thank you.

663
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:55,458
So Mr. Fields' name has been withdrawn from the Community Development Board.

664
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,060
Sincerely, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

665
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,161
Councilor Knight.

666
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:03,202
Mr. President, thank you very much.

667
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:10,207
In recent weeks, this council has requested that the administration provide us with a list of her appointments to the Community Preservation Commission.

668
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:15,962
which is a function of the Community Preservation Act that was passed last November by the voters in this community.

669
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:31,034
As we go through the list here and we see the individuals that have been appointed by the administration, four of these individuals are voluntary, five are statutory, Mr. President, and the council does have the power to approve the appointees that the mayor has put forward.

670
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:38,680
In reviewing the resumes that have attached and looking at the voluntary appointments that the mayor has put forward, we see Joan Cyr from 40 Cedar Road,

671
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:40,624
appointed to a two-year term.

672
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:47,306
Joan served on the CPA Ad Hoc Subcommittee that helped craft the CPA language, the CPA ordinance here in our community.

673
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,967
And she's someone who I think did a great job also.

674
00:47:50,027 --> 00:47:54,709
She was instrumental in getting the Community Preservation Act passed here in the community.

675
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:58,670
We also have, she also has a background in project management, Mr. President.

676
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,051
Then we see Roberta Cameron from North Street, also recommended for a three-year term.

677
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:08,853
Roberta was also a member of the Ad Hoc Committee that helped put together the ordinance that's been adopted by this council.

678
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:11,854
and she has a long background in community planning.

679
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:24,317
The other two appointees that are before us this evening are Elizabeth Kerry Sewell from Douglas Road, appointed to a one-year term, and she has a very long and extensive history in landscape architecture, Mr. President.

680
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:29,979
And then we have Joseph Pecora, a resident from Adams Street, appointed to a one-year term, who is a real estate professional.

681
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:38,301
If we look at the Community Preservation Act and we see that there are certain aspects of the act that it's focused on preservation of open space, the creation of affordable housing,

682
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:54,063
Um, the maintaining of our, uh, historic landmarks, Mr. President, I think that, um, the administration has done a great job in going through the applicants in presenting us with a group of, uh, or a team, I should say, of individuals that will move the city in the right direction.

683
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:58,624
Um, so with that being said, I just wanted to have a brief moment to go over the individuals that were appointed.

684
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,365
Mr. President, I'm uncomfortable this evening voting on them.

685
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:05,386
However, I'd open the floor up to deliberation to my council colleagues to see how they feel as though they'd like to proceed.

686
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:06,406
Thank you.

687
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:06,887
Councilor.

688
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:07,987
Councilor DelaRusso.

689
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:27,260
President, I first of all want to thank Councilman Knight for his hard work in bringing us to this point, and I want to second the motion for approval of the slate of these fine and highly qualified individuals who will be deciding how to spend the taxpayers' money.

690
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:30,162
Thank you, Councilor De La Rosa.

691
00:49:31,423 --> 00:49:36,567
And I also want to commend the committee for the amount of work that it took to get this

692
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:42,842
From nothing up to where it is right now, you did an outstanding job and they should be commended.

693
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:43,903
Councilor Falco.

694
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,184
Thank you, Mr. President.

695
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:55,253
I just wanted to also mention that I worked with a number of these people when we put this committee together.

696
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,155
And I know for one, Joan Sierra and Roberta Cameron,

697
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:05,492
extremely knowledgeable and instrumental in passing this and, um, you know, in building the, uh, city ordinance.

698
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,374
And, um, I, I thank the, I thank them for the commitment.

699
00:50:08,494 --> 00:50:14,099
Uh, this is going to be a really, um, I think it's going to be a tough commission to be on, but I think they're up to the challenge.

700
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:16,141
Uh, they're both, uh, smart, knowledgeable people.

701
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,623
And, uh, I think, uh, they'll do a great job.

702
00:50:18,663 --> 00:50:19,483
So thank you.

703
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:21,265
Councilor Scott Pelley.

704
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:22,806
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

705
00:50:22,866 --> 00:50:26,729
I too echo, uh, my fellow counselors, uh, remarks.

706
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:27,410
I know that,

707
00:50:28,646 --> 00:50:37,029
how much time we put into this process and especially Joan and Roberta who have been directly involved.

708
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:51,033
But I feel that the diversity and the different backgrounds and all of our appointees will lead us in making great choices for our community moving forward.

709
00:50:51,073 --> 00:50:55,854
So I applaud our representation and

710
00:50:58,189 --> 00:50:58,669
Move forward.

711
00:50:58,709 --> 00:50:59,049
Thank you.

712
00:50:59,269 --> 00:50:59,649
Thank you.

713
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:01,150
Name and address for the record, please.

714
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,370
John Sorella, 20 Metcalf Street.

715
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:14,313
Mr. President, I would respectfully urge this council to table this motion, and I'll tell you why.

716
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:21,354
What we're doing here is appointing nine people to this preservation committee.

717
00:51:22,675 --> 00:51:26,576
Now, all of the taxpayers are going to pay this surtax.

718
00:51:26,636 --> 00:51:27,916
This really is a surtax.

719
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:32,072
on the property tax, which, by the way, has a limitation.

720
00:51:33,213 --> 00:51:34,953
This, but this is not sub-subject.

721
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,574
This exceeds the limitation.

722
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,975
That's illegal, but they're doing it anyway.

723
00:51:40,696 --> 00:51:46,998
But the point I want to make is that when you look at these lists of people, and it doesn't matter if someone was instrumental or not in passing it.

724
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:47,959
That's history.

725
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,860
What matters is who's on this preservation committee.

726
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:55,102
Now, we have eight wards in this city.

727
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:58,643
Don't you think all of those taxpayers should be represented?

728
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,341
We have nine appointments here.

729
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:02,963
Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

730
00:52:03,403 --> 00:52:13,491
When the ordinance was crafted, there is language that's included in the ordinance that says that the appointees that are put forward by the mayor will do their best to represent all geographic areas of the community.

731
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:25,059
And if we look at the individuals who have been appointed and where they live, um, we will see that the appointees that are before the city council, um, are spread out and relatively decently across the community in separate wards, Mr. President.

732
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:26,400
Uh,

733
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:31,173
I beg to differ, Councilor, half of the wards are not represented.

734
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:32,973
We have 16 precincts.

735
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:35,234
Half of those precincts are not represented.

736
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:37,054
These also pay taxes.

737
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:39,794
Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

738
00:52:39,814 --> 00:52:41,955
I never made a reference to a ward or a precinct.

739
00:52:42,015 --> 00:52:45,055
I made reference to a geographic area, which is what the ordinance speaks to.

740
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:46,196
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

741
00:52:46,776 --> 00:52:54,257
Well, Mike, we vote by wards, and these people are all taxpayers, and they're in the wards.

742
00:52:54,873 --> 00:53:06,158
If you look at this list of nine people, half of them are from West Medford or from borderline areas of the city close to West Medford.

743
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:10,539
Now, that is not the way to do it in an equitable way.

744
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,301
What we should do is give everybody representation.

745
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:20,343
I think a new list should be offered, and we should have representation throughout the city.

746
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:24,285
That way, a taxpayer will feel

747
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:32,470
that the people on this committee are offering solutions that will also benefit his particular area of the city.

748
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,771
And it should be so.

749
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:36,773
All areas should be benefited equally.

750
00:53:37,354 --> 00:53:47,702
And when you have a group of nine people, and maybe six of them come from West Medford or West Medford contiguous areas, that simply is not fair.

751
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:54,127
That's the reason I am urging a table on this motion and requesting the mayor to submit another list

752
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:58,992
that applies to all the people of the city, and it's more democratic.

753
00:53:59,533 --> 00:53:59,873
Thank you.

754
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:01,094
Thank you, Mr. Cerello.

755
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:04,617
Name and address of the record, please.

756
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:09,501
Thank you, Council President Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Mefford, Massachusetts.

757
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:21,992
I'm not gonna get into the West Mefford and South Mefford or East Ford, although Dr. Cerello may have brought up some reasonable points.

758
00:54:24,857 --> 00:54:35,140
However, I would like to say the implication that Mr. Sorella made was it was in effect an override of prop two and a half.

759
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,001
In effect, we could say that, but it really wasn't.

760
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:43,382
It was under the Massachusetts law of the Community Preservation Act, I believe.

761
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:51,804
However, I'd say when it was voted in by, however it was voted in, and that's,

762
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,901
kind of an understatement of how it got approved.

763
00:54:57,722 --> 00:55:15,868
Um, I just wanted to say, if I was had input to what to use as one and a half million dollars, if that's what it is, the first thing I would do is they talk about Shibali auditorium as having being the crown jewel of the city.

764
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:39,373
However, as you pull into Meffitt Square from the Rotary, Route 93, Interstate Route 93, on Salem Street, as you're going past the old Meffitt Cinema, which is now Elizabeth Grady, and on the right-hand side there, after that church, is, I believe it's Martin Pastry, or Mike's, I think it's Martin.

765
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:46,116
However, that steeple has not been there since, we shouldn't pull it, Joe's pool room back in 68.

766
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:55,945
I would think maybe it's not a crown jewel that's missing, but at least put, as they say on a Christmas tree, a finial on top of that steeple.

767
00:55:56,545 --> 00:56:03,347
It doesn't have to be a full blown out structure, because it might come down with another windstorm or hurricane and get condemned.

768
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:11,949
It could be a reasonable facsimile that goes up 20, 30, 40 feet, made of some sort of carbon or plastic material.

769
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:16,130
At least the center of the square

770
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:22,868
We'll look a little bit more with a cap on top.

771
00:56:23,408 --> 00:56:29,332
Make a better presentation to the outsiders and also to myself as I'm driving my bicycle around City Hall.

772
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,313
I think it's a no-brainer.

773
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:38,077
People might think it's not important, but I think we'll make a big presentation.

774
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:40,298
I would thank you for listening.

775
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,480
The money gets appropriated into several different categories.

776
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,342
All the money does not get spent in one particular area.

777
00:56:46,638 --> 00:56:49,780
There's different categories where it's a... Yes, I understand.

778
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:56,245
One of the major parts of it, if I recollect, is architecture and housing, I believe.

779
00:56:57,366 --> 00:57:03,970
But talk about architecture, historical society should have been on that one 25 years ago.

780
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:04,871
Thank you for listening.

781
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:05,211
Thank you.

782
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:06,792
Council Member O'Kurin.

783
00:57:07,393 --> 00:57:09,194
Thank you, President Carviello.

784
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:15,178
I just wanted to go back and review which sections of the city that everybody was...

785
00:57:16,756 --> 00:57:21,819
lives in because I do, I agree with the language, with the way the ordinance was drafted.

786
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,961
I also agree with what Dr. Estrella had mentioned.

787
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:28,302
We want every geographic location represented.

788
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:33,005
And I know to do that would almost be close to impossible because we don't have enough nominees.

789
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:40,209
But if you do look at it, you have four appointments from the mayor, which, you know, we do have the resumes attached tonight.

790
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:41,870
They're all very good resumes.

791
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,292
Two are up in the Heights, which everybody spoke about, Joan and Roberta.

792
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:48,675
One, and then two are from the hillside.

793
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:56,417
And then with regards to the appointees that are picked by the commissions, you do have two West Medford, one South, one Wellington.

794
00:57:56,437 --> 00:58:03,718
I think there's another West that was pulled because he's been hired by the OCD to work in City Hall.

795
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:08,599
And then there are, I think, another commission or two that are voting on their member this week.

796
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:14,481
So it's pretty well, I always like to look at that myself, and it is pretty well represented.

797
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:16,701
So we have North.

798
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:20,557
Wellington, West, South, and the Hillside.

799
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:28,944
I think we've covered, you know, everything with the eight nominees that we're voting on tonight, and I just wanted to point that out for the public.

800
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:30,406
Thank you, Council Member.

801
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:31,727
Vice President Mox.

802
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,788
Thank you, Mr. President.

803
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:35,890
And I agree with all my colleagues.

804
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:41,115
I think we have a great list of candidates that were presented by the mayor.

805
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:44,698
The one difference I do have, Mr. President, is

806
00:58:45,711 --> 00:59:05,298
And I'm not sure about the new counselors, but it's been past practice of this council that for any appointments, whether it's a confirmation of the mayor's appointment or our own appointment, which we don't have many of, we've always requested that the person appear before the council so we can thoroughly vet them out.

807
00:59:06,465 --> 00:59:15,412
And even before that, Mr. President, dating back some eight to 10 years ago, we used to have committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings to interview.

808
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:24,959
I remember sitting across the table asking people questions on why they want the appointment, what do they plan on doing, what do you see the position as.

809
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,141
So you can get a feel of the person, Mr. President.

810
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:29,863
It's great we got the resumes.

811
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,945
And I know many of these people, so this is not a dig on

812
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,078
who applied and so forth.

813
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:37,879
I think we have to be consistent, Mr. President.

814
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:42,220
We all talk about transparency, and I think we have to be consistent.

815
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:53,603
If I'm going to request that someone on the Liquor Board or someone on the Community Development Board appear before us for a confirmation, then you better believe any other confirmations should appear before us, Mr. President.

816
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,693
This council has been great over the last several years.

817
00:59:57,013 --> 01:00:01,674
In particular, we have voted to tighten up our rules and regulations.

818
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:12,697
We no longer waive third readings, which does away with the public right to come up when we enact an ordinance.

819
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:17,138
And the third reading would allow them to come up and stand before the council.

820
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:19,038
And we used to waive that.

821
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:20,839
We no longer waive that, Mr. President.

822
01:00:21,932 --> 01:00:32,398
When we voted for council president and vice president, there's a conflict, an inherent conflict, because the council president and vice president used to vote on their own pay raise.

823
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:40,583
And that's not me saying it, that's the ethics commission saying there's a conflict of interest on voting on anything that you have a monetary gain to.

824
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:46,227
And we no longer do that, Mr. President, if you look at the way we handle our process.

825
01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:49,916
All I would ask, Mr. President, no one wants to stall.

826
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:51,417
No one wants to remove these people.

827
01:00:51,977 --> 01:01:08,184
Give them the same opportunity to appear before us and let the council ask questions and thoroughly vet them out, Mr. President, not only for this council, but for the purview of the people watching at home, Mr. President, and the purview of transparency, Mr. President.

828
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:09,765
So that's what I would offer tonight.

829
01:01:10,085 --> 01:01:11,466
Let's invite them up before us.

830
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,547
This has been a long process.

831
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:16,328
Councilor Knight and other councilors have done yeoman's work.

832
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:19,014
and pushing this forward to get to this point.

833
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:25,138
And I don't think vetting these candidates out, which will have the purse strings of every taxpayer.

834
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:26,458
There is a check and balance.

835
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:27,599
We end up voting on it.

836
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:30,401
But they make the recommendation to the council.

837
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,483
And they do have the purse strings.

838
01:01:35,388 --> 01:01:38,190
And I think, at the very least, we have to do our due diligence.

839
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,752
The mayor may have done hers, and we have to do ours, Mr. President.

840
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:50,978
So, I would respectfully ask that this be laid on the table, Mr. President, until all the nominees appear before the council for proper vetting.

841
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:53,099
Would you like that done by next week, if possible?

842
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:55,000
As soon as we can get it scheduled, Mr. President.

843
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,321
Okay.

844
01:01:56,041 --> 01:02:02,145
On the motion by Vice President Marx that we lay this on the table until we can get everybody here.

845
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:09,232
to confirm them personally, seconded by?

846
01:02:09,832 --> 01:02:10,433
Seconded by?

847
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:19,901
Seconded by Councillor McLachlan.

848
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:20,942
All those in favour?

849
01:02:20,962 --> 01:02:21,603
Aye.

850
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:23,224
Motion passes.

851
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,433
Del Russo and Councillor Knight are in opposition.

852
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:33,716
There will be five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

853
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:40,423
Motion by Councillor Scarpelli to revert back to regular business.

854
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:41,685
All those in favour?

855
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:44,948
Motion passes.

856
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,012
Motions, orders and resolutions.

857
01:02:49,926 --> 01:03:00,651
17344, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the city's information technology strategic plan be discussed.

858
01:03:01,832 --> 01:03:04,313
Councilor Mox, Vice President Mox.

859
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,694
Thank you, President Caviello.

860
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:18,659
It was back in July 2016, the mayor came out with the City of Method information technology strategic plan, and that plan was supposed to take place

861
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,321
from 2016 to 2018.

862
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:32,246
And they were going to upgrade many of the computer systems at City Hall, which I think Microsoft Office was back in 2001 that they were using here at City Hall.

863
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,407
Needless to say, the systems were very outdated.

864
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:40,449
They looked into a new phone system, which I believe they have currently on board.

865
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:42,350
And coupled with that, Mr. President,

866
01:03:42,643 --> 01:03:53,207
This new initiative was also to train employees that were used to working on outdated and archaic systems on the latest and greatest of technology.

867
01:03:53,887 --> 01:04:00,830
And as part of the proposal, Mr. President, and that's why I offer this tonight, is there was a section for open government.

868
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:10,374
And it stated, the city is in the process of studying the use of social networking for providing all city residents equal and timely access to information.

869
01:04:11,343 --> 01:04:12,924
I have yet to see that, Mr. President.

870
01:04:13,064 --> 01:04:14,586
Maybe there is something in the works.

871
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:19,509
But I can tell you right now, there's no social networking going on here at City Hall.

872
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,793
And there's no community outreach, as far as I can see, from City Hall.

873
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:29,517
Other than, Mr. President, maybe an inundation of reverse 9-1-1.

874
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:35,281
And maybe, Mr. President, that we're still using wooden A-frame boards.

875
01:04:35,822 --> 01:04:41,026
There's one on Main Street in front of Dunkin' Donuts, alerting people that they're doing street sweeping.

876
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:49,914
I mean, the A-frame boards we used back in the Depression, Mr. President, when people that were jobless were walking around with A-frame signs.

877
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:56,797
And we're still using them in the city of Meffitt now to let residents know what is going on in the community.

878
01:04:57,497 --> 01:05:03,800
So one thing, Mr. President, I want to find out what the social networking that opens it up to every city resident.

879
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,521
You know, I got a call last week.

880
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:07,642
There's going to be street sweeping.

881
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:08,542
I said, this is great.

882
01:05:08,562 --> 01:05:10,683
They're alerting me when there's street sweeping.

883
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,149
Go onto the city website, you'll find out.

884
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,591
Why call, Mr. President?

885
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:22,334
Why call residents to let them know there's street sweeping if you're not gonna tell me when the street sweeping is?

886
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:30,939
And the system has the ability and the capability of alerting residents by ward, precinct, street, address.

887
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,862
It has all sorts of capability and the city's not using it.

888
01:05:35,162 --> 01:05:40,685
I finally got a call tonight saying there's street sweeping in my neighborhood this, I think it's Wednesday or Thursday.

889
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:41,832
to move the cars.

890
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:43,973
So that's my first question, Mr. President.

891
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:52,317
Where do we stand with the study that was proposed under the mayor's information technology strategic plan on social networking?

892
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:54,457
And the second one was customer service.

893
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:59,660
And it states information technology is studying the use of payments via the internet.

894
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,921
Wow, that's unbelievable.

895
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:03,141
Imagine that.

896
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:05,562
We just got a call waiting on the phones.

897
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,083
So now you can call and leave a message.

898
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:09,764
That must have been a new,

899
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:15,424
creation, and now we're going to have the ability to make payments over the internet.

900
01:06:15,444 --> 01:06:19,585
Imagine if Amazon couldn't make payments over the internet.

901
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:22,026
What would they do, carry a pigeon?

902
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:24,087
Is that how they deliver the money?

903
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:27,769
So, Mr. President, it's great to put this stuff out.

904
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:29,389
It sounds great.

905
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:32,190
You know, when you read it, open government, customer service.

906
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:36,232
We still have a C-Click Fix program that's not working.

907
01:06:37,245 --> 01:06:43,027
Anytime we ask for the administration to give us the statistics and reports on it, we get no results from it.

908
01:06:44,048 --> 01:06:48,189
And as far as I'm concerned, it's a complete and utter failure, that C-Click fix.

909
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:53,751
And, you know, the mayor's talking about automatic transfers of payments and so forth.

910
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:55,752
Has that happened yet, Mr. President?

911
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,613
It's been a year and four months.

912
01:07:00,073 --> 01:07:02,914
It's been 16 months now, has that happened yet?

913
01:07:03,214 --> 01:07:14,859
So those are my questions, Mr. President, regarding social networking and where we stand with payment via the internet on this particular item that was offered by the mayor back in 2016.

914
01:07:14,899 --> 01:07:18,820
Thank you.

915
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:25,303
I can't say that I do see Facebook things coming from different departments here in the city.

916
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:27,843
So I know they do do some networking.

917
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:29,104
Councilor Falco.

918
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:30,504
Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:38,208
Uh, I just wanted to, uh, while we're on the topic of, uh, information technology, uh, budget season will be upon us soon.

920
01:07:38,408 --> 01:07:51,475
So, uh, I'd like to, if we can, if I can amend the resolution, uh, just to see if we can get a report from the, uh, technology department here at city hall to find out, uh, basically what new software has been purchased this year and what is being planned for next year.

921
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,338
And if we can get an update as to, uh,

922
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:02,506
As far as the current software that we're using, what version of software are we using?

923
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:04,927
I mean, we're in the 21st century here.

924
01:08:05,027 --> 01:08:07,647
Our software should be fairly up to date.

925
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,848
And I know last year during the budget hearings, we were lacking.

926
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,429
And I want to see what type of progress we made.

927
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:18,590
And it's important to find out before we actually go into a budget hearing.

928
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,590
So thank you.

929
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,270
Thank you.

930
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:26,652
And if I could amend that to ask, if I can recall, I thought we had hired a

931
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,134
a second person in the IT departments.

932
01:08:30,595 --> 01:08:37,819
I haven't seen that second person in the office yet.

933
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:40,901
I haven't seen anyone in there, so I don't know if that person's ever been hired.

934
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:47,006
I don't have any correspondence, so I can't say.

935
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:52,849
On the motion by Councilor Mox, second and by.

936
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:56,492
On the motion by Councilor Mox, second and by.

937
01:08:57,824 --> 01:08:59,085
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

938
01:08:59,825 --> 01:09:01,086
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

939
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:07,050
Councilor Dela Rousseau?

940
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:07,450
Yes.

941
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:08,851
Councilor Falco?

942
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:09,151
Yes.

943
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:10,111
Councilor Night?

944
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:10,392
No.

945
01:09:11,592 --> 01:09:12,333
Councilor Kern?

946
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:12,633
Yes.

947
01:09:13,293 --> 01:09:13,994
Vice President Monk?

948
01:09:14,314 --> 01:09:14,574
Yes.

949
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:15,855
Councilor Scott Bell?

950
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:16,295
Yes.

951
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:18,256
President Cabrillo?

952
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,177
Yes.

953
01:09:20,898 --> 01:09:22,699
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

954
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:23,800
Motion passes.

955
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,964
17, three, four, five, offered by Councilor Falco.

956
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:40,012
Whereas the increased amount of traffic and speeding poses a major public safety concern, be it resolved that the Chief of Police increase patrols on Harvard Avenue to monitor the speed of vehicles.

957
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:41,893
Councilor Falco.

958
01:09:42,113 --> 01:09:43,274
Thank you, Mr. President.

959
01:09:43,314 --> 01:09:48,938
This issue came up last week during the community police meeting at the West Memphis Community Center.

960
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:53,581
During that time, there was a lot of discussion regarding the traffic on,

961
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:54,755
Harvard Ave.

962
01:09:55,015 --> 01:10:03,959
And it seems like this has become a definite quality of life issue where it's getting to the point where it's really tough to even cross the street.

963
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,020
The traffic is heavier.

964
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:06,820
It's quicker.

965
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,441
It's faster.

966
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:14,624
So this is just basically if we could contact the chief of police, have him increase patrols in that area.

967
01:10:14,664 --> 01:10:21,667
And if we could also have the portable radar unit put down there as well to monitor traffic and speed.

968
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:25,577
to protect the residents in that neighborhood.

969
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:26,297
Thank you.

970
01:10:26,377 --> 01:10:26,697
Thank you.

971
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:27,678
Thank you.

972
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:28,618
Councilor Knight.

973
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:32,441
I'd like to amend the resolution, Mr. President, and request that Arlington Street be included.

974
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:37,724
Mr. Clerk, if you could amend the resolution to add Arlington Street to that also.

975
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:43,607
Vice President Mox.

976
01:10:44,228 --> 01:10:45,088
Thank you, Mr. President.

977
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:52,653
I want to thank Councilor Felkel first for providing a forum for people throughout the neighborhood to discuss issues of concern.

978
01:10:53,402 --> 01:10:54,623
I think it's been very successful.

979
01:10:55,104 --> 01:11:08,314
Mr. President, I'm going to once again ask, I think this is my fifth time that this council has voted on, we were promised as residents of this community that we would have a pilot program with three raised crosswalks.

980
01:11:09,035 --> 01:11:12,677
Remember the issue about pedestrian safety that's been around for years?

981
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:15,598
Remember the issues of speeding cars?

982
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:25,203
We resolved this issue, or thought we were resolving part of the issue, by implementing a pilot program back some, I think it was three or four years ago, under the McGlynn administration.

983
01:11:26,584 --> 01:11:31,466
We carried out one of the three on Winthrop Street, which, by the way, needs to be painted.

984
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:32,187
You can't even see it.

985
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:35,168
You go over it, it's like hitting just a giant hurdle.

986
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:38,570
But, Mr. President,

987
01:11:39,332 --> 01:11:51,823
We were promised the Winthrop Street, which happened, Harvard Street, which is a very dangerous road and highly trafficked, and Central Ave, another long stretch that residents complain about quite frequently.

988
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:53,664
I receive complaints, Mr. President.

989
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:59,049
And I've sent this administration several requests, where do we stand, Mr. President?

990
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:03,953
And if you can find a paper that responds to that request, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

991
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:10,397
Okay, if you could find that paper, Mr. President, that talks with public safety.

992
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:14,022
You know, the mayor's preaching complete streets, we're doing this and that.

993
01:12:14,323 --> 01:12:17,707
What about the basics, Madam Mayor, that we've already spoke about?

994
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:20,611
Go to Ring Road back here, Mr. President.

995
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:27,541
Remember we installed back some eight years ago the crosswalk that blinks for $50,000?

996
01:12:28,562 --> 01:12:32,103
We could have thermoplastic the whole city for $50,000, as you mentioned.

997
01:12:32,743 --> 01:12:34,044
Now go buy it, Mr. President.

998
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:36,865
All the blinkers in the street were torn up.

999
01:12:37,105 --> 01:12:37,505
Go buy it.

1000
01:12:37,805 --> 01:12:40,306
There's all holes with no more blinkers in the street.

1001
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:45,488
We just spent $50,000 for that crosswalk, and it's gone, Mr. President.

1002
01:12:46,353 --> 01:12:48,996
You know, and you have the mayor touting about complete streets.

1003
01:12:49,456 --> 01:13:01,188
You know, it just doesn't make any sense, Mr. President, that when you talk public safety issues and you expect results, or at least expect follow-up, you get no response from this administration.

1004
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:03,610
No response at all, Mr. President.

1005
01:13:03,929 --> 01:13:05,951
And I want to say it's four or five direct votes.

1006
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:14,199
I know I offered them personally that were voted on by this council and we have yet to get a request on where we stand with the raised crosswalks.

1007
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:22,287
The residents in those areas that were told, I just had a gentleman the other day at stop at shop say to me, when are we getting our raised crosswalk on central Ave?

1008
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,009
And I said, your guess is as good as mine.

1009
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,733
I've asked a dozen times and I'm honestly, I'm getting tired of asking.

1010
01:13:28,982 --> 01:13:31,263
the same question over and over again, Mr. President.

1011
01:13:31,483 --> 01:13:34,505
So, once again, I would ask my colleague if I can amend his paper.

1012
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:41,168
Once again, we'll send the paper to the mayor and ask, where are the other two raised crosswalks that were promised to this community?

1013
01:13:41,828 --> 01:13:45,510
When are we going to see them implemented in the interest of public safety?

1014
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:47,871
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1015
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:49,072
Councilor Falco.

1016
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:54,274
If I may, Mr. President, another issue did come up during the meeting.

1017
01:13:54,314 --> 01:13:55,194
A number of issues came up.

1018
01:13:55,234 --> 01:13:56,435
It was actually a very productive meeting.

1019
01:13:56,997 --> 01:14:01,862
A great conversation about a number of issues, but speed did come up.

1020
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:09,590
And the point that Councilor Marks had made earlier in the year about lowering the speed limit to 25, that we all voted for.

1021
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,354
And it was a great resolution and something that we all supported.

1022
01:14:15,255 --> 01:14:19,099
The question was, when are those 25 mile per hour signs coming in?

1023
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:22,940
And from what I'm hearing, they haven't been procured yet.

1024
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,722
So if we could get an update as to when they're going to be procured and installed, that'd be great.

1025
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:29,962
Spring is here.

1026
01:14:30,543 --> 01:14:35,784
And as we know, people, you know, tend to get out and drive and there's a lot more people walking around.

1027
01:14:35,864 --> 01:14:41,186
So I think it's in everybody's best interest that we get those signs installed as soon as possible.

1028
01:14:41,286 --> 01:14:44,027
So if we could get an update on that, greatly appreciated.

1029
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:44,367
Thank you.

1030
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,488
Thank you, Councillor Bailão.

1031
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:46,068
Councillor Knight.

1032
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,787
I'd also like to further amend the paper.

1033
01:14:49,227 --> 01:15:00,676
Mr. President, I request that Tufts University be contacted and that we request they take the appropriate steps to properly improve the visibility of the raised crosswalk that they have on Boston Ave.

1034
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,137
It's like Mount Everest.

1035
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:05,340
You come up the hill on it and you can't even see that it's there, Mr. President.

1036
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:12,545
I've witnessed cars going at a normal and acceptable rate of speed, still bottom out on it because of the size of it, Mr. President.

1037
01:15:12,665 --> 01:15:15,708
So I think that we might need to do a little bit better work over there.

1038
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,883
denoting the fact that there is a raised crosswalk on the street on Boston Avenue right before the old post office.

1039
01:15:22,463 --> 01:15:22,904
Thank you.

1040
01:15:23,624 --> 01:15:30,569
On the motion by Councilor Falco as amended by President Mox and Councilor Knight.

1041
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:31,550
Do I have a second?

1042
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:34,712
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1043
01:15:34,752 --> 01:15:35,452
All those in favor?

1044
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:40,056
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1045
01:15:40,456 --> 01:15:41,497
Motion passes.

1046
01:15:46,193 --> 01:16:05,479
17346, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Medford Middle School String Ensemble under the direction of Sophia Chang for winning the silver medal at the Massachusetts Instrumental Chorus Conductors Association Band and Orchestra Festival.

1047
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:11,201
Be it further resolved that they be invited to a future meeting to accept commendations.

1048
01:16:11,623 --> 01:16:12,384
Councilor Felco.

1049
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:13,244
Thank you, Mr. President.

1050
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:16,947
I just wanted to say congratulations to the middle school orchestra.

1051
01:16:17,947 --> 01:16:22,871
They're an amazing bunch of kids, and they won a silver medal this year.

1052
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:28,474
The music is just amazing when you hear it.

1053
01:16:28,595 --> 01:16:29,735
It'd be great if they could come down.

1054
01:16:29,755 --> 01:16:33,038
I know when I was on the school committee, they came down to a number of meetings and played before us.

1055
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:35,079
Ms.

1056
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:37,501
Chang does a fabulous job with the children.

1057
01:16:38,922 --> 01:16:40,883
When you listen to them, it's hard to believe that it's actually

1058
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:45,444
young kids playing, and they sound fabulous.

1059
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:53,987
And since they've actually had this competition and did a little research here, there's over 160 ensembles that are part of this.

1060
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:59,710
And over the eight years that Medford has been involved, they've won six gold and two silver.

1061
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:03,491
So I think that's pretty impressive, and I just wanted to say congratulations.

1062
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,372
Thank you.

1063
01:17:04,512 --> 01:17:05,252
We'll have them up here.

1064
01:17:05,272 --> 01:17:07,313
Whenever you invite them up here, we'll get that done.

1065
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,497
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1066
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:11,157
All those in favor?

1067
01:17:11,317 --> 01:17:11,417
Aye.

1068
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,199
Motion passes 7-0.

1069
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:23,622
17-347, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Metro High School Drama Club be congratulated on their outstanding performances of Pippin last weekend.

1070
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:29,825
Be it further resolved that Director Sarah Grant be recognized for working with the students to prepare them for this production.

1071
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:30,205
Councilor Falco.

1072
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:32,507
Thank you, Mr. President.

1073
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:39,632
I just wanted to say my son, Joey, and I had the opportunity to go to the opening night performance this past week.

1074
01:17:40,473 --> 01:17:43,876
The students did a fabulous job with Pippin.

1075
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:49,080
And Sarah Grant, as always, first class production.

1076
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,362
And I just wanted to say congratulations to everyone involved.

1077
01:17:51,482 --> 01:17:51,882
It was a great show.

1078
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:52,403
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1079
01:17:52,423 --> 01:17:53,063
They did a great job.

1080
01:17:53,564 --> 01:17:53,884
Thank you.

1081
01:17:54,144 --> 01:17:58,067
On the motion by Councilor Falco and seconded by Councilor Lococo and all those in favor?

1082
01:17:58,087 --> 01:17:58,668
Aye.

1083
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:01,516
7-0, motion passes.

1084
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:11,401
Motion by Councilor Knight to take hands by the clerk.

1085
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:20,225
Seconded by Councilor Scott-Bell.

1086
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:25,467
17-353, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the engineering department report to the council the status and

1087
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:36,082
and necessary for service interruption of electricity on Harvard Avenue and what notification systems are in place to inform the affected residents of status thereof.

1088
01:18:37,403 --> 01:18:37,983
Councillor Knight.

1089
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:39,724
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1090
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:48,689
I filed this resolution in response to some frustration that the neighbors had in the area relative to advertised power outages that never happened, Mr. President.

1091
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:54,874
Last week, residents were notified that the power would be out in the evening hours between 8 and 10 p.m.

1092
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:55,975
The power never went out.

1093
01:18:56,575 --> 01:19:00,278
Two days later, residents are notified the power is going to go out between certain hours.

1094
01:19:00,378 --> 01:19:01,299
The power never goes out.

1095
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:05,201
Three days later, residents are notified the power is going to go out during certain hours.

1096
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,263
The power never goes out, Mr. President.

1097
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:17,070
So I'm wondering what the situation is on Harvard Avenue and what notification systems are in place to inform the residents, number one, if their power is going to be shut off, but number two, if they're not going to do the scheduled and performed work.

1098
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:27,242
so that individuals that may have made dinner plans to go out that night, as opposed to staying home and opening their refrigerator back and forth, let the freezing cold air out, would be in a little bit of a situation, Mr. President.

1099
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:32,828
So I raise the issue based out of real frustration on behalf of the neighborhood residents especially.

1100
01:19:33,472 --> 01:19:37,416
those residing in the condominium on Harvard Avenue that were notified multiple times.

1101
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,217
Should we contact National Grid?

1102
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:49,986
Dan Cameron is the individual and I have placed a phone call into him, Mr. President, but I'd like to ask that we send this to the engineering department for an update and I'll make my phone calls to Mr. Cameron and hopefully I can get an answer personally.

1103
01:19:50,006 --> 01:19:50,227
Thank you.

1104
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,709
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1105
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,391
All those in favor?

1106
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:55,871
Aye.

1107
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:58,614
Motion passes.

1108
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:22,987
17-354 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the code enforcement officer meet the entity located at 186 Winthrop Street, doing business as stone and skillet on the ongoing violations of city ordinances related to the hours of operation, parking, and neighborhood concerns related to the Columbus.

1109
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:23,588
Councilor Knight.

1110
01:20:24,043 --> 01:20:27,904
Yes, Mr. President, this has been an ongoing issue in the community for quite some time now.

1111
01:20:28,784 --> 01:20:35,246
I feel like every 90 days I'm making a phone call to Code Enforcement or the Board of Health to go down and take a look at Stone and Skillet and what's going on.

1112
01:20:36,326 --> 01:20:43,028
Now, don't get me wrong, Stone and Skillet's a great business, and they're doing a great business, and they've absolutely outgrown the location that they're currently located at.

1113
01:20:44,068 --> 01:20:52,950
If you aren't familiar, Stone and Skillet right now is located at the old Marty's for Parties, the old Pranzi's location, right on Winthrop Street on the corner of Winthrop and West Street, Mr. President.

1114
01:20:54,436 --> 01:21:01,141
In past months, we've seen 18 wheelers double parking on Winthrop Street to load up the truck with product from Stone and Skillet.

1115
01:21:01,822 --> 01:21:06,166
We've seen grease trap problems and border health issues that have been rectified in the past.

1116
01:21:06,206 --> 01:21:09,468
We've seen rodent problems because of the border health issues in the past, Mr. President.

1117
01:21:10,549 --> 01:21:14,253
And quite frankly, the neighborhood's a little bit frustrated with it, and they've had enough.

1118
01:21:15,464 --> 01:21:18,025
I had the opportunity last Thursday evening at 1 a.m.

1119
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:24,406
with a screaming child in the backseat of my car to drive by Stone and Skillett and see that all the lights were on and the place looked like a nightclub.

1120
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:29,347
And that's something that's not suitable or appropriate for a residential neighborhood, Mr. President.

1121
01:21:29,387 --> 01:21:40,230
So I'm asking that the Code Enforcement Office go down and meet with the individuals that operate Stone and Skillett and reiterate the city ordinances that are in place and if need be, levy citation.

1122
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:46,655
It's also brought to my attention, Mr. President, that at that location, there were late hours when Prenzies was there.

1123
01:21:47,455 --> 01:22:01,466
And any special permit or any approval that the city council issued relative to late hours should really go with that business, Prenzies, and not a muffin wholesale that's operating through all hours of the night that's really far outgrown its location, Mr. President.

1124
01:22:02,053 --> 01:22:04,974
We're seeing legitimate 18-wheelers parked on the corner of West Street.

1125
01:22:05,274 --> 01:22:13,777
Legitimate 18-wheelers parked right in front of Molten Seafood in the address 186 Winthrop Street during rush hour, normal business hours, blocking the street.

1126
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,418
It's gotten to the point of frustration that something needs to happen.

1127
01:22:17,618 --> 01:22:19,258
Something needs to happen sooner rather than later.

1128
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:20,659
I'd like to thank Ms.

1129
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,621
O'Connor at the Board of Health and Mr. Bavuso and code enforcement because they've been working with me for the past year on this issue.

1130
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:30,202
And I've spoken with them both relative to the filing of this resolution.

1131
01:22:30,776 --> 01:22:32,597
It's time that something happens down there, Mr. President.

1132
01:22:32,617 --> 01:22:34,378
So I'm asking that my colleagues support this initiative.

1133
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:36,598
Thank you, Councilor Haynes.

1134
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:37,499
Councilor Del Rosso.

1135
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:56,367
Just by way of point of information, Mr. President, if I remember correctly, the extended operation hours to the previous occupant of that property were indeed restricted to that occupant and not to the location.

1136
01:22:56,947 --> 01:22:58,407
I think this council has

1137
01:23:00,815 --> 01:23:07,080
consistently adopted the policy of doing such with any of those applications.

1138
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,962
On the motion by Councillor Nye, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso.

1139
01:23:11,082 --> 01:23:11,743
All those in favour?

1140
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:12,023
Aye.

1141
01:23:12,644 --> 01:23:13,364
Motion passes 7-0.

1142
01:23:13,384 --> 01:23:16,266
We have one more Councillor Nye.

1143
01:23:16,346 --> 01:23:17,967
Actually we have one more.

1144
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:38,075
Offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the DPW clean the rear parking lot of City Hall, as there's garbage bags and litter that is piled by the melting stove bank.

1145
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:38,995
Move approval.

1146
01:23:39,395 --> 01:23:41,656
I don't know if anyone's looked out the back window here.

1147
01:23:42,196 --> 01:23:42,777
It's, I was.

1148
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:44,977
Across the street, across the street too.

1149
01:23:45,257 --> 01:23:45,798
Yeah, I was.

1150
01:23:45,918 --> 01:23:47,238
Third world.

1151
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,859
Yes, it looks very bad.

1152
01:23:49,739 --> 01:23:54,541
If the DPW can take care of that immediately, it would be greatly appreciated.

1153
01:23:54,845 --> 01:23:55,725
President, just while we're in suspension.

1154
01:23:56,326 --> 01:24:01,208
While we're under suspension, Councilor Mox, Vice President Mox.

1155
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:02,929
I move to approval, Mr. Councilor.

1156
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:05,270
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1157
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:06,371
All those in favor?

1158
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:07,771
Motion passes.

1159
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:09,692
Vice President Mox.

1160
01:24:09,732 --> 01:24:12,073
Just if I could, Mr. President, a public announcement.

1161
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:14,054
A very worthy cause.

1162
01:24:14,394 --> 01:24:20,637
On April 13th, at the Malden Irish American, they're having their first annual music bingo fundraiser.

1163
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:23,859
The Volk alumni put this together.

1164
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:27,428
in the hopes and anticipation to raise some funding.

1165
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:30,110
As we heard from Ms.

1166
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:39,276
Riccio, Director Riccio, that was before us, I believe it was last week, regarding all the great initiatives that are taking place at the vocational school.

1167
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:52,185
This is the alumni, I think it's the first of its kind as far as I know, reaching out to the community on behalf of the vocational students and the school itself to improve the vocational education

1168
01:24:52,575 --> 01:24:53,256
in our community.

1169
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:59,202
So I would urge anyone in the community that has a few extra dollars in their pocket, 7 p.m.

1170
01:24:59,282 --> 01:25:00,143
to 11 p.m.

1171
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:04,668
April 13th at Irish American Music Bingo, Mr. President.

1172
01:25:05,148 --> 01:25:06,690
And I heard you're one of the singers there.

1173
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:07,450
Is that true?

1174
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:08,051
I am.

1175
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:09,232
I will be there.

1176
01:25:09,473 --> 01:25:09,813
Okay.

1177
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:12,716
So I just want to urge everyone to get out there, Mr. President.

1178
01:25:13,296 --> 01:25:13,577
Thank you.

1179
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,761
Councilor Scarpelli.

1180
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:18,644
If I can, thank you for, Vice President Marks for bringing that up.

1181
01:25:18,704 --> 01:25:19,885
I think it's a great event.

1182
01:25:21,106 --> 01:25:35,637
I think, I believe, so people understand it's not for the school, but it's actually for the tools that, I believe that part of it is going for our students as they graduate to assist them in purchasing the tools they need in their trade.

1183
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:36,438
I think that's what Ms.

1184
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:36,938
Riccio said.

1185
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:37,899
I thought that was very important.

1186
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,484
And the other thing is that evening, right around the block is, at John Brewer's is,

1187
01:25:44,094 --> 01:25:50,238
the HEMO fundraiser for the Buzz Off, where I've been banned.

1188
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:51,519
They won't allow me in there.

1189
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:55,542
But I suggest everybody there.

1190
01:25:55,582 --> 01:25:57,923
There'll be two events.

1191
01:25:57,963 --> 01:26:07,490
That would be great to stop over and play a little musical bingo, and then see some great people over at John Brewer's for a great cause for the Buzz Off.

1192
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,851
So thank you.

1193
01:26:09,371 --> 01:26:10,512
I'd go to the Buzz Off second.

1194
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,930
That's what I say, because you want to look good.

1195
01:26:13,451 --> 01:26:13,651
Right.

1196
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:17,594
So Councilor Falcone and Scott Pelley, they don't get any, you don't get anything buzzed off?

1197
01:26:18,235 --> 01:26:19,436
We're going to bring, we're going to bring.

1198
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:23,139
Councilor Knight.

1199
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,761
Move approval, Mr. President.

1200
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:29,745
Motion by Vice President Marks.

1201
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:30,465
All those in favor?

1202
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:34,529
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

1203
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,892
Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1204
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:39,273
All those in favor?

1205
01:26:41,588 --> 01:26:57,545
17348, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of the late State Senator Charles E. Shannon as April 5th, 2017 marks the 12th anniversary of his passing.

1206
01:26:57,945 --> 01:26:58,606
Councilor Knight.

1207
01:26:59,694 --> 01:27:01,035
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1208
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:02,755
It's amazing how time flies.

1209
01:27:02,775 --> 01:27:11,359
I remember walking into Senator Shannon's office when I was 19 years old and getting my first big boy job, as I like to call it, and I sat down at a desk next to your son, Richard.

1210
01:27:12,076 --> 01:27:18,102
And I logged on to a computer that Councilman Moxley used to sit at, and I began my career in public service, Mr. President.

1211
01:27:18,242 --> 01:27:30,192
And through the relationship I have with Senator Shannon and the many moments of teaching that he allowed me to participate in through his guidance and his wisdom, I really

1212
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,683
miss him and bring this matter forward annually in his remembrance.

1213
01:27:35,943 --> 01:27:38,145
Senator Shannon did a great deal of work for the city of Medford.

1214
01:27:38,165 --> 01:27:41,967
He was a gentleman who, as they like to say, brought home the bacon to the district.

1215
01:27:42,588 --> 01:27:46,811
And that type of representation is something that we need here in the city.

1216
01:27:47,371 --> 01:27:50,553
And I was pleased to be a part of it in the senator's office.

1217
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:57,518
He worked on a number of important issues that we're seeing come to fruition now, like the extension of the Green Line, marriage equality, just to name a few, Mr. President.

1218
01:27:58,263 --> 01:28:02,225
So it's with a heavy heart that I bring this resolution forward this evening.

1219
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:07,668
However, it's important to me to remember somebody that's meant so much to me and so much to this community.

1220
01:28:08,269 --> 01:28:11,651
So with that being said, I'd ask that my colleagues join me in endorsing the resolution.

1221
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:18,134
And if I could reiterate that, you know, Councilor, Senator Sheehan and I first got involved with him when I was involved with youth hockey.

1222
01:28:18,915 --> 01:28:25,158
And he's the one back in the early nineties when the state was going to tear down that La Conte rink.

1223
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:29,411
Senator Shannon stepped in and got the funding to keep that building open.

1224
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:33,213
And since then, he became both a friend and a mentor to me and my family.

1225
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:34,853
So again, I commend him for that.

1226
01:28:34,873 --> 01:28:36,474
If we could all stand for a moment of silence.

1227
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,939
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1228
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:55,421
17349, petition by John Starello, 20 Metcalf Street, Medford.

1229
01:28:55,872 --> 01:29:01,993
to address the council with a template for the upcoming 2018 budget.

1230
01:29:04,233 --> 01:29:05,494
Name and address for the record, please.

1231
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:06,234
Mr. Starello.

1232
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:22,237
John Starello, residing at 20 Metcalf Street here in Bedford.

1233
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,237
Thank you for your patience, Mr. President.

1234
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:28,663
I do appreciate it.

1235
01:29:28,844 --> 01:29:29,544
I did want to

1236
01:29:55,313 --> 01:30:21,285
So, thank you, Mr. President, and thank you

1237
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:26,112
all six councilors.

1238
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:33,435
Uh, I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you and I want to thank you all.

1239
01:30:33,455 --> 01:30:41,159
I want to say the title of my discourse tonight is a template for the upcoming 2018 budget.

1240
01:30:42,559 --> 01:30:53,485
In January, 2016, the Medford city council under the leadership of counselor John Falco voted unanimously for a template for the 2017 budget.

1241
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:56,212
I had to look it up.

1242
01:30:56,672 --> 01:31:01,234
According to the dictionary, template means a guide or a model.

1243
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:12,737
The template was never provided by the administration, so I am offering my anticipation of the fiscal year 2018 budget now.

1244
01:31:14,477 --> 01:31:18,358
The city of Boston has already put forth its budget.

1245
01:31:20,459 --> 01:31:24,320
Now, this is not so difficult to do because there are legal

1246
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:26,651
parameters for proposed budgets.

1247
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:32,354
Is it too early now to discuss a budget to be passed at the end of June?

1248
01:31:33,434 --> 01:31:34,175
I don't think so.

1249
01:31:35,475 --> 01:31:47,481
It is never too early to discuss the budget because the budget is a lifeblood of the people of Medford in a material sense, of course, not in a spiritual sense.

1250
01:31:50,563 --> 01:31:52,484
There are senior citizens on fixed income.

1251
01:31:54,126 --> 01:31:55,626
There are handicapped young people.

1252
01:31:57,007 --> 01:31:58,847
There are under educated people.

1253
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:03,128
There are drug addicted people and so on.

1254
01:32:04,048 --> 01:32:10,150
And the department heads all tell us of how they all need more money.

1255
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:19,672
The budget as presented by the executive will be passed automatically by a majority of this council in the last week of June.

1256
01:32:20,792 --> 01:32:21,032
Why?

1257
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:26,914
because that is what has happened every year for almost 30 years.

1258
01:32:29,396 --> 01:32:31,898
This year will not be an exception.

1259
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:40,925
The council, as is well known, can shape the budget with a majority line-item veto.

1260
01:32:42,286 --> 01:32:52,214
But, alas, it does not, forgetting that it has taken an oath to serve the people of Medford, not the administration.

1261
01:32:54,255 --> 01:33:00,136
The council and the audience have been given a copy of the anticipated 2018 budget.

1262
01:33:00,156 --> 01:33:02,817
This year's 2017 budget is $162 million.

1263
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:08,158
The anticipated 2018 budget, this is the budget that I am suggesting will be in effect, is $169 million.

1264
01:33:08,178 --> 01:33:09,059
That is $7 million more.

1265
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:25,791
a 4.3 percent increase.

1266
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:29,633
How can a 4.3 percent increase be justified?

1267
01:33:31,234 --> 01:33:35,196
Social Security payments to our seniors are flat or diminished.

1268
01:33:36,576 --> 01:33:40,298
Ten-year United States bonds pay only 2 percent.

1269
01:33:41,499 --> 01:33:47,502
Local banks pay interest to savers as low as one-hundredth of 1 percent.

1270
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:51,084
And inflation is only 1.3 percent.

1271
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,401
Our city needs 4.3% to operate.

1272
01:33:58,861 --> 01:34:01,462
How can we rationalize such an inequity?

1273
01:34:02,502 --> 01:34:08,003
Now, look at the template for the 2018 budget.

1274
01:34:09,684 --> 01:34:11,444
Look at how we arrive at these numbers.

1275
01:34:12,904 --> 01:34:19,546
Some numbers are rounded numbers and some numbers are estimated because we do not have access to official numbers.

1276
01:34:20,806 --> 01:34:23,607
But we will find that we are near accurate because

1277
01:34:24,685 --> 01:34:27,087
They are based on historical numbers.

1278
01:34:29,329 --> 01:34:35,053
Now about this budget, if you look at it, this is how it happens every year.

1279
01:34:35,153 --> 01:34:35,814
It's routine.

1280
01:34:35,954 --> 01:34:39,657
You can predict what's going to happen, because it happens this way every single year.

1281
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,801
And that's when Councilor Falco asked about it.

1282
01:34:44,821 --> 01:34:50,286
He could have followed this here and anticipated the budget, as it's going to be presented, by the way.

1283
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,968
We start out with the last levy.

1284
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:55,209
which was $104 million.

1285
01:34:55,950 --> 01:35:03,655
Now, we add to that Proposition 2.5 percent, which is a law, by the way, which is another $2.5 million.

1286
01:35:04,596 --> 01:35:06,277
Now, new growth, I had to estimate.

1287
01:35:06,877 --> 01:35:10,240
Usually, new growth comes to about $1 million a year.

1288
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:15,984
Now, I'm estimating for this year $1.5 million because we have a lot of building going on in the city.

1289
01:35:17,124 --> 01:35:19,186
So, we arrive at a levy limit

1290
01:35:20,044 --> 01:35:22,005
of $108 million.

1291
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:28,229
Now, that levy limit of $180 million is what the homeowners pay.

1292
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:31,091
That's the real estate tax, $108 million.

1293
01:35:31,691 --> 01:35:38,015
And that is what the people of Medford who own homes will be paying, $108 million.

1294
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:49,002
We have to add to that all the other taxes, like, for instance, local fees, state aid, school grants,

1295
01:35:50,227 --> 01:35:52,949
return earnings, and the Enterprise Fund.

1296
01:35:53,049 --> 01:35:55,310
I'm putting the Enterprise Fund in at $25 million.

1297
01:35:56,531 --> 01:35:59,213
We discussed that earlier, as you remember, Councilor Marks.

1298
01:35:59,813 --> 01:36:02,715
And the reason I'm putting that in is because every year it's about that.

1299
01:36:02,855 --> 01:36:05,017
We have $24 million or $25 million or so.

1300
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:12,002
And because water and sewer rates are being raised, I'm estimating it at $25 million.

1301
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:16,384
Now, we arrive at an available budget of $169 million.

1302
01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:23,809
Remember that number, $169 million.

1303
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:32,052
Now about this budget, this budget means tax increases in all our taxes.

1304
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:37,634
After all, the $7 billion must come from somewhere.

1305
01:36:40,115 --> 01:36:42,956
Only the city council can reduce the budget as presented.

1306
01:36:44,356 --> 01:36:47,277
But there are many items that cannot be legally reduced like

1307
01:36:48,088 --> 01:37:06,933
contracted compensation for our worthy employees, like principal and interest on borrowed money of bonds, like insurance, like pension contributions, like state assessments, like legal liabilities.

1308
01:37:09,874 --> 01:37:17,116
So the only item, as far as I can see, that we can reduce is the cost

1309
01:37:18,135 --> 01:37:19,615
of waste in government.

1310
01:37:20,636 --> 01:37:21,756
Yes, waste.

1311
01:37:23,036 --> 01:37:23,997
And there is waste.

1312
01:37:25,097 --> 01:37:28,518
And it could add up to that $7 million that we were talking about.

1313
01:37:28,858 --> 01:37:31,879
After all, it is now only 4% of the $169 million budget, not 4.3%.

1314
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:33,939
There is surely at least 4% waste in our government.

1315
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:35,300
The people of Medford expect honesty,

1316
01:37:47,596 --> 01:37:49,036
and truthfulness from our government.

1317
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:53,838
That requires an expenditure of time and energy.

1318
01:37:55,358 --> 01:38:01,120
The people expect generosity and kindness from our government.

1319
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:08,842
That requires, well, the other was truthfulness that required transparency.

1320
01:38:08,862 --> 01:38:10,382
That was another one.

1321
01:38:10,962 --> 01:38:16,484
But generosity and kindness require the expenditure of time and energy.

1322
01:38:17,053 --> 01:38:19,313
The people expect humility from our government.

1323
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:23,574
That means no arrogance, no elitism.

1324
01:38:24,895 --> 01:38:27,295
The people expect courage from our government.

1325
01:38:28,495 --> 01:38:30,656
That means taking some personal risk.

1326
01:38:31,816 --> 01:38:39,038
And finally, the people expect devotion to the people from our government.

1327
01:38:40,478 --> 01:38:45,639
And that requires altruism, honesty,

1328
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:53,662
Generosity, humility, courage, devotion.

1329
01:38:55,323 --> 01:39:10,968
Individuals who do not embrace those qualities should not be in government because in the pact with government, the people surrender part of their most precious right in return for some service.

1330
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:15,650
That most precious right is

1331
01:39:16,693 --> 01:39:17,273
their liberty.

1332
01:39:19,494 --> 01:39:26,397
Marcus Aurelius, who died in 180 A.D., said, life is short.

1333
01:39:27,818 --> 01:39:29,018
That's all there is to say.

1334
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:35,601
Get what we can from the present, thoughtfully, justly.

1335
01:39:35,981 --> 01:39:38,442
Now, the two most important words there are thoughtfully, justly.

1336
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:45,105
And he says, get what we can from the present, with thought and with justice.

1337
01:39:47,162 --> 01:40:00,745
So when we talk about, I've said this before to the council, they're probably tired of hearing it, but someone must expect responsibility for the increase in taxes constantly, year after year.

1338
01:40:02,945 --> 01:40:12,387
Sorry to say this, I like all of you personally, believe it or not, but sometimes I regret your political actions.

1339
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:15,788
You can depend on me.

1340
01:40:17,446 --> 01:40:20,107
I know you'll never need me, but if you do, I'm available.

1341
01:40:21,328 --> 01:40:30,032
But I want to say that the increase in taxes is unfortunately the responsibility of the city council.

1342
01:40:31,052 --> 01:40:35,675
The city council can do something about it, but it doesn't.

1343
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:42,838
Therefore, when taxes are increased on the poor, on the people who cannot afford it,

1344
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:45,286
Other people find difficulty.

1345
01:40:45,547 --> 01:40:47,008
Not the prosperous people in Memphis.

1346
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:47,708
There are many.

1347
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,969
They can afford it.

1348
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:54,854
If they want to pay more taxes, they should, but they should not impose it on the poor people.

1349
01:40:56,555 --> 01:40:58,197
That's one thing that I'm sorry about.

1350
01:40:59,558 --> 01:41:05,302
One of the flaws of human nature is that people want to control other people.

1351
01:41:06,323 --> 01:41:07,284
They ought not do that.

1352
01:41:08,445 --> 01:41:10,206
If you want to pay more taxes, go ahead.

1353
01:41:11,305 --> 01:41:14,186
but don't compel other people to do the same thing.

1354
01:41:15,467 --> 01:41:16,688
Thank you very much, councillors.

1355
01:41:16,868 --> 01:41:17,768
Thank you, Mr. Stirola.

1356
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:22,831
Thank you.

1357
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:37,998
Name and address for the record, please.

1358
01:41:40,703 --> 01:41:42,765
Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street.

1359
01:41:45,447 --> 01:41:49,771
It's hard to follow Dr. Starella, he's so eloquent.

1360
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:55,576
And my education is not so good, you know.

1361
01:41:56,537 --> 01:42:00,200
From Tuspac, I was educated at Woodstock, and I went to BU once.

1362
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:06,085
I did go to BU once, Boston University I think it's called, but it was closed.

1363
01:42:07,866 --> 01:42:08,287
However,

1364
01:42:09,321 --> 01:42:35,111
What really fries my backside is this new growth that's projected at about $1.5 million, it is not, never has been deducted from Prop 2.5 before you raise the real estate tax.

1365
01:42:36,052 --> 01:42:37,412
If it did last year, the $1.7 million,

1366
01:42:40,650 --> 01:43:01,283
of new growth deducted that first from the two and a half percent of 100 million, two and a half million, you would have had like $800,000 increase instead of two, three, $4 million.

1367
01:43:01,404 --> 01:43:08,068
Approximately, I would say,

1368
01:43:08,465 --> 01:43:10,306
The real estate tax was never going up like $400.

1369
01:43:10,466 --> 01:43:12,488
It probably would have went up $80.

1370
01:43:12,608 --> 01:43:18,032
Probably would have saved 80% on the tax increase.

1371
01:43:19,633 --> 01:43:21,435
I don't know why it's not being done.

1372
01:43:24,497 --> 01:43:35,165
Furthermore, I don't understand why we can't do what Somerville, Everett, Malden does, Boston, Brookline, and I believe Martha's Vineyard.

1373
01:43:37,418 --> 01:43:48,527
to give the owner-occupied who live in their one home, doesn't matter if it's a condo, single, two, three family, or 100 family, marauder home, doesn't matter.

1374
01:43:48,547 --> 01:43:51,569
They're all gonna get the same 20% exemption.

1375
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:58,595
Actually, now I'm talking, since it's never been done here, 35% to make it worthwhile.

1376
01:43:59,436 --> 01:44:07,042
So no one's real estate tax will go up, even if you live in it, because the cap would be

1377
01:44:07,587 --> 01:44:13,171
much higher than last year's projected $600,000 or thereabouts, it'll go up to $1 million.

1378
01:44:14,191 --> 01:44:20,295
And if it does go up, because you live in a house that's valued over $1 million, it's going to be a minuscule increase.

1379
01:44:20,936 --> 01:44:33,564
And don't forget, at 20%, if that was adopted, it would have been, I don't know,

1380
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:40,538
I'm losing track because it's highly unfair.

1381
01:44:42,078 --> 01:44:43,759
And I kind of understand it.

1382
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:47,740
And if you give the city more money, even on the side, I'm sure they'll take it.

1383
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,021
But Dr. Sorella brings up some good points.

1384
01:44:54,501 --> 01:45:05,084
I still understand why we don't use that new growth, because the new growth, we might as well not have it because we don't need more congestion in East Ford, South Medford, because

1385
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:10,297
They don't help the real estate tax because it's been carrying the load for decades.

1386
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:11,578
They hurt us.

1387
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:21,945
Need more police, more fire, schools, school teachers, infrastructure, things of that nature.

1388
01:45:23,126 --> 01:45:24,227
So where does that come from?

1389
01:45:25,648 --> 01:45:26,489
We need more money.

1390
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:32,993
And the real estate tax, thanks to Barbara Anderson, rest her soul, is about two and a half.

1391
01:45:33,714 --> 01:45:34,955
But like Dr. Stirella says,

1392
01:45:35,405 --> 01:45:39,626
last year's increase or his projected increase for 2018 will be like over 4%.

1393
01:45:40,026 --> 01:45:42,007
So that's a fallacy also, Prop 2.5.

1394
01:45:45,588 --> 01:45:47,948
How much more can you tax the lower middle class?

1395
01:45:48,028 --> 01:45:53,089
I really don't care too much for rich people, and I'm not really in the poor people's corner either.

1396
01:45:54,730 --> 01:46:03,632
I'm for the lower middle class, because without the lower middle class, which is the majority, you're not gonna have a society worth a damn, and I repeat,

1397
01:46:04,068 --> 01:46:06,309
and it might be time for a second revolution.

1398
01:46:07,209 --> 01:46:09,750
That's how this country was founded when we threw out the English.

1399
01:46:11,711 --> 01:46:12,451
Give him a break.

1400
01:46:14,211 --> 01:46:21,454
Please, help the taxpayer, the average person, please help them for a change, just once.
