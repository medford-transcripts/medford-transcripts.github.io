1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,611
I understand.

2
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:02,592
I mean, people don't want to get it.

3
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:03,312
It's terrible.

4
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:06,273
But never reading.

5
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:06,593
No.

6
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:06,753
Yeah.

7
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,713
I mean, it's a good point.

8
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,074
There's a little kid literature that just doesn't work.

9
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:13,234
But wouldn't the student system need to develop on top of it?

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:46,231
Do people want to?

11
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:51,673
I don't hear yours as well.

12
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,074
I checked my.

13
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:01,559
Christian's website traffic.

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,861
Like, wow, we got 25 visitors.

15
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,805
Like, half of those are probably me, just checking to see who's going.

16
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:21,294
Or we had a big spike in Chinese traffic for some week.

17
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:27,299
Like, just servers from China.

18
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:28,820
I don't know, we had quite that reach.

19
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,375
We did work that out, because I was really excited, because I said, wow.

20
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,977
Because I didn't look at where it was coming from.

21
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,300
I said, wow, we just spiked, like, triple or nothing.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,161
It's an international congregation.

23
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:50,727
And then, boom, it's like, I've got to go read all the things that's going on.

24
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:52,128
Yeah, it was fun.

25
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,149
It was fun.

26
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:08,403
Thank you.

27
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,683
Would you like access to that?

28
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:10,344
Yeah.

29
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:10,824
Awesome.

30
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:11,184
I am.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:42,663
I will say, I think that Kate has the best strategy in terms of letting someone know when the slide needs to change, because she just works it into her narrative, and she says, on the next slide, you will see.

32
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:48,024
And it's just, it's wonderful, because it's not like a non sequitur in terms of saying, next slide, next slide, right?

33
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,224
Just, she's very, very polished.

34
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:53,245
The next chapter, yeah.

35
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:56,846
I'll see what I can do, Matt.

36
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,349
Anyone that is online virtually, we are going to

37
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,159
start up probably in about five minutes or so.

38
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:26,360
We appreciate you being punctual and on time.

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:35,185
We just usually like to give a little bit of time for people to trickle in, whether we're in person here or those that are joining us virtually.

40
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:36,805
So just hang tight.

41
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,546
We will get going short here.

42
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:42,869
Hi, Matt.

43
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:45,610
Just double checking that there's a sign-in sheet in the room.

44
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:49,772
Thank you so much.

45
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:50,893
There certainly is.

46
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,256
In my backpack.

47
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,403
I appreciate your sister so long.

48
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:35,932
I think there's, yeah, there are classes back there.

49
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:42,115
Is that courtyard over there?

50
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:46,497
That courtyard should be over there.

51
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:50,719
But I'm not sure if there's, there's never been windows in here since I've been here.

52
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,631
even before they reach it.

53
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:04,694
No, I think there is something over there, because if you go out the hall, there's offices over there.

54
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,134
There's a nurse's office over there.

55
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:07,335
The bathroom's there.

56
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,496
Nurses are on the other side.

57
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,957
I really wanted to take my bathroom.

58
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,178
There's an advisor's office there.

59
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,039
And then there's the- Advisor's, like, right there.

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Uh-huh.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,041
And then there's the overpass.

62
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:25,605
And then the nurse is on the other side of the overpass next to the- except the nurse is on the second floor, not the third floor, but by the path.

63
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,409
Once you know the building, it's really not that bad.

64
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:48,242
The worst part about this building, quite honestly, I mean, for people getting around, is when you come for any sort of sporting events, trying to get to the back of the building or know where to get to.

65
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:53,634
Where's the gym?

66
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,835
I'm like, oh, go, go in the pool.

67
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,136
And so I realized, I wouldn't stick it in.

68
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,857
There's no sign that says where to go.

69
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,238
And these people are so confused.

70
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:00,839
I'm the one that's always dark.

71
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,561
And so often, I'm like, OK, go this way, or like, no one else.

72
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:09,904
Well, when you come to the pool during the day, and you can't go in the pool entrance, you have to go around the back of the gym.

73
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:10,565
Oh, my god.

74
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,565
Yeah.

75
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:12,406
To the other pool.

76
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:16,048
I was going to say, see, I'm not drunk, but you just keep cropping them.

77
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,024
Jim doors to get a bad number.

78
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:20,064
Yes, we appreciate that.

79
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,425
Yeah.

80
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,126
And then they go around and on from it.

81
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:23,766
Okay.

82
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:27,087
To be clear by we, I mean my coach, I have not done anything.

83
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,288
Please don't be mad at me.

84
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,269
Oh, I laugh every time Pam walks around and I'm like, really?

85
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,030
Someone's going to do it.

86
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,852
And then it started getting from the end of the day, which is.

87
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:51,117
What's 50% of the hot and other 50% inside for a game.

88
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:59,004
Well, I will happily admit that I have had to.

89
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:02,827
put on my desk constantly and I don't know how that can be the same thing.

90
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:06,730
So that's what's going on your desk in your paper problems.

91
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,836
No, I have one here and one here.

92
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,397
But I'm not the only teacher.

93
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:14,318
And it's like a principal has her face, Peter.

94
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,820
Like another teacher has like screams upon the thesis.

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,541
And then they're showing us how to fill the thesis.

96
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,703
So which one are you?

97
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,917
We all overlapped there.

98
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:49,025
That being said, I feel like I'm so used to this point that Well, I've gotten smart, but it's.

99
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:49,165
It's.

100
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:49,826
It would be my.

101
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:51,888
No worries.

102
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,741
Every travel basketball game, I'm like, I'm sorry.

103
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,382
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,784
If you don't know, but they said, no, right.

105
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:06,264
There's not me.

106
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,285
That's a gym entrant.

107
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:07,986
Just as insane.

108
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:08,987
It's like, where are you looking?

109
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,069
Well, it probably was at some point, but it says there's a community.

110
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,690
Yes.

111
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,431
Cool.

112
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,332
None of them actually say Jim.

113
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:15,793
No.

114
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:16,734
Yeah.

115
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,055
I just, I don't know.

116
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,130
I mean, I've been here for four and a half months.

117
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,132
I have a long list of who thought that was a good idea.

118
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:24,732
It sure does.

119
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:25,532
It's probably long.

120
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,253
It's just hidden, and then you get the thing.

121
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,314
All right, what's the name?

122
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:40,501
I'm just trying to find a spot that's not going to be on the computer, so I don't know.

123
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,706
It's not going to be great.

124
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:53,767
Yeah, no worries.

125
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,388
Don't let me leave without giving you.

126
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,569
I won't, but if I don't get it, I'll get it.

127
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:58,150
OK.

128
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,191
So thank you.

129
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:04,314
Has somebody, I know you guys have had people come around and do surveys of everything.

130
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,996
Does anybody watch the traffic flows in the morning and afternoon?

131
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:07,636
They have?

132
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:08,156
Yes.

133
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,758
It's still working.

134
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,302
I've just never seen anyone standing outside my classroom in the afternoon.

135
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,423
I think they stand down by the corner.

136
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:30,512
So can I suggest that somebody stands where the parents start honking at each other around up in the back, like by the community schools entrance, honking at each other.

137
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,594
I believe you.

138
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:34,255
Yes.

139
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,717
I took Steve Miller drive.

140
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:45,363
And then they watched the different spots around the front, like watching and counting what goes up the loop and comes around the other way.

141
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:51,571
This is what they do when they park, and they pull over, and they honk at each other.

142
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:59,638
For reference, at the back corner of the building, you can't, and they just.

143
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,920
Yeah, because they're all away from the curb.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,605
No, but then sometimes there are people parked over there, and then the buses can't turn, and they honk at each other, and they do like two rows.

145
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,148
I'm just letting you know, things are so many no's that it's.

146
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:11,949
Oh, it's hot.

147
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:17,603
But I know, I wasn't sure if they were like, I was like, I think they're just at the front of the building.

148
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,323
And that's where the parents almost said.

149
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,604
But I really put all the way over there.

150
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:22,884
All right.

151
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:29,085
So we took a brief foray into our site and safety and security.

152
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:32,226
Overstepping our advisory team, which is OK.

153
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:35,086
Because that's what we go over quickly.

154
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,507
There's a lot of overlap between us.

155
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:42,988
But we are going to get going with our exterior interior design advisory team meeting number two.

156
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,153
I can get the slides to wake up.

157
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:48,433
We'll move forward.

158
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:53,514
So we'll do a quick round of introductions of the design team.

159
00:10:53,574 --> 00:11:01,275
Again, just so you feel at least talk with me primarily, but we're still going to have a lot of opportunity for dialogue as we go forward.

160
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:07,317
I will do, as I've done at the other second iteration of these meetings, just give an opportunity.

161
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:13,518
Does anyone knew that was not able to introduce themselves at the first meeting from the Medford team?

162
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:22,505
I'm happy to allow a couple minutes just to allow people to tell us about themselves and serve their connection to the project.

163
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:28,466
We're going to do a quick recap in terms of what we went over in terms of meeting one as part of this discussion.

164
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:38,168
We're going to talk a little bit about the context of civic architecture that is here within the city and what that means for this project moving forward.

165
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,828
We're going to talk about the

166
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:44,807
how we formulate, think about exterior materials moving forward at a very high level.

167
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,909
We're not getting too specific just yet.

168
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:53,714
And similarly, we're going to talk a little bit about interior design and materiality for the interior of the building.

169
00:11:54,454 --> 00:12:04,402
And then lastly, talk about the concept of experiential graphic design and how that can help connect to and reinforce the culture of the building.

170
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:08,365
And we'll wrap up just going over some next steps.

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,202
All right, so just a real introduction very quickly.

172
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,444
Again, my name is Matt Rice.

173
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,026
I'm an architect with SMMA.

174
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,387
We'll go in the room here.

175
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,308
We have one other.

176
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:23,250
I'm Michael Pardek.

177
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,152
I'm also an architect, project designer.

178
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:33,297
Online, I think Helen may join us in a couple of minutes.

179
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,658
She is our project manager.

180
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,980
I know we have Sarah online.

181
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:38,513
Hi, everybody.

182
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,294
Sarah Long, interior design with SMMA.

183
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,595
And I think we have Soala as well.

184
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:46,416
Hi, everyone.

185
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,296
Good to see you all again.

186
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:50,037
It's Soala, architectural designer at SMMA.

187
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,858
And Matt, I'm here as well.

188
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,458
Lucas Carrier, designer at SMMA.

189
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:56,819
Great.

190
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,060
Is there anyone else that I missed from the design team?

191
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:05,081
And just I'll give an opportunity.

192
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:06,462
Do we have folks from left field?

193
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:22,211
Yes, Jen Carlson here I and Matt Galeno will be joining us shortly shortly I am the project director with left field the owners project manager and Matt Galeno will be joining us shortly is the day to day project manager.

194
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:25,313
Great Thank you.

195
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:30,035
All right, and then, this is our medford advisory team members.

196
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,438
Is there anyone on the line.

197
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:43,742
that is a new member that didn't get a chance to introduce, not a new member, but was on this list, but wasn't able to make the first meeting that wants to just do a quick introduction.

198
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,527
All right, I'm going to keep moving, taking that as a no.

199
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:55,829
We're just giving this quick reminder probably at every meeting as we go forward.

200
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,772
And as this evolves and gets updated as we move forward, we'll change this.

201
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,113
But for the time being, this is still

202
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:07,869
Our schedule as it's laid out currently, a fall opening of 2030 is our goal post that we're moving towards.

203
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:19,213
The starred touch points that we have here for the advisory team meetings, and this is every one of the four meetings are going to happen at each one of these start points.

204
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:25,075
The second meeting where we are now is still in this first portion of the feasibility study where we are.

205
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:30,137
The next meeting that we're going to have, number three, actually is going to happen towards the beginning of March.

206
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,117
We'll get the specific

207
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:34,847
uh, time, date, um, towards the end of the meeting.

208
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:42,209
Um, but this is going to be the, the final meeting that we have in this portion of the repeatability, not the final meeting goal for all.

209
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:59,193
And then just a reminder that this exterior and interior design advisory team meeting is part of a collection, um, of these four, uh, groups, um, that I'll, I'll just keep saying it over and over again, that these are not siloed activities or discussions that are happening

210
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:13,034
There is a lot of overlap that happens and we do want to focus in on these topics to have some conversations so that we can understand what the community is thinking and sort of where the community's priorities and goals are moving forward.

211
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:23,038
We'll bring those together and these will all come back to the full building committee of recommendations coming out of this process, the series of meetings that we're in right now.

212
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:26,740
All right, I think there's an animation on the slide.

213
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,036
This is a slide that we have reviewed a couple of times.

214
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,317
We reviewed it last night with the full building committee.

215
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:45,205
We're sharing it again here just because it's pertinent in terms of the topic of design when we start thinking about what the building may look like on the outside and the inside to understand how we're progressing along.

216
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:53,470
What we shared with the building committee last night was repeated over and over again that was not design options, but really high-level cost alternatives.

217
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:58,756
Eventually though those will evolve into design concepts.

218
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:06,703
And it's really going to be part of what we talk about here as we move forward in terms of getting some input and feedback.

219
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:12,689
We're going to get input and feedback from a lot of different sources and voices as we go through the process.

220
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,775
But this is one that will have some specific conversations as we get to sort of that next level.

221
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:25,148
Um, of having, um, sort of moving things from those cost models into actual design options.

222
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,712
And again, if you did not catch the meeting last night, we did have 29, um, different.

223
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:39,657
High level cost models, um, that are being put out, um, out into the world, um, for cost estimating.

224
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:46,161
Um, we reviewed with the building committee last night or really confirmed, um, that this is a correct number that we want to look at.

225
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,203
Um, these are really discreet.

226
00:16:51,102 --> 00:17:05,647
cost approaches in terms of how we are either building new construction, doing partial addition and renovation of the existing building, or all the way on the left-hand side just doing a baseline code upgrade.

227
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,788
So we're not going to revisit the entirety of that meeting from last night.

228
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,469
That's not the point of this discussion today.

229
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,970
We just wanted to share the fact that these are out there.

230
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,231
We can certainly circle back if people are curious about any aspects of these.

231
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:21,996
as it pertains to the subject matter of this particular advisory team.

232
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:29,379
But there is some connection between what we talked about last night and what we're going to discuss here.

233
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,080
All right.

234
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,780
So I'm going to turn it over to Michael.

235
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,481
All right.

236
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:39,322
So it's always good to remember what we talked about last night.

237
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,543
There's been a lot of meetings between then and now.

238
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:43,444
So I think it's important to remember

239
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:50,519
Try to recap, we collected all the information provided and took related notes.

240
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:58,022
And then we tried to synthesize that down to a few, collect those under some themes.

241
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:12,267
It's always very helpful to take the range of things that we talked about from what color should the brick be to who are we as a school and everything in between.

242
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:25,643
So word clouds are helpful, but just the first one that we heard a few times was to do more for us.

243
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:42,106
We should be looking at timeless design, timeless materials over trendy things, things that are maybe flashes in the pan, and that we should embrace simplicity, strength,

244
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:58,990
make choices that are beautiful, materials that are beautiful and look good and exude a certain comfort and excitement people are using the building.

245
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:11,437
And on the flip side, looking at life cycle costs, looking at things like maintenance, which plays into the long-term value of that material and keeping it

246
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,313
keeping it looking good, not beat up.

247
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:28,765
So a couple of people that were fond of this building, the concrete that is all around us, it's honesty and longevity.

248
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:36,832
And this last phrase really stuck out to us is that every material should earn its place in this building.

249
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:38,113
That we're not here to,

250
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:46,162
decorate things with things that don't have purpose.

251
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:57,471
Second kind of broad bucket was materials, material health, sustainability.

252
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:05,978
Many people mentioned going after rentless free materials, materials that are low in toxicity,

253
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:13,876
the PVC vinyls for the project, setting the occupant.

254
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:18,317
Occupant well-being, health is paramount.

255
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,358
That's both the physical and emotional side of that.

256
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:29,000
Again, maintenance will be a big theme, especially as we get way down the road.

257
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,202
We are selecting materials for classrooms, for hallways, for

258
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:44,753
like this with movable furniture, it all gets down to that level of detail of how well that material holds up over time.

259
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:59,261
And avoiding things like waxing floors and working with the custodial staff to understand how the building is cared for over time.

260
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,064
And that sustainability has always been

261
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:08,424
a very high priority for this district, for this school.

262
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,366
So that goes without saying.

263
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:17,470
We're investigating all those scenarios for, is it LEED?

264
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,571
Is it passive house?

265
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,972
Is it living building challenge?

266
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:28,497
That'll all get discussed as we start creating buildings and sites.

267
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:31,819
Next.

268
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:36,209
Next big thing here was about the civic role of the building.

269
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,438
A lot of it was about what we were just kind of briefly talking about before is, you know, the clarity and the site circulation.

270
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:51,085
Do people intuitively know where to go or are they getting lost the moment they make a right turn onto the site?

271
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:51,685
Some

272
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:59,776
Some thought that Medford as a city lacks public space.

273
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:05,558
So school, the flagship as a great opportunity to help fill that gap.

274
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:16,281
Of course, there's gonna be a lot of amazing, there are a lot of amazing programs here that draw people in, whether it's the pool or the fields.

275
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:23,403
There's a new auditorium and performing arts portion of the project.

276
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:29,514
That's not hidden, but it's very much part of the public realm celebrated.

277
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,116
And that'd be civic spaces.

278
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:37,678
I like this word, beacons in time of crisis.

279
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:47,222
It might talk about times of crisis a little bit later on when I talk about the civic architecture and its response to it.

280
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:52,564
Another theme was

281
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,800
flexibility of the space and student ownership.

282
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:09,865
So I think that flexibility goes both ways, both long-term flexibility, you know, the educational model today may not be the educational model in 40 years, 50 years.

283
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:19,008
So creating spaces that can evolve over time, creating systems as well that can evolve over time.

284
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,269
And yet the other flexibility

285
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:37,363
comment was more about the day-to-day sort of the class, the class use of, you know, when class of 2026 starts to have an English ability, how do they make it theirs for their duration here?

286
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:50,165
And so you imagine the waves of students and cohorts coming through the school and how can we create environments that allow them to have some sense of ownership,

287
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:53,888
There's a lot of that as we walk the halls here today.

288
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:59,749
There's a lot of murals and things like that are either painted on a wall or in a display case.

289
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:06,230
There's artifacts from probably the old school that are found out here.

290
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:13,131
Sarah will talk about how to incorporate some of that stuff a little bit later on, a little bit later on.

291
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:20,293
This one is pretty obvious, but we have an amazing site.

292
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,589
amazing setting within the fells.

293
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:32,452
So seeing that is not just an afterthought, but how you really take advantage of the fells throughout the season.

294
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,393
It's always changing through the season.

295
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:43,235
And there is a few really amazing views of the skyline from higher up and higher up the site.

296
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:49,137
Those are important when it comes time to even thinking about where we're positioning

297
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,861
blocks of space within a building, or which direction classroom space.

298
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:59,442
So that'll all come into play as we're starting to scope space and form.

299
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:18,747
And looking for ways to, this says rooftop access, but it could be a rooftop, it could be offsite access for teaching spaces, for science, for events, for CTE yards that become less of a storage place and more of a showcase.

300
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:27,356
And there's a few other landscape architecture related things.

301
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:30,177
Some about the durability of the landscape.

302
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:38,460
We have 1,300 students plus teachers, public moving through the school and grounds.

303
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,262
So creating that in a way that is both beautiful and durable and able to be upkept.

304
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,004
That's always a critical conversation to have.

305
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:51,225
Not to mention the things

306
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:55,994
don't really happen today.

307
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:11,343
And of course, there's a few historical, there's somewhere on your site, there's a quarry or a landfill, depending on which lens you wanna see that through.

308
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:19,508
And then probably the overarching thing here is, I think, belonging and creating.

309
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:50,172
whether that be from the architecture itself, whether that be how the Mustang identity is woven, not in a, like, just with the logo everywhere, but, you know, are the ways that weave it through the architecture, through the interiors, a way that's beautiful and thoughtful and creative.

310
00:26:52,589 --> 00:27:12,544
that all these things coming together, the materials we select, the graphics, the things that the students are able to create, not just on day one, but for the life of the building, that these are, they're able to be displayed off the leads throughout the building.

311
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:20,831
So we thought about this in trying to sum all that up of what we thought we heard, tried to,

312
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,975
challenge ourselves to get it to a concise statement.

313
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:49,773
And, you know, for us, we talked a lot about the range from materials to feelings and what things are about, but, you know, at the heart of all this, I think what we heard is this deep sense of trying to create a place where students belong, where families belong, where people that don't have kids who are

314
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,807
Citizens in Bedford feel like they belong.

315
00:27:53,027 --> 00:28:04,551
And visitors, you know, from other school districts, they come to the field, or they come to plays and things like that, that they belong with as well.

316
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,612
So that's the purpose and belonging at heart.

317
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:11,853
And so how do we achieve that?

318
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:17,275
Achieve that through selecting materials with purpose, value,

319
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:37,916
We're trying to achieve this timeless identity through creating spaces that are flexible and feature ready and underpinning it all as a healthy space, space full of sustainability that's not just tacked on, but really woven into the fabric of the school.

320
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:46,883
And then on this outer ring, these are all the things that maybe you thought when you joined this committee, you'd be talking about,

321
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:50,090
the color of metal panel and things like that.

322
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,172
So those are all this outer frame.

323
00:28:52,932 --> 00:29:15,950
The materials and the aesthetics of the building, the wayfinding artwork, how people find their way around the site for athletics, after hours events, how the landscape feels and interacts with the building and the greater site, and daylight views and the comfort

324
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:18,988
So that's kind of this outer ring.

325
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:25,832
So we tried to kind of echo what we thought we heard in the first meeting.

326
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:30,835
Put it in a form that gave it a little bit of structure.

327
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:36,658
It definitely had a major kind of why at the Senate at all.

328
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,842
I sort of neglected as we jumped into the introduction and sort of the agenda.

329
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:59,099
Generally the format for these second meetings is that we're going through in sort of groups or chapters of the discussion, take about like 12, 10 minutes with each one of these and have a little bit of presentation of content and then also have some feedback discussion or thoughts associated with it.

330
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:07,404
So for this first one, this is really just trying to get a sense of whether or not what we're sharing back to you resonates, right?

331
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:10,126
Is this, does it seem like we've heard

332
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:25,516
Um, the feedback that came to us during this first meeting, um, are there things that, that you're thinking about that you mentioned last time that maybe aren't reflected here that could be, or are there some other thoughts that have sort of come out of this, um, that you think might be interesting to add to the conversation?

333
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:30,977
Um, so we'll just take a couple minutes and feel some thoughts there, and then we'll move on to the next sort of chapter.

334
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:43,364
completely accurate and good, which we might just take the silence for.

335
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,465
We will use the time in the other chapters as we move forward.

336
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:47,126
That's fine.

337
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:49,447
So three rings is a nice way to organize it.

338
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:53,308
I think that I can capture the categories.

339
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:55,829
You can categorize them all.

340
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:04,874
Yeah, it's hard to, when you're talking about design, it's just hard to have a formula.

341
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,855
But I think just doing it, this is kind of like

342
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,039
how scientific might do it, right?

343
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:25,184
There's a why in the middle, and then you have a how, the what around, but it just felt like, you know, the amount of things that we heard that there was a maybe a simple way to help frame it.

344
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:33,846
And to be able to go back to this, you know, but we're in more heated, you know, maybe in the future when we're in more heated discussions about

345
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:38,007
why we're doing certain things or why we're selecting certain things.

346
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:41,548
We might use this as kind of our star.

347
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:52,253
I think, I mean, I want to echo what Libby said because I think the visual of this captures things really nicely.

348
00:31:52,293 --> 00:32:01,037
Having been, like Marta and I have been in every single session that we've done between visioning and leadership and forum.

349
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:11,759
And I think that that really reflects what we've heard from teachers, from staff, from students.

350
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:22,467
I said in one of the several meetings that we've been in that the most impactful part for me so far was during the educational forum work and listening to students.

351
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:29,012
And they talked about the kinds of spaces where they felt the most connection or sense of belonging.

352
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:29,312
So.

353
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:48,348
And we did hear from from teachers who it's a shift to have to have some shared spaces and what will, you know, really help them be able to, you know, have a space where they can do their planning and they're collaborating with colleagues.

354
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,311
This really does reflect all of those conversations we've been a part of.

355
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:52,551
So.

356
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:57,934
All right.

357
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:06,509
We're going to do a little, like a class here.

358
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:19,414
We're going to talk about materials, no, no, civic architecture, and a little bit, Matt will talk about materials afterwards.

359
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:29,638
But kind of on the material front, I thought I'd wait for way back in Medford history to talk about some of the first materials that

360
00:33:32,124 --> 00:33:33,204
that really meant something.

361
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:40,728
And those were shipbuilding and brick picking towards kind of the mid-16 to 1700s.

362
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:51,454
But I thought I'd start here, instead of just jumping right into looking at some of the civic buildings that say that, you know, there is a long history here.

363
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:57,637
We know some of these, the gold in these industries are kind of died out.

364
00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:03,176
in the 1700s and 1800s, but it's still important to recognize the history.

365
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:20,262
And I think there's a really good tie to, I was thinking earlier about our CTE spaces here, like that hands-on, like it was happening here even back then, you know, of course, we had the skill and the material, right?

366
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:28,424
We had wood, we had the skill to build ships, we had the river to be able to send them out in the rain, same with brickmaking.

367
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:35,434
There's a lot of clay and natural materials that resourceful people turned into an industry.

368
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:40,216
So I thought that was an interesting place to start.

369
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:46,620
And then I'm just going to roll through just some civic buildings.

370
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,783
And these are kind of civic buildings by era almost.

371
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:55,945
I've just pulled out a handful of the ones that

372
00:34:56,537 --> 00:35:05,540
that were mentioned last time and some new ones and some that I drove by on the way up here, which is kind of cool.

373
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,781
The first one is the 1891 building.

374
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:20,525
I thought this was a really good place to start, because this one, you think about buildings and how they're forming their material.

375
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:25,847
If you think about an armory, you think, like, of a top building, right?

376
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,621
I'm holding a lot of important things.

377
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:34,342
Historically, they were used to hold ambitions and things like that.

378
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:40,283
Over time, they evolved into more community spaces in some cities.

379
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:46,124
But you can see with this Romanesque revival, the stone is really rustic.

380
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,065
It's got these castle-like turrets.

381
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:54,766
So it's really trying its hardest to exude strength.

382
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:00,586
That's 1891.

383
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:08,490
Down in the square, the big old block is late 1800s.

384
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,291
That's kind of a late Victorian Queen Anne style.

385
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:17,373
That's kind of characterized, can't really see in the photo, but the brickwork is really ornate.

386
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:18,554
There's a lot of detail.

387
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,335
It's very intricate.

388
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:24,697
A lot of these buildings express their verticality.

389
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:27,238
See it all the way up through the

390
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:34,613
that should be like elements in this corner, turn on the corner, which is clad in copper.

391
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:51,906
That's pretty typical of any Victorian or Anne style, just trying to stretch out that monumentality, but also giving the people inside, especially that corner room, kind of the visibility of the intersection square below.

392
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,747
Perfect spot for it, Duncan.

393
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:54,367
Right?

394
00:36:55,691 --> 00:37:01,832
Yeah, and adaptable, right?

395
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:02,692
Adaptable.

396
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:07,433
Yeah.

397
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,753
Just up the street, the theater.

398
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:11,894
So it's 1939.

399
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,514
It's part of the old high school building.

400
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:16,615
It's a great revival.

401
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:23,836
And I thought what was interesting about this is this building and the City Hall, which I'll show next, we're all part of the

402
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,657
built during the later part of the depression.

403
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:36,298
And when you think about what buildings are reacting to, I don't think that was a really great optimistic time.

404
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:49,401
So in times of crisis, especially back in the early, late 1800s, early 1900s, architects and designers were going after these revivals.

405
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,882
So you'll see this is a Greek revival, the city calls a colonial revival,

406
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:58,306
They're trying to call back to a previous time.

407
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:02,448
A lot of it's nostalgia, like, oh, it was so great back then.

408
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:03,708
Let's recall that.

409
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:10,230
So you'll see a lot of this, especially in these New Deal era buildings.

410
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:19,153
Of course, being a theater, recalling Greek is not a bad place to start.

411
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,943
classic Greek theaters that we see all the time.

412
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:33,469
And Greece also being the cradle of democracy doesn't hurt your country.

413
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,072
It's very recall those sentiments.

414
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:39,795
City Hall as well.

415
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:44,319
Not that old, 1937.

416
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,803
Like I said, it's another one of these revivals that's

417
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,390
calling back to a more patriotic time, perhaps.

418
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:56,392
So that's the story here.

419
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:58,774
It's got a kind of symmetry.

420
00:38:58,854 --> 00:39:06,038
It's got a very tall element in the middle so that you can see it from around.

421
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:08,820
But again, it's calling back.

422
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,182
Again, this was at the very end of the Depression.

423
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:19,407
So probably built, both of these buildings, probably built with a lot of rural labor

424
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:32,688
I forget which one of the new deal soups, it's either the WPA or EWA agencies that were going through the country building these buildings.

425
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:40,095
We're gonna fast forward a little bit.

426
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,397
Just to keep everybody on their toes here.

427
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:47,601
But, you know, Medford Police Station, I'd call this like,

428
00:39:48,983 --> 00:39:57,147
very civic structure, but it definitely shows it's kind of a serious building.

429
00:39:57,207 --> 00:40:00,989
It shows its utility and it's branded.

430
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:09,433
It's branded both with very large signs and this not so subtle blue with waves and brick.

431
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:18,777
So, I mean, police stations really have a tough balance between kind of suiting, protection, but they're also becoming places

432
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:20,775
that are welcoming people in.

433
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,136
The interior is actually pretty good.

434
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:40,482
There's some public space that has wood, but from this angle, it feels like it's protecting itself with these arms that are forming the ramps, but it feels like it's kind of holding on to itself.

435
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:45,784
Well, probably the architect said, well, we'll make the corner all glass.

436
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,511
but still feels a little paper.

437
00:40:54,473 --> 00:41:06,279
And then the library, the library is probably, I don't know, one of the nicer examples of a civic building, just opened a few years back.

438
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,880
It ties into the first slide.

439
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,363
You could definitely see a connection with the form of the building, splinterized, almost imagined.

440
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:17,184
One of the clipper ships, sure that,

441
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:23,489
These roof ornaments were inspired by shipbuilding and industries like that.

442
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:37,397
And a really good example of a, not so obvious here, but this is maybe one of the first net zero libraries, estates perhaps.

443
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:45,102
But if you look from the aerial view, the whole rooftop is covered with photovoltaic panels.

444
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:47,047
They did a really good job here.

445
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,910
It's really welcoming, welcoming spot, city.

446
00:41:53,471 --> 00:42:00,236
Kind of a interesting dichotomy of two civic buildings and what they're doing.

447
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:12,565
Now getting to the high school, these are, well, some of these pictures are of the high school, but the 1970s were, early 70s, late 60s were a really interesting time.

448
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:22,682
I just, while researching this project, was looking at who designed this building.

449
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:29,047
Somebody must have signed it, but I opened up a couple of these 1970 architecture magazines.

450
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:32,269
This is all you see, for the most part.

451
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,272
We're told it was a guy that designed Christmas straps.

452
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:38,273
So many high schools.

453
00:42:38,313 --> 00:42:39,754
So this late modernist style.

454
00:42:47,638 --> 00:43:04,987
almost a brutal architecture, which is raw concrete, single-pane glass that was used for schools, it was used for funeral homes, offices, banks, maintenance laboratories.

455
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:07,868
It was like the style of the day.

456
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:12,651
So it's not anything crazy.

457
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:22,389
I think Salem High School, which is also going through this same process, it's also of that same era.

458
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,451
So it kind of looks very similar.

459
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:38,695
But there was a really good spread in the yearbook from 1970 of this little photo essay that was put together.

460
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,537
But I'll kind of read through some of these lines.

461
00:43:45,577 --> 00:44:00,161
As the natural terrain was reshaped by dirt, concrete, earth-moving machines, a man-made beauty evolved that rivaled its own natural order.

462
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:08,743
Beauty is in the eye of the shibboleth, a world of coherence and order that even nature could not believe was excitedly emerging.

463
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:12,864
Surely brick and mortar could not live in green.

464
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:21,060
Yeah, I mentioned, you know, I mentioned architecture responding to what's going on.

465
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,822
This is like Vietnam era, a lot of craziness going on.

466
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:30,143
So a building and the previous building had the fire.

467
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:33,104
So a lot of chaos, right, going on during this time.

468
00:44:33,164 --> 00:44:44,048
So probably the school building committee at that time, the architects, you know, a search, you know, a search for order and clarity is certainly what they did here.

469
00:44:45,500 --> 00:45:01,290
from the way the corridors are laid out, the way the buildings are nicely placed together, pretty regular courtyards, and even getting down to the system of the facade, right?

470
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:12,818
There's rules, there's definitely rules that were applied, whether it be how we treat stairs, how we treat windows, how we treat sunshades, everything was

471
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:17,174
was ordered orderly and in control.

472
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:33,959
Quote by Marcus Aurelius, I think basically says that, I think Churchill's got a similar quote, but, you know, we shape our buildings and our buildings shape us.

473
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,440
So that's kind of what we're embarking on.

474
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:42,002
It was the environment who creates, materials who select,

475
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:53,090
all have impact on the occupants, how they grow, how they learn, how they interact with each other.

476
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,795
So now's a good maybe moment to pause.

477
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:02,499
Just kind of threw out this question.

478
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:07,203
I've seen some of the civic places.

479
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:10,706
Is there a connection between

480
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,164
Those places, this place, they're not a connection.

481
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:22,267
What does it mean to be a civic building today?

482
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:32,675
And this building does have as much significance as Sidney Hall as a public library.

483
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:36,178
It is the flagship school for the school district.

484
00:46:36,238 --> 00:46:41,742
It is so much more than just the high school as well, that it does have this type of prominence.

485
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:57,583
it doesn't necessarily need to have any particular aesthetic connection, but it's definitely worth talking that through to understand are there thoughts, are there feelings out there as to how it may connect or how it may not?

486
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,964
It seems out of place other than the police station.

487
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:09,646
With the other buildings, this seems like a completely different, like the police station and the high schools seem like different flavors than everything else.

488
00:47:10,265 --> 00:47:16,829
I know that in Marble Dead, or going to the Marble Dead projects, they wanted all the buildings to tie together.

489
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,272
They wanted to be cohesive.

490
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:36,662
But there's, I would say, the police station aside, this building has masonry, it's got bravitas, it's got dignity, and maybe some people may think it's ugly, but it has a lot of the weight that the other buildings have, and a sense of entry point.

491
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,789
that's meant to welcome people.

492
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,350
So I think that, yeah, the style is really different, for sure.

493
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,751
But it has that that ties things together.

494
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:51,694
I mean, if you look at photo of the Edwards, I think more so than like that.

495
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:53,895
I don't know what that photo is.

496
00:47:54,875 --> 00:48:02,018
Yeah, just I walk, you know, I haven't been to some of these buildings, but if I walk up to the city hall, I feel like, wow, it's interesting.

497
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:02,939
It's welcome.

498
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,920
I feel welcome to go there just on a Sunday when the building architecture

499
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,170
to the high school.

500
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,251
I don't feel it feels very cold, very distant.

501
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:15,735
Part of it's because it's so far setback in the administrative, you know.

502
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:22,238
Well, again, it doesn't have a super clear entrance because of where you drive up.

503
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:23,739
You then have to turn.

504
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:29,381
You don't see it, you know, like all of these, you see very clearly where you go in or what's standing out.

505
00:48:29,842 --> 00:48:34,504
And the high school doesn't have that unless you know to turn and go to a certain spot, you know, go there.

506
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:39,419
And all the other schools, I think, feel like they have more of an entrance, too, in the district.

507
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:40,259
Yeah.

508
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,920
Somebody has their hand raised.

509
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,521
I'm just going to put my glasses on so we can see.

510
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:45,781
Delia.

511
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:47,881
Hi, everybody.

512
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:50,302
Sorry to be on Zoom while you are all in person.

513
00:48:51,022 --> 00:49:01,685
But in thinking about your question, I was just considering the different users of the high school, and in particular, the students.

514
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:15,083
One might argue that the way in which this project is connected to kind of like the civicness of Medford could be in demonstrating what that means for students.

515
00:49:15,904 --> 00:49:32,255
So, you know, in educating students what it is to be civically minded or, you know, even thinking about other users like the greater community, you know, being, you know, connected, being a space in which community can gather.

516
00:49:33,612 --> 00:49:45,817
or to demonstrate to itself how to show what belonging means or, you know, showing up for each other means or, you know, any number of values that we might identify.

517
00:49:45,837 --> 00:50:00,202
So I think there's a really core component, like what distinguishes perhaps this from some of the other buildings would be the student component that it can educate in a way what it means to be civically minded.

518
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:11,658
Paul, go ahead.

519
00:50:11,738 --> 00:50:15,380
Thank you.

520
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:32,113
Sort of jumping off of what Delia had said, you know, when you were describing how a lot of architecture seems to be reflecting on a better time, I mean, we don't have to get into how

521
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:34,673
Was it really a better time?

522
00:50:34,693 --> 00:50:40,278
You know, nostalgia is often not related to reality.

523
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:50,026
But I think, you know, the school is always about the future.

524
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,808
It's like by default.

525
00:50:54,831 --> 00:51:08,176
you know, certainly we can have seniors in for education, but we don't make people go to high school or public school at the end of their lives for a reason, because this is helping them prepare to go forward.

526
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:17,120
And so I do hope we can sort of avoid any kind of nostalgia approach to design.

527
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:23,323
You know, like the, when we were building ships, it was,

528
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:27,334
It's a part of Medford's history.

529
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:32,697
I'm not saying that's not important, but there were also a lot of enslaved people here.

530
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:39,141
And we often just move along as if we just had chips and rum and everything was dandy.

531
00:51:40,482 --> 00:51:42,764
And that's not the truth.

532
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:49,008
And I do feel uncomfortable sort of perpetuating the myth of how great things used to be.

533
00:51:50,606 --> 00:52:06,904
Because I think it doesn't serve, in particular, it doesn't serve our students who, if they're doing a good, if we're doing a great job teaching them, then they are going to be far more aware than the rest of us sitting here of what history really was like.

534
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:09,587
So, you know, I

535
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:20,032
I think I'm loving, I love this, this look across the architecture of the city and the library in particular.

536
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:35,744
I think there's a way to weave in, you know, a theme, if you will, like whether ships and shipbuilding is a theme we can weave in or not is something that would be interesting to explore because

537
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:40,655
a bunch of buildings that aren't related at all.

538
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:51,582
It doesn't feel like it's part of a community necessarily, but I do think figuring out how we can make sure it's forward facing and not based on nostalgia is super important.

539
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:53,122
Thank you.

540
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:56,224
Great.

541
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,205
I'm going to take one more.

542
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:03,749
I think Jesse, you have your hand up, and then we're going to shift forward to make sure that we can touch on some of the other topics for today.

543
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:07,057
Thanks.

544
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:34,333
I'm just wondering, based on like the talk about nostalgia and how things fit into Medford, just to me, I feel like the usability and the sort of accessibility of the building winds up communicating its belonging far more than, you know,

545
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:42,790
trying to tap into what is Medford's character and its architecture, just because that's always changing.

546
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:55,563
But to me, a wildly different architectural style, if that were to be used in the high school,

547
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:24,936
wouldn't necessarily doom itself to being unsuccessful if it doesn't fit into a sort of Medford character so much as if it doesn't communicate that this is for everyone in the town the way, you know, some of the older civic buildings and the new libraries seem very accessible and usable versus the current high school which, you know, looks more like industrial sort of and

548
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:33,677
like a hydroelectric dam or something that you're not really sure where the access points are and what's happening inside of it.

549
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:35,358
That's all.

550
00:54:37,118 --> 00:54:38,818
Yeah, I think that's a great point.

551
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:46,040
And for clarity, I don't think we're suggesting that there's any emulation that we're putting forth at this point.

552
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:51,602
We were really just, and you all have done a fantastic job of just thinking about the topic

553
00:54:52,550 --> 00:55:00,016
and sort of whether or not there's sort of guidance there or thoughts, lessons to be taken from what's in there.

554
00:55:00,056 --> 00:55:04,739
But there's certainly more to come on that conversation as we move forward in the process.

555
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:15,727
So we're gonna talk a little bit more about exterior materials, right?

556
00:55:16,948 --> 00:55:19,409
So just to keep going on the theme of,

557
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:32,778
Precedence within this case, the district we have here the other school buildings that are located within the city.

558
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:43,086
The elementary schools in the middle schools here, and you can see there's a there's a good predominance of brick with some accent materials associated with them.

559
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:58,242
As we think about what materials may end up on the exterior of the building, we really need to keep in mind, first and foremost, that we're designing buildings that have a 50 to 75 year lifespan to them.

560
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:06,366
Right, so at that initial point, it's going to preclude the use of some more residential scale

561
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:11,011
products, we're not designing vinyl siding on school buildings.

562
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:17,992
We're not probably designing even wood siding, natural wood siding on school buildings, given sort of the upkeep that is associated with them.

563
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:22,933
So these are a collection of typical material.

564
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:28,874
Brick is certainly one of them, and it is found in the city, as we just showed, and the district, as we just showed.

565
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:33,895
And it's not to say that these are the full collection of materials that are out there.

566
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,675
We'd love to hear those other materials,

567
00:56:36,517 --> 00:56:42,083
um, that anyone has experience with or interest in that we can investigate and move forward to the process.

568
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:55,616
Um, but moving from sort of left to right is that natural materials in terms of, uh, stone, actual real stone, um, applied to a building, um, brick itself in terms of a clay fired process.

569
00:56:56,276 --> 00:56:58,298
Um, and that can take different forms.

570
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,041
Um, there can also be thin versions of those.

571
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:12,897
So there's different ways of putting up exterior materials on a building, whether they're laid in beds of mortar, which is sort of a more traditional approach, or sort of applied in more of a rain screen approach.

572
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:25,500
There's metal panel, which can take all sorts of different forms in terms of corrugations, in terms of the metals that are being used, in terms of the finish that is applied to those metals, but metal can't have that durability to them.

573
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:42,309
other types of rain screen panels, whether they're phenolic panels, and phenolic is like a fancy word for like a resin or plastic at the end of the day that's sort of modified for outdoor exposure and durability and longevity.

574
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:47,391
They can have different types of materials sort of inlaid into them.

575
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:52,614
So there's like wood book phenolic panels that exist out there that are used in rain screen systems.

576
00:57:53,895 --> 00:57:57,677
There's also porcelain panels, which again have sort of that clay base to them.

577
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:00,207
that can provide a lot of durability.

578
00:58:00,307 --> 00:58:04,650
They can have sort of shiny reflective finishes and glossy finishes or matte finishes.

579
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:06,512
There's a wide range there.

580
00:58:06,532 --> 00:58:09,954
And then there's terracotta panels as well.

581
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:13,277
And these are generally graded from left to right.

582
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:16,159
And we'll get into the next slide in terms of price point to them.

583
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:25,847
Cost is of course going to be a factor in terms of the selection of the materials, but it plugs into the overall set of criteria that we're going to be using, right?

584
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,161
Aesthetics play a role.

585
00:58:29,181 --> 00:58:39,405
Sustainability plays a role in terms of our selection of exterior materials, both in terms of how much energy it takes to actually fabricate these things and how many natural resources are consumed to do that.

586
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:50,208
It's a very complex selection process that we'll get into as we move forward in terms of what the exterior materials on the building will end up being.

587
00:58:50,308 --> 00:58:52,369
Again, these are just DOP materials.

588
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:55,030
We haven't even got into the topic of fenestration and

589
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:58,546
what are the things that we look through BATOV.

590
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:09,252
But sticking with those, penetration, which is again, fancy window, fancy word for window, essentially.

591
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:19,158
So maybe I'll try to just keep on the simpler side of the terminology, but architects, we like to like trend into all the fancy words that we know, and I'll try to check myself on that.

592
00:59:19,238 --> 00:59:21,160
Now young people feel alone in talking about technology.

593
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,400
It's similar, yes.

594
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:44,013
So I talked a little bit about sort of the cost spectrum in terms of materials, but also sort of the durability of materials that we go through in terms of how we can sort of plot where different materials fall on this range.

595
00:59:45,454 --> 00:59:52,175
So we have sort of durability is our range on the top left there, and then cost,

596
00:59:53,446 --> 01:00:05,834
running across the bottom, you can see that masonry or brick has that sort of interesting position of being extremely durable and having a lot of longevity to it and also being sort of on the lower price point.

597
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:15,140
And that is the very reason why you see brick on so many public buildings, because it does fit into a lot of sort of beneficial categories that way.

598
01:00:16,021 --> 01:00:17,482
There's a lot that we can do with brick.

599
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:22,505
There's a lot of creativity that has been really investigated over the course of

600
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:24,450
history with that.

601
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,772
So it is a material that can be considered as part of the exterior palette as we move forward.

602
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:38,555
But again, you get a sense from looking at this where some of those other materials fall in terms of that, that spectral graph that we've been looking at.

603
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:49,039
And the one in the upper right-hand corner is maybe a little bit more interesting in terms of building integrated photovoltaic panels or solar panels actually applied to the base of the building.

604
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,480
We don't see that too often.

605
01:00:51,265 --> 01:01:08,494
around in terms of public school buildings in Massachusetts are really too much within the country, because it is at the upper end of both the first cost investment of what goes in there, and then also in terms of durability, it is not going to last quite as long as an active technology than some of the other material.

606
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:11,315
You're saying the lower on the graph, the more durable?

607
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:12,776
Correct.

608
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:16,778
Yeah.

609
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:19,419
And then to the right-hand side, being more expensive.

610
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:26,545
And then just a sampling of exterior buildings, exteriors of buildings.

611
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:33,609
These are actually all SMMA projects, but just give you a sense of the range of materials that are out there as options.

612
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:50,197
Again, you see a lot of brick here, but there is some composition, juxtaposition of the brick, both with modern sort of aesthetics and approaches and juxtaposed with renovated portions of buildings, glass,

613
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:57,205
certainly to help both perforate the exterior of the building, right?

614
01:01:57,225 --> 01:02:02,007
An exterior of the building with no windows in it is not a nice building to be inside at all.

615
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:10,011
So we will sort of understand that mix and that composition between glazing and opaque wall assemblies.

616
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:20,035
And just some closer views of some, again, exteriors of SMA projects, just to give you a sense of

617
01:02:21,568 --> 01:02:24,350
some of the options and opportunities that are out there.

618
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:37,598
This first one is Waltham High School, a mix of granite base, a lot of brick, but then also accent panels of composite aluminum panels up above arranged green panels.

619
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:49,666
This is the Wakefield Memorial High School, which is currently under construction, so we don't have finished, but a similar palette here in terms of materials.

620
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:55,982
It's not that we're arriving at these similar pallets because we're trying to design every building in a similar manner.

621
01:02:56,082 --> 01:03:10,913
It's more sort of the conversations like this one that we're having now and that we'll have moving forward, both here and with the full building committee to sort of understand what is that right mix of external materials that we want to be using both to

622
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:15,800
talk to the character of what we're designing, but also sort of longevity of what we're designing.

623
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:24,443
And it's good to show that night view too, because it is a building that is used more than just the day.

624
01:03:24,643 --> 01:03:31,066
So it's always good to think about building throughout the life cycle of its day.

625
01:03:32,366 --> 01:03:35,708
How do you signal what spaces are welcoming?

626
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,929
And we talked about that beacon at the very beginning.

627
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:48,504
Not that you're trying to spill daylight out into the fells, but it will be larger spaces that are used at night.

628
01:03:49,804 --> 01:04:03,070
Yeah, I mean, designing with light is really, really an option that we have moving forward and available to us and something that we want to consider in terms of how we create a welcoming appearance at night, but also the opaque materials change at night, right?

629
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:06,892
It's really the inverse condition in terms of how you approach the building and where your focus is.

630
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:15,557
So it's something that we'll look at both during the day and the evening as we're studying renderings and things as we move forward.

631
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:23,884
The Somerville High School does have a large proportion of terracotta paneling on the exterior of it.

632
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:32,331
And that was really more due to the fact that we were building here in a historical context for the Carnegie Public Library that was immediately adjacent to the building.

633
01:04:32,976 --> 01:04:37,720
which had terracotta detailing that was connected and related to the brickwork.

634
01:04:38,421 --> 01:04:44,806
This is not that similar type of terracotta, but here we were connecting back to that, the concept of the materiality.

635
01:04:44,866 --> 01:04:52,352
And so it's a way of taking sort of that historical connection, reinterpreting it, providing sort of a modern aesthetic using a different kind of material.

636
01:04:52,372 --> 01:05:01,219
And this is a recently completed public charter school down in Roxbury, again,

637
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:18,473
Using traditional materials, and this is a lot of brick again, but it has sort of what's called an iron spot, which is sort of a metal that's actually cast in and gives off a reflection, sort of a purplish hue, and really plays with the light in interesting ways when brick hits it.

638
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:22,714
So again, just going to different ways of using more traditional materials.

639
01:05:23,034 --> 01:05:31,435
There's definitely options available to us, and this mixes in some metal panel that's both sort of an opaque color and a wood look color as well.

640
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:37,609
And this is the Concord Middle School, which also just recently completed.

641
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:44,133
Almost 100% of the exterior of this building is brick.

642
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:49,097
There's a little bit of concrete masonry unit as well that has a polished surface to it.

643
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:52,099
So different types of masonry can be used.

644
01:05:52,539 --> 01:06:01,586
And this actually had a lot of different sort of striations, layers of brick to add some texture and color to the exterior of the building.

645
01:06:04,892 --> 01:06:08,256
So we'll pause there.

646
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:09,697
Can I ask about the windows?

647
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:10,718
Sure.

648
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,442
Is that to prevent, like is that to provide shade?

649
01:06:16,163 --> 01:06:18,785
So the horizontal projections that you see coming up, yes.

650
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:20,687
Yeah, they're solar control devices.

651
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:29,916
So what they're trying to do and what they do do, especially when they're positioned on the southern facade, they work most effectively on the southern facade.

652
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:38,710
is they control the amount of sunlight and sun, solar energy that's coming into the building during the summer months, right?

653
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:53,321
And they're designed in a way so they have louvers, like little slats on them, so that during the winter, when the sun is lower, you actually do get that sun coming in to the windows and actually doing some passive heating of the space.

654
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:55,543
And in the summer, when the sun is higher,

655
01:06:56,231 --> 01:07:02,673
the lumbers and the depth of the shade is blocking out the sun's heat that's getting into the building.

656
01:07:02,713 --> 01:07:07,314
So they're part of an overall sort of passive design strategy that we ended up using.

657
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:19,698
So they're located on this building as well, but they're located in vertical arrangements primarily, except for where it was the science lab renovation added some of these horizontal sunshades as well.

658
01:07:20,138 --> 01:07:23,759
The vertical ones, they're more decorative.

659
01:07:24,047 --> 01:07:32,053
I would say generally they're more effective on like an Eastern and Western elevation, but they're not as effective as what we would do here.

660
01:07:32,153 --> 01:07:37,176
So they were definitely popular in terms of the aesthetics of the 70s when these buildings were designed.

661
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:47,484
But when we use them today, we really try to make sure that they're purposeful in terms of the orientation of the building and what they're actually going to be doing from a passive design perspective.

662
01:07:47,844 --> 01:07:52,007
In this particular photo in school, are those all operational windows or not?

663
01:07:52,926 --> 01:07:56,128
Each of the windows does have an operable vent to it.

664
01:07:56,148 --> 01:08:04,755
You can sort of see that little piece that's kicking out at an angle, opens up to allow for some convenient user control of the environment.

665
01:08:05,716 --> 01:08:10,159
But there's other portions of these windows that are solid and opaque and fixed.

666
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:22,168
But we do provide, and we will provide here moving forward, operable windows in every classroom just for give teachers control over that environment, getting fresh air if you want that option.

667
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:25,696
And it should be a lot quieter.

668
01:08:26,077 --> 01:08:28,977
So the, any new, it'll be triple green.

669
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:39,140
So right now you have a single pane, so that parent popping out your classroom window, it'll be a little quieter greenhouse.

670
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:51,943
Any other thoughts just about the types of materials, of appropriate other materials that maybe we didn't show examples of that there's interest in us exploring?

671
01:08:55,978 --> 01:09:03,042
probably a little bit harder to be abstract without a form and a building to look at.

672
01:09:03,623 --> 01:09:04,903
Brian's physically really interesting.

673
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:05,304
Yeah.

674
01:09:05,504 --> 01:09:07,485
Oh.

675
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:08,365
Brian?

676
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:09,966
On Zoom.

677
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:10,667
OK, thanks, Brian.

678
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:11,547
Hi, guys.

679
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:12,848
Hopefully you can hear me on Zoom.

680
01:09:13,508 --> 01:09:24,275
So what I like about the Concord School that you've got up right now, and particularly how well it sort of speaks back to the landscape that's right there,

681
01:09:25,168 --> 01:09:40,020
And a lot of that brickwork, masonry work, really reminds me of our site in some semblance, simply because we're dealing with a lot of rock, a lot of strata, a lot of the fells and that sort of back and forth speaking to each other.

682
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:50,729
So I'm just curious if there's a concept even based around perhaps literally the term strata for some of the sediment layers, things like that, whatever we find when we start digging into that site.

683
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:56,193
But I like that sort of, I guess, conversation back to nature.

684
01:09:56,793 --> 01:10:11,824
And perhaps we can pull some of the materials from the fells and some of those layered ideas, both horizontally and even, like, I love layers in architecture from nature to the interior.

685
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:18,469
And if we can get some of those layers involved, that might inform maybe how we use some of the materials that you guys had shown up on the screen earlier.

686
01:10:20,103 --> 01:10:21,543
It feels more wood-like on the top.

687
01:10:21,563 --> 01:10:30,846
I don't know if it's because of the lines that give me grain or the color tone and the proximity of the trees and everything.

688
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:33,566
It feels more natural than concrete.

689
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:35,627
But all brick.

690
01:10:35,707 --> 01:10:39,648
I mean, it's the buff color that ties into it.

691
01:10:40,648 --> 01:10:48,170
But it's a really rich area to explore and certainly something that we can look into as we move forward, those connections to nature and the fells, which is so

692
01:10:48,757 --> 01:10:50,798
So predominant on the site for sure.

693
01:10:51,258 --> 01:10:51,698
Yeah.

694
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:57,779
But I was just going to say, I mean, it's still, you know, it's still masonry, but somebody just mentioned it.

695
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:04,061
I mean, even the way you've strided that masonry could talk to like a tree ring or something like that.

696
01:11:04,081 --> 01:11:06,542
You know, it's, it's, you can see it in there somehow.

697
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:11,983
It's, it's not much of a stretch to connect with still those, that same palette that you guys showed earlier.

698
01:11:15,044 --> 01:11:17,825
Now is that, that road is not passable.

699
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:21,432
No, that's an outdoor set of outdoor classrooms that are down there.

700
01:11:21,452 --> 01:11:23,353
So it's pedestrian access as it runs around.

701
01:11:23,373 --> 01:11:28,456
So they didn't in this building have a certain ability to start to navigate the outside of the building?

702
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:29,077
They did not.

703
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:30,978
So there's a conversation with the fire department.

704
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,359
We haven't had that conversation with the fire department here.

705
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,800
We will be having it very soon.

706
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:39,203
There was this significant gray drop off here around the back of the building as well.

707
01:11:39,243 --> 01:11:40,364
So that contributed to it.

708
01:11:40,424 --> 01:11:42,766
It wasn't a place that you would want to take a fire truck.

709
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:45,767
So they'll acknowledge that and work with us.

710
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:48,498
It can be done this way.

711
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:49,138
It's true.

712
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:52,480
I'm going to keep us moving forward.

713
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,301
I don't want to shortchange Sarah too much on the timing here.

714
01:11:56,401 --> 01:12:02,843
But Sarah, I think I'm going to give you about 10 minutes for each of these, the last two short chapters that we have.

715
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:03,763
Sure.

716
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:05,884
Yeah, no, I'll go through it as quickly as I can.

717
01:12:05,964 --> 01:12:09,465
But feel free to interrupt me, because again, as we've

718
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:15,377
been talking about a lot of this is, uh, you know, reflecting what we've heard, and we want everybody's feedback.

719
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,620
So just stop me if I'm, uh, freezing too quickly.

720
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:29,630
So, uh, first and foremost, I just wanted to kind of introduce, um, a few key elements of interior design, um, that we'll be talking about today and in the future.

721
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:33,033
It's, uh, definitely not an exhaustive list, but

722
01:12:33,988 --> 01:12:43,752
These are all elements that really work together and are related and add different layers to the space.

723
01:12:43,912 --> 01:12:55,336
So again, space is three-dimensional, it's creating our flow, and really this is tied so closely to our educational plan and all of the visioning meetings that we've been having.

724
01:12:56,816 --> 01:13:02,258
Color, obviously, it's more than just aesthetics.

725
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:10,686
it really does impact, you know, school identity, wayfinding, it can support accessibility goals.

726
01:13:10,946 --> 01:13:24,432
So, you know, looking at contrast and things like that, how it can impact mood, all of that color theory is something that we'll be exploring as we, you know, move forward in design.

727
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:27,132
and very closely related to that is lighting.

728
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:43,438
We've talked a lot today about natural light and daylight, but obviously once you move into the building and we do flood it with as much natural daylight as possible, but artificial light is also something that's going to be studied and considered.

729
01:13:43,478 --> 01:13:53,102
We want to make sure that we're providing the appropriate illumination for all of the activities happening, but it also does have a big impact on color.

730
01:13:55,323 --> 01:13:56,664
and impacts mood.

731
01:13:57,664 --> 01:14:04,948
The other two I wanted to touch on really quickly are often overlooked, but a layer that can really make an impact is texture and pattern.

732
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:13,193
And this can, texture can either be physical touch, or it can be something that you perceive visually.

733
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:21,117
And pattern can both just be, you know, a repetition of lines, but it's also a rhythm that you can feel within the space.

734
01:14:21,277 --> 01:14:22,598
And so that's something that we're gonna

735
01:14:23,608 --> 01:14:30,131
look at as we move into the next slide and we look at some of the goals that we're looking to to explore.

736
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:39,556
So you know shifting into to what we think we heard in the first meeting and again we've talked a lot about this today.

737
01:14:40,657 --> 01:14:47,240
These are high level goals but really are going to help guide our design process particularly in the interior.

738
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,162
So you know wanting to make sure this aligns with the goals of this group.

739
01:14:52,563 --> 01:14:52,723
So

740
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:58,642
Moving into the interior materials, we heard you that they're going to be purposeful, durable, and value-driven.

741
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:04,725
And obviously, they'll all be evaluated for maintenance and are sustainable goals.

742
01:15:06,546 --> 01:15:20,933
Also, we've talked a lot about the importance of the connection to the exterior, both the glazing, creating a visual and physical connection, but the design palette and overall design goals for the exterior.

743
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:23,573
definitely trickle into the interior as well.

744
01:15:23,593 --> 01:15:38,465
And we wanna design something that encourages movement, engagement, student autonomy was something that was brought up in the last meeting and really providing materials and patterns that can support that.

745
01:15:39,526 --> 01:15:50,235
And then again, we really wanna root this in a timeless neutral palette and be very intentional about the different accent colors and lighting features and things like that.

746
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:52,924
to build upon that neutral palette.

747
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:57,687
So just a quick check-in that this kind of aligns with everybody.

748
01:15:57,707 --> 01:15:58,348
Yes.

749
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:13,419
One thing, just for some interior materials, like sitting in this room here, I know this is a specifically no-wax floor, but it looks, almost strikes me as feeling dirty.

750
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:16,061
It doesn't, and it hasn't held up well.

751
01:16:16,141 --> 01:16:18,963
I know hopefully newer materials that are low maintenance will

752
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:21,474
book better longer kind of thing.

753
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:22,815
Does that make sense?

754
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:24,135
It does.

755
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:25,696
It does.

756
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:25,976
Yeah.

757
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:33,881
And we'll talk a little bit more about some specific materials and how we can really achieve these goals, even in like the next couple of slides.

758
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:36,542
So, but all of that feedback is excellent.

759
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:38,203
So yeah.

760
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:44,066
So basically in order to reach those goals, we do kind of reference back to some basic interior design principles.

761
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:47,708
And what I've put together here is also a couple of precedent images of

762
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,062
recent SMMA projects.

763
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:55,067
Just as examples, you know, there's a lot of different elements here.

764
01:16:55,187 --> 01:16:59,432
So, again, feel free to jump in if any of these speak to you or don't.

765
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:03,219
One of the things that we talked about was the connections to nature.

766
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:09,544
And so I've got a photo here of our rooftop terrace at Waltham High School.

767
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:17,551
And so this is something where, again, it can be glazing and views that create that connection to nature, but it can also be a direct physical connection.

768
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:20,033
So that's something that we can explore moving forward.

769
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:24,660
Another image here is comfort, comfort and well-being focused.

770
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:34,425
So, you know, this isn't just about lighting and thermal comfort or healthy materials, but it can also be tied directly to the educational plan.

771
01:17:35,305 --> 01:17:40,728
So an example here is a health assisting program at Waltham High School.

772
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:50,613
So obviously, you know, lighting, healthy materials, all of that was a part of it, but it can really drive into the educational programming as well.

773
01:17:52,194 --> 01:17:53,295
celebrating diversity.

774
01:17:53,895 --> 01:17:59,338
There are so many different ways that you can do this and obviously we'll fine tune this so that way it's Medford specific.

775
01:18:00,298 --> 01:18:15,586
What we're showing here is again Waltham High School and this tile mosaic is a direct result of student surveys and they wanted to showcase fabric patterns from the various sculptures that were represented by the student body.

776
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:24,081
And so that was a way that we were able to celebrate diversity in a physical representation in that school.

777
01:18:25,362 --> 01:18:29,244
And then showing also adaptable and flexible spaces.

778
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:31,605
We've talked about that today.

779
01:18:31,645 --> 01:18:33,346
You know, again, this can mean many things.

780
01:18:34,066 --> 01:18:39,689
What I'm showing here is an example of a new educational program to Waltham High School.

781
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:41,490
This is their environmental science

782
01:18:42,287 --> 01:18:42,687
lab.

783
01:18:43,587 --> 01:18:47,908
And here, really, it was about providing them flexibility as the program grew.

784
01:18:48,108 --> 01:18:52,849
So, you know, durable materials, but flexible space as well.

785
01:18:52,949 --> 01:19:06,632
So we're seeing the lab space with power cord reels from the ceiling, so that way you can move the furniture around, access right next to it with a classroom, also access to the green roof right outside.

786
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:09,353
So taking all of that into consideration.

787
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:16,141
And then on this slide, a couple more precedent images here.

788
01:19:16,321 --> 01:19:19,962
We've talked about honoring history, but also embracing the future.

789
01:19:21,183 --> 01:19:23,964
So again, many ways that this could be done.

790
01:19:24,064 --> 01:19:27,545
It could be done with graphics, which we'll talk about a little bit.

791
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:34,408
It could be done with salvaged items from the existing site or historical artifacts that are important to Medford.

792
01:19:35,488 --> 01:19:36,889
So many opportunities there.

793
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:40,330
Intuitive wayfinding and placemaking.

794
01:19:42,412 --> 01:19:46,414
This is definitely, especially for a large school, really critical.

795
01:19:47,534 --> 01:20:02,241
Good space planning is important, but we want to make it as easy as possible to know where you're at in the building and also get to your next destination, get from point A to point B. Equitable and universal design.

796
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:05,503
Code compliant accessibility is obviously a given.

797
01:20:06,662 --> 01:20:12,946
Um, but we also can consider thoughtful ways to make the building, um, as friendly as possible to everyone.

798
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:17,488
Uh, this can be done, uh, in a lot of different ways we're showing here.

799
01:20:17,808 --> 01:20:19,609
Um, one way that's also you're.

800
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:24,432
You're showcasing where you're at, but it's also, um, can be educational.

801
01:20:24,532 --> 01:20:32,136
So we're showing the arts and both, uh, enlarged Braille as well, um, as ASL, um,

802
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:41,718
Access to daylight, obviously critical as we move forward with our space planning, particularly for art spaces or visual arts.

803
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:46,120
And really, it all boils down to things being durable and timeless.

804
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:50,181
So, you know, again, avoiding training materials and products.

805
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:54,423
And, you know, we can talk a little bit more about the interior materials on the next slides.

806
01:20:56,463 --> 01:21:01,185
Yeah, and Sarah, I'm going to actually say that we're going to pause just a second here.

807
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:05,405
Just to take a second and talk through any of those topics.

808
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:09,668
Yeah, we're, we're going to run out of time here.

809
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:10,709
I think pretty quickly.

810
01:21:10,749 --> 01:21:15,753
I want to make sure we can talk to environmental graphics quickly as well.

811
01:21:17,935 --> 01:21:27,041
Thoughts though, maybe about what we've shown here in terms of some of these interior material guiding principles.

812
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:29,303
I really liked the health assistant.

813
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:35,024
It's just that that flooring really kind of like guides you, but what the separate areas are.

814
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:37,967
Yeah.

815
01:21:37,987 --> 01:21:39,808
Again, subtle wayfinding, right.

816
01:21:40,008 --> 01:21:47,155
And just kind of really diving into the, you know, how much that, that, that pattern can help with the flow of the space.

817
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:54,721
Um, and yeah, I mean, it's a wonderful program and really the space just is kind of the cherry on top to that.

818
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:55,602
Yeah.

819
01:21:58,908 --> 01:22:07,472
Well, I just wanted to say sort of jumping off what you said at the beginning about doing more with less and not having anything decorative without purpose.

820
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:14,115
So I'm looking at some of these slides and the celebrating diversity is absolutely beautiful.

821
01:22:14,456 --> 01:22:18,938
And there was one on the next page, the hallway in the top left.

822
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:27,202
They're beautiful, but I'm thinking of students with visual impairments in particular, and with a lot of different colors and a lot of different

823
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:35,313
patterns, so forth, coming in and feeling sensory overload from just a visual perspective.

824
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:36,713
And so I'm just being mindful.

825
01:22:36,753 --> 01:22:40,714
And then going back to the slide again, the one, the celebrating diversity.

826
01:22:41,074 --> 01:22:46,335
I'm looking at those colors and they're gorgeous, but I'm also looking at those white tables and how they blended with the floor.

827
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,376
And you're distracted by all the color above you.

828
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:57,158
That's sort of the perspective I'm coming from in terms of making it accessible.

829
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:10,136
Um, that's, that's, you know, sort of, and it ties in with the weight mining and the, and the, the same with the floor, you know, making it sort of intuitive.

830
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:15,638
So that's one thing that jumped out at me, um, kind of keeping that in mind.

831
01:23:17,139 --> 01:23:17,519
For sure.

832
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,680
No, that's great feedback.

833
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:21,121
And definitely, I think finding that balance, right.

834
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:25,503
Of, um, you know, making things.

835
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:28,021
comfortable for everybody, right?

836
01:23:28,381 --> 01:23:39,964
And to your point, being intentional about where the accent colors are, what the contrast is, and actually making sure that we are achieving that goal.

837
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:51,726
Sometimes it's also about how you shape a large space, that there's nooks and little spaces, so you're not in the middle of it all.

838
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:54,867
I know at my daughter's school, when I first walked in there,

839
01:23:57,019 --> 01:24:00,781
exactly what you said, it had like, it's a 90s school set, like a checkered board.

840
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:07,646
Very overwhelming pattern.

841
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:24,497
It's just like a space that is all visual, like energy everywhere, you know, so it's like trying to sculpt spaces in a way that are proportioned well, lit well, and have the interior palette that supports

842
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,883
that it's a pleasant and navigable space.

843
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:31,763
Right.

844
01:24:33,304 --> 01:24:34,025
All right.

845
01:24:34,045 --> 01:24:37,187
Yeah, we can skip the environmental graphics if you'd like, Matt.

846
01:24:37,627 --> 01:24:38,988
And we can come back to it.

847
01:24:39,028 --> 01:24:49,014
I'm just going to let people know that we're skipping over something that is still very important in terms of healthy materials, red list avoidance of materials.

848
01:24:49,855 --> 01:24:54,718
We are going to get into a little bit in the next advisory team meeting if you want to stay for that.

849
01:24:55,396 --> 01:24:58,537
It gets back to this topic that we're not talking in silos here.

850
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:00,678
We're overlapping consideration of materials.

851
01:25:01,798 --> 01:25:07,640
I did want to talk really quickly about experiential graphic design though, Sarah.

852
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:14,722
So if you want to try to get through this material pretty quickly, I'll give us a couple minutes at the end just to wrap up.

853
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:16,463
Yeah, no, I will give the quickest overview.

854
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:23,165
So basically experiential graphics or XGD is all about bringing visual graphic elements into the space.

855
01:25:23,872 --> 01:25:29,695
And it goes really hand in hand with the rest of the building design and can exist in a variety of formats.

856
01:25:31,056 --> 01:25:37,540
And really the three major questions that we look at all kind of stem from the audiences, right?

857
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,021
So there's three major audiences for a school.

858
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,362
It's the students, it's the staff and the community.

859
01:25:42,382 --> 01:25:48,846
And all of that ties back to, you know, what is the content?

860
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:49,866
Where is it going?

861
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:50,907
You know, can we hide

862
01:25:51,415 --> 01:25:54,117
Can we tie content into the programming?

863
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:57,820
Is it located near the gym versus a classroom?

864
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,743
And then what does it look like?

865
01:26:02,164 --> 01:26:05,367
It also includes what is it made out of and how is it maintained?

866
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:17,735
And then for goals, again, this is something that we've worked with each school for unique project specific goals, but these are ones that we try to achieve in every environment.

867
01:26:18,236 --> 01:26:26,060
And it's really about connecting those three audiences, the students, the staff, and the community to the space through a cohesive system.

868
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:32,503
And again, responding to the other design elements, interior, architectural, and the site.

869
01:26:33,615 --> 01:26:45,426
And then creating different strategies, again, to encourage educational opportunities, not just inside the classroom, using the building as a teaching tool.

870
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:56,736
And then, you know, first, a critical element is obviously providing clear and functional wayfinding and really cementing those important places throughout the school.

871
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:03,035
And again, these are just some visuals from some recent projects.

872
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:08,437
So a few examples here about connecting the individuals to the space.

873
01:27:09,277 --> 01:27:12,659
And we can just kind of flip through these very quickly, Matt, if you'd like.

874
01:27:13,939 --> 01:27:16,460
Again, responsive graphic design.

875
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,182
So a lot of these are that image for Wakefield.

876
01:27:20,222 --> 01:27:21,722
Those are acoustic wall panels.

877
01:27:22,763 --> 01:27:26,584
So again, it's providing graphics, but at the same time,

878
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,542
helping with the acoustics of the media center.

879
01:27:33,025 --> 01:27:36,328
Let's see, the next slide we can talk about.

880
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:42,514
So these are some great examples of creating educational opportunities, again, based on some context.

881
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:51,624
So, you know, we have a graphic in the architectural drafting hallway of Somerville that really highlights the entire

882
01:27:52,563 --> 01:28:08,431
plan of the space, and then we've got informational signage for those tile murals that we were talking about to explain what are you really looking at, what are the parts and the pieces, as well as some lead signage as well, just to better understand what the building system is actually doing.

883
01:28:11,273 --> 01:28:13,934
And then some examples of wayfinding and placemaking.

884
01:28:14,054 --> 01:28:17,076
So from stairwells, knowing which level you're on,

885
01:28:17,929 --> 01:28:26,217
the building entrance, site signage, even just welcoming in to the main office, all of those things can be part of XGD.

886
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:32,323
And this is just a quick example of, again, we're looking at everything as a suite.

887
01:28:33,284 --> 01:28:34,765
So everything works together.

888
01:28:34,906 --> 01:28:38,169
It's all cohesive and has a similar language.

889
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,932
And the last slide is basically just a quick

890
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:58,757
process that is really where once there is a building and we start to get a little bit further into design in the next phase, you know, we'll start with surveys to really help inform those project goals and develop the concept and the content.

891
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:11,663
And this will really be one of maybe like a splinter group that comes out of this and will probably work to try to find some student voice to pull into this because that's it's really critical to making

892
01:29:12,718 --> 01:29:16,339
sort of any experiential graphic connected to the school community.

893
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,140
I think we've heard that in a variety of ways already.

894
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:28,903
And Suzanne mentioned at the beginning that the student input is just critical and it's been very insightful to date wherever we've been able to make those connections.

895
01:29:29,763 --> 01:29:41,086
The other thing I'll just add on to the end of Sarah's piece here is the fact that there's actually a lot of experiential graphic activity and that's already in the building today.

896
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:53,604
Particularly the CTE programs have been very prolific in terms of generating some amazing things that are on the walls, either outside their shop spaces or inside their shop spaces.

897
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:56,525
And what we want to do is try to amplify that, right?

898
01:29:56,945 --> 01:30:03,627
There's some great ideas that we've heard also about things that have been done in the past that we can bring back, new things that we can do moving forward.

899
01:30:04,455 --> 01:30:18,347
So this will be definitely a comprehensive lens that we'll use for the entirety of the school, not just sort of one particular area of the student body that we're talking to and thinking and working with.

900
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:23,931
So we are pretty much at the end of our time.

901
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:31,237
So I want to take a quick second to go through the next steps in terms of what's coming, including confirmation that

902
01:30:32,114 --> 01:30:39,096
We're going to come back together on March 10th in terms of having a subsequent discussion.

903
01:30:39,836 --> 01:30:40,376
That will be at 530.

904
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:49,718
We're going to be doing it again as this remote hybrid setup, probably in this room, but we'll confirm that when we get a little bit closer in terms of the timing.

905
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:59,500
The organization of what we'll be doing at that third meeting is that we'll actually be looking at something a lot less interesting than sort of slides with graphics on them.

906
01:31:00,005 --> 01:31:01,326
We're going to be going through a spreadsheet.

907
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:15,739
I know that sounds exciting, which has essentially all of the topics that have come out of both the initial session and sort of the dialogue that we've had here as recommendations back to the full building committee.

908
01:31:15,779 --> 01:31:18,121
And we're going to categorize those into three different groups.

909
01:31:18,962 --> 01:31:24,927
We're going to have some given items and we're going to do sort of a traffic signal analogy on this.

910
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:26,969
So the givens are going to be green light items.

911
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:33,857
We won't need to talk about them at the next meeting, but we'll run through the list to just confirm that they are there as recommendations going back.

912
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:41,219
There's going to be some flashing yellow items as well that we're going to have some discussion about in this meeting when we get together again.

913
01:31:41,239 --> 01:31:52,541
And we'll just see where those sort of, they're not pain points or friction points, but things that really there's different perspectives that we want to talk to and make sure that we have a consensus agreement on.

914
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:56,382
And then we may also have some red light items, items that

915
01:31:57,123 --> 01:32:00,085
We're not going to be pushing forward as recommendations.

916
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:04,249
So that's what we can look forward to as we move forward into the next meeting.

917
01:32:04,789 --> 01:32:09,052
But definitely thank everybody for their time, those that are in person, those that are remote.

918
01:32:09,813 --> 01:32:12,815
We know that everyone's time is valuable, especially on the evenings.

919
01:32:13,275 --> 01:32:15,978
So appreciate any way that you've been able to join us.

920
01:32:17,038 --> 01:32:17,379
Thank you.

921
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,301
Thank you.

922
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:23,443
We have some folks in for the next advisory team meeting.

923
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:24,324
So there is no rest.

924
01:32:25,419 --> 01:32:27,826
for us that are multiple.

925
01:32:27,867 --> 01:32:28,147
Thank you.

926
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:03,836
systems and sustainability advisory team will probably take about five minutes.

927
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:09,084
We'll let other people filter in and we're going to get everything set up and then we'll get going right at about 535.

928
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:02,958
You're on.

929
01:38:03,338 --> 01:38:03,759
All righty.

930
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:15,103
For everybody online and everyone in the room, we're going to get going here with our meeting number two for our Sustainability and MEP Systems Advisory Team meeting.

931
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:23,347
The agenda for today, we're going to do a quick set of introductions again just to remind you who we are and who's speaking.

932
01:38:23,427 --> 01:38:31,550
I know we were all remote last time, so being in person, maybe it'll be limited to who we are this time around.

933
01:38:33,334 --> 01:38:56,028
If there was anyone that is part of the team that was identified as part of the team but wasn't able to make the first meeting, I do want to give just a couple of minutes to anyone that's in that category to introduce yourself, your connection to the project, and your priorities and goals, similar to what we did with the entire group at the first meeting, just because we want to make sure that we have the ability to hear from everybody.

934
01:38:57,097 --> 01:39:05,341
So after we get through that sort of introductory piece, we're going to break the discussion down into a series of chapters of the discussion.

935
01:39:06,022 --> 01:39:10,684
And each chapter will really involve a little bit of presentation of material.

936
01:39:10,764 --> 01:39:16,066
We're essentially going to be reflecting back what we heard the first time around during the first conversation.

937
01:39:16,887 --> 01:39:22,610
And we tried to group similar types of comments or thoughts into these chapters.

938
01:39:23,682 --> 01:39:27,163
We won't be talking to you for 45 minutes and then we wait and have a conversation.

939
01:39:27,203 --> 01:39:28,583
We're just going to go piece by piece.

940
01:39:29,403 --> 01:39:33,544
If we get to the point where we're at our time limit, I'll just have to move us along.

941
01:39:34,465 --> 01:39:37,365
So I'll apologize in advance if I need to cut anybody off.

942
01:39:38,046 --> 01:39:40,546
But that'll be generally the content of the second meeting.

943
01:39:40,966 --> 01:39:43,227
Then we'll talk about next steps as we get to the end.

944
01:39:43,287 --> 01:39:47,668
If you were here at the tail end of the last meeting, you've had like a little bit of a spoiler.

945
01:39:48,108 --> 01:39:51,809
It's very similar in terms of what we're going to be doing for each of the groups.

946
01:39:53,413 --> 01:39:55,433
So real just quick on the introduction side.

947
01:39:55,873 --> 01:39:56,894
My name is Matt Rice.

948
01:39:57,214 --> 01:39:59,094
I'm an architect with SMMA.

949
01:40:00,214 --> 01:40:02,195
Helen, I know, is online with us.

950
01:40:03,675 --> 01:40:03,915
Yep.

951
01:40:04,295 --> 01:40:05,335
Good evening, everyone.

952
01:40:05,395 --> 01:40:07,596
Helen Fantini, project manager with SMMA.

953
01:40:09,516 --> 01:40:11,676
I think Soala is with us as well online.

954
01:40:11,696 --> 01:40:13,117
Hi, everyone.

955
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:14,077
Good to see you all.

956
01:40:14,257 --> 01:40:16,937
This is Soala Janka, architectural designer at SMMA.

957
01:40:16,957 --> 01:40:18,778
All right.

958
01:40:18,858 --> 01:40:20,198
I think we have folks in the room.

959
01:40:21,662 --> 01:40:25,185
I'm Martine Dionne, I'm the Sustainable Design Director at SMMA.

960
01:40:25,205 --> 01:40:29,388
Hi, I'm Emily Ehlers, I'm a Mechanical Engineer at SMMA.

961
01:40:30,229 --> 01:40:32,350
I'm Andrew Barrows, I'm an Electrical Engineer at SMMA.

962
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:36,674
I'm Luke Reiser, I'm a member of the Enterprise School.

963
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:40,517
Sorry, we're just going to keep going through the design team folks.

964
01:40:40,537 --> 01:40:42,258
I don't mean to cut you off.

965
01:40:42,358 --> 01:40:42,999
No, that's fine.

966
01:40:43,019 --> 01:40:43,960
Brenda, you're online too?

967
01:40:49,556 --> 01:40:52,518
Yes, hello everyone from the Land Sustainable Design team member.

968
01:40:53,919 --> 01:40:56,921
Okay, I don't think Tomaso is online with us.

969
01:40:57,342 --> 01:40:58,182
Is James online?

970
01:40:58,783 --> 01:41:02,645
Yes, James Job, Agile Engineering, Plumbing and Fire Protection.

971
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:10,371
Okay, it's not that I don't want everyone to introduce yourselves again, I just want to try to conserve as much time as possible.

972
01:41:11,332 --> 01:41:13,173
This is everyone on the Medford team.

973
01:41:15,007 --> 01:41:22,930
Again, is there anyone that was not with us for the first meeting that didn't get a chance to introduce themselves and sort of their goals online or in the room?

974
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:24,671
Libby, do you want to go ahead?

975
01:41:25,431 --> 01:41:26,591
Hi, I'm Libby Brown.

976
01:41:26,671 --> 01:41:27,972
I'm an architect and parent.

977
01:41:28,012 --> 01:41:29,212
I'm on the School Building Committee.

978
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:32,814
And I saw the list of goals that were summarized last time.

979
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:33,594
They look great.

980
01:41:33,674 --> 01:41:35,214
I don't really have anything specific to add.

981
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:36,555
But I also had James.

982
01:41:36,575 --> 01:41:39,396
He was my engineer, UMass Law only.

983
01:41:39,416 --> 01:41:39,956
So hi, James.

984
01:41:39,976 --> 01:41:41,997
Nice to see you again.

985
01:41:42,017 --> 01:41:43,437
Hi, how are you?

986
01:41:45,902 --> 01:41:47,143
Hi, Sarah Michaelman.

987
01:41:47,163 --> 01:41:47,804
I'm online.

988
01:41:47,844 --> 01:41:50,106
I'm sorry I can't be there with you in person.

989
01:41:50,386 --> 01:41:52,428
I unfortunately missed the last meeting.

990
01:41:52,448 --> 01:41:54,449
So I'm a community member.

991
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:58,172
I've lived in Medford for 22 years.

992
01:41:58,553 --> 01:42:03,397
My daughter went all the way through the Medford school system starting in kindergarten.

993
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:06,379
She's long out of the system now.

994
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,621
My son is about to graduate from the high school.

995
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:12,152
And I agree with Libby.

996
01:42:12,232 --> 01:42:16,035
I did watch the video of the last meeting.

997
01:42:16,055 --> 01:42:19,698
You guys covered a lot of ground in terms of goals for the project.

998
01:42:19,999 --> 01:42:21,400
I agree with all of them.

999
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:25,023
Oh, so my background and why I'm here.

1000
01:42:25,043 --> 01:42:27,605
I am a sustainable design consultant by trade.

1001
01:42:27,845 --> 01:42:29,567
I work with a firm out in West Concord.

1002
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:37,286
and have worked on a lot of MSBA school projects over the years as a consultant working with the architects.

1003
01:42:38,207 --> 01:42:53,501
Just one thing I do want to add is I'd love to see this building be resilient and potentially a community resource should there be any catastrophic events where people need shelter, vaccines, water or food, that it could be

1004
01:42:55,662 --> 01:43:08,390
a resource for that and along those same lines have that kind of passive survivability and be able to maintain comfortable temperatures and things should there be an electrical outage, et cetera, if it's used as a shelter.

1005
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:10,492
One thing I wanted to add.

1006
01:43:11,712 --> 01:43:12,553
Thank you so much.

1007
01:43:12,613 --> 01:43:13,253
That is great.

1008
01:43:13,273 --> 01:43:23,940
And I realize that we had not gotten into that whole notion of shelter usage and shelter designation is something that we need to, something that we'll have connected conversations with the first responders as well.

1009
01:43:24,353 --> 01:43:28,836
in terms of understanding sort of what the city's perspective is from those departments.

1010
01:43:29,737 --> 01:43:33,800
But we can definitely wrap in what that means from a resiliency standpoint as well.

1011
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,780
So I appreciate that.

1012
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:37,923
Thank you.

1013
01:43:37,963 --> 01:43:47,970
Just really quick on our schedule again, we are still... Emily's doing some extra recording for us.

1014
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,931
Sorry, I thought I found it.

1015
01:43:56,589 --> 01:44:01,013
Fall 2030 is our target school opening date at the moment.

1016
01:44:02,014 --> 01:44:04,276
We are very much not quite there yet.

1017
01:44:04,576 --> 01:44:07,799
We're at the beginning of this feasibility study process where we are right now.

1018
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,342
We do have these touch points of advisory team meetings.

1019
01:44:12,263 --> 01:44:16,787
This second one that we're going to have is the last one in the first part of the feasibility study.

1020
01:44:16,807 --> 01:44:19,570
And we're just getting into sort of the semantics of the MSBA process.

1021
01:44:20,689 --> 01:44:27,534
Understand that we're going to get together two more times after this as an advisory team with each category that we're looking at.

1022
01:44:28,314 --> 01:44:32,717
And again, the fact that this is not an isolated conversation, it's not a silo conversation.

1023
01:44:33,338 --> 01:44:38,762
We do have these four different teams that are meeting to talk on these particular topics.

1024
01:44:39,582 --> 01:44:45,086
There are overlaps that's inherent and intended and beneficial to the process as we go through.

1025
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:53,723
But at the end of the day, from these advisory teams, there will be a series of recommendations that we're going to be sharing back to the full building committee.

1026
01:44:55,024 --> 01:45:09,133
They will have the ability to accept or not accept those recommendations, but this is the process in terms of collecting expertise and input really from experts within the community on these particular topics.

1027
01:45:11,726 --> 01:45:16,989
very quick refresher on the objective, the topic of what we're going to be talking through.

1028
01:45:17,049 --> 01:45:22,271
But I think this one is very self-explanatory in terms of the title of the advisory team.

1029
01:45:23,552 --> 01:45:25,893
And then we're going to jump right into topics and priorities.

1030
01:45:25,913 --> 01:45:31,976
I'm going to hand it over here to Martina to start off.

1031
01:45:32,956 --> 01:45:35,858
So we're going to browse through

1032
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:40,081
Some of these, we've got it all there, but I'm not going to name them one by one.

1033
01:45:40,481 --> 01:45:48,302
But the last meeting we went through the givens, you know, the specialized code, the MSBA requirements, etc.

1034
01:45:48,822 --> 01:45:56,344
And then the Medford, some of the Medford sustainability policy and guidelines.

1035
01:45:58,004 --> 01:46:04,005
And then we got a good amount of your great feedback and discussion points.

1036
01:46:05,547 --> 01:46:06,207
at that meeting.

1037
01:46:06,247 --> 01:46:08,368
And what we did, we organized them.

1038
01:46:08,868 --> 01:46:15,890
There was one particular comment about understanding what LEAD is and giving a LEAD overview.

1039
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:19,811
So we'll do that briefly, and we'll have a bit of a discussion around that.

1040
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:32,875
This is not to go through the whole LEAD set of criteria, but you will see that throughout the topics we're going to go through, some of those are going to fall within the

1041
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,821
within the following discussions.

1042
01:46:37,341 --> 01:46:43,142
Climate resiliency, so we sort of bundled in there, obviously energy efficiency.

1043
01:46:43,343 --> 01:46:46,424
We're going to talk about mechanical, electrical, plumbing systems.

1044
01:46:47,224 --> 01:46:52,165
Operations and maintenance was something that was near and dear to some of you.

1045
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:56,447
We're going to brush a bit on passive design strategies.

1046
01:46:56,587 --> 01:47:02,589
And Sarah, thank you for bringing that up because that's something that's going to be part of the project in terms of resiliency.

1047
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:07,868
And then renewable energy, EV charging.

1048
01:47:08,028 --> 01:47:11,331
There was another set of comments around embodied carbon.

1049
01:47:11,351 --> 01:47:14,973
So we're going to talk, we're going to spend a bit of time talking about this today.

1050
01:47:16,574 --> 01:47:20,997
Healthfulness, environmental quality and literacy, and environmental literacy.

1051
01:47:22,378 --> 01:47:31,565
That was sort of bundled, sort of the ventilation, daylight, and everything that has to do with connectivity to nature and sustainable sites.

1052
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:35,593
And then there were some comments about cost effectiveness.

1053
01:47:35,633 --> 01:47:46,661
So we wanted to make sure that we're going to give you an overview of some of the life cycle cost analysis that we're going to be providing in schematic design.

1054
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:51,044
And it's required by MSBA, but we're going to give you some example of what it entails.

1055
01:47:52,425 --> 01:47:55,127
This particular topic is fraught with acronyms.

1056
01:47:55,527 --> 01:47:59,270
So LCCA down there at the bottom is life cycle cost analysis.

1057
01:48:00,008 --> 01:48:06,330
We'll try to make sure that we explain those as we go through for folks listening in now or after.

1058
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:07,111
Right.

1059
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:11,932
So LEED, just to respond a bit to a comment from the last time.

1060
01:48:11,992 --> 01:48:16,514
Leadership on Energy and Environmental Design is what this acronym stands for.

1061
01:48:16,554 --> 01:48:21,136
It's a green building standard that was developed in the mid to late 1990s.

1062
01:48:21,756 --> 01:48:24,557
And it was fully launched commercially in the early 2000.

1063
01:48:25,337 --> 01:48:27,398
MSBA adopted it in the late 2000.

1064
01:48:28,562 --> 01:48:34,305
as a requirement for designing schools in Massachusetts and getting reimbursement for MSBA.

1065
01:48:35,066 --> 01:48:39,388
The green building certification system is in its fifth version.

1066
01:48:39,428 --> 01:48:46,012
So your building will be registered under V5, which is a bit of an overhaul over the previous version.

1067
01:48:46,112 --> 01:48:47,052
We're not going to go into that.

1068
01:48:47,653 --> 01:48:55,697
But basically the way this comprehensive green building certification is set is into these categories that you see there.

1069
01:48:56,797 --> 01:49:01,099
And many of your comments from last meeting sort of fall into the criteria.

1070
01:49:01,579 --> 01:49:04,240
Each of these categories have a set of criteria.

1071
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:08,501
And MSBA requires a minimum of silver certification.

1072
01:49:08,561 --> 01:49:16,344
So we're going to have to apply all the prerequisites and a good amount of the criteria from each of these categories.

1073
01:49:17,105 --> 01:49:26,108
As we go through and talk about the different topics tonight, we're going to highlight which of those are already included in the LEED certification that you will have

1074
01:49:26,645 --> 01:49:29,467
the product has to pursue.

1075
01:49:29,887 --> 01:49:37,773
Version 5 has sort of rebalanced a bit the sort of the weighing of the criteria within the system.

1076
01:49:38,653 --> 01:49:48,640
They put, obviously you can see there, decarbonization is a big component of it, quality of life, and then ecological conservation and restoration.

1077
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:55,344
Those are the sort of big chunks of the re-weighing that they've done in the B5.

1078
01:50:00,373 --> 01:50:08,297
So this is what the scorecard, we're not going to go through this point by point, but you're going to see this throughout the process of the design process.

1079
01:50:08,877 --> 01:50:18,682
There's a scorecard, which each of those categories that you saw on the previous slide has a set of criteria, and we need to design to that criteria.

1080
01:50:19,963 --> 01:50:28,247
We're going to present to you updates periodically throughout the whole design to show how we're

1081
01:50:29,251 --> 01:50:34,913
sort of qualifying to meet the silver certification at minimum.

1082
01:50:36,494 --> 01:50:36,834
Next.

1083
01:50:38,515 --> 01:50:42,536
So just one very early sort of look at it.

1084
01:50:43,717 --> 01:50:49,979
In order to get to silver, we need 50 points minimum through this criteria.

1085
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:55,181
We did a very preliminary assessment and

1086
01:50:56,904 --> 01:51:00,906
you know, sort of targeting, we need to target more than 50 to make sure we get 50.

1087
01:51:01,847 --> 01:51:19,818
And then there's options here to go either gold or platinum, and I know in some other meetings, there may have been some comments about, you know, gold or platinum, and that's not something that we are going to decide for you.

1088
01:51:19,938 --> 01:51:21,059
We want you to

1089
01:51:21,815 --> 01:51:28,599
voice your wish, and then we're going to analyze and show you what it takes to get to gold or platinum.

1090
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:31,801
That's really, right?

1091
01:51:32,221 --> 01:51:40,826
Yeah, so just to clarify that a bit more, so I think we want to be clear about what our sustainability goal and why we are looking for a particular rate.

1092
01:51:40,866 --> 01:51:43,267
The silver certification through USGPC

1093
01:51:43,827 --> 01:51:45,988
that's going to get us MSBA funding.

1094
01:51:46,088 --> 01:51:49,430
So that's a clear goal and a rationale for why we want to do that.

1095
01:51:49,531 --> 01:51:50,151
That's a given.

1096
01:51:50,391 --> 01:51:57,015
If we're going to gold or platinum, are we interested in just that designation, that recognition that comes from the USGBC?

1097
01:51:57,395 --> 01:52:05,841
Are we interested in sort of the core sustainability benefits that are behind those ratings and sort of what matters as we move forward in the process?

1098
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:07,862
So it's a little bit of a higher level question.

1099
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,062
But I think it is worth a little bit of discussion as well.

1100
01:52:11,102 --> 01:52:13,844
And this is the last slide that we have on this section, right?

1101
01:52:13,864 --> 01:52:15,485
So we can get it there.

1102
01:52:15,505 --> 01:52:16,626
I know Liz got his hand up.

1103
01:52:18,687 --> 01:52:23,750
So I've reviewed other high school projects throughout the Commonwealth.

1104
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:27,673
I know there are designers for Wakefield.

1105
01:52:28,213 --> 01:52:30,355
They're doing something interesting with the microgrid.

1106
01:52:31,816 --> 01:52:37,119
Perhaps you could confirm, because these articles are half accurate, right?

1107
01:52:39,278 --> 01:52:43,200
Did they try to obtain LEED Gold or LEED Platinum?

1108
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:44,561
And then did they back off?

1109
01:52:44,721 --> 01:52:45,921
And what did they back off?

1110
01:52:46,102 --> 01:52:48,643
I think I got the answers, but it's just based on the news article.

1111
01:52:48,843 --> 01:52:51,925
Can I also ask what version of LEED was for?

1112
01:52:52,085 --> 01:52:54,606
So Wakefield is LEED B4.

1113
01:52:56,407 --> 01:53:04,451
And the LEED community supported silver minimum.

1114
01:53:05,572 --> 01:53:07,613
And they had aspiration for gold.

1115
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:22,673
And so what happens when we do aspiration is that we sort of build as much as we can towards gold and cement everything we can that would reach gold.

1116
01:53:22,693 --> 01:53:24,034
But there's not as much.

1117
01:53:27,155 --> 01:53:33,518
There are some criteria that they're not willing to extend to, whether it's budgetary or

1118
01:53:34,038 --> 01:53:36,658
for some other reason, maintenance or whatever.

1119
01:53:36,798 --> 01:53:40,579
And so there was a discussion throughout and we kept track.

1120
01:53:40,839 --> 01:53:51,101
I think there's still an aspiration for gold, but there's no, there's no final seeing until the building is fully certified.

1121
01:53:51,721 --> 01:53:56,542
And that won't happen for a couple of years, I think, or a year and a half.

1122
01:53:56,642 --> 01:53:56,782
Okay.

1123
01:53:57,182 --> 01:53:58,802
Are they tracking silver?

1124
01:54:00,302 --> 01:54:03,743
You said aspirational for, are they tracking silver or are they tracking gold?

1125
01:54:04,197 --> 01:54:15,241
We're tracking silver, but with high, high enough points that we were borderline gold territory, but we cannot say where we're tracking.

1126
01:54:16,901 --> 01:54:20,683
Which just for reference is exactly what happened in Somerville.

1127
01:54:20,743 --> 01:54:22,683
Like we tracked silver all the way along.

1128
01:54:22,723 --> 01:54:24,544
They actually just got their gold certification.

1129
01:54:24,584 --> 01:54:27,165
It does take a couple of years after the building opens to get it.

1130
01:54:27,581 --> 01:54:29,823
sometimes in terms of the back and forth that you'd be seeing.

1131
01:54:29,843 --> 01:54:36,707
But it's not like it's a completely unattainable goal or an approach to the project as you track at it.

1132
01:54:37,087 --> 01:54:48,735
It's really just trying to manage where we're focusing some of the investment on different scope items, where particular points have just very direct costs associated with them.

1133
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:52,998
And I brought up Wakefield.

1134
01:54:54,853 --> 01:54:56,634
because they've also got a very interesting concept.

1135
01:54:56,654 --> 01:55:04,237
Now, they have a municipal power company that you can partner with, and they're developing microgrid backup.

1136
01:55:05,618 --> 01:55:11,340
And as I was reading that, I saw a lot of appealing aspects, but we don't have a municipal power company.

1137
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:21,444
And so I was wondering whether some of the things Wakefield is doing, because that project is pretty far along, are applicable in terms of storage to Medford.

1138
01:55:22,825 --> 01:55:24,965
Oh, no, I thought you meant in terms of lead.

1139
01:55:25,186 --> 01:55:41,149
So I was going to say no, because it's a separate project and, you know, the PV is not installed at... No, would the battery backup have any influence on... No, because it wasn't part of this project and it's not within the lead boundary.

1140
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:43,309
However, in Lexington, which is not a muni, it's a

1141
01:55:51,884 --> 01:55:54,425
Massachusetts PA utility.

1142
01:55:56,946 --> 01:56:03,268
They've committed and required the gold aspiration platinum.

1143
01:56:03,709 --> 01:56:08,210
So in Lexington, they've committed to it as a community.

1144
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:20,675
And they've also committed to net zero energy, full site net zero, well, building net zero energy on site with battery storage.

1145
01:56:21,714 --> 01:56:30,117
The battery storage, the solar photovoltaic being installed as part of the project does contribute to LEED and LEED points.

1146
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:46,701
The battery storage in LEED v4 or less and LEED v5 could have some significant impact in terms of some of the modified and new criteria within LEED v5.

1147
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:48,322
But the really major

1148
01:56:49,725 --> 01:57:16,112
benefit of the battery storage is the participation with the utility in the demand response program in, you know, storing the energy, sending it back in the grid and getting the real sort of the money benefit of that on top of reducing your peak load, which reduces your peak energy cost, which is also significant energy savings.

1149
01:57:16,727 --> 01:57:19,548
So those are the benefits of the storage.

1150
01:57:20,089 --> 01:57:30,533
The way we build the setup is very different because they're a mini, so they're going to manage this at the, not at the building level, but at the city level.

1151
01:57:31,074 --> 01:57:44,560
Do we know enough about the existing Renford High School to understand when the peak load is happening, to understand when that demand would match up with the solar collection, and whether or not battery is

1152
01:57:45,178 --> 01:57:47,109
really an effective use of money.

1153
01:57:47,955 --> 01:57:52,918
So when we get to the lifecycle cost analysis, I can speak to that a little bit.

1154
01:57:53,539 --> 01:57:55,820
We've gotten some information.

1155
01:57:55,860 --> 01:58:00,343
And the nice thing about Medford is you have an energy manager, I think, in town.

1156
01:58:00,363 --> 01:58:00,724
So we can.

1157
01:58:00,744 --> 01:58:01,624
She has her hand up now.

1158
01:58:01,724 --> 01:58:02,305
Oh, she does.

1159
01:58:02,545 --> 01:58:03,746
Let's let Brenda go.

1160
01:58:03,906 --> 01:58:11,851
So basically, we get to high level assuming, yes, we can look at that.

1161
01:58:11,931 --> 01:58:17,295
We can look at that in collaboration with the energy manager, get that information, and then

1162
01:58:18,141 --> 01:58:20,152
align with what would be planned.

1163
01:58:20,695 --> 01:58:21,559
Brenda, do you want to go ahead?

1164
01:58:26,324 --> 01:58:37,490
So what I originally had put my hand up to say was I think that it's important to aspire to platinum as we're starting this process and moving forward.

1165
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:44,834
But I would say that I think that net zero and passive house are potentially more valuable goals.

1166
01:58:44,894 --> 01:58:53,378
So if we are able to achieve those without achieving lead platinum, I don't think that would be the end of the world.

1167
01:58:55,246 --> 01:59:01,372
Okay, I'm going to let Paul go and then going to move us along, just because again, I want to make sure that we have time to get to the other topics.

1168
01:59:01,932 --> 01:59:04,735
I know you feel strongly about this topic, Paul, but go ahead.

1169
01:59:05,888 --> 01:59:09,771
I just wanted to sort of echo a bit of what Brenda just said.

1170
01:59:09,911 --> 01:59:23,941
And, you know, I was having an offline conversation with her and Alicia Hunt and, you know, being able to stick a thing on the wall that says what our lead level is, is actually not something that I care about.

1171
01:59:25,322 --> 01:59:30,146
I care about the full lifecycle costs of operating the building.

1172
01:59:31,787 --> 01:59:35,950
And so I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.

1173
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:46,657
Although I don't, I also care a lot about reimbursement, getting enough points to get extra money back from MSBA.

1174
01:59:47,858 --> 01:59:53,522
So both of those things, but like I'm not attached to being able to proudly say we're a lead platinum.

1175
01:59:54,303 --> 01:59:59,166
If we are, that would be great, but let's get there for the right reasons.

1176
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:06,973
So just to clarify, the MSBA reimbursement is tied to the LEED silver.

1177
02:00:07,693 --> 02:00:11,216
Gold or platinum does not get you more money from MSBA.

1178
02:00:13,959 --> 02:00:19,103
Meeting the specialized stretch code, which MENFER has already sort of adopted,

1179
02:00:19,618 --> 02:00:21,559
gets you more money with MSBA.

1180
02:00:21,699 --> 02:00:36,023
And then there are a specific set of credits and criteria, mostly related to indoor environmental quality and materials, that if we meet a higher level of those, there's a basic level required by MSBA.

1181
02:00:36,043 --> 02:00:39,384
If we meet a higher level, we get an additional 1%.

1182
02:00:39,564 --> 02:00:46,146
And we plan to, you know, show you and pursue those that's achievable.

1183
02:00:46,186 --> 02:00:48,787
And we've been doing so in other projects.

1184
02:00:49,365 --> 02:01:02,639
Yeah, so just to clarify, Paul, you may be thinking that in the past, MSBA has handled the reimbursement and the benefits for different levels of LEED certification in different ways, and they will continue to do that as they go forward.

1185
02:01:02,679 --> 02:01:12,749
They do track along with how the energy codes adapt and modify and get more stringent over time, and they adapt sort of their reimbursement model a bit as you go year by year.

1186
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:19,343
Um, so we'll understand once we get to the point of schematic design, sort of what we're locked into in terms of their policy at that point.

1187
02:01:20,004 --> 02:01:22,605
Um, so we'll just have to continue to track it as we go through.

1188
02:01:23,065 --> 02:01:24,766
Um, I am going to push us forward.

1189
02:01:24,786 --> 02:01:36,613
I think that was, that was great discussion and I really do appreciate that point that it's not the plaque on the wall that is really driving this, but it's sort of the benefits, um, from a sustainability perspective, environmental perspective.

1190
02:01:37,653 --> 02:01:40,535
Um, so we're going to shift to climate resiliency as a topic.

1191
02:01:41,633 --> 02:01:59,619
So, you know, we had energy there, but before we get to that, we just want to explain what you're seeing there again is the LEED criteria and part of climate resiliency involves sustainable sites and transportation and water efficiency, water conservation.

1192
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:04,601
So those, that criteria is part of LEED.

1193
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:07,722
These are givens, transportation demand management.

1194
02:02:07,762 --> 02:02:10,323
That's something that came up at the last meeting in terms of

1195
02:02:11,033 --> 02:02:18,874
EV charging station, which we'll talk a bit later in this section, bicycle storage and bicycle charging.

1196
02:02:19,235 --> 02:02:28,516
So all of this is going to be part, to a certain extent, be included to comply with LEED.

1197
02:02:28,576 --> 02:02:33,317
For example, the EV charging station for LEED, you need to install 10% under UNB-5.

1198
02:02:33,337 --> 02:02:34,457
So these are all givens.

1199
02:02:34,477 --> 02:02:35,138
Next.

1200
02:02:39,413 --> 02:02:47,619
In terms of energy and atmosphere, we want to spend a bit of time because there was a lot of talk around this last time, and it's a big chunk.

1201
02:02:47,739 --> 02:02:50,721
Somebody just made a comment about net zero energy.

1202
02:02:51,422 --> 02:02:58,727
So in terms of LEED, we have to outperform standards that are part of their criteria.

1203
02:03:00,228 --> 02:03:06,013
And MSBA looks at that performance and associates a certain amount of LEED points

1204
02:03:06,694 --> 02:03:15,501
they sort of look at that performance to associate lead points for the stretch code, which they're kind of apples and oranges, but that's their way of benchmarking.

1205
02:03:16,102 --> 02:03:27,591
And so we really try to optimize the energy performance of the building to really meet them as the threshold, but also, you know, make as much points there.

1206
02:03:27,631 --> 02:03:30,073
The change in Lead B5 is source energy.

1207
02:03:30,654 --> 02:03:34,577
We won't go into all those details, but it's source energy-based versus site energy-based.

1208
02:03:37,065 --> 02:03:40,546
All of this is supported by the MA specialized stretch code.

1209
02:03:41,186 --> 02:03:45,908
So there's a lot from that code that's going to support the criteria there.

1210
02:03:47,548 --> 02:03:58,191
That said, there's a lot of technical things here, but passive strategies are going to be also a priority, you know, making sure we harvest the free sun.

1211
02:03:59,831 --> 02:04:03,853
And Emily will talk a bit about that, you know, thinking about wind,

1212
02:04:06,067 --> 02:04:21,255
at the same time, and then somebody brought up passive survivability, so that will be part of the thinking here in terms of HVAC system and overall resiliency of the site.

1213
02:04:23,336 --> 02:04:30,720
I won't go through all of this, but to say that commissioning is subsidized by MSBA, so the full commissioning set of

1214
02:04:31,379 --> 02:04:42,186
mechanical, electrical, plumbing, building enclosure, and actually some ongoing commissioning plan is all included in the MSBE scope and provided by MSBE.

1215
02:04:42,226 --> 02:04:43,347
And that's it.

1216
02:04:43,567 --> 02:04:47,089
Is the SBC considering bringing on a commissioning agent in somatic design?

1217
02:04:47,109 --> 02:04:50,411
Because that's what they mean by this requirement.

1218
02:04:50,431 --> 02:04:52,813
So I was curious if that was a consideration.

1219
02:04:53,168 --> 02:04:54,268
So I have a question.

1220
02:04:54,288 --> 02:04:56,789
MSBA doesn't bring it on until DD.

1221
02:04:56,829 --> 02:05:01,911
So I actually have a question, because MSBA is going to transition to DD.

1222
02:05:02,471 --> 02:05:08,653
So I have a question to them about that, to first clarify if they're going to substantiate.

1223
02:05:08,713 --> 02:05:11,814
And if not, then we would have to account for it.

1224
02:05:11,834 --> 02:05:14,475
We've asked them that question, and they've heard no.

1225
02:05:14,655 --> 02:05:15,295
You've heard no.

1226
02:05:15,455 --> 02:05:15,915
Yeah.

1227
02:05:16,315 --> 02:05:16,455
OK.

1228
02:05:16,735 --> 02:05:18,216
But I'd be curious if you had a different answer.

1229
02:05:19,408 --> 02:05:26,672
And we keep asking, I think the more people pointing out, they may have an epiphany there that, geez, we need to adjust our policy.

1230
02:05:27,032 --> 02:05:38,438
And then the other thing that they do not provide, if you want to, if you install a solar PV system, you need to have it commissioned to get the lead points for the renewable energy.

1231
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:40,899
But MSBA does not reimburse that.

1232
02:05:41,019 --> 02:05:44,541
So you usually have to buy that commission separately.

1233
02:05:44,621 --> 02:05:46,142
Same with the demand response.

1234
02:05:46,905 --> 02:05:52,227
There's a part of it that's an observation of a test that needs to be done by a commissioning agent.

1235
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,168
We also need to buy that up front.

1236
02:05:55,028 --> 02:05:59,690
So I'm just going to try to keep us on the questions until Martín gets through this piece of it.

1237
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:00,950
So no, no problem.

1238
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:01,970
So a lot of the

1239
02:06:09,518 --> 02:06:13,339
you'll see a lot of the schools are targeting EUI 25.

1240
02:06:13,719 --> 02:06:15,640
So make sure I explain what I mean.

1241
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,140
Energy use intensity.

1242
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:29,464
The EUI is a metric that we use to compare schools and buildings, actually all buildings, by using a sort of a nominal energy per square foot per year metric.

1243
02:06:29,684 --> 02:06:38,687
In this case, we take all the energy loads, whether from fossil fuel or electricity, and we combine them in kBTUs per square foot per year.

1244
02:06:39,285 --> 02:06:49,049
The target for most schools that are not vocational schools, that are not comprehensive program school, usually is 25.

1245
02:06:49,610 --> 02:07:00,875
But with the case of your school, which has a comprehensive program, which really requires a bit more energy per square foot than a typical school, we've put a range there of 25 to 35.

1246
02:07:00,955 --> 02:07:05,897
There's going to be more discussion about that, but we'd like to set that

1247
02:07:06,868 --> 02:07:16,833
goal up front in the project, and we do energy modeling to sort of monitor and target and continue to sort of profile that goal.

1248
02:07:17,353 --> 02:07:18,794
And how do we get there?

1249
02:07:18,974 --> 02:07:25,998
And we've got many schools that have achieved the EUI 25 that are not non-provinces.

1250
02:07:26,478 --> 02:07:30,620
How do we, can you go back, I just want to go to the nice little icons there.

1251
02:07:31,013 --> 02:07:36,894
So one of the very important components of how to get there is a super insulated enclosure.

1252
02:07:36,914 --> 02:07:41,976
All of those things are supported by code, but we want to make sure you understand what it is exactly.

1253
02:07:42,056 --> 02:07:54,058
Super insulated enclosure, triple glazing, all electric HVAC to the extent possible with your program, and then plug load management, which ties into occupant behavior.

1254
02:07:54,078 --> 02:08:00,520
And then the passive strategies, which I omitted to talk about first, but they're the first thing we look into.

1255
02:08:01,034 --> 02:08:01,274
Next.

1256
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:09,561
And in terms of operational carbon, so all this energy, we're going to talk about embodied carbon later.

1257
02:08:10,081 --> 02:08:14,345
All this energy is equivalent in greenhouse gas emission.

1258
02:08:14,745 --> 02:08:19,649
And your existing high school versus the new school.

1259
02:08:19,669 --> 02:08:20,810
This is not your school.

1260
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:21,831
This is an example.

1261
02:08:21,931 --> 02:08:26,575
When we fine tune your existing high school energy better, we're going to create

1262
02:08:27,754 --> 02:08:30,496
a bar chart like this and show you where we're looking to go.

1263
02:08:30,576 --> 02:08:43,503
What you're seeing here is an existing high school, large existing high school, and how an EUI 2530 target reduces the operational carbon over 60 years.

1264
02:08:43,563 --> 02:08:47,425
So we take the annual emissions and we multiply them by 60.

1265
02:08:48,466 --> 02:08:49,867
The reason we do that is that

1266
02:08:50,691 --> 02:08:55,253
When you do modeling and measuring of embodied carbon, you look at it over 60 years.

1267
02:08:55,553 --> 02:09:03,356
So this discussion will continue at the next meeting, probably in a bit more detail.

1268
02:09:03,876 --> 02:09:09,158
But we like to look at carbon as total carbon, both operational and embodied carbon.

1269
02:09:09,258 --> 02:09:09,478
Next.

1270
02:09:12,898 --> 02:09:20,941
So like Martin's been saying, when we're designing our spaces, we're not just thinking about what is code required, what the minimums are.

1271
02:09:22,582 --> 02:09:25,943
We're thinking about a big picture and a lot of variables.

1272
02:09:26,663 --> 02:09:29,524
So this carries over into the engineering systems as well.

1273
02:09:31,297 --> 02:09:35,960
And I was glad to hear a lot of these points were mentioned in the first meeting.

1274
02:09:36,061 --> 02:09:42,846
So that's great to hear that you're all thinking about all these different buckets that we think about during our design process.

1275
02:09:44,327 --> 02:09:56,697
So specifically for the mechanical systems, I'm thinking about the comfort and health of the occupants, the safety of the materials that I'm using, the LCCA, as Martine's mentioned,

1276
02:09:57,732 --> 02:10:02,074
both sustainability at the end, hearing teams have to consider this.

1277
02:10:02,174 --> 02:10:06,977
Reliability and maintenance of the building systems, that's very important.

1278
02:10:08,237 --> 02:10:14,180
The all electric HVAC systems is a code requirement and a LEED V5 requirement.

1279
02:10:15,561 --> 02:10:25,706
And then also just the space, not just within the building, but where we're going to place our equipment on the roof, is a sharing space with the PV solar panels.

1280
02:10:27,532 --> 02:10:29,913
And then where are we going to take up space on the site?

1281
02:10:29,973 --> 02:10:33,614
So we have to coordinate with the civil teams and the site teams as well.

1282
02:10:36,135 --> 02:10:42,158
And then I just wanted to point out this one in particular, which was brought up quite a bit in the first meeting.

1283
02:10:42,198 --> 02:10:54,763
And again, I'm very happy about that because it's one thing to design a high efficiency, beautiful mechanical building system, but it's an entirely another thing

1284
02:10:55,558 --> 02:10:57,659
to see it operate as intended.

1285
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:05,884
So it's very critical from the beginning of the design process to work with who's going to be operating your system.

1286
02:11:06,664 --> 02:11:18,611
So Andrew and I have already met with Ken and John for their facilities team to understand how they currently operate, what they're comfortable with, and then for their future, what

1287
02:11:21,313 --> 02:11:36,162
If they'll be bringing on board more team members to handle the larger systems, or they're going to incorporate more training to understand these all electric systems and controls, because it's very different than what's currently in the school.

1288
02:11:37,603 --> 02:11:44,207
And then, as Martine mentioned, we also look at commissioning as a lead C5 requirement.

1289
02:11:46,596 --> 02:11:47,937
So, Audrey, I do see your hand up.

1290
02:11:48,577 --> 02:11:54,302
We'll circle back to you when we get to the question point in this sort of grouping of slides which will be coming up.

1291
02:11:56,203 --> 02:12:01,267
Okay, and then a little bit touched on in the first meeting was specifically the mechanical system options.

1292
02:12:02,347 --> 02:12:11,294
We're going to dive deeper into these later on in the feasibility phase of the project, but I did just want to quickly

1293
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:17,281
bring them up high level for what our all electric system options might be for the school.

1294
02:12:18,402 --> 02:12:22,923
So the first is a ground source heat pump system, that's geothermal system.

1295
02:12:24,203 --> 02:12:27,564
The next would be an air source to water heat pump system.

1296
02:12:28,485 --> 02:12:32,506
And then the third would be an all air source heat pump system.

1297
02:12:33,266 --> 02:12:37,527
And then with these three, we can also kind of do a hybrid option.

1298
02:12:38,149 --> 02:12:43,530
where you can take bits and pieces of the different system types and use them for different areas of the school.

1299
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:48,672
So it could be for cost reasons, to cut costs.

1300
02:12:48,752 --> 02:12:55,793
It could be just for flexibility, like what might work well in one space might not work as well in another space of the school.

1301
02:12:55,813 --> 02:13:03,675
So again, we'll be looking at this more closely in the next phase of the design process.

1302
02:13:04,255 --> 02:13:07,476
But I did just want to put these up here so you can see what's coming.

1303
02:13:10,276 --> 02:13:13,839
Well, it seems like the most popular topic is energy savings.

1304
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:38,759
And right now, Medford's PV policy is a building that's a gradient of 10,000 square feet, requires PV array on a roof, size to 50% of that roof usable, I should say, or 90% of the top level of a parking structure that's uncovered, which I don't believe will affect

1305
02:13:39,257 --> 02:13:41,657
Medford High School, but it's an option.

1306
02:13:43,618 --> 02:13:58,960
Exceptions are unsuitable spaces or structures that can't have, can't support the structure of the solar array, or if the roof is 50% shaded throughout the year.

1307
02:14:00,721 --> 02:14:07,322
When it comes to stretch code, we have going through the public pathway,

1308
02:14:09,338 --> 02:14:15,601
you'll have to have 40% of the usable roof covered, which is under what Medford requires.

1309
02:14:16,861 --> 02:14:33,589
And any buildings that are still using fossil fuels, you'll still have to provide that solar PV array to offset those fossil fuels, such as for the pool heating, culinary kitchens, labs, and such.

1310
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:36,190
When it comes to battery storage,

1311
02:14:37,867 --> 02:14:44,212
It's not necessarily a code requirement, but it does help with the LEED version 5.

1312
02:14:44,632 --> 02:14:49,075
So it does add points to get you to higher than silver.

1313
02:14:49,615 --> 02:15:01,784
And then everything else will just be, contributes to LEED V5 and get you to silver, iron, gold throughout the aspirations.

1314
02:15:03,045 --> 02:15:06,888
And then other options would be for walkway structures

1315
02:15:07,612 --> 02:15:11,233
or parking structures or PV array locations.

1316
02:15:12,834 --> 02:15:20,376
And if there is a patio or roof, you can have a high canopy there, or onyx vertical wall structures.

1317
02:15:23,217 --> 02:15:32,661
So just to quickly clarify, if you do an all-electric fat wind specialized pool, the 40% is readiness.

1318
02:15:33,461 --> 02:15:36,382
You don't specifically have to install it

1319
02:15:37,196 --> 02:15:43,660
Whereas if you have fossil fuel, you have to install to offset your fossil fuel.

1320
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:49,083
You have to install the amount of PV that offsets your fossil fuel use.

1321
02:15:49,684 --> 02:15:57,448
We'll dive more in the details of the code in the next meetings in terms of what does that mean for your project.

1322
02:15:59,570 --> 02:16:02,071
We started looking at ballpark numbers.

1323
02:16:02,411 --> 02:16:06,874
And so how much of that 50%, for example, of your roof area would

1324
02:16:07,507 --> 02:16:10,628
the equivalent in terms of the net zero go big, right?

1325
02:16:11,108 --> 02:16:17,389
So we'll have more of those figures in the next phase of the Resilience Study.

1326
02:16:18,589 --> 02:16:26,310
And we had another slide here on EV chargers, but Andrew, I'm going to cut you off just because I get the sense that people would like to talk about some of this a little bit.

1327
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:27,771
And we're sort of running short on time.

1328
02:16:27,811 --> 02:16:29,571
So I think I will pitch it over.

1329
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:32,391
I think there was a couple of hands up earlier that we'll get to.

1330
02:16:32,432 --> 02:16:35,092
I know we have some folks online, then we'll try to circle through.

1331
02:16:35,935 --> 02:16:36,475
Great, thank you.

1332
02:16:36,956 --> 02:16:39,737
I have a comment, a question, and a comment.

1333
02:16:40,057 --> 02:16:45,921
First, I have to leave at 630, so don't take me leaving at any sign of being unhappy with this.

1334
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:57,067
Question, how much of the overall budget historically has the MSBC contributed to projects of this scale and percentage?

1335
02:16:57,627 --> 02:17:01,870
How much would we expect will be offset by their investments?

1336
02:17:02,806 --> 02:17:04,947
choosing overall with the project contribution.

1337
02:17:04,987 --> 02:17:06,447
So it varies per community.

1338
02:17:06,607 --> 02:17:12,809
The agreed upon reimbursement rate, and I forget what it is off the top of my head, is let's just say it's 50% for right now.

1339
02:17:12,829 --> 02:17:14,169
I think it's a little bit higher than that.

1340
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:24,332
It's a very confusing number though, because it doesn't actually equate to like what their contribution is at the end of the day, because it's 50% say of eligible costs.

1341
02:17:24,392 --> 02:17:27,432
And there's a whole like 45 minute presentation.

1342
02:17:27,472 --> 02:17:29,793
Just trying to get a sense for the scale for which

1343
02:17:31,457 --> 02:17:33,638
reimbursement versus have to fund ourselves.

1344
02:17:34,338 --> 02:17:41,201
So my comment is I want to register my support for doing lead silver and code minimum.

1345
02:17:41,962 --> 02:17:47,884
A lot of these systems are very sophisticated between design and maintenance.

1346
02:17:48,144 --> 02:17:53,807
And a lot of payback is, for lack of a better word, speculative.

1347
02:17:54,367 --> 02:18:00,730
The data is based on similar situations or not apples to apples to what we're doing.

1348
02:18:01,217 --> 02:18:06,340
and does not, is not able to accurately predict what is actually available for payback on some of this.

1349
02:18:06,781 --> 02:18:16,907
So, um, personally, I believe that stick with the simpler approach, tried and true technologies that doesn't so much count on future dollars coming in as it does.

1350
02:18:17,347 --> 02:18:18,568
What can we afford today?

1351
02:18:19,029 --> 02:18:24,332
And what can we afford to maintain today and aspiring to gold or silver, I think will distract us from that goal.

1352
02:18:24,983 --> 02:18:31,986
and lead us more toward cutting-edge technologies that are going to be difficult to maintain or to repair or replace.

1353
02:18:32,286 --> 02:18:33,867
So that's all I got.

1354
02:18:33,907 --> 02:18:34,227
Thank you.

1355
02:18:37,008 --> 02:18:38,669
I had a couple of questions.

1356
02:18:38,689 --> 02:18:53,915
One is the rate, and maybe this is a question for the Energy Manager, I can follow up later, is does Medford High have a specific rate structure that would benefit from dispatching storage

1357
02:18:54,907 --> 02:19:01,891
On like a regular basis, like as as you guys are going about your your design and your load calculations like are you are you looking at.

1358
02:19:02,851 --> 02:19:06,653
Okay we're going to assume this much PV during the day, but we're going to offset that with.

1359
02:19:07,453 --> 02:19:16,258
The battery and select points or we're only going to use the battery for demand response credits with national grid, I wonder if you can tell me like what what is how you.

1360
02:19:16,458 --> 02:19:18,119
How are you formulating that strategy.

1361
02:19:18,979 --> 02:19:22,041
Again that's going to be a discussion, there is a rate.

1362
02:19:22,591 --> 02:19:24,453
and it's driving the commercial rate.

1363
02:19:24,673 --> 02:19:25,594
But it's a standard.

1364
02:19:25,774 --> 02:19:26,815
It's a standard.

1365
02:19:26,935 --> 02:19:28,416
They raise it every year.

1366
02:19:28,496 --> 02:19:34,541
So when we do the cost analysis, we put cost escalation in there.

1367
02:19:35,202 --> 02:19:38,404
We have precedents because we've been doing this for a long time.

1368
02:19:38,424 --> 02:19:39,365
So we can share that.

1369
02:19:40,426 --> 02:19:49,954
The use of the battery storage is going to be up to the management, the school, the facilities management.

1370
02:19:50,324 --> 02:19:56,367
So they can take advantage of that demand response.

1371
02:19:56,507 --> 02:20:00,229
Those are specific times, especially during the summer.

1372
02:20:01,269 --> 02:20:09,814
But they can also manage it so that they can hold the storage and then use it when it's peak.

1373
02:20:09,834 --> 02:20:13,435
Let's say in the winter, they use it at night because assurance peak.

1374
02:20:13,475 --> 02:20:16,337
So that's going to be up to the

1375
02:20:17,155 --> 02:20:23,619
the facility management to optimize the use of that energy storage in general.

1376
02:20:23,819 --> 02:20:30,523
And then on top of that, they can add the incentive programs and benefit further from it.

1377
02:20:31,023 --> 02:20:39,888
And are you assuming that the high school or the city will be the owner of the solar or will you sign a third party PPA with the solar?

1378
02:20:39,908 --> 02:20:41,469
That's an excellent comment.

1379
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:45,992
Because if you are the owner, you own

1380
02:20:46,665 --> 02:20:50,046
all the greenhouse gas reduction and get all that revenue.

1381
02:20:50,786 --> 02:20:57,069
If you rent your roof and your parking to a third party, they're going to get all that money.

1382
02:20:57,169 --> 02:20:59,469
You're going to get only a reduction.

1383
02:21:00,810 --> 02:21:10,573
Obviously, there's a contract to be negotiated with them, but what we're seeing for most of them, it's a 20-year contract at a fixed rate.

1384
02:21:11,414 --> 02:21:15,475
You may not get as much money back than if you own the system.

1385
02:21:16,262 --> 02:21:21,423
But again, that will be a discussion as we look into these options.

1386
02:21:21,943 --> 02:21:30,466
That will be a discussion for the community to decide, because only the PV and the battery storage, obviously, add the cost.

1387
02:21:30,726 --> 02:21:33,566
And there is a payback to be looked at and all that.

1388
02:21:33,966 --> 02:21:36,147
So I know there's a couple of hands up here.

1389
02:21:36,187 --> 02:21:37,647
I want to let Brenda respond.

1390
02:21:37,727 --> 02:21:40,448
And I want to go back to Audrey, because she did have her hand up in between.

1391
02:21:40,488 --> 02:21:41,268
Then we'll circle back.

1392
02:21:41,348 --> 02:21:44,549
I know there's a lot of topics for discussion here going forward.

1393
02:21:44,919 --> 02:21:51,122
We actually have a lot of other content as well, but we may just pause and spend a little bit more time here because I think it is productive conversation.

1394
02:21:51,562 --> 02:21:52,622
So Brenda, why don't you go ahead?

1395
02:21:53,943 --> 02:22:11,871
Sure, I was just going to add that there are demand charges for buildings that are this size, commercial buildings that are this size, and the high school is our largest energy user of any of our municipal-owned buildings in the city.

1396
02:22:12,291 --> 02:22:15,093
So the demand charges are quite expensive for it.

1397
02:22:15,133 --> 02:22:28,080
So I think that's what will be interesting to see the cost analysis of storage compared to the savings that we would get from the demand response we could do with the batteries.

1398
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:33,063
Appreciate that.

1399
02:22:33,404 --> 02:22:37,466
Audrey, do you want to?

1400
02:22:37,486 --> 02:22:37,986
Yeah, thank you.

1401
02:22:38,747 --> 02:22:40,268
I wanted to go back to the HVAC.

1402
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:43,782
The HVAC stuff.

1403
02:22:44,302 --> 02:22:47,804
So I just feel very compelled to speak up about this.

1404
02:22:49,245 --> 02:22:52,927
I absolutely know the one before.

1405
02:22:54,768 --> 02:23:04,794
Yeah, so speaking as someone who has been in that building over 25 years, I can say that this is a,

1406
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:18,890
huge point of contention, if you will, because, as you all know, the building is old, but the

1407
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:32,528
The amount of years of not just me, but obviously every teacher that has had to deal with the uncomfortable conditions in that building is horrendous.

1408
02:23:32,589 --> 02:23:38,073
Now, I am lucky because I'm in the science wing and that was redone about 11 years ago.

1409
02:23:38,714 --> 02:23:49,303
However, what's upsetting is that the first few years, they let us have individual control over our rooms, and then that was taken away.

1410
02:23:51,578 --> 02:23:58,660
then now currently there's something weird and something wrong with the system and they can't seem to control it.

1411
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:01,160
It's something weird about the central control.

1412
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,401
And I'll give you just a personal example.

1413
02:24:03,421 --> 02:24:07,662
Like my room is set to over 75 right now and I'm like dying in it.

1414
02:24:08,342 --> 02:24:17,224
And like today was kind of like warmer and I've had to crack my window and it kills me because I know what a waste of energy and Sprung just said that.

1415
02:24:18,024 --> 02:24:19,565
I know what a waste of energy that is.

1416
02:24:22,306 --> 02:24:35,736
I just want to make sure that in this new space that whoever's going to be running it, whether it's Buildings and Grounds or whoever, is going to be able to run it.

1417
02:24:35,796 --> 02:24:42,101
But I would ask and beg that you allow teachers, as professionals, to control their own rooms.

1418
02:24:43,723 --> 02:24:45,484
Because it's just...

1419
02:24:47,007 --> 02:24:49,709
it doesn't feel very respectful, right?

1420
02:24:49,809 --> 02:24:55,794
And then just to trust us that we would not be abusing the system, right?

1421
02:24:55,894 --> 02:24:58,917
Of like cranking it down or cranking it up or whatever.

1422
02:24:59,057 --> 02:25:06,783
So I just feel really strongly about that because of all the years of just having such miserable conditions.

1423
02:25:08,364 --> 02:25:09,005
And then, I mean,

1424
02:25:10,486 --> 02:25:17,412
that it's just I just wanted to pipe up about that as a voice of an educator who's been in that building all these years.

1425
02:25:19,373 --> 02:25:31,783
We appreciate that perspective and I think that's definitely going to be subject of a lot of conversations going forward and certainly central to the design of the mechanical system as Emily gets into it.

1426
02:25:32,424 --> 02:25:35,206
Yeah so I have three comments and then a question for you.

1427
02:25:36,007 --> 02:25:37,468
See what people are doing they're just sort of

1428
02:25:37,868 --> 02:25:41,330
Letting all the arrows.

1429
02:25:41,990 --> 02:25:44,612
So a couple of comments.

1430
02:25:46,173 --> 02:25:53,797
In our SLI, which is available on the Medford High School website, there is a report that was put together in 2019.

1431
02:25:53,837 --> 02:25:57,640
Earlier, we saw an EUI target of 2535.

1432
02:25:57,740 --> 02:26:04,864
The report contains the measured values over maybe a nine-year period.

1433
02:26:05,347 --> 02:26:09,990
showing what the EUI-4 building is or was.

1434
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:13,372
You can see a spike sort of during the COVID years.

1435
02:26:13,612 --> 02:26:17,895
I personally attribute that to more fans and more air circulation.

1436
02:26:18,255 --> 02:26:19,396
Maybe it's something else, I don't know.

1437
02:26:20,016 --> 02:26:22,018
But historically, the number was around 60.

1438
02:26:22,178 --> 02:26:26,320
And then when COVID happened, it spiked and got a lot higher.

1439
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:33,245
The report also contains a breakdown between the contribution

1440
02:26:34,088 --> 02:26:38,350
from electric sources and from natural gas.

1441
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:40,450
That's our fossil fuel.

1442
02:26:41,151 --> 02:26:51,875
So I encourage everyone who's interested in this topic to read that report to get a good idea of what the current school requires in terms of energy.

1443
02:26:52,635 --> 02:26:55,736
On the PPA discussion, I panels my roof.

1444
02:26:56,176 --> 02:26:59,777
When I put them up, the best panels produced 218 watts per panel.

1445
02:27:02,133 --> 02:27:03,074
Today, that's a lot better.

1446
02:27:03,654 --> 02:27:08,018
If you were to do the same exercise today, you could get panels that produce 460 watts.

1447
02:27:08,038 --> 02:27:12,081
And that makes a big difference when you multiply it by many panels.

1448
02:27:13,002 --> 02:27:18,486
So a PPA versus a purchase system requires cost-benefit analysis.

1449
02:27:18,506 --> 02:27:27,513
And I certainly would ask for one before making the buy versus rent decision, because I see our electric needs growing.

1450
02:27:28,028 --> 02:27:30,449
As time goes on, more people buy electric cars.

1451
02:27:30,669 --> 02:27:32,990
There's not actually that many out there.

1452
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:38,372
Maybe we see a higher concentration because of where we live and work.

1453
02:27:38,833 --> 02:27:45,155
But if you travel outside of the 1995 bubble, there's not many electric cars.

1454
02:27:45,375 --> 02:27:46,856
However, in the future, that's going to change.

1455
02:27:47,156 --> 02:27:48,096
Our needs are going to grow.

1456
02:27:49,157 --> 02:27:52,638
And having a PPA positions you to upgrade.

1457
02:27:53,239 --> 02:27:56,680
You sacrifice in one area, and you have growth in another.

1458
02:27:57,853 --> 02:28:04,696
I'm not advocating for one or the other, but I would expect a detailed cost-benefit analysis for the make versus rent decision.

1459
02:28:05,016 --> 02:28:10,298
That would be able to the school, the children, and taxpayers.

1460
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:14,019
Let's see.

1461
02:28:14,739 --> 02:28:18,181
On the reimbursability topic, it varies widely.

1462
02:28:18,701 --> 02:28:23,463
And it's, as Matt alluded to, a function of what's reimbursable.

1463
02:28:23,703 --> 02:28:24,723
So take Revere.

1464
02:28:25,183 --> 02:28:26,684
Revere is building an enormous school.

1465
02:28:26,884 --> 02:28:30,967
It's going to cost over $700 billion, according to Boston.

1466
02:28:31,888 --> 02:28:34,789
Can I say billion?

1467
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:41,254
So 3 quarters of a billion dollars, according to Boston.

1468
02:28:41,454 --> 02:28:47,418
Now, they have a very high reimbursement rate, a rate that we couldn't dream of, but it's around 80%.

1469
02:28:49,759 --> 02:28:52,401
However, that only applies to reimbursable costs.

1470
02:28:52,882 --> 02:28:54,963
And so the amount that they're getting reimbursed

1471
02:28:55,367 --> 02:28:58,848
is not 83% of $700 million.

1472
02:28:59,529 --> 02:29:01,409
It is 83% of a smaller sum.

1473
02:29:01,990 --> 02:29:07,852
And altogether, it's probably close to $300 million, reimbursed $700 million.

1474
02:29:08,092 --> 02:29:15,015
So it really matters about what's reimbursable, what's not, and then the percentage.

1475
02:29:15,075 --> 02:29:17,776
And currently, our percentage is at 53% for this study.

1476
02:29:18,076 --> 02:29:23,458
And that will change based on what this project begins to look like and what's reimbursable, what's not.

1477
02:29:24,145 --> 02:29:27,486
where we score points, where we don't.

1478
02:29:28,867 --> 02:29:30,207
I think the percentage could change.

1479
02:29:30,327 --> 02:29:31,187
Not necessarily.

1480
02:29:31,687 --> 02:29:34,548
It doesn't have to, but I have a lot of examples.

1481
02:29:35,229 --> 02:29:38,990
I'm just saying, it fluctuates, and it's not uncivil community to community.

1482
02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:43,891
And I have a lot of reimbursement forms that the MSBA publishes.

1483
02:29:44,471 --> 02:29:46,532
So anyway, it's going to change a lot.

1484
02:29:46,632 --> 02:29:48,433
It's not set right now.

1485
02:29:49,033 --> 02:29:50,673
It's something that we should all pay attention to.

1486
02:29:50,933 --> 02:29:52,614
Now, to the estimate 18, my question.

1487
02:29:53,817 --> 02:30:19,042
We saw 57 concepts yesterday, and I know that, you know, we had some sort of initial, I'll say, just impression gathering, but certainly some of the shapes that we saw and some of, I'll say, the aspect ratios, you know, implied me that there are

1488
02:30:21,322 --> 02:30:34,986
concepts that are not well-suited for things like deployment or potentially other technologies, whereas others are going to have better just inherent attributes.

1489
02:30:35,606 --> 02:30:46,549
And I wanted to ask if all 57 are going to be sort of assessed for the kind of technologies that we're working at, or will we delay that assessment until we narrow it down?

1490
02:30:47,269 --> 02:30:50,690
Can you walk us through kind of where this subcommittee

1491
02:30:51,273 --> 02:30:56,216
merges with, I'll say, the main line to have it sit back.

1492
02:30:56,416 --> 02:30:56,596
Yeah.

1493
02:30:56,896 --> 02:31:03,740
So first, we're at 29 versus 57, which to me, it makes me feel a little bit better.

1494
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:05,261
29 is still a big number, right?

1495
02:31:06,942 --> 02:31:19,470
What we're going to be doing as we go forward, we're definitely going to add, I think, solar suitability or compact, whatever the terminology that into the overall valuation criteria that the building committee

1496
02:31:20,228 --> 02:31:25,912
And consequently, I think this advisory team as well, there's sort of a lens to look at the different options as we move forward.

1497
02:31:27,733 --> 02:31:44,283
In terms of how the overlap of this advisory team's review and the SBC review works, I think we'll have to think through that timeline of exactly sort of what is being reviewed at particular points as we go forward.

1498
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:52,583
But we're not going to be reducing probably from that 29 until we're getting into the PSR phase, the next phase of the feasibility study.

1499
02:31:52,963 --> 02:31:57,685
So we will be getting together again here before we make that reduction down.

1500
02:31:58,446 --> 02:32:06,049
So there will be the opportunity for this group to actually input on some of those topics, whatever those evaluation criteria are.

1501
02:32:06,549 --> 02:32:11,672
The evaluation criteria should be set before we get to the PSR phase as we really jump into it.

1502
02:32:12,350 --> 02:32:19,893
And so I think we can also work to help craft and sort of evaluate whether or not we have all the correct evaluation criteria in that longer list.

1503
02:32:19,933 --> 02:32:23,394
And again, it's not just solar suitability.

1504
02:32:23,474 --> 02:32:28,875
It's going to range everything from educational priorities to site amenities to community goals.

1505
02:32:30,016 --> 02:32:31,576
We're going to come up with what that list is.

1506
02:32:31,636 --> 02:32:39,659
But there definitely will be overlapping opportunities as we move forward before that 29 group is called to something smaller.

1507
02:32:40,327 --> 02:32:46,092
Just so people are aware, we're not going to jump from 29 to 1, most likely, in terms of the process.

1508
02:32:46,112 --> 02:32:53,758
There's going to be sort of a short listing of it, and then we'll try to make a final selection in terms of just what people can expect as part of the process.

1509
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:07,649
So I want to push us forward to embodied carbon, and I'm going to sort of just tell our team, warn our team, that we'll probably have to take a much more abbreviated view of each of these because we have about 30 minutes left.

1510
02:33:08,947 --> 02:33:22,936
And some of these are going to be shorter topics, but I know it's definitely challenging to ask everyone to do, but just to try to sort of explain or maybe hit the high points, because I'm sure that people here have thoughts and topics that they want to talk through.

1511
02:33:23,377 --> 02:33:34,764
So to be very brief, LEED is going to include a lot of sustainable materials, you know, looking at waste, and there's also a requirement for embodied carbon.

1512
02:33:35,164 --> 02:33:36,425
So there's a minimum there.

1513
02:33:36,993 --> 02:33:47,618
What we want to look into and what we're going to continue to look into is to go beyond that minimum as much as it's, you know, feasible.

1514
02:33:48,999 --> 02:33:49,279
Next.

1515
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:58,884
So, you know, when we look at materials, exterior materials, we start looking at embodied carbon impact and a lot of the embodied carbon, next, push again, yeah.

1516
02:33:59,463 --> 02:34:03,305
A lot of the invited carbon resides in the building enclosure and structures.

1517
02:34:03,345 --> 02:34:07,506
There's a focus there, but that's not to say that we're not going to look at other material.

1518
02:34:07,566 --> 02:34:14,549
For example, ceiling tiles and gypsum is pretty high carbon as well, so we look into that.

1519
02:34:14,609 --> 02:34:14,889
Next.

1520
02:34:19,852 --> 02:34:25,194
So low-carbon concrete, structural steel with high cycle content.

1521
02:34:26,370 --> 02:34:29,912
low carbon material insulation, gypsum ceilings, and others.

1522
02:34:30,072 --> 02:34:48,540
And the one other thing that's going to be discussed is, you know, the consideration that we're curious to understand from you, if you're interested in considering mass timber and wood structural component, whether it's a full structure or a hybrid approach, which is something we can look into.

1523
02:34:49,361 --> 02:34:53,783
But mass timber obviously has an impact on reducing carbon.

1524
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:59,641
That's it.

1525
02:34:59,661 --> 02:35:02,422
We can pause and get your input from there.

1526
02:35:03,202 --> 02:35:06,443
And just to add a little bit of sort of more specific commentary on the building.

1527
02:35:06,463 --> 02:35:09,164
So we have had some initial discussions with our structural engineer.

1528
02:35:10,144 --> 02:35:17,466
Understanding that we have about a 15 foot by 15 foot structural grid at work in this building where we have the concrete frame portions of the building.

1529
02:35:18,326 --> 02:35:23,568
That structural grid dimension actually works pretty well with a mass timber structure.

1530
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:37,558
If we're thinking about expanding horizontally or even if we're thinking about expanding vertically on this existing concrete structure and not all the building is concrete structure, there are portions that are steel-framed like the vocational wing, like the gym, like the pool.

1531
02:35:38,499 --> 02:35:41,281
It's already a little bit of a hybrid structural system that we have.

1532
02:35:42,022 --> 02:35:50,308
But there is some inherent compatibility between the timber frame and then the concrete frame as it exists today, just for what that's worth.

1533
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:53,671
Part of the discussion will be

1534
02:35:54,758 --> 02:36:08,748
around, you know, wood structure will be to look at, you know, the appetite for the full new components or hybrid option.

1535
02:36:09,008 --> 02:36:16,693
And we're, you know, curious to know what sort of where this group falls in terms of interest for that.

1536
02:36:23,243 --> 02:36:31,187
sort of viewing that in the broader context of the schedule and the budget, right?

1537
02:36:31,347 --> 02:36:52,718
And if timber framing, I don't know sort of one versus the other, but if that's going to add cost, where would you recommend that we sacrifice that cost from say somewhere else based on prior

1538
02:36:53,728 --> 02:36:59,433
our experience, I think, seeing, you know, everything's going to have a trade-off, right, as you're working through it, so.

1539
02:37:01,575 --> 02:37:18,530
And I think this group is also about sort of establishing some of those priorities and talking about sort of where, from a larger community perspective, because we have a lot of really great voices as part of this group, just to understand, and it may be different for different perspectives and roles or responsibilities within the city as well.

1540
02:37:20,188 --> 02:37:21,909
Many of you should definitely look at a hybrid system.

1541
02:37:22,069 --> 02:37:26,631
I would imagine we won't end up with a full mass timber system, just for various reasons.

1542
02:37:26,691 --> 02:37:31,393
But we're in the woods, not just for the carbon footprint, but for the we-don't-miss-that-excitement.

1543
02:37:31,993 --> 02:37:34,154
So we should definitely study.

1544
02:37:34,774 --> 02:37:38,175
We'll see how it comes out in terms of the budget.

1545
02:37:39,916 --> 02:37:45,178
Using mass timber also allows for less use of other materials, like you can have exposed ceilings and things.

1546
02:37:46,159 --> 02:37:48,019
So there's the trade-off there.

1547
02:37:50,594 --> 02:37:55,296
And exposed wood has been shown to, you know, ties to biophilia.

1548
02:37:55,316 --> 02:38:05,500
There's a new healthfulness connection to it too.

1549
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:19,625
So I don't know very much about it, but in terms of typical facility volumes that utilize mass timber, is there any limit on the size of the structure?

1550
02:38:20,863 --> 02:38:25,846
or is there kind of like a do not exceed size for dealing with wood?

1551
02:38:26,106 --> 02:38:31,949
And I'm thinking about, you know, it's kind of inferior mechanical properties relative to metal.

1552
02:38:32,049 --> 02:38:36,092
And so like spans or something, you gotta think about stiffness and all that.

1553
02:38:36,112 --> 02:38:45,737
So I wonder, are there like some limitations on how big, from yesterday, I have an understanding that this is gonna be a very large structure.

1554
02:38:46,257 --> 02:38:49,719
And so if you could provide some commentary on applicability

1555
02:38:50,337 --> 02:38:54,101
of timber on a very, very large structure.

1556
02:38:54,141 --> 02:38:56,243
That's probably larger than what we have today.

1557
02:38:57,003 --> 02:38:58,985
Yeah, so I think there's two ways to think about it.

1558
02:38:59,085 --> 02:39:08,734
One is sort of what I was alluding to previously in terms of the structural grid dimensions that exist and sort of what timber can do in terms of traditional spans without getting too deep, right?

1559
02:39:08,774 --> 02:39:13,939
Because we're thinking about a renovation of this existing building with a 12 foot 10 floor to floor height.

1560
02:39:15,053 --> 02:39:28,085
dropping significant depths in terms of any type of structural frame is going to limit our ceiling heights and impact our indoor environment in terms of probably in a detrimental way in terms of making it feel very compressed.

1561
02:39:29,005 --> 02:39:37,113
But from like a how big can we go with the mass chamber from an overall building standpoint, I think that's really driven more by building code.

1562
02:39:37,173 --> 02:39:39,495
It's going to be like the limitation that gets put on that.

1563
02:39:39,855 --> 02:39:41,857
And that's true for any type of structural system.

1564
02:39:42,337 --> 02:39:52,200
gets classified into a particular construction type and we're allowed overall height limitations and horizontal distance limitations.

1565
02:39:52,720 --> 02:40:02,583
It's not to say that we can't separate the building using firewalls and other things to sort of extend the realistic extent of how far we can go with it.

1566
02:40:03,464 --> 02:40:10,366
It's really just being able to work through the constraints of the building code more than anything in terms of understanding how much we can do.

1567
02:40:10,856 --> 02:40:19,360
And is there like an additional burden for fire prevention and sprinklers and things like that relative to a concrete level structure or is it equivalent?

1568
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:31,545
So there definitely is a connection in terms of the relative fire resistance of any structural system and how far we can go before we have to separate the building or how high we can go before we separate the building.

1569
02:40:33,806 --> 02:40:39,529
The way that mass timber works is that it chars the structural or the building code assumes that it chars

1570
02:40:40,090 --> 02:40:43,651
on the outside before it completely fails in terms of a structure, right?

1571
02:40:43,711 --> 02:40:54,634
And so it's accounting for when they give us the area limitations and the height limitations, like the time involved in terms of fire tests and what it's been proven to.

1572
02:40:55,774 --> 02:41:00,256
Sprinkler systems will increase those limitations in terms of what we can build to.

1573
02:41:00,656 --> 02:41:04,737
Again, whether it's concrete or whether it's steel or whether it's wood of any type.

1574
02:41:05,517 --> 02:41:08,898
So all those things work together in terms of driving sort of

1575
02:41:09,294 --> 02:41:34,075
what each structural system might allow us to do, but definitely is connected into things like fire protection systems and fireproofing of the actual structural members themselves as well, whether that's like applying something to them, whether it's a mess encoding or spray fireproofing, or sort of wrapping the members with another type of material that's fire resistant, like a drywall or gypsum board.

1576
02:41:35,216 --> 02:41:36,917
So it's a lot of sort of

1577
02:41:37,462 --> 02:41:43,807
complex interrelationships from a building code perspective in terms of dictating what those restrictions are.

1578
02:41:45,749 --> 02:41:50,032
This school was built because the priory school burned down.

1579
02:41:50,072 --> 02:41:53,675
Concrete from a fire resistance standpoint is a wonderful material.

1580
02:41:53,695 --> 02:41:54,796
It will not burn.

1581
02:41:54,816 --> 02:42:01,001
And you can build as far as you want to and as high as you want to really without limitations is what the code tells us.

1582
02:42:01,461 --> 02:42:04,003
And that's sort of how that equates to its fire resistance.

1583
02:42:04,443 --> 02:42:05,404
So yes.

1584
02:42:06,953 --> 02:42:14,518
We'll certainly, well, one of the reasons why this was built out of concrete primarily, but we do have some steel, right, in terms of those longer span spaces.

1585
02:42:14,598 --> 02:42:15,099
All right.

1586
02:42:19,622 --> 02:42:23,184
Last comment.

1587
02:42:23,304 --> 02:42:27,267
We can always come back to it too.

1588
02:42:27,647 --> 02:42:28,168
All right.

1589
02:42:29,189 --> 02:42:31,590
So let's start real quick.

1590
02:42:31,870 --> 02:42:33,411
So, you know, last meeting,

1591
02:42:34,662 --> 02:42:45,105
There was obviously comments around daylight, obviously, maybe challenging or limited in this current structure.

1592
02:42:45,545 --> 02:42:58,429
The new design will definitely optimize access to views and daylight to the majority of the classrooms, programs based on possible, whether it's side or

1593
02:43:02,613 --> 02:43:06,755
you know, in some places will have top light, you know.

1594
02:43:08,315 --> 02:43:10,896
And then air quality was another.

1595
02:43:11,657 --> 02:43:17,659
So, you know, there's going to be more talk about this ventilation, obviously, ventilation quality.

1596
02:43:18,119 --> 02:43:26,383
Just quickly, LEED has a set of criteria that brings high environmental, high indoor air quality.

1597
02:43:27,329 --> 02:43:29,591
So all of those will be part of the project.

1598
02:43:29,691 --> 02:43:47,722
And then occupant experience in terms of interior lighting, acoustical, thermal comfort, all of those are also inherent in LEED, but that's not to say that there's going to be a set of discussion in criteria beyond LEED that's going to be brought up as part of the design of the project.

1599
02:43:47,862 --> 02:43:49,884
Operable windows, for example,

1600
02:43:52,270 --> 02:44:06,552
passive survival that was mentioned earlier on, there's potential to look into mixed mode in terms of using outdoor air when possible and natural ventilation when possible, et cetera.

1601
02:44:07,013 --> 02:44:10,293
And then the construction in the air quality practice.

1602
02:44:10,313 --> 02:44:20,955
So there's a whole set of lead that looks at the construction practices and sort of requires a set of practices that is going to sort of

1603
02:44:22,683 --> 02:44:26,964
help indoor air quality, so cleaning and flush out.

1604
02:44:27,064 --> 02:44:27,904
Flush out is big.

1605
02:44:27,964 --> 02:44:30,925
They actually, yeah, flush out is big.

1606
02:44:31,505 --> 02:44:32,905
And then there's testing.

1607
02:44:35,566 --> 02:44:38,086
And then healthfulness beyond LEED.

1608
02:44:38,546 --> 02:44:40,387
LEED requires redness materials.

1609
02:44:41,547 --> 02:44:42,387
There's a minimum.

1610
02:44:42,407 --> 02:44:50,069
We're currently applying redness material to a very high level in other projects, and so we're

1611
02:44:50,691 --> 02:44:59,535
Looking forward to share that expertise and those opportunities and that doesn't mean the fellow about the cost is gone, but it doesn't mean it's going to cost more.

1612
02:44:59,555 --> 02:45:01,416
It's about vetting the right materials.

1613
02:45:02,736 --> 02:45:13,281
Biophilia, the flush out, and then there's a whole component of healthfulness that's tied into the site and so

1614
02:45:13,982 --> 02:45:16,724
the site discussions are going to address this.

1615
02:45:16,804 --> 02:45:31,473
We're not going to go in detail about this today, but they're very much into looking at the major opportunities offered with the proximity of the bells and sort of the landscape around.

1616
02:45:32,493 --> 02:45:37,977
And then environmental literacy, you know, we talked about Aldo La Plata a bit.

1617
02:45:39,092 --> 02:45:40,393
that was brought up as well.

1618
02:45:40,433 --> 02:45:44,394
Green vegetative roots was something that was brought up that we'll talk about.

1619
02:45:44,454 --> 02:46:07,623
And then we usually do a quite extensive set of signage, which sort of combines all of the sustainability criteria throughout the school and combines it with sort of a set of imagery and language that can support the educational program.

1620
02:46:09,143 --> 02:46:31,531
In this project, you also have the great opportunity of your vocational program, which can be tied even more closely to sustainable design, whether it's certain things that they will do within their program, or whether it's interacting with some of the building components.

1621
02:46:33,031 --> 02:46:34,652
For example, the culinary,

1622
02:46:36,332 --> 02:46:42,835
can include a portion of the kitchen that's all electric, because that's where commercial kitchens are going.

1623
02:46:44,355 --> 02:46:51,278
The automotive can look into electric cars, right?

1624
02:46:51,518 --> 02:46:53,059
And things can be set up for it.

1625
02:46:53,099 --> 02:46:56,860
So those discussions are going to come through as we progress through the design.

1626
02:46:57,060 --> 02:46:59,201
Yeah, just with those two items, actually, in particular.

1627
02:46:59,221 --> 02:47:03,563
So the culinary arts folks are probably happy with doing fully electric kitchen already.

1628
02:47:04,277 --> 02:47:06,539
That will not be sort of a hill that we have to climb.

1629
02:47:06,999 --> 02:47:13,485
And certainly the automotive technology folks are asking us to plan for electric vehicle stations.

1630
02:47:13,525 --> 02:47:18,049
So they're very much on board here, I think, from a safety perspective in terms of where we're thinking.

1631
02:47:18,089 --> 02:47:23,734
I thought they just got a grant or something, a program to bring some equipment in just to be able to service electric cars.

1632
02:47:23,934 --> 02:47:24,335
They have.

1633
02:47:24,355 --> 02:47:31,021
There's a little bit of a spatial backup right now in terms of how many bays that they have to work with and what they can do.

1634
02:47:31,597 --> 02:47:34,960
Definitely, as we're planning, we're thinking of a specific base for EVs.

1635
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:41,144
The kitchen is a big deal because it ties into the code and the fossil.

1636
02:47:41,184 --> 02:47:52,012
So if we can eliminate the gas cooking in the teaching kitchen and in the main kitchen, then we're eliminating that PV requirement, that electrification requirement.

1637
02:47:52,032 --> 02:47:52,693
So that's great.

1638
02:47:52,713 --> 02:47:57,116
And actually, the main kitchen as well, all electric is going to be perfectly fine.

1639
02:47:58,513 --> 02:48:08,819
So Sonja, you had your hand up, and I'm also going to just note that we're happy to have Sonja here because of HMFH's work that they've done with red list materials through the MSBA.

1640
02:48:08,839 --> 02:48:11,180
There's a wealth of knowledge that we're definitely going to tap into.

1641
02:48:11,420 --> 02:48:14,041
Yeah, I think that's good.

1642
02:48:14,061 --> 02:48:18,564
I mean, red list materials are things that we can do on any project without additional costs.

1643
02:48:18,584 --> 02:48:25,787
There are a few particular components within buildings that do cost a little bit more, but it's in our brain.

1644
02:48:29,055 --> 02:48:43,918
I'm curious, and maybe it's because of my knowledge about this, if there's confusion around all-electric gas, because the option specialized doesn't require you to be all-electric.

1645
02:48:43,938 --> 02:48:45,378
You do have hybrid options, right?

1646
02:48:45,738 --> 02:48:48,898
However, LEED Me5, right?

1647
02:48:49,338 --> 02:48:51,779
There's an electrification requirement for LEED Me5.

1648
02:48:51,979 --> 02:48:52,779
It's a credit.

1649
02:48:52,799 --> 02:48:53,859
It's not a pre-req?

1650
02:48:54,139 --> 02:48:54,979
It's not a pre-req.

1651
02:48:55,099 --> 02:48:57,440
So that was my confusion, just wanted to make sure.

1652
02:48:59,952 --> 02:49:02,413
He's gone.

1653
02:49:02,793 --> 02:49:14,977
I don't remember everyone's names, but just to his point, I do want to acknowledge that that is a system option and that if we don't study it, I'm not certain we're showing people we've done our due diligence.

1654
02:49:15,797 --> 02:49:24,279
I think it's important for all residents or all Medford residents to understand that you have studied it and it doesn't pass out.

1655
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,460
I know it won't, but sometimes it does.

1656
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:29,441
And I think that's important for people to look at.

1657
02:49:29,995 --> 02:49:32,657
I know that if you use gas, you have to put it on the roof.

1658
02:49:32,757 --> 02:49:35,940
We should be putting it on the roof anyway, because that's what Medford requires.

1659
02:49:36,020 --> 02:49:38,902
And just because we're a school doesn't mean you shouldn't comply with that.

1660
02:49:39,643 --> 02:49:45,267
But I think that's important to acknowledge and bringing all community members along.

1661
02:49:45,287 --> 02:49:49,951
I think we have a pretty varied population here in Medford.

1662
02:49:49,971 --> 02:49:54,014
And I think it's important that when we go to vote for this, we show that we've done that diligently.

1663
02:49:54,074 --> 02:49:56,016
So what you're suggesting is that

1664
02:49:57,150 --> 02:50:03,735
on top of the all-electric options, and you look at a natural gas option, which we have done in other projects, and we can certainly do that.

1665
02:50:03,775 --> 02:50:04,196
Yeah, I do.

1666
02:50:05,156 --> 02:50:09,039
I don't prefer that, and I think we should go ground-source heat pumps all the way.

1667
02:50:09,059 --> 02:50:10,180
It's going to be the most efficient.

1668
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:12,562
It will have the better payback, if it's viable.

1669
02:50:13,763 --> 02:50:15,604
That's my personal viewpoint on that.

1670
02:50:15,624 --> 02:50:16,845
I think that's the way to go.

1671
02:50:16,865 --> 02:50:26,333
I think we should figure that out, whether or not there's an additional system, because ground-source isn't always the most efficient for all of the things that you're doing inside these buildings.

1672
02:50:27,663 --> 02:50:37,650
So the one thing I want to say is when we look at that, because of the specialized food, the cost of the natural grass is going to have to improve the solar photovoltaic.

1673
02:50:37,770 --> 02:50:38,431
Absolutely.

1674
02:50:38,531 --> 02:50:39,331
I totally agree.

1675
02:50:39,391 --> 02:50:40,952
Whereas the all electric one.

1676
02:50:40,972 --> 02:50:44,475
So it's going to have to be a real comparison.

1677
02:50:44,495 --> 02:50:51,599
So everybody understand what's implied into choosing the fossil fuel versus the all electric.

1678
02:50:51,619 --> 02:50:53,401
That's part of the story.

1679
02:50:53,821 --> 02:50:56,863
And sometimes the added cost of solar sort of

1680
02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:05,223
brings that up in cost so that it looks like a better, not maybe better comparison, but it's more similar comparison to ground source heat pumps or air source heat pumps.

1681
02:51:05,624 --> 02:51:07,264
I'm glad to see we're not studying BRF.

1682
02:51:07,324 --> 02:51:09,585
I'm not a fan of that.

1683
02:51:09,725 --> 02:51:12,687
And I think it's great for a school not to consider that at all.

1684
02:51:13,547 --> 02:51:22,471
I know that that's, I don't know if mass save incentives are changing at all, but it'd be really good to understand where the heat pump adders are in terms of our reimbursement separate from MSBA.

1685
02:51:23,541 --> 02:51:27,103
So when we get into the LCCA, I can explain that.

1686
02:51:27,183 --> 02:51:35,088
It's too bad he had to leave, but hopefully he'll watch the record of it because we're going to talk about this.

1687
02:51:35,188 --> 02:51:36,528
Yeah, absolutely.

1688
02:51:36,568 --> 02:51:41,811
The incentives are something we need to make sure that we pursue upfront.

1689
02:51:42,072 --> 02:51:51,337
And we should be, we'll probably be connecting with them towards the end of feasibility or right at the beginning of SDI.

1690
02:51:51,717 --> 02:51:53,078
There needs to be a connection soon.

1691
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:55,451
That's right.

1692
02:51:55,872 --> 02:52:02,998
I do also think there have been a couple of comments about the passive house.

1693
02:52:03,038 --> 02:52:06,341
Passive house certification.

1694
02:52:08,803 --> 02:52:19,252
There was an excellent webinar on that through B plus the other day, which is architect's jargon for extra learning credits.

1695
02:52:19,312 --> 02:52:19,952
And so anyway.

1696
02:52:21,297 --> 02:52:37,607
And I think that should, we should talk about this here as like a serious topic, because I think there are a lot of soft costs added to that that will make it, that are pretty significant, that I'm not sure people really understand, although like in terms of energy modeling, you were the expert on that team.

1697
02:52:38,087 --> 02:52:44,551
But I know that that versus Teddy can be tricky in trying to convey what that means to everyone.

1698
02:52:44,571 --> 02:52:50,675
Yeah, the school is over 0.5 CFM per square foot, so we can curb our own Teddy.

1699
02:52:51,216 --> 02:52:52,536
Okay, well, that's good to know.

1700
02:52:53,577 --> 02:53:08,022
But we absolutely can, because we've done that, we have an idea of some of the cost of passive out, so we can bring that in as an item, because it was brought up, and so we took notes, and we can certainly do that.

1701
02:53:08,262 --> 02:53:11,243
But to your point about the 157 options,

1702
02:53:14,125 --> 02:53:14,305
29, just 29.

1703
02:53:14,565 --> 02:53:15,466
Oh, that's what it was.

1704
02:53:15,506 --> 02:53:16,386
Some of them were grayed out.

1705
02:53:16,406 --> 02:53:17,547
Well, I think that's important.

1706
02:53:17,567 --> 02:53:19,989
Like you've done a lot of research to narrow that down already.

1707
02:53:20,009 --> 02:53:20,569
I think that's great.

1708
02:53:20,589 --> 02:53:25,052
But if we're going passive house, they require you to analyze the envelope, right?

1709
02:53:25,132 --> 02:53:28,214
And to your point about understanding whether or not

1710
02:53:44,125 --> 02:53:48,648
One building is better than the other, like envelope area is a big one, right?

1711
02:53:48,808 --> 02:53:50,629
And we know that Paxipas looks at that.

1712
02:53:50,729 --> 02:54:01,516
So I know we haven't narrowed down the criteria for what, like how we're going to add these like MVP sustainability things to help narrow that down.

1713
02:54:02,056 --> 02:54:07,340
But I think like trying to figure out where this is going for those particular goals,

1714
02:54:09,428 --> 02:54:13,410
I think there's a huge difference between a goal and a strategy, right?

1715
02:54:13,550 --> 02:54:14,770
We're here to set goals.

1716
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:16,391
You're here to give us strategies.

1717
02:54:17,311 --> 02:54:20,112
And so we want to be able to be effective in setting those goals.

1718
02:54:20,172 --> 02:54:29,396
And so trying to understand what that means here, I think, is really important.

1719
02:54:29,436 --> 02:54:29,776
Yep.

1720
02:54:29,816 --> 02:54:30,056
Thank you.

1721
02:54:30,136 --> 02:54:31,296
I do think that's great.

1722
02:54:31,336 --> 02:54:35,638
And that's great to hear your feedback on that, because you look like that.

1723
02:54:36,270 --> 02:54:37,570
you know, we'll take that back.

1724
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:40,771
And I think your comment about passive house is well taken.

1725
02:54:40,791 --> 02:54:45,113
Yeah, I think there's another level to it as well in terms of the soft costs that are associated, right?

1726
02:54:45,133 --> 02:54:49,694
There's one thing to design passive house with passive house strategies, right?

1727
02:54:49,794 --> 02:55:02,098
So that we minimize loss through the envelope and we sort of try to minimize the amount of ventilation that we're going to be having to expend energy on versus actually going for a certification

1728
02:55:02,642 --> 02:55:06,965
and paying sort of for the third party oversight, registration, those types of things.

1729
02:55:06,985 --> 02:55:13,129
So we probably need to make that decision as well, or a recommendation for that decision as we go forward.

1730
02:55:13,589 --> 02:55:20,453
But we can start to get a little bit of a sense of what the soft costs are as well, on top of like the capital costs that would actually go into the building.

1731
02:55:21,074 --> 02:55:28,598
I think there's a good broader point that was mentioned earlier as well that, you know, the sign on the building is nice.

1732
02:55:28,678 --> 02:55:30,940
It's something that the community can sort of hold up.

1733
02:55:31,722 --> 02:55:36,927
But at the end of the day, that might be nice for the ribbon cutting.

1734
02:55:37,648 --> 02:55:41,431
But at the end of the day, the utility costs are going to be what they are.

1735
02:55:42,712 --> 02:55:55,144
And some of these other, as we're thinking about what's the payback on the structure, well, there's been a lot of money spent to get that certification just for the sake of getting the certification.

1736
02:55:55,164 --> 02:55:56,926
It doesn't, I don't know.

1737
02:55:57,617 --> 02:55:59,057
It's not like it's designed better.

1738
02:55:59,297 --> 02:56:00,598
It's designed to happen.

1739
02:56:00,858 --> 02:56:01,518
Yeah, that's right.

1740
02:56:01,738 --> 02:56:05,538
Design it to what the certification says and commission it.

1741
02:56:05,598 --> 02:56:14,380
But then if we don't go forward with the certification, the students are still getting the positive value, and the educators are still getting the positive value.

1742
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:15,940
From the efficiency that we have.

1743
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:17,840
And the taxpayers.

1744
02:56:18,421 --> 02:56:25,062
And as an undergraduate president, it's easy to understand cost-benefit analyses for a lot of decisions.

1745
02:56:25,582 --> 02:56:27,202
Because one thing that we can't escape

1746
02:56:27,719 --> 02:56:31,280
is the square footage of what is proposed is enormous.

1747
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,481
And that's a direct proxy for cost.

1748
02:56:34,261 --> 02:56:36,662
And regardless of what we do, it's going to be a big number.

1749
02:56:37,242 --> 02:56:39,342
So now we want to start adding things in.

1750
02:56:39,682 --> 02:56:44,184
They have to be justified, because they're not going to be aggregated to a big number.

1751
02:56:44,224 --> 02:56:47,725
They're going to be piling onto an already big number.

1752
02:56:48,125 --> 02:56:55,667
But I think it's also looking at the life cycle costs, because it's also projecting into the future, because it's not just what we're building today.

1753
02:56:56,227 --> 02:57:13,320
I mean, we can put all these elements in, and it's not what is, you know, yeah, the certifications are nice, but it's what do we put in today when we have costs that are being partially paid for today, and we're getting help being paid for, but we're not going to have help with the operating costs down the line.

1754
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:20,925
And I think that's critical to think about, too, is how do we operate this building in the future and what's going to pay for it in the future to operate.

1755
02:57:20,945 --> 02:57:23,547
Are there things beyond the need, like,

1756
02:57:24,784 --> 02:57:28,346
with water that we can look at, and we didn't really talk anything about water consumption.

1757
02:57:28,366 --> 02:57:29,246
Yeah, we're cool.

1758
02:57:32,288 --> 02:57:38,931
So yes, these things we're going to dive more into.

1759
02:57:39,911 --> 02:57:41,852
I think there's free swim in the mornings.

1760
02:57:42,433 --> 02:57:47,015
But all these different areas of sustainable design

1761
02:57:47,816 --> 02:57:53,281
um, coming from your comments and also from lead are gonna be- are gonna be in- in future meetings.

1762
02:57:53,321 --> 02:57:55,162
They're gonna be looked into in more detail.

1763
02:57:55,182 --> 02:57:59,426
We just browse through it now because we don't have the time, just like we're browsing.

1764
02:58:00,586 --> 02:58:03,929
So we are in a- I'm cognizant of the fact that we have five minutes left.

1765
02:58:04,009 --> 02:58:05,370
I see that Jenny has her hand up.

1766
02:58:05,390 --> 02:58:10,354
So I wanna give you just a- a couple minutes, Jenny, and then I just wanna wrap us up at the end.

1767
02:58:10,374 --> 02:58:16,419
Um, again, I- I think we actually have touched on a lot of what we've gone through, um, with the slides.

1768
02:58:16,439 --> 02:58:16,559
Right.

1769
02:58:17,724 --> 02:58:19,465
Hopefully people don't feel like they're missing out.

1770
02:58:19,485 --> 02:58:22,407
Just for everyone, for the person that had to go.

1771
02:58:22,648 --> 02:58:27,151
So the life cycle cost analysis is this 50-year life cycle cost analysis.

1772
02:58:27,411 --> 02:58:30,453
It's done required by MSBA.

1773
02:58:30,873 --> 02:58:33,115
And it's not just comparing the systems.

1774
02:58:33,315 --> 02:58:39,880
It's comparing the whole building, enclosure, electrical, and mechanical.

1775
02:58:40,520 --> 02:58:45,424
And it's looking at first cost, which is what you're referring to.

1776
02:58:46,134 --> 02:58:56,043
Installation costs versus first cost, replacement costs throughout those 15 years, so it touches on some operating costs and maintenance costs, on top of energy costs.

1777
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:58,905
All of those are combined over 50 years.

1778
02:58:59,345 --> 02:59:00,927
We put in cost escalation.

1779
02:59:00,987 --> 02:59:06,491
We also look at upfront incremental costs, comparing the systems, improving the fossil fuel.

1780
02:59:07,012 --> 02:59:10,615
And we also add on to those potential incentives.

1781
02:59:11,055 --> 02:59:11,716
I'll leave it to that.

1782
02:59:12,163 --> 02:59:20,881
We can talk about more at the next meeting, but it's pretty comprehensive and I think it will help the conversation, support the conversation for our systems.

1783
02:59:21,683 --> 02:59:22,525
Okay, Jenny, go ahead.

1784
02:59:23,719 --> 02:59:24,179
Thanks, Matt.

1785
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:33,123
I just wanted to maybe flag a couple of things and thank everyone for their thoughts.

1786
02:59:33,664 --> 02:59:36,985
There's been some really interesting things discussed.

1787
02:59:37,065 --> 02:59:40,487
And I'm not an expert in this area, so I definitely am learning a lot.

1788
02:59:40,947 --> 02:59:50,391
The two things I wanted to flag is that when the school committee commissioned the building committee, they did set forth a goal of LEED B5.

1789
02:59:51,652 --> 03:00:13,708
So that's not to say the school committee would be completely unwilling to understand what the impact of that was, but that original charge did provide some language about our collective sustainability goals and that being sort of pushed towards the gold standard was important.

1790
03:00:13,808 --> 03:00:15,810
So I do think we need to

1791
03:00:17,215 --> 03:00:20,877
continue to consider that as an option so that we can make informed decisions.

1792
03:00:22,077 --> 03:00:30,281
I am a huge fan of not saying no to things at this early stage, because we don't know enough to say no.

1793
03:00:30,381 --> 03:00:31,202
We don't want things.

1794
03:00:33,503 --> 03:00:41,747
And I just want to sort of flag that I'm super supportive of looking at all the options, whether they're ones I particularly like or don't like.

1795
03:00:43,387 --> 03:01:01,896
And then I think the other thing, Matt, that maybe we can talk about offline is to provide this group and the public in general with some transparency on what it costs in the current environment to heat and electrify this building.

1796
03:01:02,136 --> 03:01:02,517
It is like

1797
03:01:03,237 --> 03:01:19,305
The numbers are just shocking like I intuitively know that they're high and they surprise me every time that I hear about them so I and I don't think the sort of general public has any sense of what those numbers are.

1798
03:01:20,806 --> 03:01:33,349
and they're not particularly easy to find, but I think we can do a better job of helping people understand this current building and what it costs us because I think that's hugely important.

1799
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:46,372
And I think the other thing that was sort of on my mind as I was listening to the conversation is how helpful this group will be when we are thinking about criteria by which to

1800
03:01:47,472 --> 03:02:04,059
make narrowing down kinds of decisions so that we aren't throwing the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, but instead sort of thinking about the expertise in this room and the people who do this work for a living helping guide us.

1801
03:02:04,140 --> 03:02:05,820
So I appreciate everyone who's been here.

1802
03:02:06,481 --> 03:02:11,963
And Matt, we can talk about some of those other things at some point in time and maybe bring those things back to this group.

1803
03:02:13,764 --> 03:02:14,124
That's great.

1804
03:02:15,169 --> 03:02:20,213
Okay, and so to wrap up in a minute, or probably a little less than a minute, again, we're gonna be meeting in March.

1805
03:02:20,273 --> 03:02:24,317
March 11th is the next date for this advisory team to get together.

1806
03:02:24,377 --> 03:02:25,458
It's gonna be at 4 p.m.

1807
03:02:25,938 --> 03:02:27,419
We'll most likely be in this room.

1808
03:02:27,439 --> 03:02:32,043
I think we're still gonna keep the hybrid format, because this has worked pretty well.

1809
03:02:32,063 --> 03:02:42,672
In terms of the activity that we're gonna be doing, again, you may have all heard this as you came in towards the end of the last meeting, but for record purposes and those online, we will be,

1810
03:02:43,857 --> 03:02:51,979
Coming up with a series of line item recommendations and like an Excel document, we're going to be using a traffic signal analogy.

1811
03:02:51,999 --> 03:03:01,722
We're going to be treating some of these things as given recommendations, things that there's no question or discussion and everyone's in agreement that we'll make a recommendation back to the building committee on.

1812
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:08,463
There will be some yellow flashing light items that are going to warrant discussion that will use the time to actually work our way through.

1813
03:03:08,483 --> 03:03:18,086
And then there may also be some red light options that are just things that are not going to be recommended to be included in the project moving forward.

1814
03:03:18,827 --> 03:03:23,288
So again, these recommendations, this group is not making decisions on those items.

1815
03:03:23,629 --> 03:03:26,710
We're going to be forwarding recommendations back to the building committee

1816
03:03:27,660 --> 03:03:34,202
as a group and it'll be sort of in a line item type of format with these sort of colors associated with them.

1817
03:03:34,962 --> 03:03:40,384
Luke has one final question and still under passed, not seven o'clock yet, but it may go there.

1818
03:03:40,624 --> 03:03:41,884
Hopefully it's a productive question.

1819
03:03:41,904 --> 03:03:46,986
So, you know, let's see, we've got a couple of months until March.

1820
03:03:48,006 --> 03:03:50,607
There are a lot of things that we have not talked about.

1821
03:03:51,567 --> 03:03:56,989
I appreciate the overview and introduction to a lot of different concepts, some technologies,

1822
03:03:58,488 --> 03:04:12,875
But there are a lot of things that I've seen at other schools that I think are really good in terms of energy efficiency, in terms of a lot of secondary benefits, well, specific technologies that haven't been brought up.

1823
03:04:14,136 --> 03:04:16,878
And I understand that we're tied on time.

1824
03:04:16,978 --> 03:04:19,019
We have an hour and a half, and there's a lot to get through.

1825
03:04:19,099 --> 03:04:22,961
And we always ask questions, and so we slur these out.

1826
03:04:24,662 --> 03:04:26,723
There's only so much credit to the hour and a half.

1827
03:04:28,448 --> 03:04:50,156
Prior to this meeting, where we're going to be stoplighting or traffic coloring different ideas, preferences, I was wondering, should we expect any lead-aheads, or should we expect any solicitations where we can suggest some technologies to consider as part of the stoplighting activity?

1828
03:04:50,196 --> 03:04:53,618
The one that I'll just make a plug for that I really like,

1829
03:04:55,258 --> 03:05:06,361
If we have a tall vertical structure, and we have a lot of different shapes to work through, and it may not be tall vertical, but if it is tall vertical, are there ways to harness just the natural wind?

1830
03:05:07,261 --> 03:05:08,782
We're already pretty high up.

1831
03:05:09,202 --> 03:05:11,403
We're probably like 100 feet up.

1832
03:05:12,063 --> 03:05:17,064
So there's some of that to tap into for energy savings.

1833
03:05:17,684 --> 03:05:22,146
And light wells that Arlington did really, really well.

1834
03:05:25,385 --> 03:05:40,190
I walked through there when they had the open house in the community and thought that the effect was really great.

1835
03:05:40,571 --> 03:05:44,592
And it varies as you go through the elevation.

1836
03:05:45,212 --> 03:05:47,013
But it was really great in the library.

1837
03:05:48,373 --> 03:05:53,315
But it was also really effective at bringing daylight into a large volume that

1838
03:05:53,743 --> 03:05:57,525
If it were closed, you'd be spending money to illuminate, right?

1839
03:05:58,285 --> 03:06:02,927
So schools held during the day, let's not call it a little bit of sunshine.

1840
03:06:03,307 --> 03:06:07,209
We happen to be pretty high up, and there's really not a lot of tree obscuration.

1841
03:06:07,649 --> 03:06:11,250
So, you know, I want to make a plug for quite a while.

1842
03:06:11,270 --> 03:06:19,974
So I think with those types of things, I think, yes, we'll find a mechanism probably through the whole building committee that people can bring up ideas.

1843
03:06:20,434 --> 03:06:22,315
We have that connection to the committee as well.

1844
03:06:23,110 --> 03:06:29,232
So maybe we can work with you just as sort of being a conduit to sort of bring some of those ideas in and include them in the list for consideration.

1845
03:06:29,632 --> 03:06:38,454
Can I just ask you a question about that, just for everyone to think of, like, those are really great strategies for achieving a goal, right?

1846
03:06:39,274 --> 03:06:41,555
So those light wells, the goal is daylight autonomy.

1847
03:06:41,855 --> 03:06:51,918
So maybe that's something that we discuss here as a goal, so that they can start to consider things like light wells or the wind, like the purpose of that is

1848
03:06:53,320 --> 03:06:53,900
Zero energy?

1849
03:06:55,501 --> 03:06:56,461
Times your enemy, though.

1850
03:06:56,741 --> 03:06:59,383
Because in June, you have to have a horse.

1851
03:06:59,563 --> 03:07:01,904
But you have to have goals before you can develop strategies.

1852
03:07:01,924 --> 03:07:06,826
So I think we don't want to put the cart before the horse in this sense, right?

1853
03:07:06,926 --> 03:07:09,747
So I think those are excellent strategies.

1854
03:07:09,767 --> 03:07:14,069
And I do think we should keep them as means for us achieving goals.

1855
03:07:14,789 --> 03:07:18,891
But understanding what the actual goal is, I think, is our task.

1856
03:07:20,832 --> 03:07:22,713
And then you get to decide what the strategies are.

1857
03:07:23,745 --> 03:07:36,154
I don't think our agenda, like meeting agendas, just being devil's advocate, I'm not being argumentative, but from what I've seen, you know, with our prepared agendas, we're not on a path to develop a course.

1858
03:07:38,055 --> 03:07:47,121
In time for when a preferred design is being sort of presented to the NSPA, we would have to potentially change approach.

1859
03:07:47,622 --> 03:07:50,884
I mean, the recommended approach, design approach is going to be

1860
03:07:51,433 --> 03:07:55,134
at schematic design when that final package goes in, which is not till 2027.

1861
03:07:55,835 --> 03:07:56,735
I agree.

1862
03:07:57,635 --> 03:07:58,135
OK.

1863
03:07:58,415 --> 03:08:01,036
I thought we had a June, July deadline.

1864
03:08:01,877 --> 03:08:07,098
That's a preferred schematic report, but it's going to be at still a higher level where we do want to identify.

1865
03:08:07,218 --> 03:08:07,819
Oh, all right.

1866
03:08:07,859 --> 03:08:08,899
So we actually lost track.

1867
03:08:09,139 --> 03:08:09,459
Yes.

1868
03:08:09,699 --> 03:08:11,940
There's more plot for this level.

1869
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:16,542
There will be top lining because our schools are top lining.

1870
03:08:16,562 --> 03:08:17,322
But to me,

1871
03:08:20,829 --> 03:08:24,172
SUNY's point, you know, is there a specific goal for it?

1872
03:08:24,452 --> 03:08:28,915
You know, that's something that we want to hear.

1873
03:08:28,935 --> 03:08:32,738
I thought we had a much shorter response.

1874
03:08:33,179 --> 03:08:38,943
What you're seeing in those 29 options is high level massing.

1875
03:08:39,964 --> 03:08:42,406
A lot of the design is not in there yet.

1876
03:08:42,966 --> 03:08:44,127
Right.

1877
03:08:44,567 --> 03:08:46,509
But that's not to say that

1878
03:08:47,559 --> 03:08:53,283
all of those items that you feel near and dear for, they need to be brought up now.

1879
03:08:53,343 --> 03:08:55,905
They can be integrated.

1880
03:08:56,706 --> 03:09:03,671
I think that was the end of feasibility into schematic design, but it's best to bring some of those now on the scene.

1881
03:09:04,432 --> 03:09:12,218
I'm going to cut us off because we are five minutes over, and we certainly appreciate anyone that has hung out with us, but I do want to respect people's time.

1882
03:09:12,678 --> 03:09:12,918
Thank you.

1883
03:09:12,958 --> 03:09:16,281
This was a wonderful discussion, and I really do appreciate the level

1884
03:09:17,223 --> 03:09:23,843
understanding and feedback that we've been able to get from this group that's just really invaluable in terms of the process.

1885
03:09:23,863 --> 03:09:24,265
So thank you.
