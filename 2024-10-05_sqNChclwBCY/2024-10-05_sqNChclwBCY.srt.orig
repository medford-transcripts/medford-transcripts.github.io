00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:13,798

29
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:21,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caravelle did not run this year, even though I wanted to, but Dave said they wanted to get the Friday event done before dark.

35
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,296
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a great event on both days.

36
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And just want to thank Dave and all the staff for bringing the race to the city.

45
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 26 million Americans of Italian descent currently reside in the United States, making up America's seventh largest ethnic group.

46
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

47
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:38,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to acknowledge that this Italian heritage month in the country as proclaimed by the president, and I would like to proclaim something for all the Italians in Metro.

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:47,209
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still a lot of, you know, still a lot of Italians still living in this city, and I would like to see something done by the city to recognize him.

49
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,590
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done flag raising for

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,934
[SPEAKER_07]: every nationality that's had a day.

51
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:59,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen anything proposed by the city to acknowledge the Italian Americans in Method.

52
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:07,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would hope the administration would offer a flag raising day or something to acknowledge the Italian Americans living in the city of Method.

53
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:09,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

54
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:10,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpallo.

55
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

56
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:15,560
[SPEAKER_10]: As a first-generation U.S.

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:31,553
[SPEAKER_10]: resident and Method resident, I was born to Italian-born parents who grew up in northern Italy in two little towns in Calabria.

58
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:38,138
[SPEAKER_10]: And they came to this country, the greatest country in the world, to make something of themselves and for their families and start

59
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,036
[SPEAKER_10]: the legacy that they would be proud of.

60
00:04:42,697 --> 00:05:06,432
[SPEAKER_10]: They came to this community and they loved Medford and appreciate Councilor Knight, excuse me, Councilor Carviello for speaking earlier, but you have to understand there's still so many Italian Americans in Medford that were raised like me and have parents like mine and the sacrifices they made and to be just part of that

61
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:13,115
[SPEAKER_10]: that history and that pride of being an American citizen.

62
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny, my dad, while my mother raised, well, she parented four children on her own, while my dad worked as a member of Revere Sugar, he worked at a meat packing company and at glass cutting.

63
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:41,331
[SPEAKER_10]: company while going to Don Bosco High School to learn English because, as he said it, it was his honor to learn the language of the great country he moved to.

64
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:48,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that stands for a lot of Italian-Americans, proud Italian-Americans that live in Medford today.

65
00:05:49,495 --> 00:06:06,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to acknowledge that fact that this is a good time to mention what they've done to make Medford what it is today, whether it's the arts, whether it's education, whether it's, you know, in the, you know,

66
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,982
[SPEAKER_10]: the political field.

67
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:13,947
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Italian Americans, greatness all over this community.

68
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:21,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate is bringing this forward and acknowledging this this time for the Italian Americans of metric.

69
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:22,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

70
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:24,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

71
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caravallo and Councilor Scarcelli for putting this on the agenda.

72
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:34,457
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also really great to get two Italian Americans to be able to put this on the agenda.

73
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:47,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I said this last year, but one of the most interesting experiences for me going to college was that I realized that not everyone had the chance to learn Italian in school.

74
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:48,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, unfortunate.

75
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're really fortunate to have that in Medford.

76
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,454
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think that makes us really unique and our history really unique.

77
00:06:56,634 --> 00:07:02,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, you know, I think there's so many ways, as a son of immigrants, I know how important it is to celebrate your heritage.

78
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:07,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's so many ways to celebrate Italian American heritage here that we really can

79
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:09,552
[SPEAKER_13]: do more to embrace that.

80
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:22,616
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Councillor Knight has said time and time again, creating a zone in South Medford where we can capture that heritage and maybe even take advantage of state grants and funds for that.

81
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,577
[SPEAKER_13]: When I went to San Diego,

82
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:38,844
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the little Italy over there does a great job in terms of honoring its Italian American residents, there's such a rich history there so many so much work that telling Americans have put into shape our community.

83
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,026
[SPEAKER_13]: The way it is today and.

84
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this is something that came across a few years ago when this was a hot button issue.

85
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:52,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we really need to do more to acknowledge the fact that it was a really difficult time for Italian-Americans who came here.

86
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,294
[SPEAKER_13]: They did face a lot of discrimination.

87
00:07:55,255 --> 00:08:03,638
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we can do more to celebrate the triumph of Italian-Americans and face that discrimination as well.

88
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:11,322
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd be very happy to support, you know, a flag raising or some ceremony festival here.

89
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:16,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really happy to see that we were able to get the Italian festival here in Medford this year.

90
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:21,748
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I think this is one of the ways that we can bring our community back together.

91
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:23,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

92
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice Mayor Farris.

93
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

94
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for putting this resolution on.

95
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:32,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree that celebrating

96
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Italian American heritage in the city is so important.

97
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:41,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think that we try to, each of us individually, maybe do it every day.

98
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:44,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That might just be me in where I shop and what I eat.

99
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:49,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's not just those little things.

100
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I think having something official is of value to everybody as well.

101
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would certainly support that.

102
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to note that I'm on a collaboratively kick.

103
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:01,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Councilor Scarbelli for bringing up collaboratively.

104
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the best.

105
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best.

106
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:07,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say hallelujah, especially for Christophero Colombo.

124
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:14,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And Paul and Judy are both owners of that store that continued there, and probably two of the finest people you ever want to meet.

125
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And Judy passed away this week after a life he gave us.

186
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:10,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And then any extended hours, you have to come back for a special permit?

187
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:10,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

188
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:14,408

[SPEAKER_11]: So I will turn it over to the petitioner and just name and address for the record, please.

331
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Madam President and the City Council.

332
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Turning to Jim Heffernan of Richmond, APC, Boston, Massachusetts.

333
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with Verdant Bio and CI Design.

334
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everybody.

335
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:31,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Doug Medvets, 45 West 3rd Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

336
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:39,111
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the co-principals at Verdant, I just wanted to introduce our group and the project briefly.

337
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,192
[SPEAKER_14]: We are a scientist-led development group.

338
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:53,097
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we've been excited about is building life science and lab space from a little bit different perspective.

339
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:57,859
[SPEAKER_14]: And we chose this lot at 243 Mystic for a variety of reasons.

340
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very great location for what we want to do.

341
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,081
[SPEAKER_14]: We're focused on.

342
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,188
[SPEAKER_14]: very early stage companies coming into this property.

343
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:13,557
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of the location, because of its proximity to transportation, we just think it's a very good location to build lab space.

344
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:17,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

345
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:30,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And as noted tonight, this is a request for your vote to approve the PDD, PDD2, you already had a PDD1 that was here last month.

346
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:39,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, just to give context in the process, we're in step six and seven of the nine step process of the zoning PDD amendment.

347
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We were really since March to April in planning phases and formal meetings.

348
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:54,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met with the community development board, city planning staff, informal meetings and formal meetings in May, June.

349
00:23:55,262 --> 00:24:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: July was a month where myself and your representation worked through the draft ordinance with some back and forth, which I'll go through.

350
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:06,589
[SPEAKER_06]: August 2nd was our first public hearing.

351
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That was before the Community Development Board.

352
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Then this was referred to you on August 10th.

353
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We were present just to introduce ourselves that night.

354
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:23,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it went back to the Community Development Board, who unanimously approved it in September.

355
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So that brings us here tonight.

356
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought before I went through the ordinance, it was suggested maybe we show you kind of an idea of the projects we're thinking here.

357
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not, I'll just reiterate, it's not approving the actual project.

358
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:46,229
[SPEAKER_06]: The next following steps would be us filing a special permit, which would be back before you as the special granting authority.

359
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,490
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will not be the last time you see us.

360
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:54,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we thought we'll show kind of the concepts of why it relates to the zoning ordinance.

361
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll turn this over to CI Design.

362
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:01,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Attorney Heffernan.

363
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:04,757
[SPEAKER_12]: My name's Matthew Juros from CI Design in Boston.

364
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:10,520
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to press some buttons here and see if I can share my screen.

365
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:25,067
[SPEAKER_12]: So host disabled participant screen sharing is what I see.

366
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:30,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it?

367
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:33,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

368
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,481
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, should work now.

369
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,201
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, good.

370
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't mute my audio.

371
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:37,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that OK?

372
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:40,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

373
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,087
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't let me mute the audio.

374
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to leave it unmuted.

375
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:48,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you want to unmute, or no?

376
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,153
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I thought we needed to mute it.

377
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:52,674
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you are muted.

378
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:54,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you are muted.

379
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:54,495
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good.

380
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

381
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I was missing you when I was online.

382
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:15,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well thanks for taking some time with us, members of the Council and Madam President again I'm Matthew churros from CI design and, you know, I'm attorney Heffernan is done a lot of work, working out the zoning ordinance in this area and, you know,

383
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:29,147
[SPEAKER_12]: We're fans of this type of work and sort of fits our stock and trade, but pictures and descriptions of the buildings that we're interested in building are really what I think is the story here.

384
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:35,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanted to take a few minutes to just sort of talk you through what our thoughts were in the very early stages of design.

385
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:44,696
[SPEAKER_12]: The things that are most concrete in our minds are the square footages in the program, the size, the height, and so forth, and the aesthetic treatment

386
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,443
[SPEAKER_12]: is in development and will continue to develop.

387
00:26:49,563 --> 00:26:56,348
[SPEAKER_12]: In plan, we have Mystic Ave here, and I think my cursor is visible, there it is, and Harvard Street.

388
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,511
[SPEAKER_12]: The site is right on the corner of those two streets.

389
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:08,257
[SPEAKER_12]: On the ground floor, we have room for a lobby up on the Mystic Ave side and an exit for an exit stair.

390
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:16,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Vehicles enter on the Harvard Street side as far away from the intersection as we can get.

391
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,361
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a loading dock for supplies and trash to be taken away.

392
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:28,764
[SPEAKER_12]: There's room for a parking system and surface spaces that would accommodate 27 vehicles, I believe.

393
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:32,285
[SPEAKER_12]: And the upper floors for the lab floors are identical.

394
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:38,187
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll have toilet rooms and exit stairs and utility space and so forth.

395
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,523
[SPEAKER_12]: function itself is a two-part enterprise.

396
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Most lab buildings follow this pattern.

397
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:54,790
[SPEAKER_12]: And what you see is that there's lab benches that you imagine people in white coats and beakers doing their work at.

398
00:27:55,351 --> 00:28:01,115
[SPEAKER_12]: But for each lab bench station, there's also an office cubicle.

399
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:08,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Because really, I'll say 50% or more of the work that is done in this type of science

400
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:12,160
[SPEAKER_12]: is data sorting, assessment, and so forth.

401
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the office piece is actually a big part of a, quote unquote, lab.

402
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:23,188
[SPEAKER_12]: The exterior of the building is shown in four elevations here.

403
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:29,593
[SPEAKER_12]: The Mystic Ave elevation is very similar to the Harvard Street.

404
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:33,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And those will have a series of vertical fins and glazing behind them.

405
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:39,294
[SPEAKER_12]: northern elevation and the western elevation are opaque.

406
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:48,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go back to the site plan for a second, and we see that the western elevation here and the northern elevation are nearly zero lot line conditions.

407
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:58,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in order to build a building that close to a neighboring lot line, we have to have a two hour fire rated wall, which includes the ability to have windows in those walls.

408
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:04,631
[SPEAKER_12]: In the walls without windows, we have included a continuation of the verticals,

409
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:19,716
[SPEAKER_12]: bands, and you can see that they have a varied profile, and we'll see in a shadow study in a moment that that profile on the north and west elevations is intended to cast a series of shadows that changes as the sun travels around the site.

410
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:29,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And far from presenting sort of a blank wall to the neighbors, our interest is in making it consistent and really a beautiful changing part of the building.

411
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:33,999
[SPEAKER_12]: A diagram of how the building works in section.

412
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:43,953
[SPEAKER_12]: has parking and services and lobby on the ground floor level, labs, lab support, and offices also on each of the upper levels.

413
00:29:45,354 --> 00:30:04,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we get to the top two levels, the tenant that we're working with envisions having a studio space where they will do a certain amount of pitch preparation and broader business development work with some guidance, and there's also a dining function

414
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:05,786
[SPEAKER_12]: coffee area.

415
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:08,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Mechanical mezzanine is on top of that.

416
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:13,469
[SPEAKER_12]: The building is eight stories occupied above grade.

417
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to my cheat sheet here.

418
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,331
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a 7,376 square feet per floor and all together the

419
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:29,873
[SPEAKER_12]: The total square footage of the building is 60,000 square feet.

420
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,916
[SPEAKER_12]: The roof of the building tops out at 134 feet.

421
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:37,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Top of the mechanical screen is 159 feet.

422
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:48,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of the building by the numbers, again, looking at the site plan and just sort of identifying the main streets that it's on.

423
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:54,784
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a shadow study that we've done, and so we can read this across the top from left to right.

424
00:30:55,484 --> 00:31:10,952
[SPEAKER_12]: In the morning on March 1st, or the March spring equinox, you see the shadow of the building at 9 o'clock sort of runs a diagonal 45-degree angle away from the building, not hitting any residential

425
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:26,016
[SPEAKER_12]: properties, again, at midday, we cast a shadow onto the commercial street on Mystics Avenue, and in the afternoon, the shadow goes towards the Highway 93.

426
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:42,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, so as we kind of skip through the seasons, what we find is that that pattern evolves as the sun angle changes during the year, but at no point do we cast dark shadows on the residences around us.

427
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:59,223
[SPEAKER_12]: and that you see the North and the West facades receive glancing sun for the most of the day in most seasons, which sort of engages those vertical fins, which I'm an architect and find that kind of exciting.

428
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:05,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And so some visuals of the exterior, these are renderings.

429
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:12,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this is really a very conceptual design at this point, but these are the tools we use to do the development

430
00:32:13,528 --> 00:32:14,269
[SPEAKER_12]: of that design.

431
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:24,715
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you can see sort of across the street from the corner, so kitty corner across Mystic Avenue, we see the main corner of the building.

432
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:32,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And the site, I'm gonna go back for a quick sec, is itself has a beautiful sort of rounded corner to it.

433
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we really wanted to pick up on that in the shape of the building rather than doing sort of architectural gymnastics, which is using very simple

434
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:42,082
[SPEAKER_12]: cue from the site itself.

435
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:51,090
[SPEAKER_12]: In the lower right here, we see the shadows that are formed by the sun as it grazes across the northern face.

436
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,853
[SPEAKER_12]: More long shots.

437
00:32:55,153 --> 00:33:05,342
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if we were driving south on 93 and we were maybe on the passenger seat and looked to our right as we were passing the building, this is what it would look like.

438
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:21,991
[SPEAKER_12]: It's with the current state of development on Mystic Ave, it would be by itself for a moment, and we hope it'll be joined by other projects of this sort and of this scale as Medford continues to develop.

439
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:26,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Matt.

440
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:32,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, that's just a design concept that we wanted to tie it into this ordinance, but for

441
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:37,069
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight's purpose and the reasoning for the drafting the ordinance.

442
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:42,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, we're really here tonight for proving the plan, uh, development district.

443
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this is located to 43 Mystic Avenue.

444
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:47,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So over an 8000 square foot lot.

445
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:55,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this is pursuant to section 94 dash 9.2 of the cut of five Medford zoning ordinance.

446
00:33:55,838 --> 00:34:02,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and this is, uh, something that's been worked out with myself and also your representation online.

447
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:02,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I

448
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:04,245
[SPEAKER_06]: the zoning ordinance.

449
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:04,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

450
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of reading reading the ordinance all the way through.

451
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:06,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

452
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:10,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to highlight a couple of key points to draw your attention.

453
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:10,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

454
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:17,067
[SPEAKER_06]: To some of the key aspects that were negotiated through July and what we discussed with various, uh.

455
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:18,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Interested parties in the community.

456
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:22,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh you know, as required by the zoning orients.

457
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,829
[SPEAKER_06]: You the City Council are still the special permit

458
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:35,797
[SPEAKER_06]: if we are approved for this zoning change and PDD.

459
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we will be back before you.

460
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,164
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a site review process with the CDB, so they're not out of it either.

461
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And an interesting concept that the city attorney recommended was a cooperation agreement, which is embedded in this ordinance.

462
00:34:53,347 --> 00:35:06,313
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea is that we work with you on some special details that usually get worked back and forth between a proponent and a special permitting granting authority.

463
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:18,098
[SPEAKER_06]: This doesn't replace any of the other approvals, but this allows a cooperation agreement if we elect with you to come up with key terms for this project or key terms for the community.

464
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:24,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, it's another layer to have in community impact and comments put in place.

465
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:27,456
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a linkage component to this.

466
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:38,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it doesn't take away the authority of the Office of Planning and Development Sustainability, but it allows a in-kind exchange instead of just money put into a pot.

467
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's improving a park or improving a sidewalk or doing something of equal or greater value.

468
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So that concept's in there.

469
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:51,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, not required, and it's gonna be subject to review, but that is built in there.

470
00:35:52,867 --> 00:36:03,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And then key is the use, and so to clarify the use is granting the special lab, lab and office combination.

471
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see there's a long chart in there of a bunch of other uses.

472
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:12,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are just uses that are already allowed in this district, so we're not intending to build

473
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,698
[SPEAKER_06]: 10-story auto repair shop.

474
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: The focus is this lab development.

475
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you see is actually taking what's existing and also adding in the lab space.

476
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:27,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the dimensional chart is to accommodate this shape and lot size.

477
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:30,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the logic behind all the drafting of the ordinance.

478
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to answer any questions on that.

479
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:37,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have Attorney Horstman on the line to answer any of your questions.

480
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just respectfully request that you vote to approve the PDD.

481
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

482
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpaolo.

483
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President, and thanks for presentation.

484
00:36:47,621 --> 00:37:00,165
[SPEAKER_10]: For one, Councilor, I've had a serious issue with how the community, how this community, our leadership team, really puts together the vision of our growth and development plan.

485
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:07,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We say we have a comprehensive plan, but it is all over the place.

486
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:11,225
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, there are so many questions with this building.

487
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:19,647
[SPEAKER_10]: A, you're on probably one of the most busiest intersections, one of the biggest concerns of traffic in this community, huge issue.

488
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:27,249
[SPEAKER_10]: How many people do you plan on occupying this building on a day-to-day basis?

489
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:34,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Five states, 2,000 square feet.

490
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:43,050
[SPEAKER_14]: You're looking at probably 10 to 15 scientists per board.

491
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:46,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly 80, 100 people.

492
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's only 23 parking spots.

493
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:51,276
[SPEAKER_10]: It abuts a neighborhood.

494
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:52,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

495
00:37:52,397 --> 00:38:01,883
[SPEAKER_14]: So my experience, so I tried to iterate this at the beginning, but I do come from a science background.

496
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:06,627
[SPEAKER_14]: So my partner and I, we are both lab scientists turned developers.

497
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:16,703
[SPEAKER_14]: For a building like this that's going to be early stage companies, most of these employees are going to prefer to not drive to work.

498
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: We have other buildings that are along the same lines.

499
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:22,089
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of the things that I iterated at the beginning of this.

500
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:26,033
[SPEAKER_14]: We chose this spot strategically because there is access to transportation.

501
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,616
[SPEAKER_14]: We have had conversations about

502
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:45,891
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, having shuttle systems, things like that, because we know just from our peers and colleagues who are still in the sciences and have these companies, bikes, public transportation are the preferred method of arrival to work at this stage of companies.

503
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:51,375
[SPEAKER_14]: So we propose that amount of parking to push the scientists that way anyway.

504
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,676
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's really the idea behind that.

505
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:55,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Can appreciate that.

506
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,118
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, there's no guarantee for any business.

507
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:07,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you last five to 10 years, the next business comes in and has no philosophy or belief in the same as you do.

508
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, it affects our community.

509
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:17,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't take this personal, because I would love to find a location for this type of development.

510
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:18,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's amazing.

511
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:22,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've turned a few away that has really hurt us.

512
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:25,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the biggest issue I see

513
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:28,443
[SPEAKER_10]: is we don't have a true development plan.

514
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:31,665
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw how it looks there.

515
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks out of place.

516
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:37,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful building, but it's out of place.

517
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:44,174
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a community of two to three family homes no more than 100 yards away from you.

518
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:49,537
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about an intersection that has been habitually taken advantage of.

519
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:53,280
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about a neighborhood that has felt that they have been

520
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: they have been treated so unfairly and overlooked so many years.

521
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,655
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of variables that has nothing to do with you.

522
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:02,416
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want you to understand that.

523
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:14,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that when we talk about development and you look at the plan of Mystic Ave, man, I would love to see, I mean, the idea can be sold so easily when you're building

524
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: four, five, six, 10 similar locations, all the way down Mystic Ave, where there's establishments to eat, go for a drink, go for shopping, to live.

525
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,888
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a community, right?

526
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:29,868
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a community building.

527
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:38,051
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you're trying to sell the concept of 100 people in only 23 spots and thinking that now it's not gonna affect it, everybody's gonna drive a bike or a bus.

528
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,692
[SPEAKER_10]: We wish that could be the case, but that's not true.

529
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:46,976
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's what the neighbors, the neighbors that we deal with every day in that community, you have to understand, they're scorned.

530
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:53,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They're part of this community that have been bypassed in many different levels.

531
00:40:53,641 --> 00:41:01,425
[SPEAKER_10]: As I'm sitting here right now, I'm getting text messages of people that live right on that road that are disgusted that we're even talking about this.

532
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:06,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a shame that, and I'll say it publicly, I think this is the concept, this is beautiful.

533
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: That building is beautiful.

534
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:22,587
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think the idea of it, you know, when you see neighboring communities, like I'm sure you have, you see the assembly road, you see what's going on in Malden, you see what's happening in Everett, you're seeing this type of development grow together.

535
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:34,714
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have a unicorn sticking out of an eight-story unicorn sticking out of probably the most densely populated traffic area that we've had so many issues in the past.

536
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:47,081
[SPEAKER_10]: So I personally, not anything you did, but what this administration has done when we talk about development and growth, not having a true picture.

537
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:50,883
[SPEAKER_10]: If the city sat next to you, stood next to you,

538
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:57,334
[SPEAKER_10]: the development department sat with you, and they said, George, this is our plan, and this is what it's gonna look like.

539
00:41:57,814 --> 00:42:08,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I sat with a gentleman years ago in a disgusting field in Somerville, and he opened this door, and he showed me this full life-size model of something called Assembly Row.

540
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:18,731
[SPEAKER_10]: And his vision was talking about gateway communities, talking about how when you enter Somerville, this is what it's gonna look like, this is what's gonna grow to this, this is what's gonna grow to that, and guess what?

541
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:19,632
[SPEAKER_10]: It's happening.

542
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:28,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Just this great little shop area now has buildings for health care, buildings for corporate development.

543
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:29,662
[SPEAKER_10]: It's grown.

544
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:31,784
[SPEAKER_10]: People, a tea stop right there.

545
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course you don't need parking there.

546
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:35,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see how crazy it is there now.

547
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is what we're not having in Metro.

548
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:40,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I just personally think that, you know,

549
00:42:42,219 --> 00:43:00,912
[SPEAKER_10]: you're a catalyst to say, okay, here is the perfect development team that wants to come back and talk about Lincoln, talking about taking care of the community, talking about parking issues, talking about environmental issues, looking at the sciences, and let's use them as a catalyst to say, okay, this is gonna be here, and this is how we're gonna grow that area.

550
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:09,878
[SPEAKER_10]: If that was presented today, I would say to the neighbors that, hey, you can't question growth, but all they're seeing, like it was just said,

551
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just standing out.

552
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:13,318
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't belong there.

553
00:43:14,038 --> 00:43:15,939
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are too many questions right now.

554
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:17,980
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I wouldn't be able to support it.

555
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not, believe me, it's not personal.

556
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that your concept, if it rolled down the street with five other buildings, with the concept of this is what we want from Mystic Ave, we're just not seeing that.

557
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:31,569
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not seeing that from the administration.

558
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:32,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And for this counselor,

559
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:50,283
[SPEAKER_10]: For the neighbors that have reached out to me that are nervous about these issues of parking, sense of community, sense of traffic, sense of lifestyle change, they think this one building without understanding the concept after this building and what that means to their neighborhood is what's giving them the fear.

560
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:53,706
[SPEAKER_10]: that has opened my eyes to say, I can't support it.

561
00:43:54,387 --> 00:43:55,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope you can understand that.

562
00:43:56,288 --> 00:44:15,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I just hope the city opens their eyes and says, how do we help our developers get the support of their council by presenting a plan for the city that's gonna show this area, by the way, probably the last of the Mohicans, the last area close to Boston that we can build on.

563
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,063
[SPEAKER_10]: We know how important that corridor is.

564
00:44:18,103 --> 00:44:19,125
[SPEAKER_10]: That corridor is huge.

565
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,508
[SPEAKER_10]: The last corridor leads into Boston.

566
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know how important that land is.

567
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:44,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But without a plan from the city and from what I'm hearing with neighbors and their issues with what we talked about, and even before you were here, God, it took us years to put in a crosswalk right at that set of lights because of the dangerous area that it is and the heavy trafficked area that it is.

568
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,122
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope you can understand that's how I feel and I appreciate you being here.

569
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:51,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Could I make a couple comments?

570
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:51,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

571
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:54,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna go to, we'll come back to you.

572
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:56,036
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go to the councilors first.

573
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:57,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins and Vice President Behrs.

574
00:44:58,937 --> 00:44:59,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Morrell.

575
00:44:59,857 --> 00:45:02,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for the presentation tonight.

576
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:08,999
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to get to look through the visuals to go with the story of the development that you are developing.

577
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:21,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, of course, all of us behind the rail, I think that we have the same vocabulary for the known challenges on that Mystic Harbor intersection.

578
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,032
[SPEAKER_01]: pedestrian safety, traffic, of course.

579
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:31,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure in the course of your research, you've driven down Harvard many times and seen it for yourself.

580
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:40,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what is exciting is that it's interesting to see the mock-up of the building now in the current context of this zone.

581
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:45,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what is exciting is that we're at a place in the city right now where we

582
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:50,420
[SPEAKER_01]: have some of these PDDs beginning to come in because we just kind of enabled this mechanism.

583
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:53,122
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a comprehensive plan that was passed this year.

584
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:59,386
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of at the very beginning of our ability to make decisions to have this be the first of many.

585
00:46:00,546 --> 00:46:13,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that, I think comes making some modifications to the environment to, you know, change the resident experience.

586
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:36,701
[SPEAKER_01]: as this neighborhood is changing and being zoned and being developed into, you know, I think we've had many conversations as a council about how to have this mystic corridor fulfill a lot of potential as a mixed use area with some incredible development like the type that you are developing and also have it be a real boon for residents residentially and as a place to go and enjoy the community.

587
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:43,022
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes me optimistic about a project like this going forward is the fact that, you know, we have some,

588
00:46:44,021 --> 00:46:49,222
[SPEAKER_01]: guiding frameworks for how this is a part of a whole that we've already talked through and we've talked through with our city partners.

589
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:58,284
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I am curious, and I know that you mentioned the cooperative agreement, and I know that linkage is a part of this in whatever form it gets passed.

590
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:04,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the specific siting here, Mystic and Harvard, it's already a really difficult area to be a pedestrian.

591
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:08,627
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already a really difficult area to be a biker and to drive in.

592
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious if you have any kind of, even at this preliminary stage, if you have thoughts about

593
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:21,900
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic, pedestrian, bike lane, et cetera, mitigation that could affect the experience of getting there, the experience of residents for the better.

594
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:25,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Councilor, thanks for raising that.

595
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:37,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Matt will comment on some of the traffic and pedestrian, but that mechanism that you mentioned, the linkage and the cooperation agreement is to address the neighborhood concerns so that this could be kind of a spark to start proving that.

596
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:41,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And a cooperation agreement worked out once we have a plan and everything.

597
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:47,882
[SPEAKER_06]: can work to address pedestrian safety, which I think is high on the list.

598
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:55,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And talking about the traffic lights and being able to, we can actually improve that directly.

599
00:47:55,786 --> 00:48:00,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the idea behind the in-kind exchange for linkage.

600
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of just putting money into a pot that may take some time, it's

601
00:48:05,263 --> 00:48:17,066
[SPEAKER_06]: it's more efficient for a developer to come in and say, you know what, we will fix the sidewalk and the intersection and the traffic lights because we can do that while we have our construction team here and everything and can be more efficient in getting that done.

602
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:22,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really at the heart of what you're asking is why we put those two clauses in there.

603
00:48:23,027 --> 00:48:25,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you had some thoughts on the traffic.

604
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:27,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, just sort of following on that.

605
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:31,544
[SPEAKER_12]: We see the same things you see.

606
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:41,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I've lived in this area for 35 years and driven through that intersection countless times and have had the opportunity now to be a pedestrian there and imagine riding a bike.

607
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:46,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, the situation is what we know it to be.

608
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:54,634
[SPEAKER_12]: We're leaning into a near future that is going to be similar and improving, and we want to be part of that change.

609
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:58,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Doug touched on the idea

610
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:01,407
[SPEAKER_12]: concept of shuttle buses.

611
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:12,811
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that the Green Line is a short distance away and that we've explored plans to create a shuttle service from the Green Line stops to this area.

612
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:19,853
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's probably going to be, at the beginning, the way the majority of the occupants of the building arrive at this site.

613
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:24,918
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we've talked about blue bikes being located in the front of the building.

614
00:49:25,258 --> 00:49:32,720
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, honestly, riding a blue bike or any other kind of bike around this area, except for heading right back into the neighborhoods, is a little harrowing.

615
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's going to take some time for that to make sense.

616
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,021
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the cars that do come and go from the site itself are going to be minimal.

617
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:49,523
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, when we look at the crosswalk that's there now and the length of time it took in the past for that to come, we're imagining that

618
00:49:50,095 --> 00:50:02,241
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, as the master plan gets fleshed out, as the zoning follows, we see the previews of what that looks like, and we feel like we're leaning into that future.

619
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,642
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't mind sticking out right now.

620
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:11,705
[SPEAKER_12]: We feel like the future, and we feel like we're not gonna be alone for long.

621
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:18,468
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's sort of some of our thinking, that the specifics of how a linkage might address

622
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:24,844
[SPEAKER_12]: specific issues on the site today, I think, are something that we're absolutely open to discuss.

623
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:30,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a lot of different viewpoints about what are the hottest issues and the best way to spend that money.

624
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:37,710
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, I think we want to begin that dialogue and remain open to that.

625
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:45,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd say this, the PDD enables us, it's a mechanism in your zoning ordinance,

626
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole idea, again, behind the cooperative agreement is to address these very concerns in a proposed project.

627
00:50:55,147 --> 00:50:55,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

628
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:56,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

629
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:57,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

630
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for presenting.

631
00:50:58,991 --> 00:50:59,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you again.

632
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:03,136
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I can't remember when now.

633
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:14,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Between 12 and 18 months ago Councilor Kerrio, I were at a presentation by combined across the street for their large set of properties, met, met you guys there.

634
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:21,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, for what I'm seeing this as part of a more holistic larger project along the entire stretch.

635
00:51:23,235 --> 00:51:33,559
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the combined thing, they're changing paths midstream, which is, you know, there's a little confusion with that right now, but I'm hoping that they'll, that we'll be able to move that forward too.

636
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:37,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll really see two large projects.

637
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:46,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your project and then a, quite frankly, much larger project across the street that really set a foundational note for what we want this corridor to look like.

638
00:51:47,664 --> 00:51:51,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, comparatively, I think what they're gonna be able to do in terms of community benefits is,

639
00:51:52,425 --> 00:52:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: significant given the size and scale of their project, but it speaks to Councillor Collins' points around pedestrian safety, bike safety, transportation improvements, intersection improvements, looking at rights of way, addressing the horrific light timing that DCR and MassDOT have imposed on us there.

640
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think, you know,

641
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:19,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That maybe you guys are going to be the first ones out, you know, we'll see where their process gets them.

642
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:27,477
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some environmental stuff, whatnot, that might take some longer time, but I really see this as setting a note for the corridor in a good way.

643
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really encouraged by what you've presented.

644
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you've been through the public process, the meetings, the hearings, engaging with the public.

645
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:45,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the biggest things that I heard at the meeting when we were talking about the much larger project across the street that Combined has proposed,

646
00:52:47,599 --> 00:53:06,714
[SPEAKER_02]: was about how the fact that this being commercial being a commercial development being a nine to five workplace versus being housing and I personally have some misgivings about this thing that I'm about to say I'm not saying it's my position on the issue but that was of value to the residents in that community, some of them who showed up to the meeting.

647
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:11,317
[SPEAKER_02]: we hear a lot about expanding the commercial industrial tax base in the city.

648
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,878
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a lot about unique development.

649
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:20,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really encouraged that this council was able to pass a zoning ordinance that created a process that you guys were able to come through to get to this point.

650
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's exactly the goal of the PDD that we passed, exactly the goal, development goals of this council has had, and I'm really encouraged.

651
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that change can be difficult, and that is just true across the board.

652
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like

653
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: with your project, we're gonna have some further conversations about what that means, and then also, really going forward, we are going to have much larger discussions about this corridor with proponents of larger projects in the area that I think will mesh well with what you're proposing and be complimentary and align with what we're looking for.

654
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So really thankful that we were able to act as a council, propose reviewing our zoning for the first time in 60 years,

655
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:13,416
[SPEAKER_02]: go through an 18 month process to recodify our zoning ordinance past the PDD process and get to this point where this is now our second PDD in the last couple months moving forward.

656
00:54:13,536 --> 00:54:15,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot more work to do on zoning.

657
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:19,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave that for another conversation, but I'm strongly supportive of this.

658
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:19,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

659
00:54:21,952 --> 00:54:22,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

660
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:24,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, thank you for presenting today.

661
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for coming to us with the with this project.

662
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:31,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, really to echo counselor bears this sentiment there.

663
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:39,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it is really fulfilling for me as a counselor to see something so big that we did be able to bring in a project and

664
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:56,905
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, um, Council versus right when he says that change can be difficult and change, and now on to that change can be awkward as well, and sometimes we'll get a building like yours where maybe today there's nothing next to it, but our hope is that your building can bring in other buildings to.

665
00:54:57,646 --> 00:55:07,956
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, you know, that vision that I think we have for mystic have that most of us have for mystic of that we can, you know, this is the first step that will need to take.

666
00:55:08,317 --> 00:55:19,748
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have that as Council bears referred to we have that count combined properties project which hopefully will go how we want to across the street is also this really isn't a project in isolation I think this is

667
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:24,770
[SPEAKER_13]: rather a project that's the beginning of a bigger project, which I'm very happy with.

668
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear the concerns about traffic.

669
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:31,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I go through that intersection at least twice a week, if not more.

670
00:55:31,773 --> 00:55:35,154
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the traffic there is backed up.

671
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:42,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully this can also spur a new conversation with the people at DOT and DCR about

672
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:48,356
[SPEAKER_13]: like timings in Medford and getting that to match our traffic patterns better.

673
00:55:48,737 --> 00:56:00,610
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do think, as you have mentioned, it is really important to note that we fought as a council for bus access to remain in the new bus plan on Mystic Ave and on Main Street and on Harvard

674
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,535
[SPEAKER_13]: because we knew that projects like this were going to come in.

675
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:21,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of those, because of our actions as a council, because of community members, we have pretty regular bus access coming in to connect this property with Malden Square, Malden Center Station, with Sullivan Square Station.

676
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:26,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully with the shuttle, we'll have it better connected to the Green Line as well.

677
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:29,814
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's really important to mention.

678
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the son of life scientists.

679
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:42,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can definitely back up the statement that most life scientists are especially environmentally aware, and they want to really make an effort to drive less.

680
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:51,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that we don't only see in Cambridge, it's something that we see as in general with life scientists, even across the country.

681
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:55,124
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I, you know, I, I

682
00:56:56,961 --> 00:56:58,242
[SPEAKER_13]: like that part of this project.

683
00:56:58,282 --> 00:56:59,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that makes sense.

684
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:00,424
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's sensible.

685
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:09,312
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, if anything, we should be spurring and pushing our workers in Medford to be taking public transit and to be biking.

686
00:57:09,352 --> 00:57:15,057
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the only way we can do that is to make it easier to really incentivize that behavior.

687
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to mention one last thing.

688
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,534
[SPEAKER_13]: It's slipping my mind.

689
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:26,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I think if anything, this is about creating jobs in Medford as well.

690
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:30,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want Medford to be a destination.

691
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:33,243
[SPEAKER_13]: We want Medford to be put on the map.

692
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:38,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have to be willing to embrace job growth.

693
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:40,048
[SPEAKER_13]: if that's to be the case.

694
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:56,145
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess on top of that, as Councillor Baird mentioned, we keep talking about wanting to expand our commercial industrial tax base so that we take tax burdens off of residents, so that we, you know, we're talking about

695
00:57:56,866 --> 00:58:00,468
[SPEAKER_13]: we're in a difficult situation right now with our long term finances, and we need to embrace

696
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:27,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kerrio?

697
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

698
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:42,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one for smart, responsible growth, and I know what's going to happen here tonight is we're going to take a vote and it's going to go up to the Community Development Board, which is a procedural thing to do.

699
00:58:43,876 --> 00:58:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened in on the meeting on the night that you proposed this some time ago, and I know the OCD board had some concerns.

700
00:58:58,022 --> 00:59:05,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to be willing to take the concerns of the board for changes that they want to make?

701
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:10,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carvillo, this has already gone to the Community Development Board, and it came back with unanimous approval.

702
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:12,694
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't submit any changes or suggestions.

703
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:15,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there that day when they sent it up there.

704
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:17,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there was some concern.

705
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:20,740
[SPEAKER_07]: If this was across the street, I'd be dancing on the streets.

706
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:23,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think

707
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:30,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sanz made a thing that beggars can't be choosers.

708
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not beggars.

709
00:59:33,356 --> 00:59:36,839
[SPEAKER_07]: This city is ripe for development.

710
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would hope that as this moves on, maybe some of the height is one of my concerns there.

711
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:52,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight stories I think is a lot for that small lot.

712
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:58,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if maybe we would consider maybe losing a floor or two.

713
00:59:58,169 --> 01:00:06,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I say, if this was on the other side of Mr. Gabb, I'd say great, you know, because that's where it belongs.

714
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:11,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I say, Councillor Baird's and I had signed a meeting with a combined one to do similar type projects.

715
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:15,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So my concern is the height of this project.

716
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:21,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight stories on that front of a very small lot is really where my concern is on this.

717
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:28,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that maybe that might be something you might take into consideration is the height requirements there.

718
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:34,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sure.

719
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:36,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

720
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:41,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely understand your concern there.

721
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:47,232
[SPEAKER_14]: The height and the square footage of this building wasn't just pulled out of sort of a hat or anything like that.

722
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:49,794
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually do have a tenant for this building already.

723
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:55,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have a square footage requirement that we are trying to meet.

724
01:00:55,964 --> 01:01:01,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that that is important to us as a developer to make sure that we can give them the space that they need.

725
01:01:01,946 --> 01:01:05,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's part of the reason why we did request the height that we asked for.

726
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,828
[SPEAKER_14]: So I completely understand where you're coming from.

727
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:14,850
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate all the comments, but I just wanted to make sure that it was clear to the group that we do have people who are very interested in coming into the site.

728
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:21,816
[SPEAKER_14]: that will bring life science to that spot as soon as we're open and ready for the building to be functioning.

729
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:31,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And I certainly don't want to see you walking out of town either, because this brings good paying jobs for our city.

730
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:33,886
[SPEAKER_07]: It's building premium fees.

731
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:38,530
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a piece of property that's paying virtually nothing in taxes.

732
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:44,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Once your building goes up, we'll probably be getting a few million dollars a year in taxes.

733
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:52,767
[SPEAKER_07]: not counting the ancillary things, but I do, the height is really my major concern there.

734
01:01:53,267 --> 01:01:58,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Councillor Caput said, we are in a, you are in, you are boarding a residential neighbourhood.

735
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:01,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any talk of you maybe buying some of that

736
01:02:02,243 --> 01:02:03,183
[SPEAKER_07]: property next door?

737
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:05,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so we've had, we've tried.

738
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:07,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's, I mean, it's just a storage facility.

739
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:11,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we tried the, whatever the company is right next door to us.

740
01:02:12,007 --> 01:02:13,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's like Millhenge or something.

741
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Coffee.

742
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:15,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we've had some conversations with them.

743
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,430
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked to the storage facility.

744
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,851
[SPEAKER_14]: We, as I mentioned at the beginning, we really like this location and we are developing this.

745
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:23,892
[SPEAKER_14]: We are keeping this building.

746
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:26,053
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not running, but we're going to own it, manage it.

747
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:28,634
[SPEAKER_14]: We are like, again, bringing the tenants in.

748
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:31,855
[SPEAKER_14]: We would love to buy more up and down Mystic Avenue.

749
01:02:32,325 --> 01:02:38,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We would, if we can, at some time in the near future, buy surrounding sites, that would be great for us.

750
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:41,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that, yes, that is our plan.

751
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:57,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think from my perspective as a developer, I know this is new to this area, and I know this is something that hasn't been done there, but I do think if, or when this building is up, it is gonna bring other developers too.

752
01:02:57,564 --> 01:03:00,947
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna have other life science developers who are like, this is a great location.

753
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:10,772
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, to answer your question, we would love to buy more parcels up and down or adjacent to this location.

754
01:03:11,332 --> 01:03:15,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about Misty Avenue being the gateway to Medford.

755
01:03:16,534 --> 01:03:17,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's not the gateway.

756
01:03:19,014 --> 01:03:21,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that you have project in the spring and other people to come.

757
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:29,197
[SPEAKER_07]: The concern I had when we talked about the project across the street was obviously the traffic implications.

758
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:43,377
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I asked across the street when Combine was looking to do their property, I'd like to see a medium strip on Mr. Gabb in the middle with some trees.

759
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:48,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something that you'd be able to do?

760
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:55,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And as businesses come, that strip keeps going so we don't look like a piece of concrete, just a concrete road.

761
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's say Combine was able to do that there,

762
01:04:01,388 --> 01:04:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: put an island in the middle, so we had more trees and more green space.

763
01:04:07,832 --> 01:04:16,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say from a legal perspective, that's standing behind the cooperative agreement in lieu, linkage, and it's been done in other communities.

764
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:24,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a project over in Everett where they want each developer on each section of that road, improve the road.

765
01:04:24,123 --> 01:04:29,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as it goes down, it's improving it and then giving the city back more bus lanes and other access.

766
01:04:29,987 --> 01:04:40,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Every property's unique, every town's unique, but there is a, what I like about how this is drafted, and your attorney came up with the idea with the cooperation agreement.

767
01:04:40,074 --> 01:04:41,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's our attorney?

768
01:04:41,435 --> 01:04:42,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Gareth Horsman.

769
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,037
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on the call.

770
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:51,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's, he's paid for by, I believe, Alicia, you could explain the process to me, but he's paid for by the PDD fees.

771
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's your, and he's your representative, yeah.

772
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's nice about that is it allows a legal mechanism to create just that.

773
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:09,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's decided once we submit a plan and a cooperation agreement, working through putting in the trees, and then we're the spark that starts it down the street with other developers, you say, hey, they did it.

774
01:05:09,746 --> 01:05:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna ask this for everyone coming down the street.

775
01:05:12,927 --> 01:05:14,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does enable that kind of start.

776
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:23,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm looking, I'm gonna be asking that for everybody coming down the street to, again, like I say, Mr. Gavin, you should be the gateway to our community.

777
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been talked about

778
01:05:27,062 --> 01:05:31,644
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 years that I know of and nothing has really happened yet.

779
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:35,105
[SPEAKER_07]: What about on the Harvest Street side?

780
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,805
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the condition of the roadway there.

781
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:41,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to do anything to improve that roadway on the Harvest Street end?

782
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:52,052
[SPEAKER_12]: it benefits us to have that intersection functioning properly and that section of Harvard Street functioning properly.

783
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:57,615
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it ends up being that part of the linkage is us improving that, absolutely.

784
01:05:58,035 --> 01:06:01,237
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much space do you have for green space for trees and plantings?

785
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:13,044
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have our drawings up anymore, but so there's actually sort of a large amount of sidewalk that sort of wraps that intersection between the two streets.

786
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:15,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're actually,

787
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:21,631
[SPEAKER_12]: in the concept plan, sort of claiming some of that for a planted area for bike parking and so forth.

788
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:27,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically just staking out the territory for something green to be determined.

789
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:33,919
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's very limited in that way, but what we have, we're taking advantage of.

790
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:39,163
[SPEAKER_12]: But we would love to have that medium program be in place and we would love to take part in that.

791
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,466
[SPEAKER_12]: That really begins to address and address some of the issues.

792
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of our problem is our curb appeal in our city is lax.

793
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:53,885
[SPEAKER_07]: The more trees, the more friendly we look.

794
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:57,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired of seeing what we've been doing.

795
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:02,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We're putting up these cement mediums with nothing in the middle of it.

796
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Aesthetically, they don't look good.

797
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,814
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of something I want to see going forward.

798
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:15,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And we understand that a meeting like that is part of a larger planning process, and it needs to be done right.

799
01:07:15,438 --> 01:07:19,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would want that to be built, and we'd certainly take part in that.

800
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:23,560
[SPEAKER_12]: We want it to be maintained and planted properly, and it could be a real event.

801
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:32,762
[SPEAKER_07]: And would there be any, would your property be offering any community space to the city, to the residents, or?

802
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:33,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know.

803
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:37,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I saw something up at the top of the upper floor there.

804
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:40,606
[SPEAKER_07]: You had some kind of a dining facility.

805
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:44,995
[SPEAKER_12]: We hadn't envisioned it as functioning as sort of a public building.

806
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,826
[SPEAKER_07]: the community use it for maybe a public meeting.

807
01:07:52,327 --> 01:08:01,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Century building, they used to let the community use their top floor for public meetings and things.

808
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:05,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's certainly a possibility.

809
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:08,441
[SPEAKER_12]: The intellectual property that's being developed

810
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,183
[SPEAKER_12]: buildings like this is something that we have to be careful about the security of.

811
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:19,804
[SPEAKER_12]: So how we sort of work out different companies that work together and different people that access different floors and so forth, it's very much on our minds.

812
01:08:19,864 --> 01:08:22,944
[SPEAKER_12]: So incorporating the public into that is not impossible.

813
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:28,725
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing it in other projects, but we have the tools to provide that.

814
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:38,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's the... So the tenant that you have coming in, what type of lab business do they do or science or life science do they do?

815
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:51,670
[SPEAKER_07]: medical devices, so there'll be no biohazards that we'll be looking at.

816
01:08:52,951 --> 01:09:03,599
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the short way we ask for BSL level 2.

817
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:09,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Biosafety level 2 is sort of the, yeah, the low-hanging fruit.

818
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:14,387
[SPEAKER_12]: BSL 3 is pathogens that, you know,

819
01:09:14,935 --> 01:09:16,335
[SPEAKER_12]: It can kill people.

820
01:09:16,775 --> 01:09:20,056
[SPEAKER_12]: BSL-4 is sort of the answer.

821
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:21,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very few facilities.

822
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and so we're far from that.

823
01:09:25,597 --> 01:09:26,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

824
01:09:28,117 --> 01:09:32,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

825
01:09:32,278 --> 01:09:33,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to note two things.

826
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:37,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to remind the Council that as this is a zoning change, this requires five votes to pass.

827
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:39,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we end, would Councilor want to speak again?

828
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Since everyone's spoken once, I didn't know if you wanted anything else you wanted to reply.

829
01:09:43,594 --> 01:09:46,054
[SPEAKER_11]: to Councilor Scarpelli, it may have been addressed.

830
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:50,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, going back to Councilor Collins.

831
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:52,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Rowe.

832
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:54,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the discussion here.

833
01:09:54,096 --> 01:10:12,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, this is housed within a broad topic that we as a Council and I think the community talk about all the time, but it's still helpful to hear the particulars, hear some of what you have in mind for a couple steps further down the process and put this in the context of those community conversations about

834
01:10:13,596 --> 01:10:36,431
[SPEAKER_01]: this hyper specific area in particular that intersection that street address mystic of quarter in general, and our aspirations for making certain areas such as this area more mixed use more community friendly and also contributing more to our tax base and kind of putting it more concretely in the context of those ideals is very helpful so I appreciate the back and forth.

835
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:49,874
[SPEAKER_01]: President Morrell just mentioned, this is just the vote on the PDD and not this project specifically, but I really do appreciate this process and the level of granularity that we're able to have.

836
01:10:51,595 --> 01:11:02,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And with yourselves as proponents, I think it is, I think that, how to put this?

837
01:11:05,347 --> 01:11:29,506
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel good about a development coming in saying we're going to invest in the community and going through this process when really nothing is certain yet and doing the legwork and doing that and really responding to the values that the community has put forth to say, this is what we want for this area and taking the time to put forward an application that is still in many ways hypothetical, but doing the zoning changes to presuppose that and make it possible.

838
01:11:30,847 --> 01:11:34,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's heartening and it's helpful to go back to the community and be able to say,

839
01:11:35,099 --> 01:12:02,644
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we have all these conversations about making this intersection less scary to walk across, more possible to walk across, like imagine walking to Wegmans, something that feels completely impossible to me, a person who lives a mile away from it, you know, being able to cross that crosswalk and beginning to see the early seeds of, you know, a more vibrant corridor that is contributing to the city's bottom line in real ways and kind of the harbinger of a walkable, interesting,

840
01:12:04,874 --> 01:12:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: in our city.

841
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:07,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very appreciated.

842
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:09,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to be at this.

843
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:13,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I think fellow councilors expressed this, excited to be at this stage.

844
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and with that, I would motion to approve.

845
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:21,168
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to open the hearing.

846
01:12:21,348 --> 01:12:22,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we haven't done that yet.

847
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

848
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:24,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

849
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpalli.

850
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:31,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Just moving forward, I heard some things that my fellow council said.

851
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:33,858
[SPEAKER_10]: They sound great if there was a plan.

852
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:38,966
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my fellow councils sounded a little desperate today, and I truly don't think we are.

853
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:48,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is an opportunity for us as a community to really set the groundwork for what one of my colleagues said, to really rejuvenate a corridor.

854
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:53,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And from another one of my colleagues said, really set that gateway, correct?

855
01:12:54,618 --> 01:12:56,400
[SPEAKER_10]: You've obviously developed this, you've seen it.

856
01:12:57,381 --> 01:13:03,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I'm sure that, I'm not asking for your comment, but I'm sure that you can see my point of view when we're looking at

857
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:07,335
[SPEAKER_10]: smart growth and development, and what we're seeing is spot growth.

858
01:13:10,337 --> 01:13:15,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a comprehensive plan that really is not involved comprehensively.

859
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,001
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that our director is on the call tonight.

860
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:30,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a diagram, is there a vision of the Mystic Ave Corridor that Office of Community Development

861
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:31,106
[SPEAKER_10]: in the city.

862
01:13:31,126 --> 01:13:31,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to see the city.

863
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:37,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh peers across the Commonwealth set the groundwork the table to show counselors in their cities.

864
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:39,688
[SPEAKER_10]: What that would look like.

865
01:13:40,568 --> 01:13:52,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I would tell you if this was the beginning of this gateway in the beginning of this, this open corridor of beautiful, uh, open space with with smart

866
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:06,324
[SPEAKER_10]: the water and electricity, whether we have the traffic and parking concerns answered.

867
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:08,087
[SPEAKER_10]: These are things that have been concerned.

868
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:10,452
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't been answered for me.

869
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:16,471
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I love the idea that you want to vote for it because we put this in place for this purpose.

870
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,972
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't put it in for this purpose.

871
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:28,679
[SPEAKER_10]: We put it in for this purpose to start the development process so we could grow an area, not just pop up one building that neighbors are directly affected.

872
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a matter of fact, what neighbors are they?

873
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not the neighbors on Lawrence Road.

874
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,364
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not the neighbors on Grove Street.

875
01:14:36,165 --> 01:14:40,588
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the neighbors that we talk about every day that are always impacted negatively.

876
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:44,331
[SPEAKER_10]: So this building's gonna come right up in front of their homes.

877
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:53,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Their buildings, this one building is gonna impact an area that traffic-wise has been stressed to us before these gentlemen even came to us.

878
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:59,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I ask our director, is there a plan in place?

879
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:11,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a comprehensive plan that's out there and that we reviewed, but is there something that we could see tangibly, hold on and look at and say, wow, look at the beginning of the growth of this corridor.

880
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:14,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

881
01:15:14,517 --> 01:15:17,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Director Hunt, is there anything you'd like to offer?

882
01:15:18,498 --> 01:15:19,518
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be able to unmute yourself.

883
01:15:19,538 --> 01:15:19,998
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

884
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:21,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

885
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:23,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President.

886
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:40,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the Councilor knows, what we have is a comprehensive plan that speaks very specifically to rezoning appropriate emerging corridors such as Mystic Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway to create zoning responsive for desired land use for each corridor.

887
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:46,984
[SPEAKER_00]: That step is part of what we are looking to do with the Council in the next round.

888
01:15:47,224 --> 01:15:50,767
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoning consultant RFP is advertised.

889
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,448
[SPEAKER_00]: right now with responses due November 16.

890
01:15:55,648 --> 01:15:58,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And that piece of this rezoning is what we plan to do there.

891
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:10,452
[SPEAKER_00]: We did offer to the applicant that if they wanted to wait on the order of 18 months, we think that this area would be rezoned in a way that would make this very similar to what they're looking to do.

892
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:14,553
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in line with the vision that we've been talking about for this area.

893
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:17,854
[SPEAKER_00]: But the applicant does not want to wait 18 months.

894
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:20,235
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an occupant ready to go with this building now.

895
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:22,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why this is before you this evening.

896
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:24,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

897
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:25,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So the answer is no.

898
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So there really isn't something there yet.

899
01:16:27,923 --> 01:16:30,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So why rush?

900
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:31,747
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I'm saying.

901
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:41,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember in a little community next door, they settled for this company called IKEA to go in the middle of their plan.

902
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once it blew up, what happened?

903
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:47,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Once it's really took off, what happened?

904
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:54,063
[SPEAKER_10]: They had to reach out to this company and say, we have to move you because the vision has changed.

905
01:16:54,663 --> 01:16:57,764
[SPEAKER_10]: No disrespect to anybody here, but we don't have a vision yet.

906
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:02,525
[SPEAKER_10]: All we have in Wellington is somebody that wants to build there.

907
01:17:02,805 --> 01:17:03,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it.

908
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:07,687
[SPEAKER_10]: All we have is this organization that wants to just build on Mystic Ave.

909
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:08,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it then.

910
01:17:09,839 --> 01:17:10,799
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't see anything.

911
01:17:10,919 --> 01:17:12,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we have one bite.

912
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:17,182
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the only, only community left that abuts Boston.

913
01:17:17,562 --> 01:17:18,522
[SPEAKER_10]: This is valuable.

914
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,523
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't, we're not begging for anything.

915
01:17:20,863 --> 01:17:31,167
[SPEAKER_10]: This is valuable, valuable development space that we should grow with responsibility and make sure we have all the factors in place.

916
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:32,387
[SPEAKER_10]: We already said it.

917
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:34,328
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have all the factors in place.

918
01:17:35,188 --> 01:17:38,970
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna prove this without knowing if it's gonna handle the safety of that roadway.

919
01:17:39,903 --> 01:17:42,784
[SPEAKER_10]: if it's gonna handle the traffic of that neighborhood.

920
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:47,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, again, it's nothing personal.

921
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:57,567
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something I've been saying, whether it's you or any other company, any other development company that's here right now, we need development seriously bad in Metro.

922
01:17:57,587 --> 01:18:00,808
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done nothing in the last four years, nothing, zero.

923
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:05,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But because of that inability to grow,

924
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,644
[SPEAKER_10]: we've now left ourselves in a pretty valuable situation.

925
01:18:11,065 --> 01:18:17,370
[SPEAKER_10]: So as our director just said, if we can wait 18 months, we're gonna have a better opportunity here.

926
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:20,292
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's the way I'm looking at it.

927
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:25,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I shouldn't say verbatim, but that's what I just heard, that they were off at 18 months.

928
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:34,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So imagine if we wait 18 months, what the vision and what answers we can have to make sure that Florida fits everything we want for those neighbors that again,

929
01:18:36,164 --> 01:18:40,306
[SPEAKER_10]: are always the ones that people don't look to support.

930
01:18:41,306 --> 01:18:46,649
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know because I'm getting the information from them on a regular.

931
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:56,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, listen, I don't wanna be the catalyst and stand here and say, follow me, but you have to understand that this isn't personal.

932
01:18:56,548 --> 01:19:04,232
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one counselor that's fighting for the neighbors of that community that still don't know what that card is gonna look like.

933
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:15,479
[SPEAKER_10]: All they know is we're putting an eight story building jammed into a little area of the corner with no parking and still have issues with traffic, safety,

934
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:17,479
[SPEAKER_10]: in infrastructure issues.

935
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:18,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

936
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:23,650
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could ask a question, thank you for sharing about the tenants.

937
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:30,355
[SPEAKER_11]: That was gonna be one of my first questions, because I know as we have a lot of, I mean, we don't, but in the greater Boston area, there's a lot of empty office space.

938
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:31,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I know lab space is different.

939
01:19:31,576 --> 01:19:34,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So just understanding you do have a tenant that will actually occupy that space, that's helpful.

940
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:39,322
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is about resiliency planning in the area.

941
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:46,327
[SPEAKER_11]: There's concrete there now, it's already a covered lot, but as we've seen extreme rains, 100 year, 200 year, 500 year storms,

942
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:51,818
[SPEAKER_11]: are something that we're dealing with, everyone's dealing with in this area.

943
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:58,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm curious in an area that has a lot of impervious surface, impermeable surface, what kind of thought goes into that?

944
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:02,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, knowing we're looking at a zoning change, we're not looking at a site plan, but just to know your thought behind that.

945
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:11,389
[SPEAKER_12]: So in situations like this, different municipalities, Boston, for example, require a subsurface drainage system.

946
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:17,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So all water that comes off the roof plane and comes off the parking surfaces

947
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:24,732
[SPEAKER_12]: goes into a series of catacombs below the site so that the water sort of hydrates the soil and leaches into the soil.

948
01:20:25,532 --> 01:20:28,993
[SPEAKER_12]: The size of the site is really our limiter for that opportunity.

949
01:20:30,454 --> 01:20:38,276
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have, this is not a building that envisions a basement, and so we have the opportunity to do that type of subsurface drainage system.

950
01:20:39,236 --> 01:20:45,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and then in the same vein, again, knowing this is zoning, thoughts for LEED certification or something you would go for?

951
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:55,980
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is, these are, the other work that we're doing with Verdin targets the lead, I think we're looking at lead gold.

952
01:20:57,421 --> 01:21:11,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's trade offs with these types of programs and they've got real energy benefits, they've got real sustainability benefits, they've also got real costs and they've got real marketing benefits.

953
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:13,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we sort of look for a balance of those

954
01:21:14,273 --> 01:21:25,637
[SPEAKER_12]: There are programs right now that the new energy code that this building is going to be built under is going to require greater performance than.

955
01:21:26,618 --> 01:21:33,440
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to kind of keep our powder dry for a minute and see what that new code looks like and see what the best opportunities are for us.

956
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:39,043
[SPEAKER_12]: If we just meet that higher standard in the energy code, we won't have a marketing benefit, very frankly.

957
01:21:40,806 --> 01:21:48,371
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, so as I said, we're going to sort of wait and see what the best play for all of the balanced issues are.

958
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:49,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

959
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, just looking at, you know, the PDD is several pages long.

960
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:57,236
[SPEAKER_11]: The crux of what we're looking at here is height, the number of stories, that is the big change.

961
01:21:57,276 --> 01:22:03,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a lot of, you know, smaller things, but what we're going to notice in the neighborhood is the height, it's the lot coverage, and it's the parking minimums.

962
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a big crux I'm missing in my reading of this?

963
01:22:09,203 --> 01:22:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's, yeah, I think that's accurate.

964
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:14,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There is the use clarification for lab.

965
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:20,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a use element to it, but yeah, key points and dimensions.

966
01:22:21,053 --> 01:22:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

967
01:22:22,134 --> 01:22:24,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions or discussion from the council at this time?

968
01:22:25,176 --> 01:22:31,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Also knowing that we do have council with an S on the call, if anyone has questions there as well.

969
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:33,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carviel.

970
01:22:33,743 --> 01:22:35,845
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your estimated cost of this project?

971
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:50,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you asking total costs, land acquisition, construction costs, all that?

972
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:54,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually doing some numbers earlier today.

973
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,971
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be in the $50 million to $60 million range.

974
01:22:56,991 --> 01:22:59,412
[SPEAKER_07]: $50 million to $60 million?

975
01:22:59,432 --> 01:22:59,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

976
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:10,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Beers mentioned what we said in the meeting about a year ago.

977
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:19,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Something I spoke of up there was four years prior to that meeting, we had a project that wanted to go into that spot.

978
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:28,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had somebody on this council who fought it.

979
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And so here we are.

980
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:37,759
[SPEAKER_07]: five years, four years later, five years later, with an empty piece of property across the street.

981
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:45,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a much better project proposed five years ago than what's being proposed now.

982
01:23:45,464 --> 01:23:52,109
[SPEAKER_07]: There was housing, there was some commercial, there was some residential, and works, a little bit of everything.

983
01:23:53,330 --> 01:24:00,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And not too long ago, we allowed a $234 million project to walk out of our city.

984
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:04,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to work with everybody.

985
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:21,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to see $60 million walk out of Medford again, because as I say, we lost a big project for reasons we won't talk about, which would have created jobs.

986
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:28,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's property across the street, should have been already built, and people living in there, working in there now.

987
01:24:29,515 --> 01:24:32,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried to explain this to the residents who live there,

988
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:38,561
[SPEAKER_07]: who keep looking out their door, walking the Mississippi Avenue, and seeing nothing, nothing.

989
01:24:40,462 --> 01:24:49,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna lie to you, this is not my ideal project that I'd like to see there, but I don't wanna see jobs walk out of town.

990
01:24:50,487 --> 01:25:00,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is probably a several hundred thousand dollar building permit fee, which the city needs, and we're looking into ways

991
01:25:00,739 --> 01:25:04,222
[SPEAKER_07]: to find more revenue to enhance our city.

992
01:25:04,262 --> 01:25:20,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, not the most ideal project that I'd like to see there, but something, having something there that's gonna create good-paying jobs for our city is a good thing.

993
01:25:20,314 --> 01:25:21,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always a good thing.

994
01:25:21,615 --> 01:25:24,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say that they're probably paying nothing in taxes.

995
01:25:26,298 --> 01:25:28,500
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have buildings done, you're gonna probably be paying

996
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a mean of two, a mean of three.

997
01:25:31,937 --> 01:25:35,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to reap the benefit of that also.

998
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So this council may have sometimes changed its heart to swallow, but hopefully before you get this done, maybe you'll take some of the things into consideration.

999
01:25:48,669 --> 01:25:49,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

1000
01:25:50,991 --> 01:25:51,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Carvejo.

1001
01:25:51,952 --> 01:25:53,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion from the council?

1002
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:56,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to note to Councilor Carvalho's point.

1003
01:25:56,108 --> 01:25:57,569
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's before us tonight is the zoning.

1004
01:25:57,729 --> 01:26:01,733
[SPEAKER_11]: The City Council is a site plan review approving board for this.

1005
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:08,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So as the petitioner said, if this were to be approved tonight, it would be back before us many times and we would have

1006
01:26:09,258 --> 01:26:13,581
[SPEAKER_11]: hopefully many opportunities to talk about the actual project and not just the zoning.

1007
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:18,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So as this is a public hearing, I'm going to open the public hearing procedural process.

1008
01:26:19,644 --> 01:26:26,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone, I will open this for anyone who likes to speak in favor of this project, anyone who would like to speak in favor of this project?

1009
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to speak in favor, Madam President.

1010
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:30,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1011
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:35,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the project either on Zoom or in person?

1012
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:41,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

1013
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:46,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this project, either on Zoom or in person?

1014
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

1015
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:55,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins, I believe you started to make a motion before.

1016
01:26:57,434 --> 01:26:58,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

1017
01:27:01,636 --> 01:27:05,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1018
01:27:06,193 --> 01:27:09,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, pending the six day public comment period.

1019
01:27:11,575 --> 01:27:12,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1020
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:26,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs?

1021
01:27:27,401 --> 01:27:27,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1022
01:27:28,562 --> 01:27:29,182

1023
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:29,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1024
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:32,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight is absent.

1027

[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1029
01:27:37,525 --> 01:27:37,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Singh?

1030
01:27:38,005 --> 01:27:38,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1031
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:39,506
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

1032
01:27:40,147 --> 01:27:40,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1033
01:27:40,747 --> 01:27:42,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

1034
01:27:42,949 --> 01:27:43,729
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1035
01:27:45,371 --> 01:27:45,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, one negative.

1036
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:46,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1037
01:27:47,112 --> 01:27:47,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Five in the affirmative.

1038
01:27:47,973 --> 01:27:49,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

1039
01:27:49,234 --> 01:27:49,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Five in the affirmative.

1040
01:27:50,715 --> 01:27:51,095
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1041
01:27:51,695 --> 01:27:52,316
[SPEAKER_11]: One in the negative.

1042
01:27:53,457 --> 01:27:54,918
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the absences that trip me up.

1043
01:27:56,259 --> 01:27:57,680
[SPEAKER_11]: One in the negative, one absent.

1044
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,520
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1045
01:27:59,101 --> 01:27:59,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1046
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:00,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1047
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:22,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have, actually, I think I reverted back to regular order of business on my own, and on the motion of Councilor Kerrio to revert back to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1048
01:28:22,585 --> 01:28:23,185
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1049
01:28:23,205 --> 01:28:24,546
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1050
01:28:24,586 --> 01:28:25,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1051
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:26,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to the records.

1052
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:31,448
[SPEAKER_11]: The records of the meeting of the September 19th, 2023 meeting were passed to Councilor Collins.

1053
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins, how did you find them?

1054
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:35,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I would motion to table until our next regular meeting.

1055
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get a chance to review them.

1056
01:28:37,481 --> 01:28:41,384
[SPEAKER_11]: on the motion of Councilor Collins to table the records to the next regular meeting.

1057
01:28:41,484 --> 01:28:43,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1058
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:44,466
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1059
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,007
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1060
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:46,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1061
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not missing anything.

1062
01:28:51,533 --> 01:28:54,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to page 12, I believe we go to.

1063
01:28:55,796 --> 01:28:59,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Motions, orders and resolutions 23-427 offered by Vice President Behrs.

1064
01:29:00,059 --> 01:29:16,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Zoning Planning and Development Subcommittee meet to discuss amendments to the section 8.4 of the zoning ordinance regarding short-term rentals to require a monthly report from all short-term rental platforms to ensure that the short-term rental units in Medford meet all requirements of this section.

1065
01:29:17,111 --> 01:29:17,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Behrs.

1066
01:29:20,387 --> 01:29:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: you, Madam President.

1067
01:29:21,849 --> 01:29:25,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think pretty self explanatory resolution.

1068
01:29:25,674 --> 01:29:38,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we did get some suggestions from our building interim building Commissioner Mr 40 on ways that we could further improve the zoning ordinance to ensure that short term rentals are beating all the requirements of, uh,

1069
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:41,018
[SPEAKER_02]: the zoning ordinance.

1070
01:29:41,539 --> 01:29:55,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So the main ones that I want to consider are actually making sure that folks are registering their units with the city so that we know where they are, and also requiring that the platforms issue a monthly report to the city.

1071
01:29:55,966 --> 01:30:09,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that we will end up with that direct connection with the platforms to remove noncompliant listings such as the tent and port-a-potty listing, infamously, that was put up over the summer.

1072
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:12,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, vice of affairs.

1073
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Any councilor say?

1074
01:30:14,844 --> 01:30:17,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank Councilors for introducing this.

1075
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:18,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I think these are common sense.

1076
01:30:21,174 --> 01:30:23,616
[SPEAKER_13]: amendments that we can discuss as a council.

1077
01:30:24,076 --> 01:30:33,024
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the previous meetings have shown us that we need to give ourselves more teeth when it comes to these ordinances and enforcing them.

1078
01:30:34,765 --> 01:30:38,268
[SPEAKER_13]: These are things that maybe the mayor's office could do.

1079
01:30:38,628 --> 01:30:48,316
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be their prerogative, but unfortunately, or fortunately for us, we should take it upon ourselves to do this.

1080
01:30:48,396 --> 01:30:49,577
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm totally in agreement.

1081
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:50,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to second it.

1082
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:51,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

1083
01:30:52,276 --> 01:30:52,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

1084
01:30:54,357 --> 01:30:56,979
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Seng.

1085
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:57,660
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1086
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Those opposed?

1087
01:30:59,161 --> 01:30:59,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1088
01:30:59,841 --> 01:31:11,249
[SPEAKER_11]: 23-428 offered by Vice President Behrs, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that we formally submit a petition to the Traffic Commission to require no parking or standing on Commercial Street during overnight hours.

1089
01:31:11,854 --> 01:31:20,776
[SPEAKER_11]: be it further resolved that we request the Traffic Commission review all streets with overnight parking of large commercial tractor trailers and make changes to parking regulations on those streets where necessary.

1090
01:31:20,796 --> 01:31:21,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Behrs.

1091
01:31:22,297 --> 01:31:23,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1092
01:31:23,037 --> 01:31:35,540
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a follow up from our discussion at the last meeting that I'm formally submitting as a resolution that I would like the clerk's office to submit as a petition to appear on the next Traffic Commission meeting agenda.

1093
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1094
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

1095
01:31:40,865 --> 01:31:44,911
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice-Chair Baer is seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

1096
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1097
01:31:45,612 --> 01:31:46,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1098
01:31:46,212 --> 01:31:46,793
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1099
01:31:51,213 --> 01:31:51,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his thing.

1100
01:31:52,294 --> 01:31:53,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his thing.

1101
01:31:53,415 --> 01:31:55,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have put you on it.

1102
01:31:55,036 --> 01:31:57,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have, I should have put Chancellor Caravella on it.

1103
01:31:57,758 --> 01:31:58,999
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, do you want to, you want to be on it?

1104
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1105
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to call it again because now I'm lost.

1106
01:32:04,323 --> 01:32:06,605
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of vice president Behrs, seconded by Councilor Caravella.

1107
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:07,345
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1108
01:32:07,706 --> 01:32:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1109
01:32:07,866 --> 01:32:09,167
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1110
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:10,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1111
01:32:10,888 --> 01:32:12,369
[SPEAKER_11]: 23-429 offered by vice president Behrs.

1112
01:32:12,469 --> 01:32:14,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council

1113
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:21,411
[SPEAKER_11]: the Board of Health regulations and Traffic Commission regulations be posted as appendices on the city's ordinance website, Unicode.

1114
01:32:22,112 --> 01:32:25,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just looking through, uh, I'm sorry.

1115
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:26,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1116
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:29,442
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1117
01:32:30,363 --> 01:32:32,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

1118
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:33,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1119
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:47,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was looking through MuniCode websites for other communities, as one does on a wonderful Thursday evening, and just noticed that a lot of communities have these documents put on MuniCode.

1120
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:52,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, you can't see traffic commission decisions and regulations.

1121
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:53,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have to go digging for them.

1122
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:54,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the Board of Health.

1123
01:32:55,362 --> 01:33:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a platform that is able to host those, and I think it would be great to have those up there as those are two

1124
01:33:01,879 --> 01:33:06,600
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, major sets of policies in our community that are set by boards other than this board.

1125
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate my colleagues' incredible support for my efforts.

1126
01:33:12,321 --> 01:33:14,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I second that.

1127
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:15,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1128
01:33:15,322 --> 01:33:17,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the council?

1129
01:33:17,302 --> 01:33:18,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang.

1130
01:33:23,003 --> 01:33:23,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nobody heard you.

1131
01:33:24,204 --> 01:33:25,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent it on our muni code.

1132
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:26,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going around.

1133
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:45,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say the only jokes that anyone on television has heard were my jokes because your microphones are not so On the motion of by Susan bears as emphatically seconded by councillor Scarpelli

1134
01:33:54,113 --> 01:33:54,753
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1135
01:33:54,773 --> 01:33:55,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1136
01:33:55,614 --> 01:33:56,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

1137
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:56,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1138
01:33:57,114 --> 01:34:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna get punchy after 845, huh?

1139
01:34:03,976 --> 01:34:06,097
[SPEAKER_11]: 23-430 offered by Councilor Carviello.

1140
01:34:06,157 --> 01:34:14,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the chapter 86, section 91 of the ordinances of the city of Medford be amended by adding private after public in this section.

1141
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:22,663
[SPEAKER_11]: This amendment will allow residents on private ways the same city services in cutting, trimming, or removal of trees as residents on public ways, article three, trees.

1142
01:34:22,763 --> 01:34:23,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carviello.

1143
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:30,326
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something we've been going back and forth on for a while.

1144
01:34:32,368 --> 01:34:36,450
[SPEAKER_07]: A private way goes back probably 100 years.

1145
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:41,413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an archaic law when living on a private way was something special.

1146
01:34:42,694 --> 01:34:43,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on a private way.

1147
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:44,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, it's something special.

1148
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:49,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's time that we have our city.

1149
01:34:49,799 --> 01:34:51,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a city solicitor.

1150
01:34:53,405 --> 01:35:03,427
[SPEAKER_07]: some city attorney revises it, and so that the residents that live on these private ways get the same benefits that everyone else gets.

1151
01:35:03,828 --> 01:35:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: They pay the same amount of taxes as everybody else, and they're entitled to the same amount of services that everybody else gets.

1152
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:21,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I know our city engineer is not in favor of doing any work in private ways, which is wrong, and I think that maybe we should invite

1153
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:30,128
[SPEAKER_07]: DPW, given back to discuss this further, I think, Madam President, I think you, were you planning on doing a committee of the whole of this sometime in the future?

1154
01:35:30,168 --> 01:35:37,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I actually have scheduled a committee of the whole for the 25th with a land use attorney from KP Law, that that was the recommendation.

1155
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:47,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I had spoken with DPW commissioners, as well as the city engineer, and they said they didn't feel qualified to make the calls based on MGL, what could or couldn't be done on private ways.

1156
01:35:47,516 --> 01:35:48,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have a meeting with the land use.

1157
01:35:48,796 --> 01:35:51,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I can invite them as well to that one.

1158
01:35:51,157 --> 01:35:51,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah.

1159
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:52,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I say, you know,

1160
01:35:53,141 --> 01:35:56,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an archaic law, so it goes back probably a hundred years.

1161
01:35:56,162 --> 01:36:03,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is no, there's nothing special about living on a private way, other than you get worse streets than other people have.

1162
01:36:05,467 --> 01:36:10,329
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll- Would you want to send this to that meeting?

1163
01:36:10,409 --> 01:36:14,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if we can send this to them and discuss it that day, it'd be appreciated.

1164
01:36:16,572 --> 01:36:17,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

1165
01:36:18,068 --> 01:36:19,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1166
01:36:19,389 --> 01:36:21,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bringing this up, Councilor Carviello.

1167
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:30,915
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've talked about resident issues on private ways in many ways, for many reasons on this council over the past couple of years.

1168
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:46,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is, you know, as we all observe, this is a really tricky issue where we're doubly constrained or constrained legally with rules for what we can and can't do under certain conditions on private ways.

1169
01:36:46,704 --> 01:36:47,605
[SPEAKER_01]: We're constrained by

1170
01:36:48,193 --> 01:36:56,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Our resources, I'm sure that everybody who works for the city would say, well, if money was no object, we would fix every street and trim every tree in a private way.

1171
01:36:56,115 --> 01:37:02,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, as we know, we're just not in the budgetary position to do that, nor to adopt all of the private ways.

1172
01:37:03,137 --> 01:37:04,958
[SPEAKER_07]: These people pay the same amount of taxes.

1173
01:37:05,523 --> 01:37:10,247
[SPEAKER_07]: that people who don't live on a private way, they should be entitled to the same services.

1174
01:37:10,307 --> 01:37:23,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not contesting that whatsoever, just flagging that that's the issue that we run into, because we know and residents know that they're entitled to safe streets and, you know, traversable sidewalks and the same quality of their environment as everybody else.

1175
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:26,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hampered by this rule and our resources.

1176
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:30,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the issue, because I think we're all in agreement that these are things that residents deserve.

1177
01:37:31,171 --> 01:37:42,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that we're opening this conversation again, and I think that this is a problem that ideally has some, you know, some short-term action steps we can take in addition to the long-term one, which is just to get the budget where we can incorporate all of these private ways.

1178
01:37:43,516 --> 01:37:53,400
[SPEAKER_01]: More to the point, I would just, you know, ask if you were open to also inviting the tree warden, since this, you know, pertains directly to her jurisdiction, as well as the DPW commissioner.

1179
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could have a really productive conversation.

1180
01:37:58,002 --> 01:37:58,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1181
01:37:58,262 --> 01:37:58,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you amenable to that?

1182
01:37:59,403 --> 01:37:59,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1183
01:37:59,923 --> 01:38:00,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1184
01:38:00,711 --> 01:38:01,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

1185
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:07,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a motion from Councilor Carviello to send this paper to the Committee of the Whole.

1186
01:38:07,796 --> 01:38:09,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be on October 25th.

1187
01:38:09,638 --> 01:38:10,738
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a land use attorney.

1188
01:38:10,758 --> 01:38:15,562
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll invite DPW Commissioner, City Engineer, and Tree Warden.

1189
01:38:15,702 --> 01:38:19,585
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1190
01:38:19,605 --> 01:38:20,385
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1191
01:38:20,566 --> 01:38:20,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1192
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:21,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

1193
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:22,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1194
01:38:24,529 --> 01:38:32,253
[SPEAKER_11]: 23-431, offered by Councilor Carviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the Traffic Commission Institute no overnight parking on Mystic Avenue and Ring Road.

1195
01:38:32,353 --> 01:38:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carviello.

1196
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:35,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1197
01:38:35,734 --> 01:38:47,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So, similar to what I offered and Councilor Baird's put back on this week, part of the reason I brought this on is because we're becoming a parking lot in Medford for everybody.

1198
01:38:47,719 --> 01:38:52,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone has ever driven down Mystic Avenue at 2 o'clock in the morning.

1199
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:57,458
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 100 cars parked there, and there's not a house anywhere near there.

1200
01:38:59,139 --> 01:39:05,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And these cars are all coming from the garages and body shops that are on Mystic Avenue in that small corridor.

1201
01:39:07,044 --> 01:39:11,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this goes back to our carpet field in the city.

1202
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:14,888
[SPEAKER_07]: There's cars with broken windows.

1203
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:18,630
[SPEAKER_07]: There's cars that sit there for days and days at a time.

1204
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is our parking departments?

1205
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:22,325
[SPEAKER_07]: They work at night.

1206
01:39:22,726 --> 01:39:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't these cars being tagged?

1207
01:39:24,347 --> 01:39:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: The cars have been sitting there for weeks at a time.

1208
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand why they're not getting tagged.

1209
01:39:32,072 --> 01:39:33,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Go by Ring Road.

1210
01:39:34,194 --> 01:39:36,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's turned into a taxi stand there.

1211
01:39:36,936 --> 01:39:42,300
[SPEAKER_07]: These taxis sit there all day, don't pay any meters, and do nothing.

1212
01:39:43,581 --> 01:39:45,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And they park there all night.

1213
01:39:47,082 --> 01:39:51,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we're turning into a parking lot for other cities and other businesses.

1214
01:39:52,284 --> 01:39:54,045
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no taxis in this city.

1215
01:39:54,305 --> 01:39:55,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Those cars aren't registered in our city.

1216
01:39:56,766 --> 01:40:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Those cars don't belong there overnight and on the overnight.

1217
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:09,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ask that the Traffic Commission institute no overnight parking on both Mystic Avenue and Ring Road.

1218
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:12,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1219
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:15,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

1220
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:17,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

1221
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:18,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Second the motion.

1222
01:40:18,913 --> 01:40:22,015
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Carvalho, seconded by Vice Mayor Behrs.

1223
01:40:22,055 --> 01:40:22,695
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1224
01:40:22,715 --> 01:40:23,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1225
01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:24,156
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1226
01:40:24,176 --> 01:40:24,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1227
01:40:25,617 --> 01:40:32,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Communications from the Mayor, 23-432 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding teacher accommodation.

1228
01:40:32,914 --> 01:40:42,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit to the Medford City Council the following request for a food truck permit in the City of Medford in addition to City Council approval.

1229
01:40:42,723 --> 01:40:45,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Vendors are required to adhere to health department food safety requirements.

1230
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:54,715
[SPEAKER_11]: The Brooks PTO dates and times on the motion of Councilor Scarbelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Ariello.

1231
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:55,836
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1232
01:40:56,016 --> 01:40:56,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1233
01:40:56,536 --> 01:40:57,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

1234
01:40:57,297 --> 01:40:58,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_11]: going to public participation.

1236
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:05,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone who would like to speak for public participation either in person or on Zoom?

1237
01:41:08,491 --> 01:41:09,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none.

1238
01:41:09,691 --> 01:41:11,132
