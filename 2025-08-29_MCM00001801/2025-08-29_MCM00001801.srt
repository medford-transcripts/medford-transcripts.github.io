1
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:04,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Recording in progress.

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:20,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we start the meeting, we have to go to approve the minutes from the last meeting.

3
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to accept the minutes.

4
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Second the motion?

5
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:33,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Second the motion.

6
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:34,954
[SPEAKER_01]: All in favor?

7
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:36,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

8
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:37,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

9
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:38,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

10
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:53,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So we accept the minutes from the last meeting and then let's determine the meeting for next month, which is September 17th.

11
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:56,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that, everybody?

12
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been some discussion about trying to plan it during the day so that we could try to get like the tree warden or the transportation director to come.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that you guys would want to try to do next month?

14
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:15,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that some future month after that?

15
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:22,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't planned on taking that day off.

16
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do a lunch in our community center.

17
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:31,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I wouldn't be there.

18
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:32,908
[SPEAKER_03]: September 17th.

19
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:39,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just daytime meetings in general, you wouldn't be able to.

20
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked during the day too, so.

21
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:43,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean.

22
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:46,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that can be like a future.

23
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:57,281
[SPEAKER_08]: month thing, and then maybe we can try to coordinate so that we can figure out a date and then see if we can get it all off.

24
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way we can do it.

25
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:04,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be good for us, especially for our residents of Medford.

26
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next meeting, the 17th, we're good?

27
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:11,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

28
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:11,925
[SPEAKER_01]: The 17th?

29
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:12,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

30
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:14,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on a Wednesday.

31
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was a long night.

32
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:32,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that it's right after.

33
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:33,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after the unveil.

34
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:33,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

35
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:34,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

36
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

37
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to talk about events next?

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:41,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

40
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:58,068
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the ones that I've, the past events from our, since our last meeting that I'm, that I was aware of.

41
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:02,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer's Market was a lecture I met for tabling at it.

42
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:07,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a connectors event.

43
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:14,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the next couple of months, these are the events that I'm aware of.

44
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lizette's Ice Cream Social.

45
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:19,303
[SPEAKER_03]: at the senior center.

46
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:21,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a climate event?

47
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:23,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

48
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:27,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw that there's going to be a climate-themed bingo, too.

49
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:28,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

50
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,947
[SPEAKER_02]: What time is that?

51
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:33,188
[SPEAKER_02]: At one.

52
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:34,768
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 11th?

53
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:35,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you say?

55
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:36,489
[SPEAKER_08]: At one?

56
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,149
[SPEAKER_08]: The senior center will be at at one?

57
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:38,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

58
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, uh... The electropharm effort at the farmer's market, it's the same day.

59
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,671
[SPEAKER_08]: What time is it, though?

60
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's three to seven.

61
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:46,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

62
00:03:53,077 --> 00:04:05,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And June, Lizette was just saying earlier that she thought it would be good to have one or two of our energy coaches for Electrify Medford at the Ice Cream Social too.

63
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:08,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So there could be a table set up and people could talk to them if they want to.

64
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sounds great.

65
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:11,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

66
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll reach out to them to see who's available.

67
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:25,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'll be able to make that one because there is something else that I have to go to earlier in the day, a Mass Save meeting that I have to go to earlier in the day.

68
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:29,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you mean if you go to the Method Connects table with resources to render?

69
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, or we can combine them into one.

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

71
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:44,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have an Electrify Medford table at the Mystic River Celebration.

72
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you're doing that, right?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,320
OK.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

75
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:53,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you having a Medford Connects table there too?

76
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume.

77
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:58,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we've talked about it.

78
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do that.

79
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,507
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that sometimes, right?

80
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be.

81
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:04,389
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

82
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be at Tufts Community Day for Electrify Medford.

83
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:19,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that is, I think it's in the afternoon.

84
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's 11 to 2 on a Sunday.

85
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:30,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

86
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:35,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the Haitian mental health events at the senior center.

87
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there are a couple of the electron that for.

88
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Creole-speaking coaches are going to be doing that.

89
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And then was that... So what time is that?

90
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,901
[SPEAKER_07]: What time is the mental health one?

91
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Two to six, right?

92
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, three to six.

93
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Three to six.

94
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

95
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:04,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Three to six.

96
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:05,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

97
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I talked with Darlene briefly about it, but I didn't get any more details.

98
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:10,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

99
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the calendar.

100
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:18,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, you're right.

101
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I should add that.

102
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:21,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

103
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: September 26, right?

104
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:25,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

105
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:25,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

106
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't sure so that I wasn't sure what we're what we're going to do for that.

107
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:36,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it was something with you guys, then it would be like themed around whatever you'd want to do.

108
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:42,550
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, we would I would have found something some other theme around the something else from the PDS department.

109
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll add that to this list.

110
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, Lisette, there's your Hispanic Heritage Month event.

111
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, October.

112
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:58,986
[SPEAKER_07]: What time is that?

113
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be an event from 2 to 6.

114
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,754
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

115
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Up here, Chambers.

116
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I updated the calendar to a metric next right now.

117
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:17,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way, in our calendar, we can have it.

118
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be just one event edition?

119
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:19,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, one.

120
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like four hours is a long time for an event.

121
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:27,125
[SPEAKER_03]: That just might be my patience.

122
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:32,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think, I don't know if Patrick and I, we came up with that.

123
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:35,026
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that two be determined?

124
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:38,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that's what we... Question mark.

125
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:39,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

126
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the green flowers is pretty cool.

127
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

128
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,530
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening at the Hispanic Heritage Month event?

129
00:07:53,390 --> 00:08:01,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we did three to eight, so we have like a few things.

130
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it in here.

131
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:10,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get it out so we can... What time is it?

132
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it River Celebration?

133
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

134
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it here somewhere.

135
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,305
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 to 4.

136
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, seems like a long time for an event.

137
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a lot of different entertainment there.

138
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they'll have, like, musicians and dancers and all kinds of different things.

139
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:37,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

140
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

141
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,330
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so we have where I'm

142
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:53,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Hiring again, Esther Gomez, she was an edutainer from the Medgar family network that we used for the other events.

143
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:54,225
[SPEAKER_08]: She was really good.

144
00:08:54,866 --> 00:09:04,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've clipped face with her and have a meeting with her of what we're gonna come up with this year, because I'm trying to do something that's interactive with the people.

145
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:11,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in the three mini events that we had last year, one of them was the dancing and stuff like that, and I think that was

146
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing even the mayor was like, and then it was coming that works, taking care of that right?

147
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:20,587
[SPEAKER_08]: They got a plan to have her to do some events.

148
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

149
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:46,929
[SPEAKER_08]: um marie cassie's gonna see so it's like a it's like like a mix yeah but like patrick and i i still have to actually not been in touch with him about like because i asked him since this year is a bit different with like budget wise and stuff to like to kind of help us with like how much for the food should we do how much for entertainment and stuff like that so that way like

150
00:09:47,469 --> 00:10:12,229
[SPEAKER_08]: we're not overspending on like one specific thing because even though like I think the first event that we did was big I think we spend a lot on food but in in general like I think we like hit like our market we didn't you know spend more spend less so it's just like now since like all our vendors that we had in the past we don't have them anymore so we're now looking for new ones

151
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:19,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So that obviously we need to know what's the limit of what we can spend and then talk to whoever we're going to hire for.

152
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:27,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the storytelling event last year with Esther and that was really good.

153
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:34,394
[SPEAKER_03]: She was doing like Spanish and English telling of the same story with like, yeah.

154
00:10:35,631 --> 00:11:05,005
[SPEAKER_08]: you had her little props and stuff and the kids were like all jumping and doing and like it wasn't even just like storytelling it was the kids are interacting with it too so she'd be like all right like I don't know it's like the mountains exploding or something and be like yeah but it's like go like that and do your like exploding like move or whatever it was really good it's great it's very energetic oh yeah I keep losing the tv

155
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:15,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And then October 18th is my department's big event, which is the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

156
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:23,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So similar to previous years, we'll have like electronics recycling, we'll have paper shredding, we'll have textile recycling.

157
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:31,979
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be, sorry, this keeps, like clothing, blankets, things like that.

158
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Giving them a little kind of to review, like, actual recycling.

159
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:42,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's things that can't be I think what they do is they'll take things that can be reused out.

160
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: But the things that can't be reused will actually get recycled.

161
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

162
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have those bins at the schools, the white, we have the white recycling.

163
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:50,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

164
00:11:50,945 --> 00:12:03,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and actually, uh, this year we're actually using the same company as it has the bins at the schools because the parent teacher organizations, they'll, they'll actually get funding back from that.

165
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:07,238
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a fundraising thing that they do for the textile recycling.

166
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And recycling is in your area.

167
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to talk about recycling in my classes.

168
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:35,030
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah absolutely even just you know how what you're allowed to put in your bin and what you're not supposed to put in your bin and we offered compost yeah everything like that i think something really good for the people in classes yeah absolutely and so for that event then we should do it prior to that event so that that'll be for it that's what i do yeah that'd be great

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that is 12 to 3.

170
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:40,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

171
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:40,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

172
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

173
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:41,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

174
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:49,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they will they'll recycle what they can and then they'll properly dispose of what they can't.

175
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:49,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

176
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:18,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of those will have like heavy metals and things inside them that you don't want to just go into the regular trash and batteries and things.

177
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:18,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

178
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:24,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases you might need to pay a small fee for a particular item.

179
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:30,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we'll have a flyer coming out that'll list exactly what can and can't be done.

180
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I've been told in the past that if it fits in your garbage can, just throw it in your garbage can.

181
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:37,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

182
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

183
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:40,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

184
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,200
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to do that.

185
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too bad.

186
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like a booklet about trash and recycling that might be a good thing for you to use in your... Yeah.

187
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:48,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

188
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: The Hispanic character event is from 3 to 5, but I put 2 to 6 because the character books that I'm making up, that's why.

189
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:14,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

190
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:15,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

191
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:16,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

192
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:16,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

193
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And no dancing.

194
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:19,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Who said that?

195
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:20,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Dancing, that's right.

196
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,155
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what Ernie's in the class.

197
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:33,956
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be inside?

198
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't want to do it outside.

199
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:47,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the big bed is inside, so that's why I have it reserved.

200
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:55,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Harvest Your Energy Festival, the other stuff there, there's going to be a beer garden, there's going to be food, we have bands.

201
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of tabling for different groups.

202
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:04,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a transportation corner this year.

203
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So last year, we had an electric vehicle showcase, which was great.

204
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:08,374
[SPEAKER_03]: People loved it.

205
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there were people who were like, where's the love for the bikes?

206
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:17,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year, our transportation corner is going to be focused on biking and public transportation.

207
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are the hours for that one?

208
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of these bikes.

209
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:30,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that is 12 to three.

210
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:32,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

211
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

212
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:33,646
Yeah.

213
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:40,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, at the EV showcase that we had at city hall, we had bikes, not the one at the, at the McGlynn school.

214
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:42,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

215
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

216
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

217
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:51,793
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to take care of their bikes, you know, like something for kids where they learn how to, you know,

218
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,335
[SPEAKER_11]: chain and what they need.

219
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:58,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because I just see a lot of kids in their backyard.

220
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,604
[SPEAKER_11]: think of it as an alternative.

221
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And they leave it rusted.

222
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

223
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,285
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's a waste.

224
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:11,746
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, you know, as they get older, it can be a better alternative than a car.

225
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:12,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

226
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:18,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can have the police department apply the helmet for them.

227
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:19,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

228
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:20,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they do that?

229
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:21,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.

230
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:23,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

231
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have to reach out to them because I hadn't heard that.

232
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.

233
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:51,196
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like with all this electric stuff, you know, everywhere I go, I try to bring this up because I'm trying to find ways, not only in Medford, but everywhere I go, if you can find a way that it can educate people about electric scooters and how they don't obey the rules and stuff like that.

234
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:59,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seriously, I mean, waiting for something really tragic to happen, you know, for people to do something about it, you know, like,

235
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,282
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wonderful, everything's electric and blah, blah, blah.

236
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, should follow rules, you know, like, I just like, I see so many people flying sidewalks and, you know, like going between the cars and stopping.

237
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them are kids too, or young adults, you know.

238
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:16,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

239
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:19,895
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a new thing that just happened, like the, you know.

240
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:24,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know if you don't establish some rules and come together as a community and try to,

241
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm teaching them how to do something now.

242
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,972
[SPEAKER_08]: something really bad is going to happen.

243
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And then people go, Oh, let's do something about it.

244
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we always need to wait?

245
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:38,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

246
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:41,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we always need to wait for something bad to happen for us to do something about it?

247
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,254
[SPEAKER_03]: There are rules around that.

248
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:52,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for instance, you're not allowed to ride just bikes even on the sidewalks in like city centers, like in the, in Medford square here.

249
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:58,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But just when I was going to get my bubble tea today, someone was riding his electric bike on the sidewalk.

250
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it was kids.

251
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:00,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

252
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:26,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna have to find some really fun thoughts, you know, because it's kids, you know, you say rules to kids, they're just gonna be like, yeah, but like, who knows, I'm sure they have some really just kids, but parents are still like, if they get something like that for my kids, you know, like, hey, these are the rules, you know, like, so we need to kind of learn the parents because like, comes from home to, you know, it's not just as a

253
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:28,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

254
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I agree with all of that.

255
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:33,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that cars are much more dangerous for people.

256
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:38,099
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of car deaths recently for hitting pedestrians.

257
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to be responsible for you being responsible.

258
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:49,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the cars are reckless to be driving on those bike routes.

259
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see that a lot, too.

260
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:59,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they're putting like the, you know, it's like a kind of like white, like with the lights thing.

261
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So like, yeah.

262
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:02,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

263
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:02,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

264
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:09,641
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's more like we we want to motivate people to get those things and, you know, say, you know,

265
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:27,828
[SPEAKER_08]: everything and then go to that more clean energy thing you know maybe can combine with that some teaching that some warning you know like some you're saying kind of like you know how like um they have commercial don't drink don't drive type stuff or like put on your seatbelt when you're like

266
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:36,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Going in a car, is you're saying like, like something like that, like getting irresponsible.

267
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:43,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know, like, you know, you can save money by getting an electric car, but you still need to follow the same rules that a regular car, you know, like an electric bike.

268
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:47,838
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, did you know that you're not allowed to be riding any bike on the sidewalk?

269
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,941
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one resilience, like cars and bikes are going to have to get along.

270
00:19:52,505 --> 00:20:03,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Money's not going to go away for the reasons that you say, the money, the energy savings, right?

271
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:07,828
[SPEAKER_11]: But cars and bikes have to learn to get along, which means everybody has to follow the rules.

272
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:10,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the rules need to apply for everybody, you know what I mean?

273
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you, yeah.

274
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And with cars being as well.

275
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:24,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So but about this event in particular, I know that, so Electron Medford has a table there.

276
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:27,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have carnival games that we had at Circle the Square.

277
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are always a big draw.

278
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:35,400
[SPEAKER_03]: The Energy and Environment Committee, they're going to have, they're going to do tours of the inside of the wind turbine.

279
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to have information about like invasive species, like

280
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:48,024
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic takeout containers, talking about the city's electricity aggregation.

281
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:52,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe about the tree ordinance, although Trees Medford might do that.

282
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:56,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the tree ordinance.

283
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can't have certain kinds of trees?

284
00:20:59,048 --> 00:20:59,588
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

285
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's proposed there's proposed tree ordinances that will have rules for what trees can be

286
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: removed basically what trees can be cut down.

287
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

288
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:23,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and like if you cut down a tree over a certain size then there's some amount that you would pay into a fund to plant new trees and things like that.

289
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so there's a public tree ordinance so and then there's a private tree ordinance as well so that hasn't been passed yet but it's that's in discussion.

290
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:43,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of the reasons why they were, folks were interested in having the tree boarding come to the meeting is to talk about that and about other things.

291
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:43,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

292
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:52,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And because you have a lot of residents also that have brought up to us that they wish certain parts of the city had more trees and how to request that.

293
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't know how to respond to that.

294
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:55,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And not even that.

295
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember we talked about it.

296
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,711
[SPEAKER_08]: There was residents who they requested to take a tree down, but a tree that's been there for years.

297
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:09,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, some of them were like, a majority of people were bummed that they took off the tree.

298
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:13,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, that's part of the reason why too.

299
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:16,169
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a table there, right?

300
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

301
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did see that you were signed up for a table.

302
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what you're doing at the table?

303
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:27,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there, I think they're trying to have folks do more like activities to be engaged with people.

304
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys remember something?

305
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:30,675
[SPEAKER_08]: We did that with Penny.

306
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,016
[SPEAKER_08]: The harvest your energy.

307
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,533
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was just you, Natasha, maybe Jennifer.

308
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:38,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the pictures.

309
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:42,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm trying to like, I mean, so I remember the pictures, but I'm trying to figure out what we did.

310
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:45,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, Charbel, were you and your mom there, too?

311
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was there for the last two years.

312
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:51,784
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we do?

313
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:54,326
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a table with three of us.

314
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:56,267
[SPEAKER_08]: With information?

315
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I see the wheel.

316
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the picture of just trying everything.

317
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I see the wheel, but...

318
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I think a wheel would be wonderful to have.

319
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:06,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.

320
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:07,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

321
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:11,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, the wheel was there.

322
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:11,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

323
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:15,263
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when the tent was there.

324
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:15,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, right.

325
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:18,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the pole.

326
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:22,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell me about anything like you had?

327
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:23,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

328
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:29,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So the MWRA is going to be there with their water fountain trunk thing, too.

329
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:30,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

330
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that, too.

331
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:36,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a silver truck, and it looks like a fountain.

332
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Like six fountains on it?

333
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:39,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

334
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has enough for you to, like, water.

335
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so cool.

336
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:46,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take it to every event outside I live in.

337
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:54,019
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have, like, the reverse osmosis thing over there in Wellington, over there where Dunkin' Donuts is.

338
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could go and fill up, you know, you know, you know, a gallon of water.

339
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, it was, you could just go and feel it.

340
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: It was right next to the cactus.

341
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:07,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

342
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:08,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

343
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,587
[SPEAKER_08]: They had one near my house when they're gone.

344
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:11,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

345
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:11,889
[SPEAKER_08]: In Sholanda.

346
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:19,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about that, in Portugal, in like the beautiful like areas in the middle, they have beautiful stone fountains.

347
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:21,659
[SPEAKER_08]: and water's coming out, drinkable water.

348
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:25,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And so tourists and anyone can just go and get water.

349
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's always running.

350
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:32,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a fountain in the city hall that we can fill out a water fountain?

351
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we do have a water fountain on the first floor.

352
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,147
[SPEAKER_08]: We can put a water bottle.

353
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, not that I know of.

354
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:41,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not that I know of.

355
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:46,052
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to spend money.

356
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:47,993
[SPEAKER_08]: We can water fountains in our office.

357
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:57,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But granted, those that are there have been there since the dawn of time.

358
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,557
[SPEAKER_03]: They have those at the schools, I know.

359
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you can fill your bottles.

360
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:01,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

361
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:06,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We donate a lot of bottles for the kids, you know, because they use a lot.

362
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:16,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought that was pretty cool that it's, you know, we use like for every office, you know, and each of us have our own, but like the cups that we use, you know, like we use.

363
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:18,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

364
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:21,759
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but save the planet too, you know, all those planets.

365
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

366
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,444
[SPEAKER_03]: In our office, the water bubbler that we have is not one where you replace the thing.

367
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:33,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just connected right into the water hose and you can put your water bottle in to do it.

368
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:33,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

369
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,930
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

370
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

371
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:50,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that way, like... I mean, it might be that you don't have, all of them don't have access to the water pipes in all the offices.

372
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

373
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:54,578
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a sink that is going to be moved, so maybe we can do that.

374
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:58,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, who do we ask for that?

375
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be the facilities director.

376
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

377
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to facilitate that?

378
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I should just pop in and let them know and ask them.

379
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

380
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:21,625
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about that, Brenda.

381
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:23,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to tell about it?

382
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:24,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to?

383
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:25,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

384
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Brenda asked me for like the coaching, but also like pins.

385
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:38,795
[SPEAKER_03]: T-shirts and pins for our energy coaches when they're doing volunteer events.

386
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds to me like, I'm getting electricity in Wichita.

387
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

388
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:45,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the slogan, you know?

389
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:53,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more about like, switching from fossil fuels to electricity and to cleaner electricity.

390
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:58,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I noticed the other cities are having electrified airframes, electrified mountains.

391
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we jumped on the bandwagon.

392
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:04,269
[SPEAKER_08]: what's going on over here.

393
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are brand new.

394
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Solarize, right?

395
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:14,218
[SPEAKER_03]: When everyone was doing the Solarize programs, Medford did a Solarize Medford program because people get used to the sound of it.

396
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that, yeah, it becomes more understandable.

397
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:29,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I went to one event and they had this group of, you know, doing the Electrify event and then they kind of lost still, you know, like they're trying to figure out how, you know what I mean?

398
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:38,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything else you want to talk about in terms of any of these events or other events that aren't listed here that we want to mention?

399
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:43,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this in September or in January?

400
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:44,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have September and October here.

401
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:51,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because it's September and October, do you have any suggestion of giveaways that it could be giving?

402
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of go with giveaway climate and stuff.

403
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:58,624
[SPEAKER_08]: We have fans.

404
00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:00,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have fans right now.

405
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:03,463
[SPEAKER_03]: By October, we should do something different.

406
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good question.

407
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:12,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Water bottles are a good thing for things like the Harvester Energy Festival.

408
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have the water fountain there.

409
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:19,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think water bottles might be a good thing, as long as they're BPA free and keeping that in mind.

410
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:26,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we brainstormed a list of things, too.

411
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:27,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check that out and get back to you.

412
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:33,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was having some trouble to find things around this time, you know.

413
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not easy.

414
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:46,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you've got like tissues, you know, like you get a package of tissues for people, you know, like because this is the start of the season of running nose and all issues, you know, all.

415
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:48,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm like, I have no idea what.

416
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:54,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a thing from the, from the auction routine about what to do about batteries?

417
00:28:56,141 --> 00:28:58,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have battery recycling there.

418
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:04,888
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, what do you think people should be doing normally with their batteries?

419
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:07,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they're going to save them for once a year, right?

420
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:07,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

421
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:07,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

422
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the expectation?

423
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Save up your batteries for a year?

424
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:12,252
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

425
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:19,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Up in the DPW office here and I think at 21 James Street there, you can drop off your batteries for recycling.

426
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:24,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Do that at Best Buy, Home Depot and places like that.

427
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:28,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be something to publicize because I think that's a

428
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:32,338
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a big time impact and I think most people still do.

429
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:35,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do.

430
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when I worked at the university, it was so easy.

431
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,621
[SPEAKER_11]: You just take him out of the university and deal with it.

432
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,182
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't work there anymore.

433
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:43,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what to do.

434
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:54,345
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the thing too, like, you need to go somewhere to do it, you know, like, so we put out that one more thing in my list that I need to go to City Hall or whatever.

435
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:54,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

436
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:57,086
[SPEAKER_08]: To take it there, to take care of this, so.

437
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,875
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, what about those youth works people, like, and they do some, you know.

438
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:31,998
[SPEAKER_11]: battery well yeah something like that like or figure out like what you're saying like figure out it wouldn't be so bad if the drop-off was easy like the grocery store everybody goes to the grocery store why can't i just drop my batteries out there and somebody will deal with that someone closer like if you have like a drop-off at the library because there you go someone who lives closer to the library would be easier for them to go to the library instead of walk all the way to the city hall or you know places anyway there's i don't know if

439
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:36,101
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a youth works, you know, that, that stuff that Matisse is doing with the kids.

440
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,482
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's some, they can figure out some kind of thing.

441
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:45,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, work program with an organization or a company or an office.

442
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:46,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

443
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:48,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like an intern.

444
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,831
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not for us.

445
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:53,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe someone, yeah.

446
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:57,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that the program.

447
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:59,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, batteries.

448
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have something to say?

449
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:03,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Who, me?

450
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:03,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

451
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:04,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I thought I heard you.

452
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I was clearing my throat, sorry.

453
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:06,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

454
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:08,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm listening though.

455
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:24,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, is there, like, you know how you, like, for example, I'm signed up for, like, HP, like, the eight cartridges, and, like, they always bring in the box, like, one of the slips that you don't even have to pay.

456
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:28,590
[SPEAKER_08]: You just put the stuff that you already use, and then bring it to the post office, and then you're good.

457
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, like, staples or someplace like that.

458
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:31,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:56,957
[SPEAKER_08]: But we could come up, just like we were talking about the water, you know, in City Hall, we can think about the ways that all the office can do a better job with the recycling and stuff like that, too, you know, like, is everybody really throwing, sometimes I see the recycling bin when they break out the boxes, you know, like there's stuff that don't belong over there, you know, like, so maybe, you know, we educate people inside of here, too.

460
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's so video.

461
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:06,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we can kind of is that something that this group wants to take on is to do some education folks.

462
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:11,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that would be a cool project.

463
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.

464
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:14,783
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be wonderful.

465
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we can dig into that a little bit more next time then.

466
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:22,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.

467
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:33,251
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're good with these events, I think the next thing on the agenda was the brainstorming improvements for future events.

468
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:38,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have anything you wanted to kick us off with there?

469
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:50,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I went over, you know, like the other meetings that we had and we had discussed, like, maybe we need to come up with some more new alternative of games and interaction with people.

470
00:32:50,865 --> 00:33:08,556
[SPEAKER_08]: that we are always not just a wheel table, you know, like, always the same, not that we have a climate thing, but like, yeah, that's awesome, you know, like, but it's, I was googling some alternative of games and stuff, but something easy and that it can interact with everybody.

471
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:14,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we're kind of so focused on little kids, then grownups, how can we combine those things?

472
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And the giveaways too, you know, like, how can we,

473
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:45,079
[SPEAKER_08]: especially like if we are hosting the events that just like I asked you what we should be getting, you know, for giveaways that you're going to be kind of incorporating your team, you know, so maybe can give you options of when they invited people, vendors, you know, for the events and let them know, hey, those are some ideas of things that would be super cool to have, you know, to provide if you're looking for new giveaways options, you know, because sometimes we don't know, you know,

474
00:33:45,645 --> 00:34:05,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've heard that public is or yeah, and we've heard that complaint from people at previous harvest your energy festivals to where the vendors who are tabling will have giveaways that are like cheap plastic that gets thrown away and people get really upset because their kids will take it and then they'll just take them home and throw them away and flyers.

475
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:35,445
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly yeah like maybe y'all everybody just do your cure code or put it in acrylic you know your flyer so people can take pictures instead of handle papers like we oh that's something that i i talked to patrick about for like on my the spanish heritage but that like i wanted to do like more like even for us for outreach for us to have either on our phones for like you know we're trying to get more people into like the whatsapp groups and things like that

476
00:34:36,265 --> 00:35:05,182
[SPEAKER_08]: um either like we have it's just like interact you know what i mean like you can do it like for the first half let everything chill and then if more people know coming you could go back in it but like have like at least like um what's it called um oh my god like a little like those boards like a small one and just have like for the list you can write the name the number of the person and then the qr code there for like facebook for like us or whatever just things like that and qr codes for all the

477
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,317
[SPEAKER_08]: like where all the resources.

478
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:13,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be a page with just QR codes that have like Medford Family Network, Medford Connects.

479
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:20,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you can log into the games, you know, like, I'm going to play a game.

480
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you need to like your page on Facebook or whatever, you know, like, you know, like, or something, you know, where you do, you know what I mean?

481
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:36,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that too, if you follow six pages or something like that, like of us, you can, you can.

482
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:45,708
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I did for the Brazilian day and it was a huge hit, you know, like they put it like animals from Brazil all around, surrounded a lot.

483
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:52,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And then people, the kids would go and look for it and they come to the table and get a prize, you know, so that would be a cool thing.

484
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:58,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Like find a recycling bin or find this specific electric car or whatever, you know, like that would be cool.

485
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:07,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I know at previous Harvest Your Energy festivals, they had like a treasure hunt type thing where you would go to different tables and get stamped.

486
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,502
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the best working ones too.

487
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

488
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:19,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you give away a sticker at the end, designed by Lizette, that would be perfect.

489
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:22,271
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot of stickers.

490
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And on that note, I have a question, guys.

491
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:36,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm looking at the calendar and there's 2 in October that we didn't mention.

492
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, family night.

493
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:41,166
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

494
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:43,887
[SPEAKER_07]: There's family night.

495
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:48,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, but that's the public schools.

496
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:49,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

497
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the family engagement night for elementary, you know.

498
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:57,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we are waiting for the public to let us know when they're going to decide to do it.

499
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:58,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

500
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:03,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that goes to your committee, but I just want to let you know.

501
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:03,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

502
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:11,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And they use us more for the translation part, what they usually use us, I should say.

503
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:24,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa in my office sometimes does buttons, like she'll have a button making station where people can like draw their own pictures and then make a button out of it.

504
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:24,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

505
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:28,826
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really good idea.

506
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:29,706
[SPEAKER_11]: A button machine?

507
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that's a good concept.

508
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:32,167
[SPEAKER_11]: People love that.

509
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:34,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So she has one.

510
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:39,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little, it's a little fussy in terms of like the steps that you have to go through to do it.

511
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:41,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So the kids can't necessarily do it themselves.

512
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:44,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they can draw the thing and then you would make it for them.

513
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:45,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

514
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:45,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

515
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:46,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

516
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Bringing the buttons back, huh?

517
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it make a pin?

518
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a pin or a, how is it attached?

519
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:53,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

520
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:53,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

521
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:54,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pin.

522
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:55,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

523
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:57,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that too dangerous for kids?

524
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,365
[SPEAKER_08]: There's magnets too, people do magnets.

525
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dangerous for kids too.

526
00:38:02,466 --> 00:38:06,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be more dangerous for kids because they could swallow them.

527
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:10,530
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, but in the back, it's not big like that.

528
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a little.

529
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

530
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:31,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Two magnets together between the, with the clothing in between.

531
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I know parents can be really sensitive about magnets and children because they can hit them, but yeah.

532
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

533
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:42,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just getting ready to say, just turn to the paragraph right there.

534
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:48,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's basically like, this is the magnet and that's the size of the frame.

535
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:54,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something that connects, like it's in the back of the backing of the images.

536
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys get it?

537
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

538
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,042
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wouldn't be dangerous for kids.

539
00:38:59,243 --> 00:38:59,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

540
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:07,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one that has like my name and title on it and that's not that big, but yeah, but there are versions.

541
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

542
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:08,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

543
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

544
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:20,600
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so we can work on some fun activities that, you know, we can work together for the harvest energy.

545
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

546
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:24,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then, you know, talk about all the.

547
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:28,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the next project to that, how to educate the city hall.

548
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:32,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The next time for the next meeting.

549
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

550
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:34,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

551
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:38,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, each of us can do, like, at least like 3 ideas of what to do for activities.

552
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,256
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you know.

553
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:41,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Next next meeting, right?

554
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:41,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

555
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:41,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

556
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:54,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just for that event or just for events in general?

557
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:54,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Events in general.

558
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:55,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

559
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:56,546
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a ton to select.

560
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,147
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm like, we should start somewhere.

561
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:05,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's prepare for that specific event and then it can kind of see what it can take from that event that it can bring for the, you know.

562
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:09,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just for us to have a future, you know, ideas.

563
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:11,855
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

564
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:28,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one thing I noticed, um, from, well, actually at the Brazilian event, because we had the, um, open space survey happening right next to us, people love giving their opinion.

565
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:35,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, our net, my next electrifying Medford event, I should just have like a little, like.

566
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:49,275
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing for people to put stickers up that's like gas or heat pumps or whatever, just to get the conversation started because people love giving you their opinion.

567
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:51,876
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really good idea.

568
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:58,400
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been to events where they said, let's do more of, like that's one board, let's do less of, that's another board.

569
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And then people can say, you know, more pedestrian friendly, less blah, blah, blah.

570
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:09,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I get a wall of less bicycles.

571
00:41:09,526 --> 00:41:13,507
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it gives you an opportunity to talk with people about it.

572
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:19,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the secret square, the planning house, you were just like me.

573
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:23,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally put the table on the side and then we did like that.

574
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I love that because like I think it doesn't fly anywhere.

575
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:26,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

576
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like you definitely should check it out.

577
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:31,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the housing one, right?

578
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:31,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

579
00:41:32,211 --> 00:41:32,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

580
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:33,892
[SPEAKER_08]: The affordable housing group.

581
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

582
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:34,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's great.

583
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:35,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

584
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:35,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

585
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:51,919
[SPEAKER_07]: What about seeds for giveaways?

586
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeds?

587
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,039
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

588
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,821
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one year, yeah, but this time of the year, you know, yeah.

589
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:01,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

590
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,321
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

591
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:07,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things that you would plant in the fall are like bulbs, though, not seeds.

592
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:07,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

593
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:12,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have to be aware of that.

594
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we did that in the spring with the food,

595
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:20,689
[SPEAKER_08]: concert that we were participating with the YMCA, remember?

596
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so fun.

597
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So they had the little soil and they could choose their seed, remember?

598
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:32,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I even did it with RISE, you know, the other events and it brings a lot of people.

599
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:37,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just need to see what we can plant at the same time of the year.

600
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:38,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

601
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

602
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Herbs for something, something can be indoor.

603
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:42,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

604
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:51,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Libby, do you have any suggestion for seeds that could be planted this type of year, or is that not something for this time of year?

605
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:57,515
[SPEAKER_07]: What seeds can we use for this?

606
00:42:57,636 --> 00:42:58,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, June must know.

607
00:42:58,936 --> 00:42:59,337
[SPEAKER_07]: June?

608
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:00,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

609
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:00,878
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're right.

610
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:02,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually bulbs.

611
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of seeds that.

612
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:10,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, though, there are seeds that need to be cold, winter stratification.

613
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:13,503
[SPEAKER_05]: But I usually do it inside.

614
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I put them in my refrigerator.

615
00:43:17,285 --> 00:43:17,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

616
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:18,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

617
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:21,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're flowers usually.

618
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:24,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

619
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me think about it.

620
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some perennials that you plant that way.

621
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:38,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's for the spring, you know, anything during the spring.

622
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:44,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sort of thing I think if you're giving away the seeds, you would need to probably give away the pot and the soil for it too.

623
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:45,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, yeah.

624
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:55,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I did with YMCA and then I did for Rice, I bought the pots on Amazon.

625
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw it on Home Depot page.

626
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But the kids just love scooping the stuff.

627
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:03,702
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did different.

628
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:07,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of print out the plants, how they look.

629
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:10,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the seeds just have the name of the seeds and what they're doing.

630
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So for them to see what it's going to look like.

631
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,010
[SPEAKER_08]: What it's going to be in the end.

632
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:20,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great visual, but I like a lot of the.

633
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:29,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, any other suggestions for future events that we should take note of.

634
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:42,173
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we'll circle back next time, then, if people have any ideas next time.

635
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:50,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to think of libraries and makerspace, or if you could have some kind of event in the makerspace where people actually make things.

636
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:55,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just kind of facetiously thinking of knitting, you know?

637
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:58,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do that there, actually.

638
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Just last weekend, they had an event.

639
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:00,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

640
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:07,365
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys might know of a piece you could make that would be sort of climate-related, and then you could work with the librarians, because they like to make stuff.

641
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:13,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we can have, like, you know, some top students who have started engineering to, like, you know, make or space type things.

642
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know kids like that.

643
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:20,294
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, you know, like when the teacher say, bring a cart of eggs, because you're going to do a project.

644
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:24,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to participate in some project, bring this or that, you know, to recycle.

645
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:28,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can do something cool with those recycling with the kids.

646
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:36,662
[SPEAKER_08]: The egg, you know, the eggshell, when you, like, pulverize it, when you, like, make it like that, you can use it to clean.

647
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:37,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys know that?

648
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so that's really cool.

649
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:47,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my gosh, I think it's like even to YN, just in general, like a cleaning.

650
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:50,841
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit invasive, so it's not gonna scratch, but it's gonna...

651
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:57,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think household cleaners that are poisonous, this is a really good topic.

652
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and like cleaner alternatives and better alternatives, that's a really good topic.

653
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:06,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do have a lot of immigrants in Magfort that work as house cleaners.

654
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:08,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Their own natural-based stuff that they do.

655
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:15,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially with our Hispanic communities, we know that fabulous snow isn't so bad.

656
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:24,491
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, since it's the least expensive thing, you can literally buy it at the dollar store for $1.20, not $1.50.

657
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:25,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

658
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:29,534
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there's... Okay, let's pick at the dollar store.

659
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, let's go to the dollar store.

660
00:46:32,836 --> 00:46:34,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You're living at the dollar store.

661
00:46:37,386 --> 00:46:38,146
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that actually?

662
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:41,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like fine salt, but like very, really serious.

663
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:42,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells amazing though.

664
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:05,619
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you know, someone has a house, you know, when they go to their house or this or they have house cleaner.

665
00:47:09,722 --> 00:47:24,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But going back to the maker space thing, though, I 1, an event that I didn't mention is, or I could might mention it later on when I get to the energy committee, but they're putting on another free flea market in partnership with Tufts on September 13th.

666
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:30,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so people bring things in to just drop it off and donate it.

667
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people will come and take it away.

668
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:35,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also like maker space type things with it.

669
00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are bringing something that's broken, someone can help them to fix it or help the next person to fix it.

670
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:41,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

671
00:47:41,864 --> 00:47:42,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And when is that?

672
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:43,525
[SPEAKER_11]: September 13th.

673
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:47,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be at Tufts, but it's open to everybody.

674
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we don't have a flyer for it yet, but we will.

675
00:48:01,886 --> 00:48:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so environmental.

676
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:07,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And yet, you know, like I'm like, yeah, plastic things that we have to plug in.

677
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:11,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're a really good machine, but you have to know how to take care of it.

678
00:48:12,116 --> 00:48:19,461
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're used to destroying something away and getting a new one, you don't know how to maintain things.

679
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:22,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of those things that are made modular, it's like, no.

680
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:29,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But it comes to recycling too, when you talk about bikes, you know, there are a lot of people that can afford buying bikes for their kids.

681
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:33,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So before the weather started getting nice, hey, donate your bikes.

682
00:48:33,950 --> 00:49:01,177
[SPEAKER_08]: then we kind of clean up and kind of fix it up to give where to donate it and donate their old bikes you know like and then so we get ready for you know when the weather hey if you don't have a bike come you know universities have a big like they have that because students leave that bike on campus and then they go back home or whatever and they assume they're right so like leftover

683
00:49:05,149 --> 00:49:14,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what this, this free market is for, too, because it's for, like, furniture and dishes and whatever people are leaving behind.

684
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:21,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, as soon as that some people came back in May when we had it for the 1st time, some people.

685
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:31,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say just like came in, got a bunch of stuff, came back a couple hours later, because it just kept turning over with more people bringing things in.

686
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:32,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

687
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:32,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that.

688
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We had like 500 people come through.

689
00:49:34,843 --> 00:49:36,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was that?

690
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at Tufts.

691
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:42,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the building that was like right on the corner of like Winthrop.

692
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:43,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was indoors.

693
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:45,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

694
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, when we get the flyer ready, I'll send it around to you guys.

695
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:53,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm meeting with them on Friday to sort of do some last planning for it.

696
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:56,068
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have a date.

697
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:59,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We can all go together, get coffee.

698
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:02,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, should we move on to the city updates?

699
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:05,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know you guys want to get out of here.

700
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:05,912
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been so long.

701
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:06,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

702
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:06,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

703
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:09,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Updates on electrifying efforts we've had.

704
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,582
[SPEAKER_03]: 194 people signed up so far and we've coached 93 people.

705
00:50:28,882 --> 00:50:30,062
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

706
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:37,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far we know of 27 actions that have been taken as a result of this.

707
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:44,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I need to follow up with people again because there's always a lag between when we're coaching people and when we actually find out what the things have been done.

708
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the city's electricity aggregation program.

709
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:52,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has a, the default option has a 10% higher mobile

710
00:50:53,998 --> 00:50:58,040
[SPEAKER_03]: energy content to it at a lower price than what National Grid has.

711
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:06,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an opt-out program, so you're automatically opted into it unless you decide that you want to go to a different supplier.

712
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:08,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So most people do have it.

713
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:16,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people I'll talk to have gotten unknowingly signed up for third-party suppliers who are charging them more.

714
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:19,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really trying to educate people about that.

715
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:24,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you signing up for it?

716
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:25,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

717
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,274
[SPEAKER_11]: For aggregation?

718
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

719
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea.

720
00:51:29,036 --> 00:51:31,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know anything about this stuff.

721
00:51:31,377 --> 00:51:32,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to coach her?

722
00:51:32,478 --> 00:51:34,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to coach?

723
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

724
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,062
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to film it.

725
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:39,903
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great idea.

726
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually need a session.

727
00:51:42,104 --> 00:51:43,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's great.

728
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:44,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

729
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:45,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

730
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:47,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to sing.

731
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:52,636
[SPEAKER_11]: You can film it.

732
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,397
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be hilarious.

733
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:55,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this idea.

734
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:56,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the idea.

735
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:57,620
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what I'll make of it.

736
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,523
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw how nervous we were when we did that video with the mayor.

737
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:01,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We were trying to be there.

738
00:52:10,816 --> 00:52:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So, then, in the next few months, we're going to be doing Facebook ads.

739
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,822
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have send flyers home in backpacks.

740
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:24,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be sending a letter around to residents, thanks to National Grid.

741
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:28,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking with NASA radio about doing something with them.

742
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be an ad or something else.

743
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:31,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

744
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:33,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing real-time landlord outreach.

745
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:43,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're actually starting up a small business program, education program about energy efficiency called the Main Streets Program.

746
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:46,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will start at the end of October.

747
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people can sign up ahead of time, these small businesses.

748
00:52:51,062 --> 00:53:00,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're also going to be doing a lot of canvassing for like a one week time where we're going to have the people who do the audits to just go door to door with the small businesses and talk to them.

749
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:10,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's any suggestions that you guys have for outreach that we can be doing to small businesses that you think would make that more successful, that would be great.

750
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's things like lighting improvements, like refrigeration improvements, heating improvements, things that will reduce their energy bills.

751
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to be able to buy not just information, but resources.

752
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:28,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the kitchens.

753
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:30,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

754
00:53:30,191 --> 00:53:34,696
[SPEAKER_08]: My stuff.

755
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's about the radio.

756
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:37,418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's NOSA.

757
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,202
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the NOSA radio that is NOSA radio.

758
00:53:41,242 --> 00:53:41,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

759
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:50,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like maybe bring a lot of the renters that even though you don't own a house that you can, you know, bring in information.

760
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:50,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

761
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:51,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

762
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:51,372
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

763
00:53:52,138 --> 00:53:54,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Because automatic people think, oh, I don't want a house.

764
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:55,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to even listen to this.

765
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,382
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, attention renters, you know, like that message is for you.

766
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:01,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just for me.

767
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:02,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

768
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:07,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And then catch the ears like, oh, I rent in Medford, so what I can do?

769
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:07,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

770
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:08,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

771
00:54:08,205 --> 00:54:11,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are lots of options that we can talk with renters about, like the aggregation.

772
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:11,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

773
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:15,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

774
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:17,709
[SPEAKER_08]: But the piece I'm sorry to interrupt.

775
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:18,510
[SPEAKER_08]: But like I said,

776
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:25,339
[SPEAKER_08]: have a lot of things that it can decay, but it would be awesome if you could combine with some resources that they can have.

777
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know, like, what about, you know, changing lives?

778
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:35,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that is a fund that can help you with that, because everything costs too, no matter what.

779
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:39,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, we're doing this with National Grid and the Mass Save program.

780
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:40,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And so

781
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,133
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, the work would be absolutely free to them.

782
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:50,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And in others, they'd only be paying like 25% of the total cost.

783
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:51,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

784
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:52,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

785
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:53,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

786
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

787
00:54:57,642 --> 00:55:07,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be possible for them to work with you guys for interpretation if they're going door to door with businesses that week?

788
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I could help if somebody scheduled that I can.

789
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:18,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like she'll show up, hey, are you available today?

790
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:22,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Be nice if you could put in the schedule and see who is available to help.

791
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:33,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might be good if you had suggestions for businesses that you think would be good for them to reach out to, that you think it would be useful to have you on hand to talk to them.

792
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:41,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Merlin, I will have a list of cuisine business that I was in touch with them and check on them.

793
00:55:42,265 --> 00:55:43,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I can contact them.

794
00:55:44,026 --> 00:55:45,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk to her about it.

795
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:50,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we contact all of them and ask them some ideas of what they may be looking for.

796
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

797
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And bring for the next meeting.

798
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:53,731
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be wonderful.

799
00:55:55,112 --> 00:55:55,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

800
00:55:55,352 --> 00:56:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody else has like similar lists of businesses or you just have some off the top of your head, you could share.

801
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:22,355
[SPEAKER_11]: many things they did before we all became feminists like the makeover like you think of like a makeover like a restaurant or something and then use that as like like if you're willing to even make over a small request

802
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,753
[SPEAKER_11]: like I did, it's pretty money.

803
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:35,875
[SPEAKER_08]: A business that is attempting to do the before and after and then having, you know, yeah.

804
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I accepted the challenge and everything.

805
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:54,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I just paid very little money or nothing, you know, and it was very helpful for my business.

806
00:56:54,256 --> 00:56:54,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy.

807
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:59,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And then put on Facebook, social media, whatever, you know, like people can see, Oh, let me try.

808
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:00,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I can try that.

809
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:04,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kayla from my office is the one who's really focusing on the business side of things.

810
00:57:04,843 --> 00:57:10,569
[SPEAKER_03]: She's our economic development planner, and she's working with the Chamber of Commerce to do outreach to the chamber too.

811
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will pass that those suggestions on to her.

812
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:21,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she'll really like that, especially if you have any suggestions for some particular businesses that you think that she should reach out to.

813
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'd be like.

814
00:57:24,214 --> 00:57:29,116
[SPEAKER_08]: We rented the 11 Salem Street of the year, you know, the building and more of the macro.

815
00:57:29,356 --> 00:57:29,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

816
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:30,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

817
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:32,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Summertime is very hot.

818
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:36,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So each of us have a unit air condition over there.

819
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:41,239
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, is there any other savings with no money for the landlord?

820
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:41,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

821
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:48,281
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, are you saying you're going to be our.

822
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:56,533
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the landlord.

823
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that can be helpful for both of us.

824
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:05,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and there are some things that you don't even need the landlord permission for, because it's considered part of the tenant fit out thing.

825
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

826
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:06,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

827
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:06,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

828
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to do an update.

829
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:17,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is behind schedule.

830
00:58:27,323 --> 00:58:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So the accessibility improvements for the entrances are finishing up this week.

831
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:39,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The carrying up this focus on the repairs and the ADA improvements, the heating and cooling part of it is behind schedule.

832
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:47,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have some portable cooling units in a couple of places where the systems were actually down for the next few weeks.

833
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:50,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll be continuing work.

834
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: The project will probably extend to next summer, and any disruptive work is going to happen after school and on weekends.

835
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:00,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a huge project.

836
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:11,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been sprinting to get all of this done, and I really appreciate how much overtime they've been putting into doing this.

837
00:59:12,351 --> 00:59:14,872
[SPEAKER_03]: We really threw a lot on top of that project.

838
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:17,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It started out as an HVAC project, and we ballooned into much more.

839
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be cool.

840
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I emailed you information about this on-street EV charging grant.

841
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:35,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So the proposed sites right now are the ones that are yellow on the screen here.

842
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:42,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So Capen Park, Henry Park, Magoon Park, and Morrison Park, if the funding will stretch there.

843
00:59:43,602 --> 00:59:51,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the thinking behind it was that so the grant is really focused on dense residential neighborhoods where people don't have a drive way to park in.

844
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so they need to charge on the street.

845
00:59:55,026 --> 01:00:06,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Focusing on environmental justice neighborhoods, looking at places that are, um, some walk from existing charging stations.

846
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so they need 1 nearby.

847
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:21,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we looked at the sort of the technical considerations for each site and how easy or difficult or expensive it would be to do at each location.

848
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:34,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we did a survey, um, that, uh, I think we had 65 residents respond to, in addition to the more than 50 people who'd responded to the previous survey that we put out last year.

849
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:34,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

850
01:00:39,074 --> 01:00:48,201
[SPEAKER_03]: 60% of them said that they had an EV, and 32% said that they would buy an EV if there were chargers near them.

851
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:56,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So that 32%, especially, I thought was really interesting.

852
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free.

853
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is getting this at no cost right now through this grant.

854
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:03,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

855
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:04,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

856
01:01:04,372 --> 01:01:15,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were charging at home in your own driveway, I mean, you could just plug into a regular outlet for like slow level one charging, or you could install a level two charger.

857
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:22,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of utility incentives for that and manufacturer incentives.

858
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's possible to install a level two charger in your own home for

859
01:01:29,573 --> 01:01:36,496
[SPEAKER_03]: really for people who, um, you know, they can't charge at all.

860
01:01:36,536 --> 01:01:44,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for a, I don't have a driveway, so I do all of my charging charging stage.

861
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:46,700
Yeah.

862
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the 1 that the leaders is the 1.

863
01:01:52,804 --> 01:01:52,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

864
01:01:52,944 --> 01:01:53,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

865
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:54,325
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they have us on the.

866
01:01:54,365 --> 01:01:54,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Silence.

867
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:54,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Silence.

868
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me start sharing the screen again here.

869
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,844
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have shared information with them that I've.

870
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:54,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Commerce to businesses and our economic development planner has been doing some outreach around this as well because residents definitely would prefer to have them in like Wegmans and Target and places like that.

871
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:15,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, June, it keeps disconnecting.

872
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just gonna.

873
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Mention that in the chat, but I could listen to the recording.

874
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:21,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

875
01:03:23,757 --> 01:03:36,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, yeah, if you guys have any feedback about these locations, I think we're making some final decisions about them in the next week before moving forward with, like, permitting and things like that.

876
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:44,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

877
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:48,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the parking department just got an electric truck.

878
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's more for you just with like replacing parking meters and things like that.

879
01:03:55,992 --> 01:04:04,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for just like driving around to do parking enforcement, but it's the city's first, like, it's not our first electric vehicle.

880
01:04:04,756 --> 01:04:06,377
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have an electric street sweeper.

881
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's our first, like, um, non heavy duty electric vehicle.

882
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

883
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:22,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've ordered an electric refuse truck for the parks department, but we're still waiting for that to come in refuse trucks.

884
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:27,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, rubbish, it's not for garbage necessarily.

885
01:04:27,054 --> 01:04:35,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more well, it is a little bit for garbage for the garbage in the parks, but it's more really for when they're doing, like, tree trimming and things like that for that sort of thing.

886
01:04:38,092 --> 01:04:45,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we are updating our climate change, or we have updated our climate change vulnerability assessment.

887
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I have mentioned this to you in the past.

888
01:04:50,361 --> 01:04:54,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and let me share the screen with people.

889
01:04:57,606 --> 01:04:59,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, June, trying to share this with you too.

890
01:05:03,005 --> 01:05:07,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have this, in addition to the report, we also have this like experience page.

891
01:05:09,086 --> 01:05:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me pull it up on here if I can.

892
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:25,709
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

893
01:05:34,419 --> 01:05:37,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can see it.

894
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:42,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just dig into the actual data from this.

895
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of these locations on here are different assets.

896
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them different things around the city that we consider to be critical.

897
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:58,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are daycare centers, for instance.

898
01:05:58,819 --> 01:06:02,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are grocery stores or food pantries.

899
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:08,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just like emergency services like police or fire or something like that.

900
01:06:08,113 --> 01:06:14,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's overlaid with different types of like climate vulnerabilities and climate sensitivities.

901
01:06:15,617 --> 01:06:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can begin here to look at, you know, which locations are more vulnerable to, you know, say precipitation driven flooding or sea level rise.

902
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:51,821
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, because that's, that's really more dependent on the state of the, you know, why national grid and I don't think we have that that level of that's something after the water supply is that method or is that.

903
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:59,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's regional, so that's, yeah, that's, that's the same organization that does the water fountain that we were talking about.

904
01:06:59,424 --> 01:07:01,265
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be at the harvest your energy festival.

905
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

906
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:06,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also do some overlays.

907
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:11,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

908
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:19,933
[SPEAKER_04]: He says.

909
01:07:31,357 --> 01:07:33,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, we're going to have it on the web, but.

910
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about our area in particular.

911
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:17,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I do know that the data centers are, you are sucking down on data centers in general for like everything, but AI, especially a lot, but also like, I don't know what like Bitcoin and stuff like that uses a lot of electricity as well.

912
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:20,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

913
01:09:20,044 --> 01:09:21,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

914
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,285
[SPEAKER_03]: They're usually not.

915
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:28,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Locating them in the northeast because our electricity costs are so high.

916
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:32,090
[SPEAKER_03]: They're usually locating those sorts of data centers and.

917
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:39,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Places with cheaper power that's probably from more polluting sources.

918
01:09:39,432 --> 01:09:40,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

919
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:44,534
[SPEAKER_11]: So, don't use exactly exactly.

920
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,255
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all the things that.

921
01:09:52,599 --> 01:10:17,616
[SPEAKER_01]: you know returning you're getting your name lost yeah matthew oh yeah i usually like so much energy and water i just like i'm trying to remember as much as possible

922
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.

923
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

924
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:40,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are using chat GPT like it's like Google or something and I'm like, oh.
