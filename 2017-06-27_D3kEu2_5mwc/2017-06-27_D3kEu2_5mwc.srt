00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:29,880

45
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the document that we have here this evening is a little different than what we received in our packet.

46
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:36,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more detailed and I think it answers a lot of the questions that may have come up.

47
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,284
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you'd be kind enough to go through a brief presentation, I'd appreciate it.

48
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Through the chair, absolutely.

49
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:46,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight, what I'm doing is I'm actually moving funds

52
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:07,184
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving $16,000 into cemetery to cover overtime that was more than estimated.

53
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:13,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving $5,000 into data processing ordinary to cover IT's purchase of Office 365.

54
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:13,385
[SPEAKER_17]: I am moving

00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:20,625
[SPEAKER_17]: $448 to energy and environment to cover her small part-time deficit.

56

57
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving $962 to legislative.

00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:37,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving $3,300 to community development board to cover stipends.

59
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,082
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving $1,300 to licensing to cover licensing stipends.

60
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:49,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm moving 14,000 to 32 insurance, uh, to cover the insurance liability, which was more than estimated.

61
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:58,564
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm moving 4,000 312 to a senior work off FICA to cover the city's portion of the tax liability for the senior work off program.

62
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:03,788
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also moving eight 86 414 to snow and ice for the deficit.

63
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

64
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:10,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, through the chairs who,

65
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:16,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, that was $886,414 to snow and ice.

66
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And through the chair, if I may.

67
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:24,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

68
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:31,252
[SPEAKER_12]: That $886,414, that's the total amount from last year's budget that's being moved into snow and ice for the current year?

69
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,333
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the total amount.

70
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:39,858
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the total amount of leftover funds in this current year budget that I'm moving to cover the snow and ice deficit this fiscal year.

71
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:42,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

72
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:48,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any other questions for me?

73
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:53,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions for... No further questions?

74
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:57,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, councillors.

75
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dyke.

76
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, it's been my experience that at the end of the year we see a number of end-of-year transfers.

77
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,859
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some accounts that run in a deficit, some accounts that run in a surplus, and really all this is is housekeeping to balance the books.

78
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:20,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there looks like there's a good amount of surplus here that's going towards the snow and ice deficit, which is something that we need to take care of at some point in time as well, Mr. President.

79
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:21,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank Ms.

80
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Nunley for her presentation.

81
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she did a lot of work putting this document together, and I appreciate it.

82
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:29,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dello Russo.

83
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:33,146
[SPEAKER_08]: President, this is an ordinary process we go through each year.

84
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that we're chipping away at the snow and the ice.

85
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:46,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I, uh, uh, am grateful for the transparent nature in which, uh, these, uh, items are being trans, uh, presented to us.

86
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval on the motion.

87
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, council vice president marks.

88
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

89
00:10:53,829 --> 00:11:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I have, uh, a number of questions regarding these transfers, um, from accounts, uh, that we've heard from,

90
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:15,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Department heads, we've heard from personnel in these particular accounts regarding needs that were addressed in the budget or what we thought was addressed in the budget.

91
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're seeing transfers from these particular accounts to other accounts.

92
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:27,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first one I have a question with, Mr. President, is the Chevalier Auditorium.

93
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all have at one point spoken about

94
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:49,610
[SPEAKER_05]: how Chevalier is the economic engine in this community, and that we need to put some money into Chevalier in order to bring the top-notch performances and activities that we'd all like to see help revitalize our square.

95
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm concerned, Mr. President, that we're transferring $7,000 in ordinary expense, and we've heard from

96
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:09,531
[SPEAKER_05]: members of the Board of Commission that there's a hot water tank that's needed at Chevalier.

97
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:18,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, the $7,000 could have went towards replacing the hot water tank.

98
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:29,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the HVA systems in there, the motor needs to be replaced in the HVAC system.

99
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,504
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of broken windows throughout the building.

100
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:44,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it rains right now out there, torrential rains, I'm concerned that many of these broken windows will be accepting water from outside into the building.

101
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,492
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also receiving a $5,000 transfer out of personnel.

102
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:08,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are only a few things that as a member of the Friends, which I sat on the past year, that helped support Chevalier know firsthand that the commission, Chevalier Auditory Commission, is looking for these improvements.

103
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't fathom why, Mr. President, at this point, we'd be taking money from an entity we all feel needs additional money,

104
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: and putting it into an account, which is great snow and ice.

105
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:25,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when it's winter time, we all want to make sure that account has plenty.

106
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:32,908
[SPEAKER_05]: But to take from this account, Mr. President, to put into that account, I have a major concern with this.

107
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The second piece, Mr. President, is the fire department.

108
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:41,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taking $179,000 in ordinary expense from the fire department and $40,000 from personnel.

109
00:13:46,811 --> 00:14:00,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the 79,000 from ordinary expense, as we all heard in engine three and engine four and many of the other engines in this city, the windows don't work in the building.

110
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:09,309
[SPEAKER_05]: 79,000 would replace a lot of windows in our fire station that our brave men and women call home for long periods of time, Mr. President.

111
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,252
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, that's being shipped out of the fire department.

112
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,473
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about the restrooms at the headquarters.

113
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:28,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of us took tours, Mr. President, and the deplorable condition of the shower stalls and toilets at the headquarters.

114
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:29,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Deplorable conditions.

115
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:41,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I would submit to you, Mr. President, $79,000 would go a long way in fixing these very crucial needs that we hear from the fire department.

116
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:49,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, an issue that's been near and dear to me is the turnout gear.

117
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:57,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got the washes for the turnout gear, but we still don't have the dryers that can dry the equipment.

118
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:05,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, $79,000 would pay for, I believe they were asking for two dryers at the time.

119
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,446
[SPEAKER_05]: would well pay for two dryers, Mr. President.

120
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:15,131
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we have a department that we know is not going to get a brand new building, the headquarters.

121
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:20,876
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not part of the police headquarters rebuilding.

122
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:31,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have some needs throughout the community in some of these buildings that are 80, 90, 100 years old that our brave men and women are in, Mr. President.

123
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,223
[SPEAKER_05]: They do an heroic job when they have to rush out to fires.

124
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:43,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not let them do an heroic job when they have to come back and be in a substandard fire station.

125
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what they're there for, Mr. President.

126
00:15:47,403 --> 00:16:14,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing, and I bring this up, Mr. President, is because recently, the police department, because of what was going on throughout not only this state, but across the country, of security concerns within local police departments, our police department asked for ballistic glass to be put in the windows, because they're located on the first floor, they're located right when you come into the building,

127
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:19,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm under the impression that ballistic glass was installed.

128
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:40,532
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it makes the window so heavy, and we already know many of these windows in the front desk area were already in disrepair and were held up by Coke cans and so forth, opened by Coke cans, that they requested an AC unit in the front desk area because they can't open the windows.

129
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,991
[SPEAKER_05]: and it gets 80 to 90 degrees in there, from what I hear from the officers.

130
00:16:45,792 --> 00:17:03,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we're transferring $135,000 from ordinary expense from the police department, and another $20,000 that could go towards the police department locker room, which we all know, in addition to the fire department, is in deplorable condition.

131
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:09,963
[SPEAKER_05]: and this AC unit that this $135,000 would pay for, Mr. President.

132
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:32,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite as happy as some of my colleagues with the transfer to the Snow and Ice account, knowing that there are many needs out there with our public safety officials, with a building that we all brag about, Chevalier, in the squares, the economic engine, and yet we're pulling money out of it to put into, for the most part, the Snow and Ice account.

133
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:37,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will not support this transfer tonight, Mr. President.

134
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there are too many needs right now.

135
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:49,945
[SPEAKER_05]: When we sat down and went over the budget with both chiefs, I was under the impression that some of these issues would be addressed through building maintenance.

136
00:17:50,625 --> 00:18:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am very displeased to see that we are transferring money of this magnitude out of these departments and not addressing the day-to-day operations.

137
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,432
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a luxury.

138
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:15,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Having air conditioning in a room that's 90 degrees, where they sit for 24 hours a day, the police department at the front desk, is not a luxury to have an AC unit in that office.

139
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:27,657
[SPEAKER_05]: To have showers, Mr. President, when you come back from a fire, or an officer that's out all day on duty, come back and to go into a restroom that's in deplorable condition, to me is not a luxury.

140
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:28,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a necessity.

141
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:37,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, for Chevalier Auditorium, to move that great auditorium forward, we need to keep up with the basics.

142
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:43,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And a hot water tank, HVAC motors that need to replace, those are necessities.

143
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Those aren't luxuries.

144
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, Mr. President, I would hope my colleagues would reconsider.

145
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is a ritual every year.

146
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:53,765
[SPEAKER_05]: We transfer money.

147
00:18:54,324 --> 00:19:00,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But in my opinion, this transfer this year, Mr. President, is unnecessary at this point.

148
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:09,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to see some of the major issues with public safety that this council has been speaking about year after year after year addressed with this money, Mr. President.

149
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Through the chair to Councilor Marks for the Chevalier.

150
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:19,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, the building department does supplement and take care of the Chevrolet.

151
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:22,070
[SPEAKER_17]: This really is just leftover uncommitted funds.

152
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,912
[SPEAKER_17]: We weren't just taking money away arbitrarily from anything.

153
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,773
[SPEAKER_17]: And also any things like that are planned for.

154
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:34,795
[SPEAKER_17]: And as far as the fire and police department, both the chiefs are aware and I emailed them and asked them what is available in order to be moved.

155
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:35,876
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't just take funds.

156
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:40,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's exactly what you do is take funds because, uh,

157
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: no chief in this city is gonna stand up and say, you're not taking funds out of my account.

158
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So, with all due respect, I've been around here a number of years, I know how it operates.

159
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,659
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk to members of the commission, Chevrolet commission, saying,

160
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:56,643
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean that's on the agenda?

161
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,285
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean they're taking $7,000 out of ordinary expense?

162
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

163
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:05,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's overseen by the city now, the budget.

164
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And we weren't aware of that.

165
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:22,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may think everyone's aware and everyone's on board, but I can tell you the brave men in the police department and the fire department are not aware of this money being reverted to other purposes based on their needs.

166
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may be on board with both chiefs,

167
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:49,382
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can tell you the rank-and-file and the police and the fire department as well as members of Chevalier Commission are not on board Thank You president Caraviello just a question through the chair are you saying we should reduce this by 86,000 or you you're gonna not support the paper in its entirety I

168
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:01,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'll leave it up to the druthers of the council how they want to approach it.

169
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:07,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only one member of the council, but I will not support the paper with the transfers that currently exist.

170
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:16,265
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to discuss about leaving the police fire and the Chevalier Auditorium in there, that's open for discussion and I will support that.

171
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:21,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, I'm only one member of the council and I will not support the paper as it currently exists.

172
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that, um, through the chair, I think he makes good points.

173
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:30,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially with the Chevalier ordinary expenses and the fire departments, ordinary expenses.

174
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:36,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I'm not sure how much the ballistic glass costs for the police department.

175
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it would be.

176
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

177
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't, but then didn't they need thicker?

178
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:42,822
[SPEAKER_12]: They got the second set.

179
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:45,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, if we,

180
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:57,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I'd be willing to approve the paper minus $86,000 plus the air conditioner.

181
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:03,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think that would solve the problems that are discussed, but then move the rest of the paper forward.

182
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,621
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'll move that motion forward, or you can.

183
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:09,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Vice President.

184
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:19,606
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll have my support if you do it that way, so that we can approve the majority of the transfers, and then have the $7,000 for Chevalier to go back to Chevalier for whatever their needs are.

185
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:32,210
[SPEAKER_12]: For $79,000, we all know that is less than what needs to be spent in the fire stations, considering they have beds from the 1940s, I think.

186
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So that can definitely be well spent.

187
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:44,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's an air conditioner that's needed, I think that would be a good compromise so that we could get those three things done and then move approval on the rest of the transfers for snow and ice.

188
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, if I could.

189
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:55,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is why we met in budget a week and a half ago.

190
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:57,197
[SPEAKER_05]: We met for a number of nights.

191
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:00,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We asked specific questions regarding each account.

192
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,585
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, we were given the ability to see last year's expenses.

193
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, last year's budget.

194
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,405
[SPEAKER_05]: this year, fiscal year to date, and what the FY18 appropriation is, the budgeted request.

195
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've asked many times, how are we going to end in particular accounts?

196
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:39,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was under the impression with a lot of these accounts that because the report, I think was a month back, we were told, because there were sizable amounts in these accounts, that due to salary and so forth, other expenses, that we were going to bottom out on a lot of these accounts.

197
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:44,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a real surprise to me to see some of these dollar amounts.

198
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:51,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And today is June 27th, and you would have to have this spent by the end of the fiscal year, I believe.

199
00:23:52,966 --> 00:24:07,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So it puts us in a real different position now to have this money expended within that period of time, where if we knew maybe a week, two weeks ago, three weeks, what the projection was going to be,

200
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,483
[SPEAKER_05]: then maybe we could have made a better decision.

201
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:26,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So, at this point, Mr. President, I would go with Councilor Lungo's amendment to minus the $7,000 out of Chevalier, out of ordinary expense, the $79,000 out of fire.

202
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, Councilor Lungo?

203
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:31,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the whole $135,000 out of police.

204
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:37,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And see what can be done in this timeframe to address some of the issues that were brought up for

205
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: building maintenance, and other ordinary expenses.

206
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:43,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor DelaRosa.

207
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:45,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to sever.

208
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:50,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Budget Director, was there any comment on that?

209
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,381
[SPEAKER_07]: On what to...

210
00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:05,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to say that we have only like three days left in this year, and I do not think that it would be possible to do the procurements properly.

211
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:17,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it was, you know, your suggestion that this exercise should have been done maybe a few weeks ahead may have, you know, would give us more time.

212
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:44,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point where you have two and a half days really, two full days and one half day in the fiscal year, and with our end of the year processing that our office is going through, I have serious doubt that anything will be, as far as procurement, getting contractors in here and replacing windows or HVAC, I don't see that happening.

213
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so I understand,

214
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:50,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The procurement is $10,000 and over, correct?

215
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Procurement can be anything.

216
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it's a window replacement, it can be less than $10,000.

217
00:25:57,448 --> 00:25:58,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Procurement can be anything.

218
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a set dollar amount that you have to...

219
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,806
[SPEAKER_05]: you reach in order to do procurement?

220
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:08,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, over 10,000, we have to get three quotes and over 50,000, we have to do a formal RFP.

221
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what you're... So what about under 10,000?

222
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:17,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Under 10,000, you can reach out to anyone and get somebody to come and replace.

223
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can reach out.

224
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:19,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So many of these items could be addressed.

225
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,522
[SPEAKER_05]: that are under $10,000.

226
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:24,823
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are under $10,000, yes.

227
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:25,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

228
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:33,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the contractors are available to come in and give, you know, do the replacements, like if it's a window replacement or an HVAC, you know.

229
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:34,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

230
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:47,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they were able to get a purchase order by the 30th of this month, with the funding that's available, the work could be done any time, right, after that.

231
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:50,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't necessarily have to be done within.

232
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,470
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it has to be done by June 30th.

233
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:55,032
[SPEAKER_17]: General fund has to be done by June 30th.

234
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: The work?

235
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:59,954
[SPEAKER_17]: The work has to be done and procured and incurred by June 30th.

236
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard that before.

237
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:04,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never heard that before.

238
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:12,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we do any type of work now in the building, if we had an emergency work done, you're saying that we couldn't do it because we couldn't.

239
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:14,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Emergency work you could do.

240
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:15,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to do emergency.

241
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:16,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

242
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,183
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all emergency work.

243
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:18,975
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all emergency, right?

244
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:23,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Emergency is anything that jeopardizes public safety.

245
00:27:23,938 --> 00:27:27,220
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their very strict... Right, or public safety officials.

246
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for any citizens of the city.

247
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:32,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

248
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:38,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I don't want to step on Councilor Longo's toes if that's what she wanted to offer.

249
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:43,790
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'll offer the same thing, that that money be taken from this paper.

250
00:27:44,507 --> 00:28:11,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President I just want to remind the Councilors to that for snow and ice Deficit if it's not covered via transfers that is means that I do have to raise it on the tax recap Councilman go current Yep, but I think that's probably the way to go the only other option is to withdraw it from the transfer and make it a condition of the paper that the those Those get that those projects get done

251
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:17,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if it's not transferred, then it wouldn't have to be on a time crunch.

252
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Just be a condition of the paper.

253
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:23,808
[SPEAKER_12]: You remove them from the transfer, they're going to be unspent.

254
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:28,891
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to free cash, and then we make it a condition of the paper.

255
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:40,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do you want to make that a separate paper?

256
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,057
[SPEAKER_12]: You can make that as an amendment.

257
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:48,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I think at least the 7,000 and the 79,000 in an air conditioner, if that's the problem, you know.

258
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:53,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Police are getting a new station, but we have to still... $86,000 is the number you're looking at?

259
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,868
[SPEAKER_12]: $86,000 plus the air conditioner, so... $76,000.

260
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:56,868
$90,000.

261
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:59,048
[SPEAKER_07]: $86,000 is the number?

262
00:28:59,068 --> 00:28:59,048
$90,000.

263
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:01,488
[SPEAKER_07]: $90,000.

264
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:01,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd the other four come from?

265
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Air conditioning unit in the police station, I hear.

266
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it's going to cost, so I can only put the number on.

267
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:10,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather put the total dollar amount that's being traced.

268
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at the moment, you've got the two, you've got the two departments totaling $86,000, correct?

269
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: The two, and then he wants the third.

270
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:22,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, where's the other $4,000 coming from?

271
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say $4,000.

272
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,661
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, I was recommending four from the police ordinary account.

273
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,422
[SPEAKER_12]: $86,000 is the number?

274
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:31,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The seven?

275
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:32,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

276
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,926
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the line of green?

277
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:38,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the number you're looking for?

278
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:39,649
[SPEAKER_12]: All three, that's fine, 135,

279
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:43,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus seven, plus 79.

280
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me get my calculator.

281
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So 135, 79, and what else?

282
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:47,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

283
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:56,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven, so that's six, one, two, $221,000?

284
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:56,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

285
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to sever $221,000 from this transfer?

286
00:29:59,660 --> 00:29:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

287
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:17,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And the clerk has advised me that those have to come on each line.

288
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:20,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to separate with the lines that you want.

289
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:21,917
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't.

290
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:22,877
[SPEAKER_07]: We mentioned already.

291
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:23,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll spell out the amendments.

292
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:25,378
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have to spell out the amendments.

293
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:27,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

294
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, Ms.

295
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:30,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Nunley mentioned something.

296
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:36,724
[SPEAKER_03]: She said that if we reduce the funds in this paper, then it's going to have to be made up for the snow and ice control through the tax recap.

297
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:41,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if she could get up and explain to us a little bit about what impact that will have on the community and on the tax rate going forward.

298
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:54,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Through the chair, to Councilor Knight, yes, if I can't get this covered, I have to bring it up and raise it on the tax recap, which then goes in towards our levy limit.

299
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:59,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, by taking this out and moving the funds, we would actually be under the levy limit.

300
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:08,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd add this surplus deficit, this deficit for snow and ice

301
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,906
[SPEAKER_03]: to the 2.5% maximum tax?

302
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:13,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because we're allowed to raise that, yes.

303
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be snow and ice plus the property tax would generate a tax levy?

304
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:17,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

305
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

306
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,452
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so.

307
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:26,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an amendment, Mr. President?

308
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:32,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Member O'Keefe, do you want to make an amendment on which lines you want to take out so we know, so the clerk can have it?

309
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:36,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Auditorium.

310
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Ordinary expenses.

311
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So $7,000 for fire ordinary expenses.

312
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:40,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire ordinary expenses, $79,000.

313
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:42,536
[SPEAKER_07]: $79,000 from fire ordinary expenses.

314
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:44,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Police ordinary, $135,000.

315
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:45,419
[SPEAKER_12]: And police ordinary, $135,000.

316
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Conditioned on doing, yeah, doing an air conditioner.

317
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Which comes to a total of $221,000, correct?

318
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

319
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:11,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, sir.

320
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Dave Jampie, 35 Greenhall Street, Medford, Mass.

321
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:17,207
[SPEAKER_10]: With the chair, Ms.

322
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:17,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Nunley.

323
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:22,250
[SPEAKER_10]: How come we, you wrote up the budget last year?

324
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:24,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Say that again?

325
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:27,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you make up the- I did not make up the budget.

326
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,615
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the mayor's budget.

327
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:32,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor's budget?

328
00:32:32,637 --> 00:32:32,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

329
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:34,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you talking about the transfers?

330
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you talking about the- I'm just, well one,

331
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:38,026
[SPEAKER_10]: What's personal mean?

332
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:39,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Personal is salaries.

333
00:32:40,228 --> 00:32:41,809
[SPEAKER_10]: What's personnel?

334
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:46,112
[SPEAKER_17]: It's personal for UMass.

335
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:51,617
[SPEAKER_17]: According to the Uniform Massachusetts Accounting System, it is called personal for salaries and ordinaries.

336
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:55,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to direct the questions for the chair, and then she can have an opportunity to address them afterwards.

337
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

338
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,142
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I know for a fact.

339
00:32:58,162 --> 00:32:58,763
[SPEAKER_07]: To the chair, sir.

340
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,424
[SPEAKER_10]: $135,000 out of the police account.

341
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:12,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet, they don't have cruisers to respond to calls.

342
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:25,736
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a common practice by the city's administration, and before that, this city's administration was also the habit of the former administration.

343
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:30,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Every year we come back and forth.

344
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,841
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of money here that hasn't been spent.

345
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:45,028
[SPEAKER_10]: As a person that's been victimized by the city not spending money, I mean, we have money, say $135,000 for ordinary.

346
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Public safety, use it.

347
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:54,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a Riverside Ave, we have our public schools down there.

348
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:55,575
[SPEAKER_10]: No traffic light.

349
00:33:57,097 --> 00:34:01,819
[SPEAKER_10]: When we built those schools, that was one of my pet peeves was to get a traffic light there.

350
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:07,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Because not only do we have kids going back and forth during school, we have kids going back and forth to everything else.

351
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:12,423
[SPEAKER_10]: This city refuses to do anything for the citizens, public safety-wise.

352
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Energy and environment, 448, wow.

353
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:22,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Electrical, how come we have a personnel charge over $35,000?

354
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:30,725
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been looking for personnel for these departments for a while now, and nothing's been forthcoming.

355
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:34,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Building inspector, personnel, first $57,000.

356
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:37,667
[SPEAKER_10]: What have we been looking for for years?

357
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:41,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Code enforcement, maybe another building inspector or a half.

358
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:50,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the people getting taken on this, they're in.

359
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:53,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

360
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:16,944
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion that we sever, motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, and Councilor Lungo-Koehn's paper will be a separate vote to sever $221,000 from the budget.

361
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct, Mr. Clerk?

362
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,046
[SPEAKER_07]: From the transfers?

363
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, excuse me, from the transfers.

364
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the correct position?

365
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:27,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

366
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:31,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address to the record please.

367
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:33,935
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Robert Pentez here of Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

368
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a member of the circus party.

369
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,256
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a couple of things here that would disturb me.

370
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:42,578
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one goes on to personnel under the office of community development.

371
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:50,060
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this city is in desperate need of having good qualified people for the purposes of bringing development here into this community.

372
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, the city does not have a professional grant writer.

373
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:58,168
[SPEAKER_15]: It does not have any extra people in that particular office upstairs.

374
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,531
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what we heard two years ago when this administration was running.

375
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:07,696
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to boast that particular office with personnel that could bring us to some type of competition.

376
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:12,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Our sister city of Somerville, I believe, has either 13 or 14 people in their OCD.

377
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:15,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Malden, a smaller city, equal size, has more people than we do.

378
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:20,946
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a telling story that if you can have two departments that have $100,000

379
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:30,103
[SPEAKER_15]: as this particular department has, and then you can go to the building department who has a $57,000 personnel line item in there.

380
00:36:30,403 --> 00:36:40,332
[SPEAKER_15]: That really tells the story to me that there is absolutely something wrong, and nothing has taken place here over the last two years to bring in good, qualified people if, in fact, the money is there.

381
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:47,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, $100,000 just doesn't get there at the end of the year, and neither does $50,000 just get there during the year.

382
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:57,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I remember correctly, I believe this council, some six months ago, asked for an interim report as it related to department personnel and expenses, which is obviously you never got.

383
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:07,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Contrary to the issue on fire and ice, where the comment was made that you have to raise it on the tax recap, I believe with our approximately $9 million in free cash,

384
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:12,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Years in the past, we have paid deficits off with our free cash.

385
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,097
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe you do have an option there, without getting into your recap, and at the same time.

386
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:41,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I would seriously question another portion of this transfer of why are you transferring $100,000 from the Office of Community Development, which is supposed to be the brainchild of bringing new business into this community, development into this community, meeting with business owners in this community, and being the partner in the arm with the Chamber of Commerce for which it doesn't seem to seem the light of day.

387
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:48,187
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. President, I would suggest and I would hope that some member of the City Council would reflect upon that matter.

388
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:49,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

389
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:49,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

390
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:52,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

391
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:55,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

392
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:59,055
[SPEAKER_13]: The previous speaker brought up a good point on the OCD.

393
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:01,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's Office of Community Development.

394
00:38:03,257 --> 00:38:06,819
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very important that we hire the best of the best, in my opinion.

395
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford, in general, is at a crossroads for development.

396
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:16,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we need more help or the cream of the cream,

397
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:25,923
[SPEAKER_13]: a Boston or a Somerville type of individual that knows, because Route 93 goes right through us since 1960.

398
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:30,224
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of development's been going on, especially on the east side.

399
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's time we come up with a better plan.

400
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:45,070
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're gonna develop, especially any housing that's gonna generate real estate tax, as long as they're not tax exempt, like Tufts University or a non-profit, 501c3,

401
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:52,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't mind if you're going to jam us in an East Ford on the east side of the square.

402
00:38:53,762 --> 00:39:05,669
[SPEAKER_13]: However, also that new growth real estate tax should be deducted from any ideas of 2.49% increase.

403
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:14,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if not, that new growth real estate tax does not help us who's been supporting the city for decades.

404
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,537
[SPEAKER_13]: As a matter of fact, it hurts us real big time.

405
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:29,591
[SPEAKER_13]: We need more teachers, more fire, more police, buildings, infrastructure, and not to mention it's becoming overly congested.

406
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,532
[SPEAKER_13]: That is simply my opinion.

407
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for listening.

408
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:34,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

409
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:36,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

410
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:38,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

411
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, just a quick question.

412
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So if those funds are not transferred, do the funds then go into free cash?

413
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:47,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Through the chair.

414
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:51,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, they close into undesignated fund balance which does become free cash.

415
00:39:51,726 --> 00:40:12,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Okay, it could you and I couldn't hear you before you were talking about it console night asked you about it that you had mentioned something about the tax recap and I missed that so if you could please repeat that again just so through the chair all of us and everyone at home watch absolutely to Councilor Falco the deficit has to be covered if it's not covered through a transfer Then I have to raise it on the tax recap as part of the tax rate.

416
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay Thank you

417
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:35,935

[SPEAKER_07]: 17.

454
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:27,285
[SPEAKER_07]: 17.

455
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:27,285
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, are we going to go on to the budget or to the Chamber of Commerce?

456
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:27,285
17.

457
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:39,951
[SPEAKER_07]: 554.

458
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:39,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request to recommend that your Honorable Watery approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $250,000 for the following purposes.

459
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:46,138
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for the Medford square beautification.

460
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:48,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to read each one individually?

461
00:42:48,839 --> 00:43:05,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you want, uh, $50,000 or Medford square beautification was, would be for a public facade program, public art benches and public shelter and the city hall lot decorative lighting, beautification of flowers and trees, other signage for Chevalier historical assets and parking lot locations.

462
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:09,387
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for Haines square beautification, uh, the,

463
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Building facade program, benches, public art, decorative lighting, beautification of flower trees, barrels, softened plaza in front of Dempsey's.

464
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:31,505
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for West Medford Square beautification, public art, building facade program, decorative lighting, benches, beautification of flowers, other West Medford train station and banners.

465
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:36,246
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 for South Medford beautification, building facade program, public art,

466
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:45,497
[SPEAKER_07]: flower pots, decorative lighting, bike racks, other trees, and bike racks.

467
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:56,921
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000 to the hillside, Boston Avenue beautification, public art, benches and a bus shelter, bike racks, decorative lighting, building facade program, and other hillside branding and trees.

468
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

469
00:44:00,602 --> 00:44:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I move to postpone the hearing of this matter until after a committee of the whole can be held for an explanation from the

470
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:12,298
[SPEAKER_03]: administration as to where this expense is going to go.

471
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's been a number of concerns from the business community about that, and I think that it might make sense that we all sit down in the same room, Mr. President, and kind of figure out what's going on with these appropriations before we move forward in spending the money.

472
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:22,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

473
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:24,482
[SPEAKER_07]: On to the motion by Council A. Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

474
00:44:25,383 --> 00:44:26,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

475
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:32,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I, too, have received a number of phone calls with regards to business owners who have a lot of

476
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:38,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, a lot of people want to see these things happen, but there's a lot of safety concerns within our squares.

477
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:40,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of our squares are bigger than the others.

478
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:43,385
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of questions out there, and I think they need to be resolved.

479
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:46,026
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to make sure everybody has a seat at the table.

480
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:47,547
[SPEAKER_12]: We look at the surveys.

481
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:58,351
[SPEAKER_12]: We talk to the business owners, and we sit down as a group and discuss exactly how to use this, if it is going to come from free cash or, I believe, that's another issue.

482
00:44:58,371 --> 00:44:59,792
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was supposed to come from the budget.

483
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:04,733
[SPEAKER_12]: based on the parking enforcement contract, but that's a separate issue.

484
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:13,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think we need, one way or another, money needs to be spent in the squares and we need to do it the right way and we need to make sure everybody's at the table before we do so.

485
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,641
[SPEAKER_12]: So I second the motion.

486
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:18,804
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Langlois-Kern.

487
00:45:19,285 --> 00:45:20,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

488
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:26,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm quite pleased to endorse this and would like to see it acted on tonight.

489
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I was part of a committee that conducted extensive surveys on location in each one of the aforementioned squares.

490
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:45,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Furthermore, Mr. President, we've had major follow-up meetings regarding Medford Square, and it's been preceded by meetings for over a decade.

491
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:56,820
[SPEAKER_08]: May I also point out that we've been handed survey results from the mayor's office, I believe, which I might add are hard to decipher.

492
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:08,107
[SPEAKER_08]: But however, based on input I've received from people over quite some time, I'm quite satisfied that there is a grasp on things.

493
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:09,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

494
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:10,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

495
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:11,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

496
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:17,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I received a number of calls as well from residents and from members of the business community.

497
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:21,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the important thing is if we're going to do it, let's do it right.

498
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:25,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I would agree that it should go to committee, the whole, we should talk about it.

499
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We should make sure that we're seeking a wide audience.

500
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:29,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's really get the input.

501
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:32,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure everyone has an opportunity to weigh in.

502
00:46:33,328 --> 00:46:34,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure we're doing the right thing.

503
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:37,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But bottom line is, if we're going to do it, let's make sure we do it right.

504
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would support the resolution as well, that it goes to committee of the whole.

505
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:41,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

506
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:41,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

507
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:43,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

508
00:46:44,655 --> 00:46:45,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

509
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And Councilor De La Ruz was exactly right.

510
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:55,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor put together a business transition committee when she first became mayor.

511
00:46:56,018 --> 00:47:13,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And that committee did exhaustive work in reaching out to the business districts, having countless meetings, public forums, gathering input from the business community, from residents, and nothing was used, Mr. President.

512
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:19,647
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding this $250,000 beautification of our business districts.

513
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:42,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor came out with her own survey and I'm quite surprised to see that in hearing concerns from business owners and residents in this community about a number of issues that public art in our business districts is at the top of the list.

514
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,949
[SPEAKER_05]: or the one and two at the top of the list, Mr. President.

515
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:54,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the questions that were asked in the survey, I don't see any questions regarding public safety.

516
00:47:56,691 --> 00:48:07,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this money originally was intended because of the kiosks that were put in place that had a terrible, devastating impact on the businesses in our business district.

517
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:11,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a way to try to assist them

518
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:30,385
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mayor McGlynn at the time came up with an idea of allocating $250,000, $50,000 for each of the five business districts, that they can use this money towards public safety, public art, towards flower pots, decorative light, whatever they see fit, Mr. President.

519
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:35,588
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I'm gathering from this survey, it's really limited.

520
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that was the original intent.

521
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,891
[SPEAKER_05]: The second point, Mr. President,

522
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:42,162
[SPEAKER_05]: We should not be looking at 250,000.

523
00:48:42,382 --> 00:48:49,264
[SPEAKER_05]: This is year two of this whole project of giving back to the business districts.

524
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:50,964
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of money should be 500,000.

525
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,945
[SPEAKER_05]: This is year two.

526
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:57,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be $100,000 for each business district.

527
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:04,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know Mayor McGlynn had year one and Mayor Burke has year two, but this is still one city.

528
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:13,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And we owe that, when we have this committee meeting, committee of the whole, whatever, subcommittee meeting, that that issue be addressed, Mr. President.

529
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:17,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't forget about year one, the commitment Mayor McGlynn gave.

530
00:49:18,328 --> 00:49:25,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, Mayor McGlynn said he was going to pay through the revenues generated from the ticketing in the city.

531
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,112
[SPEAKER_05]: through Park Method.

532
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:31,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mayor Burke came up with her revenue source using free cash.

533
00:49:31,995 --> 00:49:34,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But this, so far, is a two-year program.

534
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:44,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very concerned, Mr. President, that this particular survey that was done doesn't represent the needs that we have in the business district.

535
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you firsthand that the Salem Street parking lot located

536
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,841
[SPEAKER_05]: across the street here on Salem Street.

537
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a business parking lot.

538
00:49:55,126 --> 00:50:00,013
[SPEAKER_05]: At night, if you go there 7.30, 8 o'clock at night, it's pitch dark in that lot.

539
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:02,697
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see your hand in front of your face.

540
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's no exaggeration.

541
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:07,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pitch dark, and it's a business lot.

542
00:50:08,277 --> 00:50:15,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess there was an estimated cost to put lighting in there at $30,000 by some organization.

543
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:18,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it could be done cheaper, Mr. President.

544
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:23,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a number of public safety issues, I think, that need to be addressed.

545
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:24,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that.

546
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:28,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And one other point, Mr. President, if I could.

547
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:32,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The survey that went out

548
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:36,344
[SPEAKER_05]: said business district beautification project.

549
00:50:36,864 --> 00:50:51,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it went on to give a narrative about 250,000, and then at the bottom it said, once the information is gathered, and I assume that's through this survey, projects specific to each business district will be identified.

550
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:58,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Now does anyone see projects through this survey for each business district that identified?

551
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And the allocation of projects will be reviewed by the city council.

552
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:05,016
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we reviewing here?

553
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: We're reviewing this, this chart here?

554
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:10,338
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we reviewing?

555
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:14,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the mayor asking us for 250,000 now?

556
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:24,161
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't been given any, according to the mayor's own distribution, any specific projects for any of the different businesses.

557
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:33,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, why this was presented to us in this fashion after two years

558
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not two weeks, two months, two years of working on this, that we get a half-hearted survey that doesn't represent the businesses or the community, and no particular projects.

559
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:56,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Something Councilor Dello Russo worked on diligently, and had all those meetings, and now one of their recommendations is in this report.

560
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:59,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You wasted your time, Councilor Dello Russo.

561
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:02,748
[SPEAKER_05]: All that time spent, you wasted it.

562
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a survey done.

563
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:22,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish to point out that I do not feel my time has been wasted and I would also take this opportunity to point out and thank what would seem to the untrained ear the accolades I've received from Councilor Marks.

564
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:22,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

565
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where the information came in that point, but that's, that's quite all right.

566
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so Mr. President,

567
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:50,595
[SPEAKER_05]: and I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this up, but based on that, Mr. President, based on the fact that this was hastily given to us with no clear direction, Mr. President, no specific projects, and falls short of the mark of funding, which should be $500,000 for two years, not $250,000 for one year.

568
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:57,958
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the mayors want to be close-knit, the mayors, when the transition happens and so forth,

569
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:01,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Honour what Mayor McGlynn put forward to the businesses.

570
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Honour the $250,000 Mayor McGlynn put forward.

571
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:10,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

572
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:14,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I just want to be clear that the motion is understood.

573
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is to lay the paper on the table until such time as the Committee of the Whole can be held.

574
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:24,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, council Scarpelli.

575
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:25,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

576
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:31,947
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, I too received a number of phone calls from concerned, uh, business owners and citizens.

577
00:53:32,027 --> 00:53:47,073
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, I think that, uh, when, uh, council council nights recommendation and going to a subcommittee or committee of the whole, whichever we decide, I think this council has gone, uh, in, in subcommittee for a number of,

578
00:53:47,705 --> 00:53:55,808
[SPEAKER_18]: very big issues, and we've worked together with all the stakeholders to make sure we find a plan that works for everybody affected.

579
00:53:56,048 --> 00:54:15,036
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I understand all of our concerns, and I think this administration has presented something to us that we can now bring to a consensus with different stakeholders, and then try to find what is best for our community as a whole.

580
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:25,769
[SPEAKER_18]: We concur with our Councilor Knight's recommendation to move this forward to subcommittee or committee of the whole.

581
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:26,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

582
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:26,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

583
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

584
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this ward.

585
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:41,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad to see this on the agenda this week because apparently last week when I introduced this before the council as to where this money went, apparently the mayor's office felt necessary to respond to it.

586
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go back with a little bit of history here.

587
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:45,013
[SPEAKER_15]: On October 7th, 2014,

588
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:51,297
[SPEAKER_15]: when the mayor had the press release indicating that the contract had been signed.

589
00:54:51,898 --> 00:55:02,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And as a result of what took place on September 20th of 2014, with a meeting with the business community and of their concerns at that particular point in time, the mayor made an addendum.

590
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:05,322
[SPEAKER_15]: He made an addendum to the contract that was signed.

591
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:12,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And he stated, after deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, the mayor is recommending the following changes

592
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:14,408
[SPEAKER_15]: to the signed contract.

593
00:55:14,488 --> 00:55:17,129
[SPEAKER_15]: In one of the signed contracts, it was point number three.

594
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:29,434
[SPEAKER_15]: It says, I recommend $250,000 on the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to the business district improvements.

595
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:32,095
[SPEAKER_15]: That was his first comment as it relates to that.

596
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Then on December 23, 2014, then budget director Burke,

597
00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:44,639
[SPEAKER_15]: speaking on behalf of the mayor, issued a press release indicating press highlights of the contract that was signed.

598
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:54,121
[SPEAKER_15]: And once again, she states in her press highlights that $250,000 annually will be subject to appropriations to the district improvements.

599
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:57,602
[SPEAKER_15]: We know that there are five districts, Mr. President, as you know.

600
00:55:58,382 --> 00:56:00,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we continue on to December 18th of 2015.

601
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:18,921
[SPEAKER_15]: You went from December of 2014, and now you're going to December of 2015, for which the mayor, on his comment to the Medford City Council on December 18th, stated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purposes of

602
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:25,347
[SPEAKER_15]: The five districts regarding to the Park Medford.

603
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:29,770
[SPEAKER_15]: This memorandum is a result of what took place during the past year.

604
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:36,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have one full year, which is 2015, as Councilmember Mox has alluded to, if we go on an annual basis.

605
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:40,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we go to January 28th of 2016.

606
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:48,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, then Budget Director Burke is the mayor, and this is her comment as it relates to us being the mayor.

607
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:49,805
[SPEAKER_15]: She states the following.

608
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:59,369
[SPEAKER_15]: After signing a 10-year contract for the program, McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue would be used for improvements in the business district.

609
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,410
[SPEAKER_15]: The prior man made a commitment to that, Burke said.

610
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:09,571
[SPEAKER_15]: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be above and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.

611
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly think that the district needs enhancements, Burke continued.

612
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:19,353
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be working for them to determine what type of monies they need going forward.

613
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:24,576
[SPEAKER_15]: You have commitments from the prior Mayor McGlynn to the present Mayor Burke.

614
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:30,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if you want to take on fiscal years 15 and go from January to December, you're into two years.

615
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:37,563
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to go into fiscal years June to July, I mean June to July, yeah, June to July, you're into two fiscal years.

616
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:44,827
[SPEAKER_15]: So no matter how you cut it, it's $100,000 that should be going back to the districts, not $250,000 or $50,000 each.

617
00:57:45,387 --> 00:57:53,893
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that is a real big concern because with $100,000 and you're going into the third year right now, you're going to be looking at either next June

618
00:57:54,413 --> 00:57:56,515
[SPEAKER_15]: or next December as being into the third year.

619
00:57:57,035 --> 00:58:08,504
[SPEAKER_15]: So to make a discussion on what the needs might be is one thing, but the real cash that should be going back to these departments, strike that, to these districts within the city, that's where it should be at.

620
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,025
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't me making it up.

621
00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:17,251
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all part of the official documents that make up this, plus another packet of internal documents that basically reflect upon the same.

622
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:21,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you doubt what I'm saying, go back and check your own records and check the meetings that took place

623
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:28,716
[SPEAKER_15]: between the Medford City Council and the business districts that came down there who were upset because they were not involved in the beginning.

624
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:39,258
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why Mayor McGlynn at the time changed it in September of 2014 when he signed the contract in October of 2014 to include that on an annual basis.

625
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:40,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

626
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:41,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

627
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:50,000
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight as seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn to move this to a committee of the whole meeting.

628
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:53,058
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

629
00:58:53,118 --> 00:58:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Table the motion.

630
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:54,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

631
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:55,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

632
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

633
00:59:00,643 --> 00:59:02,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Table the paper until after the Committee of the Whole.

634
00:59:03,565 --> 00:59:03,665
Yes.

635
00:59:03,905 --> 00:59:04,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

636
00:59:04,285 --> 00:59:04,265
17.

637
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:13,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been tabled.

638
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:17,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We will let you know when the Committee of the Whole meeting will be.

639
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:23,103
[SPEAKER_07]: after the Committee of Homeland.

640
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:26,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get a date in the next week or so.

641
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:28,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get a date and give it to you.

642
00:59:30,308 --> 00:59:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I will let you know when the date is.

643
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:36,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get together everybody and see if we can get a date that's comfortable for everybody.

644
00:59:37,652 --> 00:59:37,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if anybody wants to be notified, if they can leave their email address with the city messenger, maybe we can send out a notice to those people that are here today that wanted to

646
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:51,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll learn more about the topic and we can inform them when the meeting is via email if they leave a message.

647
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:52,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

648
00:59:57,331 --> 01:00:00,274
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can, Mr. President, I know there's some still perplexed faces.

649
01:00:00,314 --> 01:00:02,016
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that when we table

650
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:09,399
[SPEAKER_18]: When this body tables or sends something to the subcommittee, we act on this relatively quickly.

651
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:11,660
[SPEAKER_18]: So this isn't something that's going to wait a month or two months.

652
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:17,602
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something we'll get dates together that we can work together with all the stakeholders and move this forward relatively quickly.

653
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,004
[SPEAKER_18]: At least that's my hope, and I believe that's the rest of the council's hope.

654
01:00:22,904 --> 01:00:29,226
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully we can sit together tonight and have something out by tomorrow with the council.

655
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:30,407
[SPEAKER_07]: The summer holiday is coming up.

656
01:00:31,163 --> 01:00:31,743
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to be away.

657
01:00:31,764 --> 01:00:36,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to reach an agreement with, uh, when everyone's sooner, the better, sooner than later.

658
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:42,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We will, we will notify you of the date.

659
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:47,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd recommend having a committee of the whole before, um, the July meeting on July 18th.

660
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:55,403
[SPEAKER_03]: If, uh, that makes everybody schedule for July 18th, uh, this committee of the whole provided that, um, representatives from the administration can be there.

661
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we can go off that night before our council meeting.

662
01:00:58,348 --> 01:01:02,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be the objective, do it before the council meeting, the next council meeting.

663
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,571
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we will let you know.

664
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:08,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

665
01:01:08,552 --> 01:01:08,532
17, 512.

666
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:16,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President, Councilors, I submit herewith

667
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:31,017
[SPEAKER_03]: For your approval, the fiscal 18... Oh, we have to take off the table, Councilor.

668
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:35,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take this paper off the table.

669
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:38,979
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor?

670
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:40,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

671
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight to have a brief synopsis

672
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:48,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

673
01:01:53,780 --> 01:02:06,670
[SPEAKER_01]: President Rick Caraviello, honorable members of city council, and the citizens of Medford, I will now submit Mayor Burke's budget for FY 2018 for a total amount of $167,117,437, which represents a roughly $5 million increase over last year's budget.

674
01:02:16,888 --> 01:02:20,752
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a 3% increase.

675
01:02:20,772 --> 01:02:34,565
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% of this increase can be attributed to increase in fixed costs, such as health insurance, pension, debt, trash and waste disposal, and water and sewer assessments by the MWRA.

676
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:40,310
[SPEAKER_01]: If these fixed costs were excluded, the increase would only be a little over 2%.

677
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:49,341
[SPEAKER_01]: The question now is how does this 2% increase translate into additional services for the citizens of Medford?

678
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:54,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I will now briefly go into the additional services which will be part of this budget.

679
01:02:56,083 --> 01:03:04,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Burke's administration has created a new full-time year-round recreation department that will provide an assortment of recreation services and events for the families of Medford.

680
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:15,999
[SPEAKER_01]: The library has received additional funding for a media librarian and an increase in the part-time budget so there is sufficient staff available at all times.

681
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Engineering department within our DPW

682
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:24,057

691
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:36,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I just want to say that creating a budget is a complex exercise, which requires a lot of coordination with many individuals.

692
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:39,658
[SPEAKER_01]: This was definitely a team effort.

693
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:56,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank Mayor Burke, her staff, department heads, and their business managers, our finance director, Aleesha Nunley, and our treasurer, Anne Marie Irwin, our school superintendent, Roy Belson, and her finance director, Christine Patterson, for all their hard work and support.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Nice.

698
01:05:11,448 --> 01:05:15,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Mr. Belson can give an overview of the school department's budget as well, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

700
01:05:16,132 --> 01:05:19,895

[SPEAKER_04]: buttressed by revenue of $2,071,107 of generated revenue, grants and other sources of revenue as well.

703

[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 3.65 increase over last year.

704
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:53,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, the budget increases a number of activities which are positive for the schools.

705
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:56,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to increase our vocational program.

706

[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing in revenue from the outside.

707
01:05:59,316 --> 01:06:02,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now up to 20 programs as opposed to 11 a few years ago.

708
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:05,820

712
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: We've assigned probably 50 to 60 Chromebooks to each new school, each school rather, to increase their technology capability.

713
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We've increased our E-rate funding to support infrastructure improvements.

716
01:06:44,326 --> 01:06:54,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We're adding two additional ELL students, ELL teachers rather, that will help to meet the needs of youngsters who do not speak English as a first language.

717
01:06:54,812 --> 01:06:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: We're adding, our class size is really very good.

718
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:01,636
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no class in the elementary schools above 22.

719
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, they're all below 22.

720
01:07:05,994 --> 01:07:11,220
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who are interested, we added a fifth, fourth grade at the Roberts through interest that people had.

721
01:07:20,692 --> 01:07:25,755
[SPEAKER_04]: are adding additional money into the maintenance account so that every school will have additional dollars for that.

722
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: There's $200,000 of additional maintenance money with each school getting a direct grant of $20,000 in addition to general maintenance costs that we will carry through the central office that will allow them to attack certain issues that they feel are important to them.

723
01:07:42,243 --> 01:07:47,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The middle schools and the high school will get additional dollars for student activity stipends.

724
01:07:47,306 --> 01:07:49,947
[SPEAKER_04]: The special education program will need some additional money

725
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,188
[SPEAKER_04]: of tuition and transportation, but that's covered.

726
01:07:56,009 --> 01:08:05,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think that we were able to reduce enrollment at Minuteman, which saves hundreds of thousands of dollars and increase our additional revenue from that area.

727
01:08:06,494 --> 01:08:09,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The social studies program will continue to textbook replacement in US history.

728
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:16,239
[SPEAKER_04]: The math department has completed its purchase of the Envision program at the elementary level, and they will add

729
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:19,024
[SPEAKER_04]: additional textbooks to the high school math program.

730
01:08:19,424 --> 01:08:28,626
[SPEAKER_04]: The science department is going to receive $30,000 additional for science materials for the elementary school program while they pilot additional textbooks at that level.

731
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:34,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The foreign language department will acquire a new teacher from middle school to ensure that all students can take Spanish and Italian if they want.

732
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:38,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The fine arts program has a new director in Tony Sickney.

733
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:41,869
[SPEAKER_04]: As he assumes his role, we'll add 1.2 teachers to that program.

734
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The PE and health department will receive a new teacher.

735
01:08:45,277 --> 01:08:49,298
[SPEAKER_04]: which will be transferred over from one of the programs to help with the Michigan model.

736
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,140
[SPEAKER_04]: The library media program continues to add programs and services.

737
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Every library in the schools will now be covered, either by paraprofessionals or professional libraries.

738
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:02,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new director of technology, Molly Layden.

739
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:13,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be adding additional dollars to our online learning programs that we have now added a program called Edumentum this year.

740
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: which helps with credit recovery, helps junctures take additional courses, which they couldn't possibly take in this schedule.

741
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's been a very good budget.

742
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to thank my staff, all the people that are working with us, for the work that they do.

743
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we are in good shape, and we will finish this year in the black strongly.

744
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will also go into next year with a solid budget.

745
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:36,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Belson.

746
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:38,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

747
01:09:39,562 --> 01:09:43,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Belson, do you feel as though, based upon the budget that's been approved and appropriated by the school committee,

748
01:09:44,535 --> 01:09:49,477
[SPEAKER_03]: for a request for appropriation from the city council that you can meet all of the state and federal mandates and requirements that have been set forth?

749
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:49,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

750
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:50,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

751
01:09:56,779 --> 01:09:58,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions for the superintendent?

752
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

753
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:05,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you tell me, the vote looks like it took place on June 19th.

754
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:07,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

755
01:10:07,262 --> 01:10:09,583
[SPEAKER_03]: The budget vote for the school committee looked like it took place on June 19th?

756
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: 21st.

757
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:09,743
[SPEAKER_03]: 21st.

758
01:10:09,763 --> 01:10:10,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you tell me what that vote was?

759
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:13,620
[SPEAKER_04]: 7-0.

760
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,661
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-0, unanimous.

761
01:10:15,622 --> 01:10:15,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

762
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:19,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

763
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:21,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval on the budget, Mr. President.

764
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

765
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:26,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Box.

766
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

767
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for the superintendent, and I think he probably knows what I'm going to ask, but I'm going to ask it anyways, Mr. Superintendent.

768
01:10:36,457 --> 01:10:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

769
01:10:37,657 --> 01:10:39,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue is not new.

770
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I've brought up the past

771
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:43,667
[SPEAKER_05]: three years during budget deliberation.

772
01:10:44,527 --> 01:10:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's regarding security at the high school.

773
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:57,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we've had some discussion at some points it's been heated discussion, but, uh, nonetheless, I think it's discussion that needs to be had.

774
01:10:58,178 --> 01:11:09,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you can agree that, um, it's an issue that needs to be reviewed because you've told me that each of the last three years that this is an issue that definitely needs to be reviewed.

775
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:19,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So, according to the budget, Mr. Superintendent, it states that I guess there's nine security offices school-wide.

776
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:19,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

777
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's correct.

778
01:11:21,263 --> 01:11:22,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't look at the number.

779
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:22,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, nine.

780
01:11:23,205 --> 01:11:28,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the most part, they're working six and a half to seven hours?

781
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:29,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

782
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,471
[SPEAKER_05]: On a daily basis.

783
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:35,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And the issue I brought up was regarding, in particular, the high schools.

784
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to me that all security that we have are on between the hours of, let's say, 8 and 3, give or take, right around that time.

785
01:11:50,197 --> 01:11:59,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, there are many after-school programs, many functions, both athletic and academic, being held at the high school after 3 p.m.

786
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:04,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is not one security officer that's left within the building.

787
01:12:05,981 --> 01:12:33,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked if we could actually take maybe one of the security guards that are on the shift, the eight to three shift, that seems to be all the security guards on that particular shift, and maybe stagger them so we can have security there when our students, when our employees, when our faculty are there on hours that maybe school code is not in session formally.

788
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:45,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a legitimate request in this day and age, and a building of that size is the largest city-owned building in the community with many, many different entrances.

789
01:12:45,923 --> 01:12:51,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to tell you, Mr. Superintendent, and many different organizations using that particular building.

790
01:12:53,029 --> 01:13:01,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I would respectfully ask that you and the school committee, because I know decisions are made through you and the school committee, reconsider

791
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:15,461
[SPEAKER_05]: the staggering of security officers so that we have security personnel, and I know in the past you've mentioned that we have faculty that may be in the building after three, and they're a set of eyes and ears, and I can appreciate that.

792
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: You said we have maybe custodians there, and they're a set of eyes and ears.

793
01:13:19,802 --> 01:13:25,043
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they are not trained security, and that is not their role, their function, or their purpose.

794
01:13:26,223 --> 01:13:32,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would respectfully ask, Mr. Superintendent, that in such a giant budget,

795
01:13:32,753 --> 01:13:39,757
[SPEAKER_05]: and one that I can quite emphatically state has a lot of good things in it this year.

796
01:13:41,218 --> 01:13:44,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I can't find any particular fault with the budget.

797
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Class size seems to be working throughout the city.

798
01:13:49,002 --> 01:13:55,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be a fair allocation between the arts and music, and so I have no problem with the school budget.

799
01:13:56,247 --> 01:14:00,489
[SPEAKER_05]: The one problem I do have, and I've been consistent with this, is security, and I was just wondering

800
01:14:01,425 --> 01:14:03,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you can address that issue, Mr. Superintendent.

801
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:07,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what you're saying, you know, and we have talked about this.

802
01:14:07,287 --> 01:14:09,227
[SPEAKER_04]: We continuously review security issues.

803
01:14:10,388 --> 01:14:13,889
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have security during the day and we think that we've enhanced that quite a bit.

804
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:21,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We added a Raptor system, as you know, to have a professional ID system of anyone entering the buildings during the school day.

805
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a resource officer assigned to us at the high school.

806
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:29,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resource officers assigned to us throughout the city through the police department.

807
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:34,215
[SPEAKER_04]: which helps with that as well.

808
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:36,496
[SPEAKER_04]: The building is 550,000 square feet.

809
01:14:37,357 --> 01:14:42,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And a single individual moving around, I don't believe, is a particularly effective tool.

810
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:54,266
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of adult personnel there, custodians, cleaning crew, coaches, advisors, teachers, and others, all of whom have been equipped with communication devices from time to time.

811
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They can call 911 very quickly.

812
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,388
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I understand what you're asking.

813
01:14:59,053 --> 01:15:05,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the spirit of trying to come to some sort of agreement, let me bring it to the attention of the school committee.

814
01:15:05,897 --> 01:15:13,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the school committee believes that we should add a person who is in that particular assignment, then we'll bring that up.

815
01:15:14,402 --> 01:15:19,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will actively bring it to their attention, and we'll talk about that and give you a report.

816
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:23,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a reasonable compromise given the fact that we've gone back and forth on this for a few years.

817
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely is a reasonable compromise, and I look forward to your report on that, Mr. Superintendent.

818
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do that.

819
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:31,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.

820
01:15:32,602 --> 01:15:35,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I do have a few questions on the budget itself.

821
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:46,012
[SPEAKER_05]: To Mr. Nelson or to the- No, no, in general, the budget itself.

822
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:53,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, we spent countless hours, and there was, in my opinion, a number of good

823
01:15:53,823 --> 01:16:06,715
[SPEAKER_05]: proposals put in this budget from the new traffic engineer, which I know Councilor Falco has been talking about since he's been on the council and members of this council have been discussing for a long period of time.

824
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:13,001
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of things regarding the police department

825
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:20,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Crime analysis analyst that's going to be added, which we were looking for last year but got added this year.

826
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:40,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Information technology, which if you attended any of the public safety meetings throughout the community, you'll know that residents are looking for information firsthand and being able to access this information pretty quickly on crime statistics and what's actually happening in their community or in their neighborhood.

827
01:16:41,036 --> 01:16:42,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we can accomplish that through this

828
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:48,752
[SPEAKER_05]: crime analyst and the information technology position that's going to happen.

829
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very pleased with that, Mr. President.

830
01:16:52,553 --> 01:17:06,198
[SPEAKER_05]: A few things that I am displeased about is I offered a resolution, I believe it was about three or four weeks back, and it was regarding the condition of our roads in the community.

831
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:10,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can unequivocally state that it's probably

832
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:18,757
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one and number two concern that I receive from residents in this community is the poor condition of our streets.

833
01:17:19,337 --> 01:17:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did some research and homework.

834
01:17:21,658 --> 01:17:27,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I went up to the engineering department and talked to staff up there and did a little research.

835
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did find out, Mr. President, that we put in roughly about $940,000 towards

836
01:17:39,343 --> 01:17:41,704
[SPEAKER_05]: repaving of streets in our community.

837
01:17:42,404 --> 01:17:46,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We get back 100% of that through Chapter 90 money.

838
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:58,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also get an allocation from the Office of Community Development, roughly 150, 200,000 a year for repaving of roads.

839
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:02,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I mentioned a few weeks back, at the current rate we're going,

840
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:19,122
[SPEAKER_05]: based on what we're putting into repaving our streets, that we have 91 miles of road in this community, and we're roughly repaving not entire streets, but partial streets or full streets, roughly five to six a year.

841
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:24,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a total of 730 streets in this community.

842
01:18:25,309 --> 01:18:39,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on the fact that these streets are only lasting now maybe 15 to 20 years, if you're lucky, you can see how we're never going to get ahead of the game in the allocation that we're using right now to repave our roads.

843
01:18:40,274 --> 01:18:49,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time it was supported by this council and recommended that the mayor put a budget line item, which there is currently no budget line item to repave

844
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:52,514
[SPEAKER_05]: roads in our streets and our community.

845
01:18:53,435 --> 01:19:05,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was hoping that I requested a million dollars and I was hoping that at least the mayor in good faith would recognize the need in this community and would put something towards a line item.

846
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:13,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But needless to say, Mr. President, that never amounted in the budget and never came to fruition.

847
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:18,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is one of the major concerns I have as a member of the council.

848
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,792
[SPEAKER_05]: um, the condition of our roads.

849
01:19:21,412 --> 01:19:33,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, that is one issue, Mr. President, that I'm hoping, uh, that the mayor will, uh, uh, hear this loud and clear that, um, you know, when you have 950,000 or 980,000, the city puts forward.

850
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:49,967
[SPEAKER_05]: and then gets 100% of that back, so we get reimbursed 100%, then we have the $980,000 back, we should be reinvesting that $980,000 into roads.

851
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:52,808
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's a no-brainer.

852
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:55,409
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be a reinvestment right back into our roads.

853
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:58,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, we're not using it for that purpose, Mr. President.

854
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:06,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hope the mayor hears this loud and clear based on the information that I brought forward

855
01:20:07,322 --> 01:20:14,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that our current way of doing business in the community is we're always going to be chasing our tail.

856
01:20:15,226 --> 01:20:16,907
[SPEAKER_05]: We're never going to get ahead on our streets.

857
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:20,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always, every year, going to be facing, you know what?

858
01:20:20,408 --> 01:20:21,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all these potholes.

859
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:22,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the curbs.

860
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:23,930
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't match the street.

861
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The curbs are the same level as the street.

862
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:27,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the manhole covers, they're sinking.

863
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:30,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the catch basins, they're all sinking in the community.

864
01:20:31,616 --> 01:20:37,859
[SPEAKER_05]: This money, Mr. President, can be used, chapter 90 money, can be used for, according to our city engineer.

865
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:42,722
[SPEAKER_07]: In the back, can we cut the talking down to someone who's speaking?

866
01:20:43,942 --> 01:20:44,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, Councilman.

867
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

868
01:20:46,564 --> 01:20:52,547
[SPEAKER_05]: This money could be used, Mr. President, not only for repaving a street, it's also used for sidewalks,

869
01:20:53,095 --> 01:21:00,977
[SPEAKER_05]: handicap accessibility, maintenance on the water and sewer, so if it's a manhole cover or a catch basin, that Chapter 90 money can be used for that.

870
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:12,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're falling short of the mark in a city this size, six, seven square miles with 91 miles of road and fixing our roads.

871
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:21,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And it may seem like a minor thing, but it's a major thing for traffic in this community, for pedestrian safety, and for our residents.

872
01:21:22,019 --> 01:21:26,240
[SPEAKER_05]: that have to traverse these streets that are littered and lined with potholes.

873
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:31,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we have streets in the community that we've discussed six decades.

874
01:21:33,102 --> 01:21:35,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Six decades never repaved.

875
01:21:36,443 --> 01:21:41,225
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think a street looks like after six decades of a New England weather?

876
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:45,106
[SPEAKER_05]: New England snow, plowing, salt, everything else.

877
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,247
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think the street looks like?

878
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:50,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know what it looks like because we all went down to some of these streets.

879
01:21:52,316 --> 01:21:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, you know what, I will support the budget this year.

880
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:04,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, I voted against the budget for a number of reasons that I was unhappy with, of which some of those reasons found their way in the budget this year.

881
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:10,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is one other issue that I would like to mention.

882
01:22:11,133 --> 01:22:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this council back, I believe it was two or three years ago,

883
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:24,420
[SPEAKER_05]: that offered a resolution, it was actually my resolution, requesting that a line item be placed in the budget for arts in the community.

884
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:31,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time, it was supported unanimously by this council, it was the first time ever we had a line item for arts in the community.

885
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:35,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very proud of that, and at the time Mayor McGlynn, I think, funded it.

886
01:22:36,947 --> 01:22:46,791
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe 15,000, and we made a promise to the art community at the time, because the state, you know, when they start making their cuts, which they're doing now, the arts is the first to get cut.

887
01:22:47,592 --> 01:22:50,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always stated, that's our biggest bang for our buck.

888
01:22:51,373 --> 01:22:58,997
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see 15 to $30,000, it goes to thousands of children and programs within this community that keep this city functioning.

889
01:22:59,737 --> 01:23:06,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And the following year, I think it was Mayor McGlynn or Mayor Burke, it might have been Mayor McGlynn,

890
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:09,572
[SPEAKER_05]: we requested as the council that we double it to $30,000.

891
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just giving money away, the Arts Council came to us and said, this is what the programming went for, this is how the outreach went, this is how many people we touched in the community, these are the projects, and I thought it was a home run, Mr. President.

892
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:33,065
[SPEAKER_05]: This year I asked her the budget deliberation, if we can look at adding to the $30,000, and I didn't get any support from the administration again.

893
01:23:33,405 --> 01:23:36,487
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as far as I know, the arts funding,

894
01:23:37,194 --> 01:23:44,900
[SPEAKER_05]: and I stand to be corrected on this, has been slashed by at least 45% their budget, Mr. President, from state and federal funding.

895
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been slashed by at least 45%.

896
01:23:47,663 --> 01:23:53,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So they count on our measly $15,000 or $30,000 to run all these different events.

897
01:23:54,068 --> 01:24:03,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone likes to go out to circle the square and the river at the Hatch Shell and all these other events they run, and funding has to come somewhere.

898
01:24:04,276 --> 01:24:06,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was happy we stepped up to the plate

899
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:14,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am disappointed this year, Mr. President, that we couldn't find additional money to support the arts movement in our community.

900
01:24:14,659 --> 01:24:23,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on those few things, Mr. President, I'm hoping next year will be a different case from the streets and from the arts.

901
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will move approval on this budget, Mr. President.

902
01:24:27,202 --> 01:24:27,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

903
01:24:28,202 --> 01:24:30,082
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

904
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:31,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

905
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:34,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

906
01:24:37,566 --> 01:24:51,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if other Councilors want to speak on the budget, by the way, Councilor Dello Russo's motion was on the school budget, not on the city budget.

907
01:24:52,975 --> 01:24:57,738
[SPEAKER_14]: So that motion does not affect what's on the floor right now.

908
01:24:57,758 --> 01:25:05,082
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I did want to say is that following the protocol, if there are other Councilors who want to speak on the budget,

909
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:07,739
[SPEAKER_14]: total city budget before I do.

910
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:14,504
[SPEAKER_14]: There are Councilors do want to speak before you do, but they're giving me the floor now.

911
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:15,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

912
01:25:15,585 --> 01:25:19,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I want to thank you, uh, Mr. President.

913
01:25:19,788 --> 01:25:25,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And also I want to thank the whole city council whom I consider my friends and neighbors.

914
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:33,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I want my relationship to the council to be the same as the council's relationship to the people.

915
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,121
[SPEAKER_14]: and that is one of support and service.

916
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:49,666
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I want to express my appreciation to the city council for its many days of attendance at the review of the 2018 budget as presented by our mayor.

917
01:25:51,027 --> 01:25:59,551
[SPEAKER_14]: The council listened to all the department heads and asked questions about details in the budget, and you are well informed.

918
01:26:00,551 --> 01:26:02,652
[SPEAKER_14]: The council takes an oath to support

919
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:06,048
[SPEAKER_14]: and defend the Massachusetts constitution.

920
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:13,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And our constitution is there to serve the people and the city, which I know our Councilors love.

921
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:18,990
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council is not elected to serve the mayor.

922
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:27,692
[SPEAKER_14]: There are about 37 items in the budget whose costs can be reduced by a simple majority vote of the council.

923
01:26:28,492 --> 01:26:32,793
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the council is not allowed to increase the budget

924
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,841
[SPEAKER_14]: That is how we get checks and balances.

925
01:26:37,842 --> 01:26:44,766
[SPEAKER_14]: The council is empowered to check the mayor if it thinks there are excesses in a budget.

926
01:26:49,268 --> 01:26:55,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the council is aware of all this, but I say it in order to inform the television audience.

927
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:02,292
[SPEAKER_14]: The 2018 budget amounts to $167 million.

928
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:08,374
[SPEAKER_14]: That is $5 million more than last year's budget of $162 million.

929
01:27:09,134 --> 01:27:26,380
[SPEAKER_14]: If the city council passes this budget, it is voting today right now to raise taxes on all the people of Medford, including senior citizens, fixed income residents, and minimum wage earners.

930
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:34,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think the council wants to do that, but that is what will happen if this budget is passed.

931
01:27:34,954 --> 01:27:42,798
[SPEAKER_14]: That tax increase amounts to four to $500 more for each taxpayer.

932
01:27:42,818 --> 01:27:45,840
[SPEAKER_14]: $400 is very painful to our vulnerable people.

933
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:55,985
[SPEAKER_14]: The budget spending is $167 million and more than 80% of that goes to compensation for city of Medford employees

934
01:27:56,670 --> 01:28:02,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And those loyal employees will continue to be rewarded, but we will not tolerate waste by others.

935
01:28:03,714 --> 01:28:04,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me repeat that.

936
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:11,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Our loyal employees will continue to be rewarded, but we will not tolerate waste by others.

937
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:16,621
[SPEAKER_14]: That leaves less than 20% for materiel and supplies.

938
01:28:17,822 --> 01:28:25,606
[SPEAKER_14]: And that explains why Medford cannot carry out proper and timely maintenance, as Councilor Marks said,

939
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:29,746
[SPEAKER_14]: of buildings, infrastructure, and natural resources.

940
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:38,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Heads of departments, out of respect for the executive, do not insist on proper allocation of funds for their departments.

941
01:28:39,749 --> 01:28:43,710
[SPEAKER_14]: But department heads need and want proper allocation.

942
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:48,071
[SPEAKER_14]: As a result, potholes are not filled.

943
01:28:49,712 --> 01:28:51,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Sidewalks are not repaired.

944
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:54,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Street bumps are not maintained.

945
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Speed bumps, rather, sorry.

946
01:28:57,971 --> 01:28:59,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Speed bumps are not maintained.

947
01:29:00,472 --> 01:29:02,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Crosswalks are not painted.

948
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,813
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was promised in a campaign.

949
01:29:06,194 --> 01:29:07,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Street cleaning is sparse.

950
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:10,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Trees are not trimmed.

951
01:29:11,136 --> 01:29:13,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Tree stumps are not removed for many months.

952
01:29:14,757 --> 01:29:17,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Underground water leaks are not repaired.

953
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Roof leaks are not repaired.

954
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Public toilets are not sanitary.

955
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:28,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford Square is not made to work.

956
01:29:29,733 --> 01:29:33,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Traffic lights at dangerous intersections have not been synchronized.

957
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:38,777
[SPEAKER_14]: No foot patrol police officers, as promised in the campaign.

958
01:29:40,118 --> 01:29:43,339
[SPEAKER_14]: No end of unpopular kiosk parking program.

959
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,740
[SPEAKER_14]: No charter review.

960
01:29:47,121 --> 01:29:51,403
[SPEAKER_14]: No improvement in public school abysmal MCAS ranking.

961
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:58,691
[SPEAKER_14]: and $25 for a permit to park in front of your own house.

962
01:30:01,013 --> 01:30:03,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this what we are paying high taxes for?

963
01:30:05,136 --> 01:30:05,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's face it.

964
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:09,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Our Medford is not a vital city.

965
01:30:10,821 --> 01:30:12,742
[SPEAKER_14]: The city's finances are unstable.

966
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:18,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Its head is bumping the ceiling when 80% of the budget is spent on the bureaucracy.

967
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:20,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Soon,

968
01:30:21,623 --> 01:30:26,345
[SPEAKER_14]: For all practical purposes, the city will become a welfare department.

969
01:30:27,585 --> 01:30:45,531
[SPEAKER_14]: If the council passes this budget, it becomes responsible for raising taxes and it must be held responsible by the voters for separating the people from their money without an improvement in services and then redistributing that money to prosperous people.

970
01:30:46,271 --> 01:30:49,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of them, not even residents of Medford.

971
01:30:50,828 --> 01:30:58,431
[SPEAKER_14]: To quote Oscar Wilde, our mayor knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.

972
01:30:59,511 --> 01:31:14,756
[SPEAKER_14]: To vote for this budget is to follow the mayor down that path of depression, and worse, to injure our very own children who will inherit a sad, poorly educated city.

973
01:31:16,056 --> 01:31:17,117
[SPEAKER_14]: One last quotation.

974
01:31:18,177 --> 01:31:20,438
[SPEAKER_14]: This is from Marcus Aurelius, who said,

975
01:31:21,688 --> 01:31:26,651
[SPEAKER_14]: In a sense, people are our proper occupation.

976
01:31:27,931 --> 01:31:31,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Our job is to do them good.

977
01:31:32,533 --> 01:31:33,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

978
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:33,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

979
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:34,614
Thank you, Governor.

980
01:31:35,475 --> 01:31:36,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

981
01:31:37,196 --> 01:31:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I will yield to the resident.

982
01:31:41,778 --> 01:31:42,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

983
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:43,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

984
01:31:43,759 --> 01:31:44,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

985
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:47,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

986
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:49,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, thank you, Councilor Falco, for yielding.

987
01:31:50,285 --> 01:31:51,086
[SPEAKER_16]: some time to me.

988
01:31:51,466 --> 01:31:53,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I just want to talk about a few things.

989
01:31:54,308 --> 01:32:00,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I, I definitely echo everything Mr. Starella just said, uh, in, in spades.

990
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:07,099
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to echo a few things from what, uh, Councilor Marks was, was talking about.

991
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:10,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, he's mentioned one street that hasn't been done in six decades.

992
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:12,103
[SPEAKER_16]: That's, that's my street.

993
01:32:12,224 --> 01:32:12,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Evan street.

994
01:32:12,844 --> 01:32:15,326
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been before the city council before, uh,

995
01:32:18,412 --> 01:32:21,812
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a very sad commentary on the city of Medford.

996
01:32:22,175 --> 01:32:40,330
[SPEAKER_16]: to see a budget of $167 million when residents on my street, Mr. President, were told by at least two Councilors that the repairs that were in dire need, critical condition, were going to be done this May.

997
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:48,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I came to the city hall and I spoke to the engineer who told me all the red tape it has to go through.

998
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:49,676
[SPEAKER_16]: about a contract.

999
01:32:50,496 --> 01:33:04,960
[SPEAKER_16]: A neighbor of mine told me yesterday that upon speaking to somebody in City Hall, I won't mention any names, said that contract is now having problems, so it doesn't look like our street's gonna be done this year.

1000
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:15,662
[SPEAKER_16]: After being told by several people that it was gonna be done, the residents of Evans Street are outraged.

1001
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:44,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, when we're paying two income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes that go up every year, a new connectivity fee coming at us in the water tax account that has a surplus in it, to see a $167 million budget that's about to be approved, as Mr. Starewa said, that 80% of it is going towards salaries and the infrastructure repairs not being done,

1002
01:33:45,739 --> 01:33:47,520
[SPEAKER_16]: It will be reflected on this body.

1003
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,861
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a primary reason why I am running for city council this year.

1004
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:54,182
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not a campaign speech.

1005
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:57,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, but I can announce that I'm a candidate, Mr. President.

1006
01:33:57,703 --> 01:33:58,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I can.

1007
01:33:58,123 --> 01:33:59,684
[SPEAKER_16]: If that threatens you, good.

1008
01:34:00,744 --> 01:34:00,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

1009
01:34:01,772 --> 01:34:05,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we need new voices on the city council, Mr. President.

1010
01:34:05,317 --> 01:34:11,466
[SPEAKER_16]: We need new people that are going to come in here and have the political will to finally stand up and say no.

1011
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,048
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a political step.

1012
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:14,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that, Mr. President.

1013
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:15,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for reminding me that.

1014
01:34:15,952 --> 01:34:16,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1015
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:31,628
[SPEAKER_16]: The reinvestment in the arts that Councilor Marks spoke to is a stabilizing tax base, especially with that Chevalier Theatre.

1016
01:34:31,748 --> 01:34:34,951
[SPEAKER_16]: That's only going to get $97,000 this year under this budget.

1017
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:35,832
[SPEAKER_16]: It's outrageous.

1018
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:45,699
[SPEAKER_16]: It's outrageous, especially when this downtown business district is suffering so much for the extended repair of the Craddock Bridge that's now added another year, another $10 million to it.

1019
01:34:49,025 --> 01:35:00,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Far too many residents of this community are at their wits end with vital repairs that are not being done and seeing a budget increase to $167 million.

1020
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:14,010
[SPEAKER_16]: I respectfully ask you to vote no on this budget until such a time that it reflects adequate responsibility for all the millions of millions of tax dollars that these residents are paying.

1021
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:15,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1022
01:35:18,097 --> 01:35:20,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I can wait if you prefer.

1023
01:35:20,698 --> 01:35:21,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1024
01:35:21,398 --> 01:35:21,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

1025
01:35:21,558 --> 01:35:23,079
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make it very brief as usual.

1026
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Take your time.

1027
01:35:24,059 --> 01:35:25,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Castagnetti, Cushing street.

1028
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, two one five five.

1029
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,581
[SPEAKER_13]: To hear Mr. Sorella speak.

1030
01:35:31,021 --> 01:35:32,602
[SPEAKER_13]: It gives me hope for mankind.

1031
01:35:33,202 --> 01:35:34,683
[SPEAKER_13]: He reminds me of my father.

1032
01:35:34,723 --> 01:35:39,624
[SPEAKER_13]: He uses a lot of common sense, but I'm sure he has more than a sixth grade education.

1033
01:35:42,465 --> 01:35:46,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, I think the translation would be, let's cut the waste.

1034
01:35:49,003 --> 01:35:53,285
[SPEAKER_13]: and take care of what we have and maintain what we have.

1035
01:35:55,226 --> 01:36:09,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a gut feeling that the old high school in 1970 that was closed on Forest Street will still be standing when all these so-called new schools will become rubble and have to be rebuilt at our children.

1036
01:36:12,215 --> 01:36:17,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you wanna talk, please go out in the hallway so other people can hear what's happening.

1037
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:18,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to hear in this room.

1038
01:36:19,143 --> 01:36:21,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were telling me not to campaign.

1039
01:36:21,665 --> 01:36:24,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not running at this juncture.

1040
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:31,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So, excuse me, again, people can't hear in this room.

1041
01:36:31,991 --> 01:36:34,113
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to talk, please go out into the hallway.

1042
01:36:34,193 --> 01:36:34,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1043
01:36:35,393 --> 01:36:36,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, Mr. Castagnetti.

1044
01:36:38,595 --> 01:36:41,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, thank you very much.

1045
01:36:41,938 --> 01:36:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize again, Mr. Castagnetti.

1046
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:45,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

1047
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,501
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe I remember the key point.

1048
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:48,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Starella brought up

1049
01:36:50,123 --> 01:36:58,708
[SPEAKER_13]: it'll probably be a $400, $500 increase in that real estate tax, I presume he meant.

1050
01:36:59,589 --> 01:37:04,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's probably right on from the last couple of years standing in a row.

1051
01:37:04,191 --> 01:37:08,814
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like my real estate tax has gone up $400 annually.

1052
01:37:10,435 --> 01:37:18,240
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would like to say, as you people spent lots of time, and if I may commend you,

1053
01:37:19,502 --> 01:37:21,583
[SPEAKER_13]: an effort on this budget process.

1054
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:35,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully, you've taken into consideration, God willing, I'll be back in December, about the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, because we're talking about money now, budget.

1055
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:46,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of that $400 increase that Mr. Sorella presumed it's gonna be, would a 35% owner-occupied real estate tax exemption

1056
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:57,004
[SPEAKER_13]: which has never been adopted in this city, but has been in Everest, Somerville, and Malden, and Nantucket, and Brookline, and in Boston, mind you.

1057
01:37:58,305 --> 01:38:07,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of a $400 increase, we would see a $700 decrease in my estimation with my simple mathematics.

1058
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:09,149
[SPEAKER_13]: That's $1,000 swing.

1059
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:13,331
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you really want to jack up the budget 3%, 4%, 5%,

1060
01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:40,570
[SPEAKER_13]: at least give us what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts gave to We the People, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, so we could have a $1,000 swing of a savings instead of, at this rate, our tax rate will be $10,000 a year on a house instead of $6,000 in the next five years.

1061
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:46,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially for the seniors, it's not easy for a lot of people.

1062
01:38:48,282 --> 01:38:51,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you're listening, hope to see you in December.

1063
01:38:52,283 --> 01:38:52,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1064
01:38:53,823 --> 01:38:54,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

1065
01:38:58,084 --> 01:39:00,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, you have the floor.

1066
01:39:00,064 --> 01:39:01,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass.

1067
01:39:02,224 --> 01:39:17,127
[SPEAKER_15]: The interesting part about this budget goes back to October or November of last year in January of this past year regarding the mayor's original state of the city address, where she talked about she had incorporated a liaison officer between her office

1068
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,358
[SPEAKER_15]: in this council.

1069
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:34,808
[SPEAKER_15]: And the interesting part about this whole thing, you know, Mr. President, um, I don't know if I should say this, but I am, you know, because I'm at the podium, Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo like to take this opportunity from walking away and shirking their responsibility to listen to whoever the person is at this podium.

1070
01:39:35,268 --> 01:39:42,891
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a complete disrespect to this councilor and to the taxpayers of this community, for which they're getting paid $30,000 each, which is $60,000.

1071
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:54,795
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anybody is watching, I would hope that they do not vote for Mr. Knight or Mr. Dello Russo, because they show complete disrespect to people at this podium, including a former member of this body.

1072
01:39:55,495 --> 01:40:10,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, as I said before and I will repeat it, this council has never had the opportunity to sit down with this mayor to go to every single one of you, seven of you, one at a time, to find out what you would like to see in this budget as your particular project, over and beyond her particular projects.

1073
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:11,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't exist.

1074
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:12,720
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't happen.

1075
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,621
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a transparent

1076
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:16,241
[SPEAKER_15]: administration.

1077
01:40:16,281 --> 01:40:21,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a fake administration of telling things that happen that don't happen.

1078
01:40:21,983 --> 01:40:23,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It's as fake as a nine dollar bill.

1079
01:40:24,363 --> 01:40:31,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And the unfortunate part is that you seven members, all of you, especially the one that support her, she's making complete fools out of you.

1080
01:40:32,005 --> 01:40:36,146
[SPEAKER_15]: You're making yourself look like a bunch of clowns because you've never held her feet to the fire once.

1081
01:40:36,426 --> 01:40:37,987
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the year that it should have been done.

1082
01:40:38,627 --> 01:40:40,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Stirella is absolutely right.

1083
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:49,370
[SPEAKER_15]: As an elderly taxpayer in this community, he has taken the time to understand and at least manage, through this particular budget, the needs of this community.

1084
01:40:50,011 --> 01:40:57,733
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you have more building permits going out, if you have more construction coming in, and you have more money coming in, and you continuously keep taxing,

1085
01:40:58,233 --> 01:41:09,441
[SPEAKER_15]: the Medford taxpayers over and beyond, then they have the connectivity tax, surpluses in the water and sewer account for which you have no major projects going on, $9 million in thereabouts of the free cash account.

1086
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:12,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are the preferences taking place?

1087
01:41:12,863 --> 01:41:18,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilman Marks, you alluded to the fact of the gear, the washing machine gear, which goes back to February of this past year.

1088
01:41:20,048 --> 01:41:22,310
[SPEAKER_15]: $100,000 in the Office of Community Development.

1089
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:26,532
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been begging for more people in that office to help you out here in this community.

1090
01:41:27,193 --> 01:41:27,953
[SPEAKER_15]: We could go through it.

1091
01:41:27,973 --> 01:41:29,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to go through it.

1092
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:38,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Sitting behind me over here are four ladies that work in the mayor's office that make in excess of $400,000 a year that Medford taxpayers are paying for.

1093
01:41:39,721 --> 01:41:51,525
[SPEAKER_15]: And none of you will have the opportunity to sit down and to get your particular issue in this particular budget to show an act of conciliation, an act of remediation, and more importantly, an act of incorporation.

1094
01:41:51,925 --> 01:41:52,785
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't exist.

1095
01:41:53,366 --> 01:42:04,729
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why there are so many people running for city council, and that's why there are so many people running for mayor, because the people in this community are dissatisfied as to what's going on in this particular building.

1096
01:42:04,949 --> 01:42:06,530
[SPEAKER_15]: They're running it as a closed shop.

1097
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:10,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And every single one of you should be ashamed of yourself if you'll allow this to continue.

1098
01:42:11,372 --> 01:42:12,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1099
01:42:12,612 --> 01:42:13,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1100
01:42:13,692 --> 01:42:14,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

1101
01:42:15,013 --> 01:42:16,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1102
01:42:16,674 --> 01:42:19,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to thank all the residents for coming up here tonight.

1103
01:42:20,235 --> 01:42:23,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we all know, the budget process is a long process.

1104
01:42:23,816 --> 01:42:27,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of our most important responsibilities that we have.

1105
01:42:27,037 --> 01:42:28,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to thank

1106
01:42:29,265 --> 01:42:32,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to begin, this is actually my, I guess, probably closing speech in the budget.

1107
01:42:33,766 --> 01:42:38,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to begin by thanking the mayor and the department heads for all their hard work.

1108
01:42:38,967 --> 01:42:41,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is not easy as far as going through the budget process.

1109
01:42:42,368 --> 01:42:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of energy, a lot of collaboration.

1110
01:42:46,769 --> 01:42:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate that during our budget hearings, and they've been going on for a number of weeks, the quick turnaround, which helps us try to analyze the data and helps us try to make a decision in a timely fashion.

1111
01:42:58,886 --> 01:42:59,386
[SPEAKER_02]: to all of you.

1112
01:43:00,047 --> 01:43:09,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank the superintendent of schools and the school committee and all the department heads in the school department for all of their hard work.

1113
01:43:10,953 --> 01:43:16,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever we had questions, those questions were answered the same way in a timely fashion, and I appreciate that as well.

1114
01:43:17,737 --> 01:43:23,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's not easy crafting a budget and presenting this budget, but there are also a lot of people to thank.

1115
01:43:25,182 --> 01:43:26,843
[SPEAKER_02]: My fellow council members here tonight,

1116
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Asked great questions.

1117
01:43:29,693 --> 01:43:34,036
[SPEAKER_02]: The deliberation process, I thought, was pretty smooth and, for the most part, professional.

1118
01:43:34,317 --> 01:43:37,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication.

1119
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of all, the residents.

1120
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:42,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The residents that came to the budget meetings.

1121
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:48,849
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked good questions, made points, and their input was very beneficial.

1122
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:53,413
[SPEAKER_02]: But although no budget is perfect, I believe that this is a good budget.

1123
01:43:53,918 --> 01:44:02,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is a good, solid budget that protects core services, it provides educational and recreation opportunities to our youngest residents.

1124
01:44:03,683 --> 01:44:19,692
[SPEAKER_02]: A recreation department, which I believe this city has been asking for for years, and it was supported by us on the council, I am very excited to see that in the budget, and that's going to happen, and I can't wait to see the opportunities that that will present to our residents.

1125
01:44:20,232 --> 01:44:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at things that, personally, that I have lobbied for,

1126
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:29,620
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past two years, a traffic engineer, something that I have advocated for continuously.

1127
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to my colleagues.

1128
01:44:31,101 --> 01:44:32,261
[SPEAKER_02]: You've supported that as well.

1129
01:44:32,881 --> 01:44:35,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that is in the budget.

1130
01:44:35,462 --> 01:44:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at legislative software, something that I've advocated as well over the past year, and something that I believe will increase the transparency that we have here at City Hall with us and the council, with boards and commissions, hopefully.

1131
01:44:48,767 --> 01:44:50,907
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I think improves government.

1132
01:44:51,007 --> 01:44:52,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it more transparent.

1133
01:44:52,883 --> 01:44:56,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone becomes part of the process and happy to say that that's part of the budget.

1134
01:44:56,645 --> 01:45:00,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are things that I've been advocating for, but you have been supporting as well.

1135
01:45:01,067 --> 01:45:02,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are part of this budget.

1136
01:45:02,887 --> 01:45:04,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's something that is good.

1137
01:45:05,288 --> 01:45:06,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at other parts of the budget.

1138
01:45:06,869 --> 01:45:10,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I see library funding increased, another plus.

1139
01:45:10,651 --> 01:45:15,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at the additional positions in the Medford Police Department with the crime scene analyst.

1140
01:45:15,993 --> 01:45:17,054
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another great addition.

1141
01:45:17,914 --> 01:45:20,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at the school system.

1142
01:45:21,443 --> 01:45:28,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as a former member of the school committee and a parent that has kids in the Medford Public Schools, I take a look at this budget and I think this is great.

1143
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:35,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I was on the school committee and I came on during the recession, I saw things cut because we couldn't afford those things.

1144
01:45:36,253 --> 01:45:37,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are all coming back now.

1145
01:45:38,154 --> 01:45:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at

1146
01:45:39,617 --> 01:45:44,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, paraprofessionals or librarians coming back into the system.

1147
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

1148
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are good things that are being added back in.

1149
01:45:48,402 --> 01:45:55,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at the increase in maintenance and repair by $200,000, $20,000 for each school.

1150
01:45:55,986 --> 01:45:56,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Another great addition.

1151
01:45:57,887 --> 01:45:58,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Low class size.

1152
01:45:58,807 --> 01:45:59,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say enough about this.

1153
01:46:00,088 --> 01:46:02,729
[SPEAKER_02]: As a former member of the school committee, low class size.

1154
01:46:02,809 --> 01:46:03,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a look at this list.

1155
01:46:04,931 --> 01:46:05,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our schools, 19, 18, 15,

1156
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: 17.

1157
01:46:11,835 --> 01:46:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get lower than that.

1158
01:46:13,275 --> 01:46:17,836
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go across the state, you'd be hard-pressed to find... Please, there's someone speaking.

1159
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:18,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1160
01:46:20,437 --> 01:46:20,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1161
01:46:20,877 --> 01:46:22,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be professional about it, please.

1162
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:23,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1163
01:46:27,259 --> 01:46:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I said let's be professional about it.

1164
01:46:30,139 --> 01:46:30,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's distracting.

1165
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So class size is some of the best in the state, and we should be proud of that.

1166
01:46:37,382 --> 01:46:41,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that the school committee throughout the years has always focused on.

1167
01:46:42,284 --> 01:46:43,184
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be proud of that.

1168
01:46:43,264 --> 01:46:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Class size has come down.

1169
01:46:45,045 --> 01:46:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to have a class with 15 students, that's amazing.

1170
01:46:48,046 --> 01:46:49,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dream to a teacher.

1171
01:46:49,107 --> 01:46:52,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is another great budget addition.

1172
01:46:53,548 --> 01:46:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Activity accounts in our schools increasing.

1173
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:57,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fabulous.

1174
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're getting students involved in what's going on in the schools.

1175
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take a look at our vocational school program, from 11 programs, I believe, to 20.

1176
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fabulous.

1177
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all part of this budget.

1178
01:47:09,761 --> 01:47:13,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that I look at.

1179
01:47:13,942 --> 01:47:14,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I support it.

1180
01:47:14,942 --> 01:47:15,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good budget.

1181
01:47:16,203 --> 01:47:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We're replacing textbooks in addition.

1182
01:47:19,524 --> 01:47:23,725
[SPEAKER_02]: We're adding technology with the Chromebooks throughout our school system.

1183
01:47:24,205 --> 01:47:27,266
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all good additions to the budget.

1184
01:47:27,966 --> 01:47:30,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, not all budgets are perfect.

1185
01:47:30,638 --> 01:47:34,679
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is something I think, I think this is a good budget and I think this is something that we can be proud of.

1186
01:47:35,019 --> 01:47:36,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to second the motion.

1187
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1188
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1189
01:47:40,241 --> 01:47:42,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1190
01:47:42,142 --> 01:47:51,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I want to start by also thanking, um, the department heads who are at our budget, countless hours of budget meetings over the last three weeks.

1191
01:47:51,945 --> 01:47:59,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there was at least three or four that were there constantly and definitely, even if they didn't have the answer, they got us mostly every,

1192
01:48:00,705 --> 01:48:01,486
[SPEAKER_12]: answer we needed.

1193
01:48:01,506 --> 01:48:12,593
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd second like to disclose that before the vote is taken, I do have a family member that's in the school budget, so I just want to make full disclosure on that.

1194
01:48:12,673 --> 01:48:13,954
[SPEAKER_12]: She is a teacher, my sister.

1195
01:48:16,136 --> 01:48:19,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Third, I want to talk about the positives of the budget.

1196
01:48:19,678 --> 01:48:24,822
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, we put a lot of hours into it, as did the administration and the school department and school committee.

1197
01:48:25,702 --> 01:48:30,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are some great additions to the budget and a lot of things that I'm happy to see.

1198
01:48:30,863 --> 01:48:34,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some of my other colleagues have gone over a number of them.

1199
01:48:34,784 --> 01:48:37,525
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to point out what I think was important.

1200
01:48:38,585 --> 01:48:46,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the recovery coach, he's a fine young man who's done a lot of work so far, and it's great to see a recovery coach added to the budget.

1201
01:48:46,747 --> 01:48:53,989
[SPEAKER_12]: And he'll be in our health department and obviously working with Penny, our coordinator, a great deal.

1202
01:48:54,628 --> 01:49:01,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the traffic engineer that we've advocated for with the leave of Councilor Falco is going to be a great addition.

1203
01:49:02,012 --> 01:49:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that we made the recommendation during the budget hearings that that traffic engineer also have a job duty of looking over street repairs by utility companies, a problem that I know a number of us have had and we've had meetings on, keeping up to date with regards to

1204
01:49:23,139 --> 01:49:35,889
[SPEAKER_12]: follow-up of work that's done by utilities and the fact that we'll have an engineer, a traffic engineer, looking at that as well, as well as a vote we took last week, hopefully looking over the gas leaks in the community.

1205
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:38,431
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a great position that's going to be added.

1206
01:49:39,192 --> 01:49:42,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank Councilor Scarpelli for working on the rec department.

1207
01:49:42,234 --> 01:49:51,542
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good addition to the budget, and I know there were over 1,000 families that were interested in it, so it's good to see that that was added.

1208
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:59,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, having a year where the library is fully funded to levels that are appropriate and then some is a positive.

1209
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:04,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Class size, Councilor Falco spoke about it.

1210
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:11,466
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to advocate myself for one specific grade in the city that I have a child in.

1211
01:50:11,867 --> 01:50:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: But other than that, our class size is very low.

1212
01:50:14,308 --> 01:50:19,232
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was great last Monday to hear that no class size will go over 22.

1213
01:50:20,727 --> 01:50:30,832
[SPEAKER_12]: and I believe a lot, looking at the chart, there are a lot that are in the, I think we have an average of 19 or 20, which is just really a big deal to families in this city.

1214
01:50:30,932 --> 01:50:38,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Having class sizes low is extremely important for learning, and you can ask anybody, and that's pretty important.

1215
01:50:39,836 --> 01:50:49,721
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had two of the biggest complaints that I get is speeding and then the condition of our roads and sidewalks, non-removal of tree stumps.

1216
01:50:50,306 --> 01:50:53,508
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's been good to know that radar guns have been ordered.

1217
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:59,192
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also, within this budget, the past budget, have received laser guns.

1218
01:50:59,252 --> 01:51:01,393
[SPEAKER_12]: We have had officers trained in them.

1219
01:51:01,833 --> 01:51:09,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing the job of the speeding on all of our thoroughfares and inside streets that we obviously get calls on all the time.

1220
01:51:09,438 --> 01:51:11,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is extremely important.

1221
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:17,403
[SPEAKER_12]: And on a side note, it's great to have Sergeant Hartnett, who is very responsive to our questions and emails.

1222
01:51:19,365 --> 01:51:22,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that the senior work program is still within the budget.

1223
01:51:22,287 --> 01:51:26,831
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the second year since it was removed years and years ago, and I think that's important.

1224
01:51:27,211 --> 01:51:30,574
[SPEAKER_12]: It does help the seniors that are paying the property taxes.

1225
01:51:30,614 --> 01:51:34,317
[SPEAKER_12]: It gives them $1,000 in relief, and that's great to see in there.

1226
01:51:35,778 --> 01:51:44,145
[SPEAKER_12]: We got a good update with regards to collecting debt and how low we've been able to get it within the city, so that's definitely a positive.

1227
01:51:45,186 --> 01:51:46,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And the leak detection program that

1228
01:51:48,733 --> 01:51:53,175
[SPEAKER_12]: is going to be implemented will hopefully save us on the MWRA side.

1229
01:51:53,215 --> 01:51:54,896
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's good to see that in the budget.

1230
01:51:56,517 --> 01:52:00,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are just some of the good things that I want to point out.

1231
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,421
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, I do see some things that I'm concerned with.

1232
01:52:05,722 --> 01:52:07,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Down the road, we're going to run into an issue.

1233
01:52:07,863 --> 01:52:10,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have 107 police officers.

1234
01:52:11,204 --> 01:52:16,247
[SPEAKER_12]: We have hopefully nine that are coming out once we go to civilian dispatch.

1235
01:52:17,513 --> 01:52:26,194
[SPEAKER_12]: But we also have seven or eight retirements that are going to come down the line this next year, and then five, six, seven more that are in 2018.

1236
01:52:27,135 --> 01:52:39,837
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're still looking at the numbers, unless we hire within the next year, year and a half, and get some men and women in the academy, we're looking at lower numbers than we had this past year.

1237
01:52:40,677 --> 01:52:43,457
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do the calculations by what we were given, we're looking at about 104.

1238
01:52:43,497 --> 01:52:46,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just have a concern with that.

1239
01:52:47,584 --> 01:53:00,187
[SPEAKER_12]: We should have put, I know we have the crime analyst that was put into this budget, which is great, but I feel like we should have put a few more offices in the book for fiscal year 2018.

1240
01:53:00,227 --> 01:53:04,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Roads and sidewalks, I have a concern.

1241
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there was money that actually wasn't even spent in,

1242
01:53:10,091 --> 01:53:17,775
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the line items, I think it was about $45,000 that wasn't spent on sidewalk and road repairs, sidewalk repairs.

1243
01:53:18,615 --> 01:53:21,137
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something that you get complaints about all the time.

1244
01:53:21,157 --> 01:53:29,681
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go walking around the city or you have somebody that calls you and it's with regards to a sidewalk, it's because a sidewalk needs to be fixed.

1245
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:39,166
[SPEAKER_12]: So the fact that we're not spending certain portions, and we talked about it within the transfers, the fact that we're not spending money on things we need to spend money on

1246
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,301
[SPEAKER_12]: is definitely concerning.

1247
01:53:41,821 --> 01:53:43,762
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need to invest more.

1248
01:53:43,882 --> 01:53:52,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I recommended that we take, I think it was 50,000 extra to pay for our roads and sidewalks and find that money elsewhere.

1249
01:53:53,385 --> 01:53:56,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And that wasn't taken into this budget, but I think it should be.

1250
01:53:56,846 --> 01:54:06,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Going back to the vote we took a while ago, I still am concerned about when we're going to do the fire headquarters.

1251
01:54:07,392 --> 01:54:13,213
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that I believe we should have done with the police headquarters, and I wanted to point that out.

1252
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:20,295
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also been mentioned, I guess the last of my comments, it's been mentioned by a number of citizens and a Councilor or two here.

1253
01:54:21,175 --> 01:54:24,596
[SPEAKER_12]: We really are taxing the people to the ultimate max.

1254
01:54:25,216 --> 01:54:27,136
[SPEAKER_12]: The connectivity fee, I don't like it.

1255
01:54:27,976 --> 01:54:34,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand how it's going to affect the next year, and it's not necessarily concerning, but I have a really

1256
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:41,473
[SPEAKER_12]: big concern with how it's going to come down 2018, 2019, and beyond.

1257
01:54:41,633 --> 01:54:45,415
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just something that I wish was never voted upon.

1258
01:54:47,756 --> 01:54:57,461
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that we have a water and sewer surplus in the, I believe, we got the answer, I believe it was in the $7 million, $8 million range on top of free cash.

1259
01:54:58,241 --> 01:55:04,724
[SPEAKER_12]: And the rate we're charging with regards to

1260
01:55:07,427 --> 01:55:09,688
[SPEAKER_12]: PEG access, the cable fee.

1261
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:26,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like there needs to be some relief if the budget wasn't so, I think the budget's really good, so if it wasn't as good like last year, last year I voted against the budget, this year I'm on the fence.

1262
01:55:26,616 --> 01:55:35,821
[SPEAKER_12]: I just feel like taxing to the max, the absolute dollar, the last dollar we can is something we should really strive to

1263
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:44,137
[SPEAKER_12]: try to give some sort of relief to all the homeowners in this community, all the rate payers.

1264
01:55:44,897 --> 01:55:45,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just never done.

1265
01:55:45,978 --> 01:55:47,099
[SPEAKER_12]: I can, I never get the votes.

1266
01:55:47,339 --> 01:55:49,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's obviously why I'm on the fence.

1267
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:53,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I have the votes tonight either to give some relief to the taxpayer.

1268
01:55:53,425 --> 01:55:55,967
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that's just something that needs to be taken into account.

1269
01:55:57,849 --> 01:55:59,170
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll leave it at that for now.

1270
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:00,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1271
01:56:00,111 --> 01:56:00,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor.

1272
01:56:03,318 --> 01:56:04,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1273
01:56:04,999 --> 01:56:11,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't go through every single highlight of the budget because the superintendent's done it, members of the administration have done it, members of the council have done it.

1274
01:56:12,403 --> 01:56:14,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to take an opportunity to thank Ms.

1275
01:56:14,064 --> 01:56:15,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Nunley for her hard work.

1276
01:56:15,645 --> 01:56:16,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1277
01:56:16,465 --> 01:56:17,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Kahn for her hard work.

1278
01:56:17,726 --> 01:56:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to thank Ms.

1279
01:56:18,846 --> 01:56:19,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Irwin for her hard work.

1280
01:56:20,127 --> 01:56:25,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat through nearly 20 hours of budget debates in a short period of time and these three individuals were there every step of the way with us.

1281
01:56:26,835 --> 01:56:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: When the budget debates were over and we asked a number of questions, we went home and they went back to the office and they got us the answers that we needed and they got us the answers in a timely fashion.

1282
01:56:34,662 --> 01:56:37,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much for the hard work and effort that you put into this budget.

1283
01:56:38,004 --> 01:56:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Belson, I'd like to thank you as well.

1284
01:56:39,765 --> 01:56:41,327
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a great job putting your budget together.

1285
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave a great presentation and I really appreciate the work and effort that you and the school committee put in as well.

1286
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:55,658
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that's a highlight of this budget that I haven't heard much about is the work that happened in the electrical department and the work that has been performed by Steven Rendazzo.

1287
01:56:56,276 --> 01:56:59,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And his electrical department budget was decreased by $300,000.

1288
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:09,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was able to decrease his budget by $300,000 through a cost-saving measure, where the electrical department actually purchased the streetlights from National Grid.

1289
01:57:09,868 --> 01:57:17,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And this resulted in a $300,000 savings to our budget, which is actually the equivalent number to the monies that we appropriated for the recreation department.

1290
01:57:17,895 --> 01:57:20,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very important that we recognize the work and effort of Steve Rendazzo.

1291
01:57:20,877 --> 01:57:22,298
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of our newer department heads here,

1292
01:57:23,355 --> 01:57:26,576
[SPEAKER_03]: gone above and beyond the call of duty, and has done a great job managing that department.

1293
01:57:26,916 --> 01:57:30,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's shown us savings, and he's shown us his experience, and it's really paying off.

1294
01:57:31,538 --> 01:57:44,062
[SPEAKER_03]: This budget does build on the successes of the past, Mr. President, and I'm very excited to see that we're utilizing the Office of Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention and building upon the successes of that office with a recovery coach.

1295
01:57:44,082 --> 01:57:48,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very important role here in the community, and I'm very thankful that we have it in the budget.

1296
01:57:49,735 --> 01:57:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to take a quick moment to thank the school committee for the work that they've done.

1297
01:57:53,498 --> 01:57:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year they put forward one of the best budgets that I've seen the school committee put forward in a long time.

1298
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:00,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year they've built upon those successes as well, Mr. President.

1299
01:58:00,202 --> 01:58:05,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to thank the school committee as a body for all their work and effort in putting this document forward.

1300
01:58:05,685 --> 01:58:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question.

1301
01:58:08,547 --> 01:58:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good budget.

1302
01:58:09,788 --> 01:58:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I can wholeheartedly support this evening.

1303
01:58:12,129 --> 01:58:13,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd ask for a roll call vote.

1304
01:58:14,591 --> 01:58:15,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1305
01:58:15,992 --> 01:58:16,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1306
01:58:18,152 --> 01:58:24,433
[SPEAKER_18]: to follow what Councilor Knight said, and especially after John's eloquent words.

1307
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:30,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to keep pounding on these points, so I'll leave it to this.

1308
01:58:32,195 --> 01:58:42,957
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing I realized two years ago coming on this council with seven different personalities and seven different thought processes, we all had different goals for our community.

1309
01:58:43,477 --> 01:58:46,618
[SPEAKER_18]: And everyone behind this reel works very hard to work together.

1310
01:58:46,638 --> 01:58:47,738
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one thing I realized.

1311
01:58:48,764 --> 01:58:56,207
[SPEAKER_18]: The perception for the community, if you don't know or if you have your perception that this group doesn't work together, we work very, very well together.

1312
01:58:56,507 --> 01:59:02,129
[SPEAKER_18]: And I applaud what we bring to the city and how hard we're working.

1313
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:13,074
[SPEAKER_18]: The city administration, what we've done together in putting out this budget, I thank you very much because it was a lot of work and the time that we put into it.

1314
01:59:14,693 --> 01:59:22,476
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, could cause some problems at home because we miss a lot of very important nights for our children and our families.

1315
01:59:22,536 --> 01:59:23,356
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's our job.

1316
01:59:23,396 --> 01:59:28,557
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we get paid all that money, that $30,000 that we keep hearing.

1317
01:59:29,978 --> 01:59:33,779
[SPEAKER_18]: But sure, when people come to the people's podium, this is their podium.

1318
01:59:34,279 --> 01:59:37,500
[SPEAKER_18]: So when they come to this podium, I give them my full attention, my full respect.

1319
01:59:39,001 --> 01:59:41,522
[SPEAKER_18]: And sure, we all want to do better.

1320
01:59:41,942 --> 01:59:42,462
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to

1321
01:59:43,005 --> 01:59:47,606
[SPEAKER_18]: eliminate taxes, we want to fix the roads, we want to fix our streets, there's so many concerns that we have.

1322
01:59:48,566 --> 02:00:11,692
[SPEAKER_18]: But as a councilor that a year ago was appointed by former President Dello Russo, and I'll speak to this point personally because I think everybody's really touched upon many different points about this budget, but as Councilor Dello Russo went to the mayor and presented my name to be the chairperson for the focus group for recreation, I will tell you, for one councilor, I worked

1323
02:00:12,503 --> 02:00:14,465
[SPEAKER_18]: hand-in-hand with our administration.

1324
02:00:15,085 --> 02:00:15,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Every week, we met.

1325
02:00:17,007 --> 02:00:26,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Every week, every day, I talked to whether it be Joe Russo or Allie Fisk or Janine Camuso or Jen Devewood.

1326
02:00:26,956 --> 02:00:30,059
[SPEAKER_18]: I've talked to, sat and met with the mayor.

1327
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,763
[SPEAKER_18]: We provided the community with input.

1328
02:00:34,303 --> 02:00:36,866
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a focus group that I have to applaud and

1329
02:00:37,825 --> 02:00:49,371
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing that we talked about when we hit the campaign trail and how many great people we have in our community that if you work together and bring in great minds that have some goals that can work together, what you can accomplish.

1330
02:00:51,452 --> 02:00:56,695
[SPEAKER_18]: I started back as one of my number one priorities bringing a full-time recreation program to the city of Medford.

1331
02:00:58,035 --> 02:01:03,138
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing we did with this administration, this lack of communication, I didn't see.

1332
02:01:03,898 --> 02:01:07,240
[SPEAKER_18]: For this point, I will talk on, we worked very closely.

1333
02:01:08,018 --> 02:01:12,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And I personally met with this, our focus group on a weekly basis for at least 10 to 11 months.

1334
02:01:13,442 --> 02:01:23,850
[SPEAKER_18]: And we presented numbers after studies, after deep consideration, after homework that was done and people bringing information back and presented it back to the mayor.

1335
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:30,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And she brought, she came back to us with this budget that is now implementing a full-time recreation department.

1336
02:01:31,215 --> 02:01:31,876
[SPEAKER_18]: That's unheard of.

1337
02:01:33,311 --> 02:01:41,756
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had so many, there were so many questions that boy, I would love to do a lot of the fixes that people have asked for.

1338
02:01:42,896 --> 02:01:49,780
[SPEAKER_18]: But for this budget, you see the great process that we've gone through, the great initiatives that have been implemented.

1339
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:55,443
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not gonna touch upon it, because I want to, but it's beating a dead horse.

1340
02:01:55,463 --> 02:02:01,447
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to speak on the recreation again, that for what we see,

1341
02:02:02,427 --> 02:02:10,572
[SPEAKER_18]: and the collaboration used by every department head to make this come to fruition for our community, for our babies, for our kids, for our seniors.

1342
02:02:11,633 --> 02:02:14,715
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, even I know that Council Marks, it's not what he wants.

1343
02:02:14,795 --> 02:02:21,960
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and with, with the arts, he's been an advocate for the art community and making sure that they are funded to the max.

1344
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,741
[SPEAKER_18]: And I applaud him.

1345
02:02:24,702 --> 02:02:29,425
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor has put a line item budget into the recreation budget.

1346
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,921
[SPEAKER_18]: that will address some of those concerns.

1347
02:02:32,742 --> 02:02:40,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot that, you know, that people have when they come to that podium and have an agenda that they want to press.

1348
02:02:40,748 --> 02:02:41,528
[SPEAKER_18]: And I respect that.

1349
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:51,856
[SPEAKER_18]: But on a personal level, two years on the city council and bringing together this very important department that our community has been crying out for for years, it's happening.

1350
02:02:51,896 --> 02:02:53,277
[SPEAKER_18]: This is just a small example.

1351
02:02:54,108 --> 02:02:56,469
[SPEAKER_18]: of what I think we are looking for for the future.

1352
02:02:56,729 --> 02:03:03,170
[SPEAKER_18]: The way this council works, the way the city administration has worked for this department to make this happen, I applaud it and I thank them.

1353
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:11,312
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know the recreation people have talked and publicly said that George Scarpelli keeps talking about the neighboring community all the time.

1354
02:03:12,052 --> 02:03:13,773
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to clear this up to the community.

1355
02:03:14,033 --> 02:03:16,553
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not talking about Somerville Recreation.

1356
02:03:17,214 --> 02:03:20,874
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sitting here talking about Method Recreation, okay?

1357
02:03:20,894 --> 02:03:23,435
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be 10 times better than any recreation department.

1358
02:03:24,504 --> 02:03:27,666
[SPEAKER_18]: across the Commonwealth and I can see that because we have the commitment from our community.

1359
02:03:28,206 --> 02:03:34,389
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm very excited about this budget for what is positively put into this budget.

1360
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:42,794
[SPEAKER_18]: We've looked at every single avenue to get what could be put out to our community and achieve some great goals.

1361
02:03:42,954 --> 02:03:45,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I thank you.

1362
02:03:45,155 --> 02:03:45,915
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it was a little winded.

1363
02:03:45,935 --> 02:03:46,635
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

1364
02:03:47,016 --> 02:03:53,379
[SPEAKER_18]: But for this councilor, I appreciate all the hard work our city administration has done and I move forward with this budget.

1365
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:54,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1366
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:56,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1367
02:03:56,140 --> 02:04:03,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I just wanted to, um, well, first of all, thanks Councilor Scarpelli on his leadership with the education, uh, with the, uh, recreation department.

1368
02:04:03,664 --> 02:04:14,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, the other thing I wanted to mention as well, just to disclose, um, my mother-in-law works at the Medford public library and I just wanted to, she's been an employee long before I was elected, but I disclosed that during the budget hearings.

1369
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:17,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to close it here, disclose it here as well.

1370
02:04:17,751 --> 02:04:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, tonight.

1371
02:04:18,472 --> 02:04:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1372
02:04:19,312 --> 02:04:20,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1373
02:04:20,273 --> 02:04:20,913
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

1374
02:04:21,113 --> 02:04:22,754
[SPEAKER_18]: I too have to disclose that my sister,

1375
02:04:23,396 --> 02:04:35,746
[SPEAKER_18]: is a teacher at the Roberts, and she had that position well before I became a member of this council, but I just wanted to make sure that I followed suit with my colleagues and made sure the public knows that.

1376
02:04:35,786 --> 02:04:36,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1377
02:04:36,386 --> 02:04:38,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone, for the public disclosures.

1378
02:04:38,188 --> 02:04:52,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I personally, as president, I want to thank the mayor, the staff that came every night, Superintendent Belson came, and mostly I want to thank the other six members of this council who came every night,

1379
02:04:54,277 --> 02:04:56,739
[SPEAKER_07]: You've heard all the questions they've asked and the answers they've gotten.

1380
02:04:56,759 --> 02:05:02,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to commend them for all the questions and the dedication they put in over these last three weeks.

1381
02:05:03,125 --> 02:05:04,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, this is a good group.

1382
02:05:04,986 --> 02:05:14,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this whole group may not agree on everything, but when it comes to time to do some work, we're able to put things aside and get things done.

1383
02:05:14,835 --> 02:05:20,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank them for making my job as president during these budget hearings a lot easier.

1384
02:05:20,459 --> 02:05:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank you.

1385
02:05:22,919 --> 02:05:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: and all the departments for your dedication in this.

1386
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:36,784
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo to support the 2018 City of Method budget, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1387
02:05:37,064 --> 02:05:39,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1388
02:05:40,885 --> 02:05:41,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dello Russo?

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1390
02:05:43,106 --> 02:05:43,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco?

1391
02:05:44,047 --> 02:05:44,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1392
02:05:44,967 --> 02:05:45,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1393
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:45,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1394
02:05:46,607 --> 02:05:47,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kern?

1395
02:05:47,888 --> 02:05:47,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1396
02:05:48,795 --> 02:05:49,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Marks.

1397
02:05:49,856 --> 02:05:50,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1398
02:05:50,616 --> 02:05:51,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1399
02:05:51,637 --> 02:05:51,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1400
02:05:52,357 --> 02:05:53,117
[SPEAKER_09]: President Caraviello.

1401
02:05:53,398 --> 02:05:53,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1402
02:05:55,279 --> 02:05:57,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, another negative.

1403
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank all my colleagues and I thank everyone.

1404
02:06:01,142 --> 02:06:02,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the budget.

1405
02:06:03,723 --> 02:06:04,764
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension.

1406
02:06:08,165 --> 02:06:22,014
[SPEAKER_07]: 177-553, petition for sign denial reversal by Anita Fletcher of Ultimate Tango, 5 High Street, Unit B2 and 3, Medford, Mass.

1407
02:06:22,695 --> 02:06:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: OCD application 2017 exceeds allowable sign limit over public law.

1408
02:06:31,981 --> 02:06:34,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks is the chairman of the sign committee.

1409
02:06:35,503 --> 02:06:36,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1410
02:06:36,737 --> 02:06:37,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1411
02:06:38,038 --> 02:06:44,402
[SPEAKER_05]: If the petitioner is here, just explain to the council what you'd like to do.

1412
02:06:45,579 --> 02:06:45,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1413
02:06:45,819 --> 02:06:46,920
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Anita Flater.

1414
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:51,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the manager of the Ultimate Tango Dance School.

1415
02:06:51,724 --> 02:06:54,606
[SPEAKER_00]: We just moved here from Somerville.

1416
02:06:54,646 --> 02:06:57,208
[SPEAKER_00]: We're opening August 1st.

1417
02:06:58,428 --> 02:07:01,991
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically put the application for the sign over the sidewalk.

1418
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:07,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you all for having me here.

1419
02:07:07,255 --> 02:07:10,237
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interesting experience to see how this works.

1420
02:07:10,977 --> 02:07:16,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that you guys, whatever the decision, you guys doing your job and you want the best for the Medford.

1421
02:07:17,838 --> 02:07:26,680
[SPEAKER_00]: From our part, basically we did our research about what will fit the historic look of Medford City.

1422
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:34,581
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did our research to find the sign that matches the style of the building of 5 High Street, which has a very unique round facade.

1423
02:07:36,021 --> 02:07:39,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself study art restoration back in my country of Poland.

1424
02:07:39,772 --> 02:07:50,979
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in my letter, I can say that I have some experience with the historic art and restoration and preservation.

1425
02:07:51,499 --> 02:07:59,303
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I mentioned in my letter, I would not propose something that is in disagreement with the historic appearance of Medford.

1426
02:08:00,764 --> 02:08:03,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, our application was refused because of the size.

1427
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:14,903
[SPEAKER_00]: The sign is perpendicular towards the building, so according to the rules, it should not exceed four square feet.

1428
02:08:15,563 --> 02:08:19,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sign, together with all the brackets that hold it, is 16 square feet.

1429
02:08:21,425 --> 02:08:26,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it doesn't follow the rules, but I think it matches size-wise.

1430
02:08:27,506 --> 02:08:30,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Size-wise, it matches the appearance of the building, the small size.

1431
02:08:31,482 --> 02:08:35,383
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 by 2 feet is just going to look kind of funny on the building this size.

1432
02:08:36,623 --> 02:08:37,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I'm going to say.

1433
02:08:38,044 --> 02:08:39,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your advice.

1434
02:08:41,124 --> 02:08:41,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, madam.

1435
02:08:42,185 --> 02:08:44,005
[SPEAKER_08]: The chair recognizes Chairman Marks.

1436
02:08:46,686 --> 02:08:56,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, we currently have two requests in subcommittee right now, business and economic development and signs.

1437
02:08:57,548 --> 02:09:00,349
[SPEAKER_05]: One is for another sign permit at five high.

1438
02:09:01,122 --> 02:09:06,505
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, which is right next door to your sign and, uh, one on high street.

1439
02:09:07,226 --> 02:09:20,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that this paper be referred to the subcommittee on, uh, economic development and signs, uh, for the purpose of discussion and review and then, uh, potential reporting out of the paper.

1440
02:09:20,094 --> 02:09:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1441
02:09:22,635 --> 02:09:27,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, on that motion chair recognizes councilor night.

1442
02:09:28,243 --> 02:09:31,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I can certainly understand why the Chairman made this motion.

1443
02:09:31,745 --> 02:09:38,549
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, we've had a number of requests for signs that have been put into subcommittee, especially at this particular location.

1444
02:09:39,469 --> 02:09:41,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand why the Council wants to do it.

1445
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like this sign is going to be next to where another proposed sign has been, an application has been submitted for another proposed sign.

1446
02:09:49,953 --> 02:09:57,866
[SPEAKER_03]: The business owner of the building has given letters of support in the past as to what it is he'd like to see, and I think that that's something that we might require here.

1447
02:09:58,247 --> 02:10:00,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of the design of the sign, Mr. President, I think it's a nice design.

1448
02:10:01,492 --> 02:10:03,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it does fit in with the historical nature of the square.

1449
02:10:04,329 --> 02:10:14,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And provided that the building doesn't look like a NASCAR car with advertisements slapped all over it, that's something that I don't think I'll have a problem supporting.

1450
02:10:14,112 --> 02:10:21,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that Councilor Marks is making a proper and appropriate suggestion that it go through the subcommittee process so that we can take a look at the whole picture and the whole building at once.

1451
02:10:22,014 --> 02:10:22,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1452
02:10:22,355 --> 02:10:23,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a classy sign proposal.

1453
02:10:24,175 --> 02:10:32,398
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks that the paper be sent to subcommittee on that motion, Madam Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1454
02:10:32,758 --> 02:10:33,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1455
02:10:34,405 --> 02:10:37,007
[SPEAKER_12]: President Dello Russo.

1456
02:10:38,268 --> 02:10:39,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the only sign you have?

1457
02:10:39,449 --> 02:10:42,031
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you opened in August, you don't have any signage right now?

1458
02:10:42,512 --> 02:10:43,592
[SPEAKER_12]: No other signage at all.

1459
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:57,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a... I want everything to be consistent as well, but with us going into summer meetings and to have... Oh, you're opening in August?

1460
02:10:57,704 --> 02:10:58,284
[SPEAKER_12]: August 1st, yes.

1461
02:10:58,304 --> 02:10:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, August 1st.

1462
02:11:01,962 --> 02:11:03,343
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm concerned with the time frame.

1463
02:11:03,383 --> 02:11:07,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, we just want her to be able to get her sign as soon as possible.

1464
02:11:09,447 --> 02:11:11,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1465
02:11:11,509 --> 02:11:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being referred to subcommittee and the summer meeting schedule doesn't have any reflection on what the subcommittee meeting schedule is.

1466
02:11:17,593 --> 02:11:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: The subcommittee schedule is usually taken care of by the chairman.

1467
02:11:20,715 --> 02:11:27,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand we get into vacation schedule and stuff like that, but I'm sure that based upon the leadership of Councilor Marks, this is something that could happen in short order.

1468
02:11:28,523 --> 02:11:29,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, if I could.

1469
02:11:29,924 --> 02:11:32,086
[SPEAKER_08]: If you would like, yes, Mr. Chairman.

1470
02:11:32,166 --> 02:11:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: The subcommittee called for an emergency meeting back several weeks ago to address the signs that were before us.

1471
02:11:39,411 --> 02:11:45,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And one out of the three petitioners presented at the time.

1472
02:11:45,516 --> 02:11:49,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So we handled that one petitioner, and we left the other two in subcommittee.

1473
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:56,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked Ed Finn just recently, City Clerk Finn, to reach out to the petitioners to see if they're still interested.

1474
02:11:56,615 --> 02:11:58,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were told they are.

1475
02:11:58,656 --> 02:12:03,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will call a meeting in short order to discuss this, I can assure you.

1476
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1477
02:12:06,321 --> 02:12:08,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Counsel, you're satisfied?

1478
02:12:08,062 --> 02:12:08,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel better, yeah.

1479
02:12:08,762 --> 02:12:10,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we have a meeting July 18.

1480
02:12:10,123 --> 02:12:12,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have a meeting in August, too.

1481
02:12:12,265 --> 02:12:14,926
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the federal holiday coming up next week as well.

1482
02:12:18,588 --> 02:12:20,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1483
02:12:20,109 --> 02:12:21,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Move the question, Mr. President.

1484
02:12:22,211 --> 02:12:24,912
[SPEAKER_08]: On that, Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

1485
02:12:25,492 --> 02:12:25,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1486
02:12:27,231 --> 02:12:33,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, again, I know that that is in our subcommittee and it doesn't have to be, we don't have to wait until July 18th, correct?

1487
02:12:34,116 --> 02:12:34,296
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1488
02:12:34,536 --> 02:12:34,656
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1489
02:12:34,776 --> 02:12:39,940
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that the whole idea is finding out when the other two petitioners can do it.

1490
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:44,724
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think for at least the two of us can sit down and figure out when we can do it so we can get the move this forward.

1491
02:12:44,744 --> 02:12:48,146
[SPEAKER_18]: The subcommittee can make a decision and then report it out in time for July 18th.

1492
02:12:48,166 --> 02:12:48,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, for the 18th.

1493
02:12:48,807 --> 02:12:49,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1494
02:12:49,087 --> 02:12:49,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1495
02:12:51,082 --> 02:13:00,964
[SPEAKER_08]: So on that motion that the paper go to the subcommittee on, uh, science, business and economic development, all those in favor.

1496
02:13:01,584 --> 02:13:12,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Next item on the agenda is a return to the regular order of business on the motion of council night as such all those in favor, all those opposed.

1497
02:13:12,147 --> 02:13:16,768
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion carries 17-five 51 offered by vice president marks.

1498
02:13:17,316 --> 02:13:22,880
[SPEAKER_08]: be resolved that the Eversource Energy Project be discussed on behalf of Metro residents.

1499
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1500
02:13:25,582 --> 02:13:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1501
02:13:27,183 --> 02:13:33,627
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that are not aware, Eversource will be doing a major project in our community.

1502
02:13:34,628 --> 02:13:40,032
[SPEAKER_05]: We were notified roughly a year and a half ago that this would take place sometime

1503
02:13:40,759 --> 02:13:48,745
[SPEAKER_05]: in the year 2017, and now the project, from my understanding, is moving forward, Mr. President.

1504
02:13:49,245 --> 02:14:06,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a public hearing where Eversource did appear before the council at my request a while back to allow for residents to come and ask some of the concerns they may have regarding the project, and after that hearing, I didn't hear anything else.

1505
02:14:07,576 --> 02:14:21,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm bringing up the issue tonight, Mr. President, because this project is going to have a major impact on residential homes along Winthrop Street, South Street, and the Mystic Ave area.

1506
02:14:22,552 --> 02:14:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a major impact on traffic in the community for a period of time.

1507
02:14:28,609 --> 02:14:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Winthrop Street area.

1508
02:14:32,991 --> 02:14:40,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It has already several thousand vehicles per day, including trucks and MBTA buses that go down Winthrop Street.

1509
02:14:41,434 --> 02:14:47,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And this eight-mile project, which starts in Woburn, goes through Winchester.

1510
02:14:48,877 --> 02:15:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, and then into method from the method Winchester line down with upstreet down south main to mystic have, uh, which is roughly, I believe about 2.3 miles in our city out of the 8.1 miles.

1511
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:09,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, there are a number of questions that need to be answered regarding this project.

1512
02:15:10,414 --> 02:15:15,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, as we all know, the project is to put an underground utility, uh, electrical utility,

1513
02:15:16,325 --> 02:15:32,195
[SPEAKER_05]: which is gonna involve the digging of manhole installations within our street, also the trenching of roughly, if you could take a conversation on the hallway, I'd appreciate it, thank you.

1514
02:15:33,416 --> 02:15:35,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I apologize.

1515
02:15:36,778 --> 02:15:41,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So roughly two miles of trenching and excavation,

1516
02:15:42,178 --> 02:15:46,522
[SPEAKER_05]: to install the pipe within the street itself.

1517
02:15:47,263 --> 02:15:53,368
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have cabling, which is going to be extensive, the pulling of cable, the length of this project.

1518
02:15:54,088 --> 02:16:01,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cable, from my understanding, is going to be inside a pipe, which is also going to be filled with fluid.

1519
02:16:02,135 --> 02:16:03,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And because it's an electrified

1520
02:16:05,114 --> 02:16:13,282
[SPEAKER_05]: um, cable, uh, this fluid protects, uh, I guess the cable itself from any type of nicks or so forth.

1521
02:16:13,783 --> 02:16:16,686
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, it's a very extensive project, Mr. President.

1522
02:16:17,146 --> 02:16:27,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the manhole structures, um, right now, uh, from what I read in the report, there's going to be 19 precast concrete vaults, uh, located underground.

1523
02:16:28,632 --> 02:16:32,394
[SPEAKER_05]: 8 feet wide by 20 feet long and 6 feet high.

1524
02:16:32,794 --> 02:16:36,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine the size of the hole they're going to be digging in the street.

1525
02:16:37,237 --> 02:16:40,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Each manhole would take roughly 7 to 10 days to install.

1526
02:16:41,459 --> 02:16:48,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So 19 precast manholes are going to be the entire 8 miles of the project.

1527
02:16:48,823 --> 02:16:54,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in this city we're at least getting 3 or 4 of those manholes and maybe even more, Mr. President.

1528
02:16:55,046 --> 02:16:55,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine

1529
02:16:56,693 --> 02:17:14,965
[SPEAKER_05]: The manhole coupled with the trenching of a trench maybe two feet wide, three or four feet deep on the same street is going to cause a significant traffic delay and impact in the quality of life in many of our neighborhoods, Mr. President.

1530
02:17:16,566 --> 02:17:17,527
[SPEAKER_05]: The trenching will take

1531
02:17:19,041 --> 02:17:23,663
[SPEAKER_05]: place, and it'll be roughly 100 to 200 feet per day.

1532
02:17:24,424 --> 02:17:28,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's followed by roughly 10 to 18 days of construction.

1533
02:17:29,366 --> 02:17:34,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So meanwhile, they're going to be doing the manhole, the giant manhole concrete vaults.

1534
02:17:34,548 --> 02:17:35,949
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to be doing the trenching.

1535
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And every 100 to 200 feet, they're going to have to stop and do the cable pulling, the installation of the pipes, and a lot of work involved with that, Mr. President.

1536
02:17:48,908 --> 02:17:54,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So tonight's resolution is the fact that this is supposed to be starting once it's approved.

1537
02:17:55,449 --> 02:18:03,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the first quarter of 2017, if I'm not mistaken, we're in June now, we've got to be in the first quarter of 2017.

1538
02:18:04,371 --> 02:18:11,793
[SPEAKER_05]: This project is about to start and I have seen very little, uh, communication between the city,

1539
02:18:12,393 --> 02:18:16,818
[SPEAKER_05]: and the neighborhood and the direct abundance on this project.

1540
02:18:16,858 --> 02:18:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a number of motions, Mr. Clerk, I'll pass them along to you.

1541
02:18:20,642 --> 02:18:26,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, but, um, I, I think it's only appropriate that this council

1542
02:18:26,942 --> 02:18:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: and the community received the traffic impact study, which was done according to the information I read.

1543
02:18:33,804 --> 02:18:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: The noise impact study of the digging and the trenching.

1544
02:18:38,026 --> 02:18:45,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the host community agreement exist between Eversource and the city of Medford to ensure that all the agreements are carried out?

1545
02:18:46,088 --> 02:18:50,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure right now if there is a host agreement between us and Eversource.

1546
02:18:50,570 --> 02:18:51,470
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very important.

1547
02:18:52,130 --> 02:18:53,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that whatever's agreed upon

1548
02:18:54,605 --> 02:18:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: is carried forth by Eversource.

1549
02:18:57,987 --> 02:18:59,607
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the construction schedule?

1550
02:19:00,448 --> 02:19:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be a staging area and where will they be located?

1551
02:19:04,069 --> 02:19:21,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We know from the project that the big fast 14 project when they did all the 14 bridges in the heart of the square over on 93, they had several staging areas throughout the city and that always poses a concern for residents of the community

1552
02:19:22,140 --> 02:19:24,141
[SPEAKER_05]: that may be abutting one of these work areas.

1553
02:19:25,262 --> 02:19:26,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very important to find that out.

1554
02:19:28,864 --> 02:19:30,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident notification and outreach methods.

1555
02:19:31,626 --> 02:19:42,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We were told when Eversource appeared before us that they'd have a telephone hotline and email address that was available and manned 24 hours a day during construction.

1556
02:19:42,833 --> 02:19:45,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure that that is still adhered to.

1557
02:19:48,358 --> 02:19:52,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The report I read, Mr. President, talks about electromagnetic fields.

1558
02:19:53,362 --> 02:19:58,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess this underground wire is going to emit electromagnetic fields.

1559
02:19:59,247 --> 02:20:01,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a potential health risk.

1560
02:20:01,929 --> 02:20:07,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't read the 300 pages from the study, to be quite honest with you, but I read some of it.

1561
02:20:07,634 --> 02:20:12,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And the health risk is, Mr. President, at spliced areas.

1562
02:20:12,538 --> 02:20:17,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they splice the wires together at certain connection zones in these vaults,

1563
02:20:17,698 --> 02:20:20,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It emits this electromagnetic field.

1564
02:20:20,699 --> 02:20:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you happen to live in close proximity and you're a newborn or a young child, they're at higher risk for exposure.

1565
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:30,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some concern out there.

1566
02:20:30,821 --> 02:20:43,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was addressed by Eversource, or is being addressed, I should say, by Eversource, to try to mitigate that by putting certain barriers around the splicing and so forth.

1567
02:20:43,883 --> 02:20:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way I understand it, not all the electromagnetic

1568
02:20:46,895 --> 02:20:50,858
[SPEAKER_05]: magnetic fields can be eliminated.

1569
02:20:50,938 --> 02:20:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a concern, Mr. President.

1570
02:20:54,020 --> 02:21:04,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that we have a meeting on this with Eversource, with the city engineer, with the department of public works and with the mayor's office pretty quickly, Mr. President.

1571
02:21:04,487 --> 02:21:05,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the whole?

1572
02:21:05,707 --> 02:21:10,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the whole, because this project, when it starts, it's going to move forward quickly.

1573
02:21:11,191 --> 02:21:15,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And when residents can't get into their driveway because they're trenching in front of a driveway,

1574
02:21:16,164 --> 02:21:19,306
[SPEAKER_05]: for a period of time, it's going to be a concern.

1575
02:21:20,047 --> 02:21:28,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know what happened with some of the blasting that's going on on Winthrop Street, that communication sometimes doesn't get out in the manner it should.

1576
02:21:29,093 --> 02:21:38,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is only a reason why we should move forward with this and put forward the public awareness, Mr. President.

1577
02:21:39,083 --> 02:21:41,684
[SPEAKER_05]: that every resident should be getting notified.

1578
02:21:42,344 --> 02:21:58,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, that would be by motion, Mr. President, that, uh, all these particular traffic study noise impact be submitted to the council and that a committee of the whole be set up with the administration, the traffic engineer, DPW and Eversource, uh, to discuss, uh, this, this project.

1579
02:21:58,609 --> 02:21:59,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

1580
02:21:59,809 --> 02:22:00,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knife.

1581
02:22:01,109 --> 02:22:01,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

1582
02:22:01,649 --> 02:22:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing this issue forward.

1583
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:06,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's, uh, about time we start talking about this project.

1584
02:22:06,071 --> 02:22:07,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be right around the corner.

1585
02:22:07,755 --> 02:22:13,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly think that your resolution is one that's rooted in common sense, and it's something that we certainly need to look into.

1586
02:22:14,237 --> 02:22:19,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The question that I have is, would a committee of the whole be beneficial, or do you think that moving forward with a community meeting might be of help?

1587
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:26,862
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have a community meeting, then we can have Eversource come and give yet another presentation on the project, and then maybe have some input from the residents in the community as well.

1588
02:22:26,882 --> 02:22:33,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have our own questions, but sometimes I feel as though when we paint something as a committee of the whole, we have a lack of interest and a lack of involvement.

1589
02:22:33,668 --> 02:22:43,056
[SPEAKER_03]: If we paint something as a community meeting and we ask the individuals in the community to come out and express some of their concerns, we might get a better turnout and some more constructive involvement from the personnel in the community.

1590
02:22:43,636 --> 02:22:45,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the councilor's motion.

1591
02:22:45,217 --> 02:22:47,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I support it wholeheartedly the way he wants to go.

1592
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:48,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just merely a suggestion.

1593
02:22:51,863 --> 02:22:52,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do both for that matter.

1594
02:22:54,093 --> 02:22:57,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not opposed to a public hearing on that.

1595
02:22:58,215 --> 02:23:02,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing is I think there are a lot of issues that we really need to sit down and iron out.

1596
02:23:03,076 --> 02:23:10,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it is regarding the mitigation and other issues regarding the digging and so forth that may get lost.

1597
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:15,024
[SPEAKER_05]: at a public hearing, but I'm not opposed to doing either or both.

1598
02:23:15,064 --> 02:23:19,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we do the committee of the whole first and move forward as Councilor Marksley will get some of those technical questions answered.

1599
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:21,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we see fit, we can move forward with a community meeting.

1600
02:23:21,973 --> 02:23:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at some point in time, we're going to have to do it regardless.

1601
02:23:24,797 --> 02:23:25,117
Okay.

1602
02:23:25,277 --> 02:23:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1603
02:23:26,318 --> 02:23:27,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Russo.

1604
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:28,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you.

1605
02:23:28,741 --> 02:23:30,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm grateful for this presentation tonight.

1606
02:23:31,143 --> 02:23:45,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I will amend this paper that the director of the Board of Health be invited to attend the meeting and that she prepare herself by researching the impact of these electromagnetic fields.

1607
02:23:45,785 --> 02:23:52,087
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be disruptive to other equipment, power equipment, and personal health devices as well.

1608
02:23:52,628 --> 02:23:58,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the vulnerable among us need to be protected and educated in a special way.

1609
02:23:58,810 --> 02:23:59,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1610
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:10,674
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could ask my fellow councilors, seeing that we have a couple of pending council calls to email me your vacation schedules for July, so we can get this in as soon as possible.

1611
02:24:10,734 --> 02:24:14,956
[SPEAKER_07]: This way we can make sure everyone is able to attend the meeting.

1612
02:24:15,472 --> 02:24:21,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the fellow councilors could do that, the next couple of days so I can schedule something that's amicable to everybody.

1613
02:24:21,955 --> 02:24:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1614
02:24:22,756 --> 02:24:26,878
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

1615
02:24:28,659 --> 02:24:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice, by Councilor McLaren, all those in favor?

1616
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:32,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1617
02:24:34,142 --> 02:24:34,642
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

1618
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 by five, two offered by vice president marks.

1619
02:24:40,162 --> 02:24:44,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the council resolution tracking be discussed.

1620
02:24:45,204 --> 02:24:46,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice president marks.

1621
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1622
02:24:48,405 --> 02:24:48,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the.

1623
02:24:49,332 --> 02:24:56,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Council resolution tracking is a very important system that the city clerk keeps track of all of our resolutions.

1624
02:24:56,958 --> 02:25:17,993
[SPEAKER_05]: He puts a resolution number, he dates it, who it's offered by, the resolution, a little blurb on what the resolution is, who it's referred to, typically they're referred to the mayor, and then the mayor refers them to department heads or delegates them to wherever they need to go, and a date they're referred, Mr. President,

1625
02:25:18,373 --> 02:25:19,634
[SPEAKER_05]: and a date we get a response.

1626
02:25:20,534 --> 02:25:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And I happen to go through the latest list that the city clerk provided, and I'm a little troubled to see that some of the resolutions that we're offering as a council, we have yet to receive a department response.

1627
02:25:37,142 --> 02:25:41,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these are very important issues, Mr. President, and they date back.

1628
02:25:42,104 --> 02:25:43,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the list we got was from

1629
02:25:44,148 --> 02:25:48,169
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, January 3rd, 2017 to June 6th of this year.

1630
02:25:48,189 --> 02:25:52,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, there are many resolutions back in January.

1631
02:25:52,749 --> 02:25:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for instance, we had, uh, one that, uh, council set up a community meeting for how the city should be developed.

1632
02:26:00,491 --> 02:26:02,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, that has yet to be answered.

1633
02:26:02,991 --> 02:26:08,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we had one that was, uh, meeting with the developer of the Malden hospital site.

1634
02:26:09,372 --> 02:26:13,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that has yet to have any answer, uh, pop up community spaces.

1635
02:26:14,054 --> 02:26:16,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sent to OCD, never answered.

1636
02:26:17,697 --> 02:26:31,549
[SPEAKER_05]: MBTA idling buses at the corner of Winthrop and Plaisted, as far as this list shows, it was sent to the MBTA, but we have yet to get a response back on that, according to the resolution tracking.

1637
02:26:31,569 --> 02:26:40,537
[SPEAKER_05]: A plaque up at the high school, the William Edgley Memorial plaque, we asked the superintendent of schools,

1638
02:26:42,797 --> 02:26:56,040
[SPEAKER_05]: a business member that actually was here that left just a little while ago, that that plaque be refurbished, Mr. President, and replaced in an area that's prominent and not overgrown and unkept.

1639
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:00,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, it's in an area right now that's overgrown and unkept.

1640
02:27:00,921 --> 02:27:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had an issue that was sent regarding discussion of the freight trains traveling through West Medford.

1641
02:27:08,642 --> 02:27:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have yet to get a response from that.

1642
02:27:11,824 --> 02:27:16,706
[SPEAKER_05]: A cost estimate on repointing wall and replace wrought iron gates in Royal Park.

1643
02:27:17,526 --> 02:27:21,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yet to see a response from that that was offered by Councilor Knight, I believe.

1644
02:27:23,109 --> 02:27:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: An update on traffic improvements and pedestrian safety in Wellington Circle.

1645
02:27:28,051 --> 02:27:30,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet to get a department response on that.

1646
02:27:30,512 --> 02:27:34,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some important issues that we have yet to receive.

1647
02:27:34,914 --> 02:27:36,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And I offer this paper tonight, Mr. President,

1648
02:27:38,029 --> 02:27:49,094
[SPEAKER_05]: circle the wagons to make sure that when our papers are sent out, that if we don't get a response, that this council is on top of it requesting a response from the administration, Mr. President.

1649
02:27:49,414 --> 02:27:57,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes responses, even though there's a requirement by, I believe it's a city ordinance that requires a 10 day response,

1650
02:27:58,398 --> 02:28:06,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the response can merely be it's being sent to, uh, the department of engineering and then, uh, the chase is on.

1651
02:28:06,819 --> 02:28:10,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to wait for the report and that could take who knows how long.

1652
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:14,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not just pointing out engineering could be, could be any department.

1653
02:28:14,741 --> 02:28:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's crucial as a council, we stay on top of these and every time we get a council resolution tracking, I think we should make part of our committee, uh, you know, report or, uh, discussions, uh, a report back.

1654
02:28:28,703 --> 02:28:31,124
[SPEAKER_05]: to the mayor asking where these papers stand.

1655
02:28:31,444 --> 02:28:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the mayor should be tracking, these are her department heads that they're being referred to, and she should be tracking where they are and what the final destination and expected date is, Mr. President.

1656
02:28:43,429 --> 02:28:54,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that we follow up and ask that these papers that I brought forward tonight be reviewed again for a response from the city administration.

1657
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:01,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the resolution and second it.

1658
02:29:02,492 --> 02:29:10,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to ask my council colleague, Councilor Falco, through you if the tracking software is going to help in the way that our resolutions attract moving forward if he's aware.

1659
02:29:11,376 --> 02:29:11,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1660
02:29:12,377 --> 02:29:17,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank you for the question.

1661
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:24,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing is with the legislative software, you will actually follow the resolution from beginning to end.

1662
02:29:24,638 --> 02:29:25,698
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see it real time.

1663
02:29:25,738 --> 02:29:34,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see the handoffs, the dates, the times of when things were approved, what departments it was sent to, whether or not they were, you know, the questions were answered.

1664
02:29:35,181 --> 02:29:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all electronic.

1665
02:29:36,541 --> 02:29:37,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all online.

1666
02:29:37,321 --> 02:29:39,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nice thing is you'll be able to, it's all real time.

1667
02:29:39,222 --> 02:29:45,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you went in, you'd say, okay, this resolution on, I don't know, fire hydrants went to the water department.

1668
02:29:45,323 --> 02:29:49,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll actually see when they got it, whether or not they responded.

1669
02:29:49,644 --> 02:29:51,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if it follows up with like,

1670
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:52,992
[SPEAKER_02]: over time.

1671
02:29:53,332 --> 02:30:00,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It might follow up with, like, you know, if they don't respond within 10 days, maybe it'll ping them for, you know, a request or back.

1672
02:30:00,836 --> 02:30:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does track it.

1673
02:30:03,078 --> 02:30:04,258
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that it's online.

1674
02:30:04,298 --> 02:30:05,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds everybody accountable.

1675
02:30:06,019 --> 02:30:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think it's a good feature that adds a lot of transparency to the process.

1676
02:30:13,163 --> 02:30:16,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'll benefit everyone on this council.

1677
02:30:16,685 --> 02:30:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'll benefit everyone in the city.

1678
02:30:18,386 --> 02:30:20,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very transparent product that will help all of us.

1679
02:30:20,923 --> 02:30:21,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1680
02:30:21,925 --> 02:30:26,051
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1681
02:30:26,131 --> 02:30:26,772
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favour?

1682
02:30:26,792 --> 02:30:26,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1683
02:30:27,533 --> 02:30:28,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1684
02:30:28,735 --> 02:30:30,398
Motion to take current papers under suspension.

1685
02:30:31,179 --> 02:30:34,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1686
02:30:34,625 --> 02:30:35,286
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favour?

1687
02:30:35,706 --> 02:30:35,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1688
02:30:37,379 --> 02:30:47,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Marks being resolved that the sidewalk in front of the fire station engine two on Harvard Avenue be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1689
02:30:47,385 --> 02:30:48,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Mox.

1690
02:30:49,106 --> 02:30:51,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I don't know if people at home could see this.

1691
02:30:51,347 --> 02:30:56,630
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the actual sidewalk in front of engine two on Harvard Ave in West Bedford.

1692
02:30:57,310 --> 02:31:00,112
[SPEAKER_05]: It is crumbling at the very best.

1693
02:31:00,942 --> 02:31:07,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in deplorable condition, not only for the engines that are leaving Engine 2, but also pedestrians.

1694
02:31:07,925 --> 02:31:10,106
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a highly traversed area.

1695
02:31:10,706 --> 02:31:23,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, Mr. President, immediately, in the interest of public safety, as we heard from Councilor Lungo tonight regarding the budget, there was money left in accounts that were earmarked just for this particular purpose.

1696
02:31:24,151 --> 02:31:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And to see sidewalks like this, the condition, is unacceptable, Mr. President.

1697
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:38,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask immediately that this, the length of the sidewalk in front of engine two on Harvard Ave be totally replaced in the interest of public safety.

1698
02:31:39,339 --> 02:31:39,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1699
02:31:39,819 --> 02:31:40,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1700
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:44,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, this is an issue that we just addressed down on Riverside Avenue.

1701
02:31:44,123 --> 02:31:54,131
[SPEAKER_03]: About a year ago, I went down to the Riverside Avenue fire station with a mayor Burke to take a look at the same exact issue that was happening in the driveway apron at the fire station, Riverside Avenue.

1702
02:31:54,685 --> 02:32:03,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And after some discussion with the firefighters on duty, we've determined that it's attributable to the chains that they put on the tires of the trucks and the weight of the vehicle that comes down.

1703
02:32:03,869 --> 02:32:17,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that as we move forward and we look at these issues in the community, we look at the type of material that we're using on these driveway aprons in front of our fire stations, because it's clear that the concrete asphalt mix that we have right now cannot withstand the test of time.

1704
02:32:17,835 --> 02:32:18,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1705
02:32:18,775 --> 02:32:22,057
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Vice President Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1706
02:32:23,925 --> 02:32:26,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1707
02:32:26,186 --> 02:32:27,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Please call the roll.

1708
02:32:37,969 --> 02:32:38,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1709
02:32:38,950 --> 02:32:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Affirmative.

1710
02:32:40,870 --> 02:32:41,691

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1721
02:32:51,397 --> 02:32:51,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1722
02:32:51,758 --> 02:32:53,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1723
02:32:54,099 --> 02:32:55,439

1724
02:32:57,620 --> 02:32:59,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Dello Russo.

1725
02:33:00,762 --> 02:33:11,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offers sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Nalo, longtime secretary to the city clerk and register of voters.

1726
02:33:13,648 --> 02:33:14,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1727
02:33:15,818 --> 02:33:41,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, Mr. President, that we have a number of condolences on there tonight, but Rosemary was a longtime employee here in the city of Medford, worked, I think she may have been retired before Ed came to power, but under the previous regime, she was there, a wonderful woman, a good mother, and a devoted and active person in our community.

1728
02:33:41,584 --> 02:33:41,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1729
02:33:41,984 --> 02:33:44,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple of more, so if we could wait before we do this.

1730
02:33:45,572 --> 02:33:55,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered, 17556, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere and deepest condolences to the family of Joan Gorman.

1731
02:33:55,538 --> 02:34:05,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Gorman is the mother of Medford School Community member, Erin DiBenedetto.

[SPEAKER_07]: 17559, offered by President Caraviello and Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

1734
02:34:18,501 --> 02:34:21,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle is best remembered for his weekly TV show on Channel 3.

1735
02:34:22,324 --> 02:34:24,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Galusi family.

1736
02:34:25,307 --> 02:34:25,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1737
02:34:27,008 --> 02:34:35,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd just like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to David and Matt and Suzanne and the grandkids on the loss of Kyle.

1738
02:34:35,835 --> 02:34:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the last couple of years, it's been very tough for the Galusi family.

1739
02:34:39,518 --> 02:34:42,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt and Dave lost their mother about a year and a half ago, and they've lost their father.

1740
02:34:43,245 --> 02:34:43,865
[SPEAKER_03]: just this week.

1741
02:34:43,925 --> 02:34:47,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I'd like the council to join me in offering our condolences.

1742
02:34:47,228 --> 02:34:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Kyle was a great guy.

1743
02:34:48,588 --> 02:34:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd always, uh, see him up there on the corner of Winthrop street and Whitney road, uh, the corner of Blakely road and Whitney road, um, hanging around, sitting on the porch.

1744
02:34:56,974 --> 02:35:00,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's always the first one to come up to you and shake your hand and tell you a funny story.

1745
02:35:00,156 --> 02:35:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'll be sadly missed Mr. President.

1746
02:35:01,897 --> 02:35:04,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1747
02:35:05,539 --> 02:35:06,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1748
02:35:06,140 --> 02:35:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say, you know, uh, Kyle was a good friend of mine for many years and, um,

1749
02:35:10,501 --> 02:35:13,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year, I get the bag of tomatoes from Whitney Farm.

1750
02:35:14,042 --> 02:35:18,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And as they stop and I say, we were good friends over the years.

1751
02:35:19,082 --> 02:35:21,523
[SPEAKER_07]: A sad person to miss.

1752
02:35:21,543 --> 02:35:30,004
[SPEAKER_07]: 17558, offered by President Caraviello and Councilor Knight, we resolve that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sacred condolences to the family of Danny Menezes.

1753
02:35:30,785 --> 02:35:34,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Danny was a member of the Medford Historical Commission and owner of a Ray Auto Center.

1754
02:35:35,145 --> 02:35:39,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Danny is married to Mary Menezes in our Department of Public Works.

1755
02:35:39,908 --> 02:35:41,789
[SPEAKER_07]: His presence in our community will be missed.

1756
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:43,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1757
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:52,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think that if we're all going to sit back and talk about some legislation that the council passed this year, one of the things that we did was a demolition delay.

1758
02:35:53,014 --> 02:35:57,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you right now, I wouldn't have supported the paper if it weren't for Danny Manese.

1759
02:35:58,177 --> 02:35:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Danny's a great guy.

1760
02:35:59,157 --> 02:36:03,460
[SPEAKER_03]: He was supporting historical preservation in the city of Medford before it was the cool thing to do.

1761
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the forefront of this issue, Mr. President, for a number of years.

1762
02:36:08,773 --> 02:36:19,522
[SPEAKER_03]: in the historical society and his ability to find these old photographs and old articles about the city of Medford was something that I really enjoyed and he's gonna be sadly missed.

1763
02:36:19,902 --> 02:36:21,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I offer my condolences to Mary as well.

1764
02:36:21,924 --> 02:36:28,709
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a very hard worker who's done a great job up there in the DPW office and it's reflective on her work during the budget hearings that we just had.

1765
02:36:28,749 --> 02:36:30,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, she had every answer to every question.

1766
02:36:31,131 --> 02:36:38,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deep and sincere condolences to the Meneze family on the recent passing of Daniel.

1767
02:36:39,002 --> 02:36:41,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And I ask that tonight's meeting be held in Danny's memory.

1768
02:36:42,865 --> 02:36:44,246
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

1769
02:36:55,993 --> 02:36:56,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

1770
02:36:57,754 --> 02:37:06,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if I could, because I think it's only appropriate that I just found out that Kyle Galusi passed away.

1771
02:37:09,588 --> 02:37:15,031
[SPEAKER_05]: stunned, but he was a dear friend, Mr. President, to a lot of people.

1772
02:37:15,832 --> 02:37:36,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, someone that was very active in the community and during a lot of big issues in the community gave people a format when he ran a show on local cable access, whether it was the building of the new schools or the field of dreams or whatever the issue was, he was out in the forefront.

1773
02:37:37,297 --> 02:37:56,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when he opened up his globe on the Sunday morning, and you watched his show, he spoke truly about what was going on in this city, and spoke from a standpoint of a resident, and not a politician, not anything else, but a resident, and what the thoughts are on behalf of this city.

1774
02:37:57,365 --> 02:38:03,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am really taken back by the loss of him, and I wish his family well.

1775
02:38:05,025 --> 02:38:05,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, good man.

1776
02:38:05,725 --> 02:38:09,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say he'd come to my house and we'd all the time with his olive oil.

1777
02:38:09,347 --> 02:38:14,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And so with myself and my wife and the deck and the good man, he'll be missed there.

1778
02:38:15,789 --> 02:38:16,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1779
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could make a brief announcement.

1780
02:38:19,210 --> 02:38:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: This morning, I believe it was, I was driving to work and I was listening to the radio and on the radio, there was an individual that came on from Andover, Massachusetts.

1781
02:38:27,544 --> 02:38:36,408
[SPEAKER_03]: who had just appeared before the MBTA's fiscal control board relative to the issue of these communication towers that they're putting up along the commuter rail.

1782
02:38:37,228 --> 02:38:46,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And based upon the tone of the article and what was reported, the tone of the radio report and what was reported, it seemed as though the fiscal control board had some serious concerns over

1783
02:38:47,376 --> 02:38:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on with these towers, almost like they didn't know what was happening.

1784
02:38:51,379 --> 02:38:54,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to a report back from the MBTA on that, Mr. President.

1785
02:38:54,682 --> 02:38:57,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did want to provide some updates to the council based upon what I've learned.

1786
02:38:58,245 --> 02:39:02,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I've placed a call over to the legislative liaison at the MBTA to see if I can find out any more information.

1787
02:39:03,109 --> 02:39:08,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But just heard it this morning on the way to work, just last week or two weeks ago, we talked about the ordinance.

1788
02:39:08,353 --> 02:39:10,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that I want to keep in the forefront.

1789
02:39:10,434 --> 02:39:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something we all want to keep in the forefront because the 73-foot tower

1790
02:39:15,035 --> 02:39:21,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Right behind Tyler Ravel, Chawin Road, Medford isn't something that's going to add to our quality of life and it's certainly not going to be an improvement to our community.

1791
02:39:22,039 --> 02:39:25,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to make that brief announcement.

1792
02:39:25,021 --> 02:39:26,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be more information forthcoming.

1793
02:39:27,122 --> 02:39:27,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1794
02:39:28,362 --> 02:39:28,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Records.

1795
02:39:30,323 --> 02:39:30,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1796
02:39:31,404 --> 02:39:32,905
[SPEAKER_07]: For Pastor Councilor Dello Russo.

1797
02:39:33,345 --> 02:39:35,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo, how did you find the records?

1798
02:39:36,026 --> 02:39:38,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I read the records of the previous week's meeting.

1799
02:39:38,488 --> 02:39:40,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I find them to be in order and motion their approval.

1800
02:39:41,263 --> 02:39:41,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank you.

1801
02:39:41,905 --> 02:39:43,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight to adjourn.

1802
02:39:44,209 --> 02:39:45,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1803
02:39:46,394 --> 02:39:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1804
02:39:47,957 --> 02:39:48,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1805
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:50,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting adjourned.
