[SPEAKER_05]: Please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:45,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I, too, am introduced to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:50,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,122
[SPEAKER_05]: 15-448, offered by Counselor Knight.

22
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:57,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wait on that because his father's absent.

23
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We want his father to come in.

24
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Counselor Knight, be it resolved that the MBTA

25
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:14,401
[SPEAKER_05]: in follow-up to Council Paper 14-083, conduct a spring cleanup and beautification initiative at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station.

26
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

27
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

28
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:30,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Paper 14-083 was filed some months ago by Councilor Caviello, and Councilor Caviello was working very hard with the MBTA to get some beautification initiatives completed down at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station, Mr. President.

29
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,694
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the winter came and the winter left.

30
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:37,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are with the same exact West Medford commuter rail station that we had beforehand.

31
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:43,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I filed this resolution to start the conversation up again, to prompt the MBTA to come down there and do a spring cleanup.

32
00:01:44,059 --> 00:02:00,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to amend the resolution, Mr. President, because upon filing the resolution, I did get a couple of phone calls from area residents and business owners who have a concern about the, for lack of a better term, port-a-party that is up against the fence behind the Seafood Depot, or the Depot Station now, I guess it would be called.

33
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:04,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to see if maybe we can get that encapsulated or encased.

34
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:13,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my understanding after discussions with Karen Rose that the governmental entity is exempt from the local board of health's oversight.

35
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:24,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully this council will support my resolution and we can reach out to the MBTA and ask them to do a little bit of spring cleaning down there, Mr. President, and also do a beautification initiative to take care of that port-a-potty.

36
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:38,982
[SPEAKER_04]: According to Karen Rose, there was an attorney general's opinion that was issued some years ago that would exempt the state from local Board of Health oversight on their property.

37
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was based on a conversation I had with her today.

38
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:45,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what she told me.

39
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And that came right out of the host's mouth.

40
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:48,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

41
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to amend that also to ask for a copy of the ruling that makes the MBTA a sui iuris

42
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,215
[SPEAKER_05]: entity.

43
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:57,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

44
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's an attorney general's opinion.

45
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, sometime ago in the world order.

46
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:06,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, uh, amended by council and night council care of yellow.

47
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:06,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

48
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:11,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, Mr. President, you know, um, I thank council night for bringing this back up again.

49
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:26,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I, you know, I, I worked diligently with, you know, uh, Senator Jen's office and some people from the T and, um, part of the thing was, you know, we, we did have some, we did, we did get some cleanups and painting and stuff done, but, um, I think part of the problem was,

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,242
[SPEAKER_13]: The T has got a problem with how much money they can spend there.

51
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:49,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, you're only allowed to spend so much of what the property is valued at, and anything over that now means going into another level, because obviously the station is not handicap accessible.

52
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:56,515
[SPEAKER_13]: But last time we tried to get some smaller projects done, and some of the people weren't happy with some of the small projects.

53
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:05,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I would urge when we meet again, you know, let's take what we can get from the T and the small, let's see, no matter how small it is, and then we can go back again and ask.

54
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:18,263
[SPEAKER_13]: But to try to get it done in a big package, because they say it takes them over their thresholds for the value of the property, and it now turns into a $14, $15 million project.

55
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:19,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

56
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:22,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight as amended, all those in favor?

57
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:22,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

58
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

59
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:25,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

60
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,524
[SPEAKER_05]: 15-449 offered by Councilor Knight.

61
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:40,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Be resolved that the Board of Health, in follow-up to paper 14-708, propose a draft ordinance to regulate the sale and use of electronic cigarettes in the city of Medford.

62
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:41,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

63
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:43,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

64
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:53,460
[SPEAKER_04]: In recent discussions with the Board of Health, I have learned that they have filed some regulations that have strengthened the controls surrounding electronic cigarettes.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,922
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they're not necessarily where they need to be.

66
00:04:56,503 --> 00:05:04,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm filing this resolution and I'm asking that the Board of Health take a look at the current ordinance and the current regulations that are in place and do their best to strengthen them.

67
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:10,610
[SPEAKER_04]: In our packets this evening, Mr. President, we have correspondence from the Coalition for Responsible Retailing.

68
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:19,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Coalition for Responsible Retailing does come out with a certain number of recommendations relative to the retailing of electronic cigarettes and tobacco products, Mr. President.

69
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:25,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd ask that this document be included as part of the research when the Board of Health does sit down to take a look at this.

70
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:31,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

71
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:32,666
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

72
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

73
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,153
[SPEAKER_05]: 15-450, offered by Councilor Knight.

74
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the other- Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution at this time.

75
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:48,739
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to withdraw by Councilor Knight.

76
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: 15-451, offered by Councilor Marks.

77
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:55,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Eversource Electrical Project, which extends 3.2 miles underground

78
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,679
[SPEAKER_05]: through Medford be discussed.

79
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:11,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, just before you begin your presentation on this matter, I was contacted by the lead figure or representative for Eversource on this project.

80
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:19,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's asked to be present at next week's council meeting to present to the council and to ask any questions.

81
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:26,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if that will influence your desire to speak on this matter tonight to any extent.

82
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:38,500
[SPEAKER_05]: and perhaps allow them to petition us through the clerk to address the council and to have the opportunity to address all the questions that we have with themselves here.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

84
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:41,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:46,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of my resolution tonight was to request that Eversource appear before the council.

86
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's good news.

87
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:55,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, there was an open house last night at the high school, um, regarding this particular project.

88
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:05,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess residents who had concerns or questions could have attended the meeting last night, although it wasn't well publicized, in my opinion.

89
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:23,758
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I could, Mr. President, because this is a project that many people are not aware of in the community, and it's going to have a devastating impact on the roadway throughout much of our area.

90
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:30,801
[SPEAKER_12]: and expected to last upwards of 8 to 10 months of construction.

91
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:42,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I think it's important that at least it be brought up tonight and the council can ask questions regarding this next week when they present to us formally.

92
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:54,054
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I could, Mr. President, Eversource, formerly NSTAR, is proposing to install a new 115-kilovolt underground electricity transmission line

93
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:59,907
[SPEAKER_12]: and an eight-mile route connecting the Woburn substation to the Mystic substation in Everett.

94
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:14,237
[SPEAKER_12]: The Meffitt portion of the proposed route is about 3.2 miles long and extends north to south from the Winchester line on Winthrop Street to the Somerville line on Mystic Ave.

95
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:21,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting at the Winchester line, the proposed route follows Winthrop Street south through the rotary

96
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:26,736
[SPEAKER_12]: at High Street and then under Mystic Valley Parkway.

97
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:32,898
[SPEAKER_12]: It then turns east to follow South Street to Main Street slash Mystic Ave.

98
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:37,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we'll continue down Mystic Ave into Somerville and then to Boston.

99
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,222
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll again cross the Mystic River to finally reach the Mystic substation in Everett.

100
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,384
[SPEAKER_12]: In most places, the plan is to bury a line eight inches in a trench

101
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:55,989
[SPEAKER_12]: about two feet wide, parallel to the existing electrical lines under the streets.

102
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,433
[SPEAKER_12]: The proposed project is constructed to begin sometime in 2017 and 2018.

103
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:16,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I had also general project information, and I wanted to just personally thank Mr. Krause for providing this, but it goes on to say that

104
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:34,582
[SPEAKER_12]: The 8-inch steel pipe is going to be buried under our street, which will also be accompanied by 2-inch diameter polyvinyl chloride, which is PVC conduits, for relay and communication cables.

105
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:41,146
[SPEAKER_12]: And they will be installed in a normal 24-inch wide by 60 inches deep.

106
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:44,348
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be 2 feet wide, 5 feet deep.

107
00:09:45,562 --> 00:10:05,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, Mr. President, which I found quite interesting, is they're going to have to also put roughly 17 manholes, create 17 new manholes throughout this particular stretch of the cable.

108
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:13,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And the manholes will be used to splicing cables, line testing, and maintenance.

109
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:19,425
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're going to be put approximately every 2,000 to 2,400 linear feet.

110
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:33,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure what 3.2 miles is in the city of Meffitt, but out of these 17 manholes, they're going to start from Woburn all the way to Charlestown, which I think this is going to end up roughly.

111
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:42,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be concerned about, if we can make this part of the report, how many manholes will have to be done in the city of Meffitt

112
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,676
[SPEAKER_12]: for this 3.2 miles.

113
00:10:45,856 --> 00:11:00,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, Mr. President, Eversource will be doing roughly, in Winchester, 2.3 miles from what I heard, not compared to our 3.2 miles.

114
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:05,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So our project is about a third larger than the Winchester project.

115
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:09,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're scheduled to last roughly six months.

116
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,749
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I said eight to 10 months,

117
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:19,204
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just a ballpark I'm coming up with based on how long it's going to take Winchester for a smaller magnitude.

118
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:30,728
[SPEAKER_12]: As part of this particular program, from what I've been told from representatives of Eversource, the city of Meffitt has not asked for any type of mitigation.

119
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:38,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's important that we as a council initiate this next week.

120
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would also offer that, Mr. Clerk, as an amendment to this paper.

121
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:45,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So my first amendment is, how many manhole covers will exist?

122
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:51,500
[SPEAKER_12]: My second amendment is, what mitigation will be available for this community?

123
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:59,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And a third issue that I wanted to bring up is, what is the length that this project will take?

124
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:11,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Will there be, the fourth one, will there be public meetings in the community to discuss this project, even though it's

125
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:19,604
[SPEAKER_12]: A few years out, this project is going to encompass a lot of our roads, digging up a lot of our streets.

126
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:27,869
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we witnessed in the past, our streets never go back to the condition they were originally in when work like this takes place.

127
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,792
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to make sure that we are protected as residents.

128
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:39,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Another issue is the hours of operation that work will take place on these particular lines.

129
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:58,655
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, that the, uh, ever source as well as the city of method appoint a 24 hour hotline and also clerk of the works to protect the interest of the residents and, uh, our city streets.

130
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:08,420
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm happy to hear that, uh, cause I was going to propose that they appear before us, uh, at an upcoming meeting.

131
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm happy to hear that the council president was contacted by ever source.

132
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:34,957
[SPEAKER_12]: regarding this project, and that the council be furnished with any documentation that was presented at the open house last night, because I have not received any paperwork other than the paperwork that I looked up and also the paperwork I received from Mr. Krause.

133
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:42,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there were alternative routes that were discussed

134
00:13:44,303 --> 00:14:00,888
[SPEAKER_12]: And one that I posed that was asked last night was why couldn't we go along I-93, where I-93 goes through Woburn, it goes through Winchester, it goes through Method up to where you'd want to connect into Everett.

135
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:08,010
[SPEAKER_12]: To me it would make sense, less disruption for the residents of our community.

136
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,735
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was told that the Woban substation is on the west side of the fells.

137
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:24,501
[SPEAKER_12]: And they cannot access the wiring from that side of the fells.

138
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:27,744
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why they couldn't use an alternative route.

139
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:35,649
[SPEAKER_12]: And they did mention another route that talked about going through the heart of the Lawrence of States and going, I

140
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,981
[SPEAKER_12]: believe down Governor's Ave.

141
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:45,923
[SPEAKER_12]: And the route was actually much longer than the existing route, which didn't make much sense.

142
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:50,885
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I was looking for a route outside of our city and a route, a smaller route.

143
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,325
[SPEAKER_12]: So that didn't make much sense.

144
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:57,787
[SPEAKER_12]: But I look forward to the questioning next week and also the notification.

145
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:05,330
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask, Mr. President, and maybe through your leadership as the president, this is an extremely important issue, even though it's two years out.

146
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:17,705
[SPEAKER_12]: that a reverse 9-1-1 call go out to residents that will give them ample opportunity to appear if they can or watch if they'd like the council meeting next Tuesday to get information on this.

147
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:24,166
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would ask that we put out a reverse 9-1-1 call.

148
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Reverse 9-1-1, Mr. Clark.

149
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Request to the Chief of Police and Captain Merrick.

150
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:32,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

151
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:33,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

152
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:37,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, and I want to commend Councillor Marks for bringing this up this evening.

153
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:48,194
[SPEAKER_15]: This is certainly going to have a major impact on our community, as is the Credit Bridge, which will be going on roughly around the same time, I assume.

154
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:55,500
[SPEAKER_15]: But that project is so convoluted as far as timelines and timeframes, I'm just assuming at this point.

155
00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:00,244
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, I like Councillor Marks, all his recommendations.

156
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:02,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately,

157
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,350
[SPEAKER_15]: According to the Councillor, there's no mitigation.

158
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:11,694
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past, Algonquin Gas paid mitigation, but I'm not sure of the specifics of that project.

159
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,035
[SPEAKER_15]: But if that's something we can look into.

160
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,297
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want to thank the Councillor for bringing it up.

161
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:29,224
[SPEAKER_15]: On a side note, if the Councillor doesn't mind, or I can make it a separate paper, can we ask for the MBTA to come in at this point with another

162
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:37,267
[SPEAKER_15]: idea slash proposal for moving the bus stop across from Medford Auto School down here in Medford Square.

163
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:42,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to get that done prior to the construction commencing.

164
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,089
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to be.

165
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of clarification.

166
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of clarification, Councilor Pinto.

167
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Pursuant to what Councilor Camuso, I had called him up and asked him about that, that resolution.

168
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe you brought it up maybe almost two months ago.

169
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:52,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

170
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,291
[SPEAKER_17]: They said they never got it.

171
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,272
[SPEAKER_17]: They never got the resolution.

172
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:57,572
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we need to ask again.

173
00:16:58,752 --> 00:16:59,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you send that out?

174
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:09,876
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I believe the resolution was to have it be sent to the MBTA, to their director of public relations for the purposes of can the bus stop be moved.

175
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:11,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon me?

176
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,179
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it at?

177
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Transportation committee?

178
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge.

179
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:28,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Our Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge, OK.

180
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:45,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Either way, it's not going to be fair to the consumers and the people that utilize public transportation to find out two days before a shovel's on the ground that now they have to go to place X or Y or Z to catch transportation to get to work.

181
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could call that Committee of the Whole in a fairly reasonable time.

182
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Last but not least, if we could also send to the Committee of the Whole

183
00:17:54,347 --> 00:18:22,887
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a paper this evening, and if we want to bring this up at a different agenda item, I would put something on, but if we can, if the Councillor sees it as fit to just refer the paper from Cassandra Koudelidis, telling us that at roughly $4 million to resurface and to mill and pave Boston Ave, Forest Street, High Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, the part that the city owns, as well as Riverside Avenue, Salem Street,

184
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:28,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I, as one member of this council, we have a lot of money in reserves right now.

185
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:33,614
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have a great bond rating due to the good fiscal management that's been going on here.

186
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:38,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I think these roads need to be resurfaced once and for all, and I think that's a project.

187
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:51,508
[SPEAKER_15]: I know as one member of the council, I would support a bond initiative or using some of the reserves for the $4 million to do a complete infrastructure improval

188
00:18:52,505 --> 00:19:01,632
[SPEAKER_15]: improvement rather on these streets and these are main thoroughfares and it actually equates to what did she say as far as mileage?

189
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,093
[SPEAKER_15]: 58,000 linear feet.

190
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:12,680
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's 265,000 square feet of paving and milling that would take place and it's something that I think we need to do.

191
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:19,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the good question would be to ask the engineer is this something that we should wait to do until after the project that Councillor Marks is referring to?

192
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:35,871
[SPEAKER_15]: two years down the road, or is it, because I'm not an engineer, I don't know, they talked about five feet underground and stuff, but is it five feet, I don't know, so would it make sense to do a major initiative like this after this project, or wait until?

193
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:39,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we talk to the city engineer, and then call the appropriate meeting.

194
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:42,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you mind if that's a B paper, Councilor, or do you want me to put it on?

195
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:46,318
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all part of the main paper.

196
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:49,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you again to Councilor Marks for bringing this important item up.

197
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much to the both of you.

198
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

199
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Mox.

200
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, would like to add a couple of recommendations, and I will be short.

201
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: The first recommendation, Mr. President, that I think is important would be that Eversource provide access to a website for the goings-on of the construction here in Medford, so that a resident can go right on their computer and type up what's going on and be updated real-time, whether it's a Twitter feed or a daily update, something like that.

202
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:22,084
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow residents the prompt and quick sharing of information.

203
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:46,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The other item, Mr. President, that I'd like to see happen and that I'd like to recommend would be when, in fact, the road is closed up, that the repairs are done curb to curb, Mr. President, which would lead me into Councilor Camuso's amendment and the resolution that he refers to in the paper in response that we got back that Councilor Camuso refers to was a request that I made to determine what the cost would be to resurface all our emergency arteries here in the city.

204
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And in looking at this Eversource project, I don't think that it's going to go across every single major artery in our city.

205
00:20:54,751 --> 00:21:02,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, I don't see any reason why we would need to wait to begin repairing our infrastructure and resurfacing our roadways here in the city of Medford.

206
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I think right now, with all the things that are going on in the city, the number one most important priority in the city should be repairing our roadways.

207
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a quality of life issue.

208
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:12,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a safety issue.

209
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, and quite frankly, it's very difficult for people to be happy with the services that are being provided when they come over from Malden on a clean street and a smooth street, and they don't even have to see the sign that says, welcome to Medford.

210
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit the road and they know.

211
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:35,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, right now I think the number one priority in this city should be taking a look at resurfacing the roadways because it's causing inordinate damage to people's cars.

212
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:39,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It's making traversing the roadways a public safety issue, Mr. President.

213
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:40,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Councilor Mox.

214
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:41,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

215
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:42,984
[SPEAKER_04]: for bringing these issues forward.

216
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:47,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I support this measure in 110%, Mr. President, and I move for approval.

217
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:53,432
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of, on Councilor Mark's motion as amended, Councilor Caviello.

218
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:54,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

219
00:21:55,333 --> 00:22:07,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with Councilor Camuso, and I think maybe we should wait for the engineer to see which streets are going to be affected, and I'd hate to see them dug up twice, because usually when they dig them up and put them back, they don't do a good job.

220
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:10,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, on the letter here,

221
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:19,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Could I recall that Representative Donato received funding for Riverside Avenue through the transportation bond bill that was filed last year?

222
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:20,604
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't go through.

223
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:21,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

224
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:22,285
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't go through.

225
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:23,405
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't go through?

226
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,326
[SPEAKER_16]: The bond bill didn't go through.

227
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:31,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, according to the representative, the money is sitting at the state house waiting for us to go and get it as part of the garage package.

228
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,610
[SPEAKER_13]: No, garage didn't go through either.

229
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,752
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not what the representative says, but Mr. President, if you could check if

230
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,308
[SPEAKER_13]: if that funding ever went through, through the bond bill.

231
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:45,668
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll check on that for you.

232
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:46,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

233
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:46,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

234
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

235
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:52,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

236
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:53,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

237
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:09,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Just regarding the underground electricity proposal, I think we have to be mindful, and I know Councilor Knight has brought this up on several occasions, that Winthrop Circle has already been disrupted

238
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:24,655
[SPEAKER_12]: for many, many months regarding the drainage and gas projects that have been going on and still going on, right, in that particular area, and coupled with this potential project that's going to run right through that area again.

239
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:36,603
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think it's important we as a community, and I'm not sure what we can do to stand up and say, you know what, enough's enough with this particular digging and so forth.

240
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:38,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I also found, you know,

241
00:23:39,414 --> 00:24:00,184
[SPEAKER_12]: When I looked at the general project information, I'm not opposed to, because it says the project's purpose is to improve reliability electricity transmission within the greater Boston area and to address thermal overloads within the existing electric transmission line in combination with other planned greater Boston area transmission upgrades.

242
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:05,147
[SPEAKER_12]: The project provides a system with substantial flexibility to accommodate load growth.

243
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:25,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not opposed to expanding the electricity and the ability to gain electricity north of Boston, but I'm not sure why it has to be done on the backs of every resident in this community and the inconvenience of digging our roads and digging trenches constantly in our community.

244
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:33,283
[SPEAKER_12]: And in my opinion, to get very little, if anything in return, is troublesome to me.

245
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:35,464
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would hope that

246
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:52,542
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever the decision is that we play a vital role at the table in deciding what the impact is going to be in this community and how much we think we can take as a community on the vitality and also the integrity of our neighborhoods.

247
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,944
[SPEAKER_12]: And that should be the utmost importance of all of us.

248
00:24:56,004 --> 00:25:05,488
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to make that point that the residents on Winthrop and High Street and that whole general area have been going through all this construction

249
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:12,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And to say in another two years you're going to be facing something similar is a problem, Mr. President.

250
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:15,538
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we'll get more answers next Tuesday.

251
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:16,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We all look forward to that.

252
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So, on the motion for approval, all those in favor?

253
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

254
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

255
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:24,143
[SPEAKER_05]: 15-453 offered by Councilor Penta.

256
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:33,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the ongoing school sex survey be questioned as it is being challenged by mass resistance.

257
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:34,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

258
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:44,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, before I speak, we have in attendance this evening the president of the state organization from Mass Resistance, Mr. Brian Kamenker.

259
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:51,886
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to have him come forward and give his reasoning first before I make my comments.

260
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:59,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir, please come forward and state your name and address for the record.

261
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And are you an official of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

262
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,360
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

263
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,461
[SPEAKER_05]: He's part of a state organization.

264
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,361
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Brian Kamaker.

265
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,442
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 84 Stanaford Street in Newton.

266
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:24,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Our organization, Mass Resistance, is a pro-family group in Massachusetts, and we've been active for over 20 years.

267
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:29,127
[SPEAKER_18]: We advocate for parental rights in the public schools.

268
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:34,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm considered an expert myself in parental notification,

269
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:51,210
[SPEAKER_18]: I wrote the Parental Notification Law in Massachusetts, Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 32A, which I have here, which deals with parental notification in the public schools.

270
00:26:53,631 --> 00:27:01,876
[SPEAKER_18]: This past week, I testified before in the State House for a bill that we have, H-283, regarding

271
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,094
[SPEAKER_18]: surveys that are being given across the state.

272
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:24,922
[SPEAKER_18]: These are these youth risk behavior surveys and other surveys which are created by the state of Massachusetts and they're given by the various cities and towns throughout Massachusetts in middle schools and high schools.

273
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:31,125
[SPEAKER_18]: These surveys have very graphic sexual and other kinds of

274
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:32,815
[SPEAKER_18]: disturbing questions.

275
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:48,139
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, the testimony that I and several other parents gave was so disturbing that it was covered by the local Fox News, WRK Radio, and WGBH.

276
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:57,142
[SPEAKER_18]: The questions on these surveys given statewide in middle school and high school have to do with

277
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:10,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Suicide, whether you've contemplated suicide, how many times you've had sexual intercourse.

278
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:18,441
[SPEAKER_18]: For instance, how many times in the past three months, in the past three months, how many people have you had sexual intercourse with?

279
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,543
[SPEAKER_18]: And the answers go from zero to six or more.

280
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:25,045
[SPEAKER_18]: How old were you when you first had sexual intercourse?

281
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:25,626
[SPEAKER_18]: 11 to 17.

282
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:33,117
[SPEAKER_18]: When you have sexual intercourse, do you drink alcohol?

283
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:45,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Many of these questions have to do with drugs, have to do with family life, have to do with illegal activities, such as do you carry a gun?

284
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're very, very disturbing.

285
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:56,008
[SPEAKER_18]: The problem with these questions is, and I had to deal with them when my own kids were in school, is that parents are very,

286
00:28:57,412 --> 00:29:03,914
[SPEAKER_18]: almost never notified about this, and it's very difficult for them to see the test beforehand.

287
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:06,835
[SPEAKER_18]: There are also local tests.

288
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:13,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a survey here that was given here in Medford, which I received from a parent here in Medford.

289
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:18,138
[SPEAKER_18]: This was given in 2013, grade six through 12.

290
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:25,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the questions on this Medford test, and I'll leave all these tests for you, have to do with

291
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:31,432
[SPEAKER_18]: How many times have you used cocaine in the past 30 days?

292
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:35,174
[SPEAKER_18]: And the answer goes from zero to 40 or more times.

293
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:40,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Marijuana, heroin, LSD, ecstasy, things like that.

294
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:46,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the other questions have to do with depression.

295
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:49,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes I think life is not worth it, yes or no.

296
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,421
[SPEAKER_18]: At times I think I'm no good at all.

297
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:56,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Questions about your family life.

298
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's some questions.

299
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you feel close to your mother?

300
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:06,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you share your thoughts and feelings with your mother?

301
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you enjoy spending time with your mother?

302
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you enjoy spending time with your father?

303
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:12,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Things like that.

304
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,700
[SPEAKER_18]: These questions are very intrusive.

305
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:23,546
[SPEAKER_18]: And how it affects a child, especially some of these younger children, is very disturbing to parents and others.

306
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:32,968
[SPEAKER_18]: The parent, in this case, only found out about this test because she made an effort to get it.

307
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:35,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, she wouldn't have known.

308
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:51,236
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we are hoping here is that various city councils, such as yourselves, will send a message to the state legislature and saying that, you know, we want this bill passed.

309
00:30:55,089 --> 00:31:04,377
[SPEAKER_18]: you're passing this resolution, a city council rather than a school committee will lend great credibility to this.

310
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:09,121
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to thank you for giving me permission to speak.

311
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:11,423
[SPEAKER_18]: And I could certainly take any questions that you have.

312
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:17,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I want to thank the president for being here.

313
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:20,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the bill, the intent of the bill needs to be said.

314
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,331
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to protect school children.

315
00:31:21,728 --> 00:31:28,353
[SPEAKER_17]: from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without parental knowledge.

316
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:36,019
[SPEAKER_17]: The surveys also ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues.

317
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,382
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the legislation that House Bill number 382 describes itself to.

318
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:46,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I have no problem as a city councilor, and hopefully my council colleagues would be supportive of this.

319
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:48,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's fair to say

320
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:54,982
[SPEAKER_17]: There was an equal representation from both Democrats and Republicans on Beacon Hill who have signed on to support this bill.

321
00:31:55,882 --> 00:32:03,487
[SPEAKER_17]: The piece of legislation that you're talking about dating back to, was it 1975, 1978 that you wrote it?

322
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:05,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

323
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:12,232
[SPEAKER_18]: The legislation, the current law, was passed in 1996 and signed by Bill Weld.

324
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:12,232
1996.

325
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:18,396
[SPEAKER_17]: And that piece of legislation is very explicit as it relates to surveys being disseminated by the public schools.

326
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:28,141
[SPEAKER_17]: for which parental notification needs to be given before the child either takes the survey or has the opt-out provision that they could take the survey.

327
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:28,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

328
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:35,023
[SPEAKER_18]: The current law, unfortunately, does not include surveys, which is why we have this new bill before the state house.

329
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:42,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And the new bill would require parental opt-in, that is written permission, for these kinds of surveys.

330
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:47,708
[SPEAKER_17]: It's disturbing, and not to be repetitive, but when they ask questions, how old were you when you first had

331
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,961
[SPEAKER_17]: sex, annual, oral, vagina, for the first time.

332
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:55,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it says, you know, in the past three months, how many people have you had sex with?

333
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:59,263
[SPEAKER_17]: And it goes on to talk about whether you've taken cocaine, heroin.

334
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:02,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also talks about, do your parents text while they drive?

335
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:04,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a whole host of issues.

336
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:17,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe, if I understand it correctly in reading the bill and speaking to folks up in the Statehouse on the legislative committee, their concern is when a child goes to school, it's got to be more than making the child be physically safe.

337
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:25,447
[SPEAKER_17]: The child now has to be psychologically, emotionally not disturbed because of going to school and taking these type of surveys.

338
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:32,351
[SPEAKER_17]: And so to do that, they feel that this type of legislation would at least put the parent on an equal playing field.

339
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,972
[SPEAKER_17]: At least they would be advised of it.

340
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:38,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Now here in the city of Medford, I know you said, I think the survey was given in 2013.

341
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:44,758
[SPEAKER_17]: And some parents, again, once they find out after the fact, it's too late after the fact.

342
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:51,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I think another problem with these surveys, and some of these kids who are much younger, when they go to answer it, they may not know how to answer it.

343
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:57,747
[SPEAKER_17]: And they may just be writing all kinds of numbers that can escalate, yeah, 1, 5, 4, without really knowing.

344
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they don't even understand what the questions mean.

345
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:04,311
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you get somebody in the fourth, fifth, and the sixth grade to understand all of this?

346
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:09,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, today, they may be more advanced because of what's on television and what's in the movies and stuff like that.

347
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: But some of this stuff is really personal.

348
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:13,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's something that is a parental responsibility.

349
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,021
[SPEAKER_17]: It's their responsibility to make sure that their child understands what's on here if they are going to take it.

350
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:23,282
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, it's not appropriate for the schools.

351
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:33,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it's appropriate for any school, public, private, or whatever, to make any decision on behalf of something that a parent has a responsibility and should have control over.

352
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:39,326
[SPEAKER_17]: A kid should not have to go to school, have that survey, and have the teacher say, we have to take this survey.

353
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:43,727
[SPEAKER_17]: And the parents have absolutely no idea on that particular day that that survey was given.

354
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:46,165
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's wrong.

355
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:49,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And I applaud you, and I applaud your organization and your efforts.

356
00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:52,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, there's a state rep up from Lowell.

357
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:54,091
[SPEAKER_17]: His name is Randy Mom.

358
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:58,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe he's a foreigner who immigrated here to this country, and unfortunate enough.

359
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:07,760
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, this type of a survey is almost communistic, because he comes from a country, I believe it was Cambodia, and these are the type of questions that they would have to deal with.

360
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:11,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you were referring to the state rep from Lowell recently.

361
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:16,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, he was a committee member, and he heard the testimony, and that was his reaction.

362
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:16,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

363
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:27,718
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that being said, Mr. President, I believe both chairpresidents from the House and Senate are not only in favor of it, but they appreciate the testimony that was given because it's being talked about.

364
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:32,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe this can be sent back to the State Department of Education that you cannot.

365
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:37,605
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if you want to have these type of surveys to go out, communities and parents

366
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,323
[SPEAKER_17]: need to be informed ahead of time.

367
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:42,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The parent needs to see the survey, not be informed.

368
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:43,026
[SPEAKER_17]: They need to see the survey.

369
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:44,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want your child to take the survey?

370
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And either they opt out or they opt in, one way or the other.

371
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:53,254
[SPEAKER_17]: But for what purpose it serves, I don't know, other than the fact that you're going to have some of these results turn around.

372
00:35:53,274 --> 00:36:01,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I understand it correctly, in some cities and towns, these surveys were supposed to be anonymous, if I understood it correctly, but some people were identified by a number.

373
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

374
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:12,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I was told that in Medford, this was what I was told by this mother who gave me this survey, was that the surveys had the student number on it, and they were passed out that way.

375
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:16,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And that doesn't speak well for a school system that allows that.

376
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:23,724
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would move, and again, I would hope that the city council would support House Bill 382.

377
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:25,205
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll read it again.

378
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:31,966
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to protect schoolchildren from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without

379
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,079
[SPEAKER_17]: parental knowledge.

380
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,663
[SPEAKER_17]: These surveys also seek to ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues.

381
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:42,044
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's House Bill 382.

382
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,005
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the bill.

383
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,806
[SPEAKER_17]: It's up in — there was heard on, I believe, on May 6th.

384
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:48,727
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a full House.

385
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:59,753
[SPEAKER_17]: You had — you had mothers there, you had single parents there, over and beyond mass resistance, and you had legislatures who spoke white, quite frankly, in favor of this because

386
00:37:00,123 --> 00:37:02,763
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this is something that just needs to be stopped before it gets out of hand.

387
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:05,284
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the motion.

388
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,924
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the motion on the motion.

389
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:08,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Carvio.

390
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

391
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:18,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I thank council for bringing this up because, uh, some years ago I had a daughter that was involved, wasn't a written survey.

392
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:27,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an individual survey where they personally ask questions and they asked questions that were totally inappropriate of a third for a third grader.

393
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:29,028
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were, they were asking personal questions.

394
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:30,993
[SPEAKER_13]: about their home life, their parents.

395
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:40,517
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I would hope this stops, especially with the younger kids who don't really know the difference of the questions they're answering.

396
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:42,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I applaud your efforts.

397
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a text before us, Mr. Counselor Penta?

398
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:51,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this is what the bill is, in essence.

399
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:51,643
[SPEAKER_17]: It's right there.

400
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I just read it to you what the gut of the bill is.

401
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:57,706
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion of Counselor Penta?

402
00:37:58,573 --> 00:37:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

403
00:38:00,354 --> 00:38:01,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Camuto.

404
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:03,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

405
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:05,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a quick question.

406
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:11,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, are you a volunteer at Mass Resistance, or are you a paid consultant or an employee?

407
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a paid employee.

408
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the president.

409
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry?

410
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,781
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the president.

411
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a paid employee.

412
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:19,682
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

413
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:25,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mass Resistance, I've known about it a little bit.

414
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:31,556
[SPEAKER_15]: exactly what type of things do you guys lobby behind, and it's mostly family issues, is that correct?

415
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:32,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, yeah.

416
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:36,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Our original name was Parents' Rights Coalition.

417
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:40,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Mass resistance is sort of a catchy name.

418
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:44,324
[SPEAKER_18]: We changed that maybe, oh, I don't know, eight or nine years ago.

419
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:48,586
[SPEAKER_18]: But our actual legal name is Parents' Rights Coalition.

420
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,528
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the official name.

421
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:53,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the Parents' Rights Coalition,

422
00:38:55,568 --> 00:39:05,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it under them, I think it was under that name, that you were strong opposition to the same-sex marriage and put up on Beacon Hill and it was brought forward.

423
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:06,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

424
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:07,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that that organization or the new one?

425
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:11,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we were also involved with that also.

426
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we were opposed to same-sex marriage.

427
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:15,645
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the same organization.

428
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:18,628
[SPEAKER_15]: No, mass resistance is very much

429
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:23,622
[SPEAKER_15]: behind in opposition to same-sex marriage.

430
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:28,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe as recent as within the last few weeks with the court case up in Washington, D.C.

431
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:29,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

432
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:30,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that's correct.

433
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:31,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

434
00:39:31,408 --> 00:39:33,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So, all right.

435
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:39,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to get a better understanding on what we're looking at supporting this evening, Mr. President.

436
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:45,340
[SPEAKER_15]: And quite honestly, I don't know much about the bill.

437
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,202
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Councilor Knight alluded to a few weeks ago,

438
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:55,592
[SPEAKER_15]: The democratic process, as you know, it can be a bill that's submitted one way, and by the end, by the time it hits the governor's desk, it's totally different.

439
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the democratic and legislative process.

440
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,775
[SPEAKER_15]: So, at this point, I will not be supporting this this evening.

441
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Just as a point of... And thank you very much for... Oh, yeah.

442
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:11,658
[SPEAKER_18]: This bill, as you said, does have equal Democratic and Republican support.

443
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:18,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that the legislative process, you can start out with the text and the verbiage of one bill being

444
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,844
[SPEAKER_15]: A, B, C, D, and then by the end of it, it's totally extrapolated, things added, things taken out.

445
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:36,393
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand, and I have my own personal feelings about the surveys in the public schools, but I'm certainly not going to take a vote based upon my own personal feelings, number one.

446
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:41,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And number two, I just, I don't know where it's going.

447
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:48,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I would feel better seeing how it comes out of committee, if it comes out of committee, and then saying whether we support it or not.

448
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:54,381
[SPEAKER_15]: I know in the past, some of the initiatives that mass resistance has been adamantly against the same sex marriage.

449
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:57,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm on the other side of the issue on that particular matter.

450
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:02,406
[SPEAKER_15]: And at this point, I just don't have enough information to be quite frank with you.

451
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:09,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't feel comfortable supporting something early on as this in the legislative process, Mr. President.

452
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

453
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Just as a point of clarification to Councilor Camuso's comments.

454
00:41:13,894 --> 00:41:16,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of clarification.

455
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:18,037
[SPEAKER_17]: We have filed bills here from the city of Medford.

456
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:22,313
[SPEAKER_17]: that have made radical changes by the time it came out.

457
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,254
[SPEAKER_17]: All I'm talking about is the intent of what the bill wants to do.

458
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:27,896
[SPEAKER_17]: If the bill has to be amended, so be it.

459
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:31,218
[SPEAKER_17]: It may not even come out of committee, but it looks like it will come out of committee.

460
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:43,644
[SPEAKER_17]: The intent of this is to protect schoolchildren, but the law is very specific, as it's written right now, that parents, when surveys such as this are going to be disseminated, the parents need to be

461
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:45,377
[SPEAKER_17]: told ahead of time.

462
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:47,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Schools cannot just go out there and do it.

463
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what the intent of this bill is.

464
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:53,679
[SPEAKER_17]: So all I'm asking you for is to support the intent of it.

465
00:41:54,619 --> 00:42:03,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Then they can add it up, but to add it down after that, it's letting people know that, you know, if you want your child protected from this type of pornography in plain English, you know, now's the time to speak up.

466
00:42:06,702 --> 00:42:07,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Camuso.

467
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:13,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, I appreciate the council is, um, um, opinions, but as I stated, uh,

468
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:21,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in our own homeroom petitions, by the time things get to the governor's desk, it's changed tremendously.

469
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:26,407
[SPEAKER_15]: We've dealt with that, as Councilor Penta said, right here, with stuff that was initiated in this building.

470
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:34,993
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a lot of changes by the time it left the city clerk's office with the mayor and the council signatures on it, all the way to the time it got back to Governor Deval Patrick's desk.

471
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:38,316
[SPEAKER_15]: And for that reason, I'm not supporting this this evening.

472
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:39,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caruso.

473
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion approved by Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

474
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight wishes to be recorded in opposition.

475
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:57,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to reflect that mass resistance has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in March of 2008, Mr. President.

476
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:03,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's formerly the Article 8 Alliance, which led the charge on Beacon Hill to oppose same-sex marriage here in Massachusetts.

477
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:06,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are politics that I can't agree with, Mr. President.

478
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:10,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So for that reason and that reason only, I'll be asking to be recorded in opposition.

479
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:11,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

480
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mox.

481
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:15,344
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to answer that.

482
00:43:15,364 --> 00:43:17,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of clarification, Councilor Nanta.

483
00:43:17,486 --> 00:43:21,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight just made a remark that it's a hate organization.

484
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:28,174
[SPEAKER_17]: If it was such a hate organization, they wouldn't even be entertaining this on Beacon Hill, and they wouldn't be getting the support from both sides of the aisle.

485
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:32,216
[SPEAKER_17]: But to say that they're a hate organization, I don't see anything in front of me that says they're a hate organization.

486
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,278
[SPEAKER_17]: That's your opinion, for what you maybe read someplace.

487
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:36,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

488
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the Southern Poverty Law Center in March of 2008, which I did state,

489
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:43,137
[SPEAKER_04]: made this designation, Mr. President.

490
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:45,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not here to debate the merits of the resolution.

491
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm not voting for it.

492
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,298
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I recused myself when the debate was going on.

493
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in opposition to the bill.

494
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:52,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to address that.

495
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Sir, you'll be recognized at the appropriate time.

496
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I think that the debate has ceased at this point in time.

497
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,440
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking a vote on the matter.

498
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,280
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we talking about?

499
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,360
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about it, Adam.

500
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Just let people talk.

501
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:03,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I left.

502
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to interrupt the debate.

503
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:08,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to give you guys an opportunity to go through the reasons why I think this is good legislation.

504
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the record to reflect.

505
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,623
[SPEAKER_04]: why I'm in opposition, that's all.

506
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:11,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

507
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:17,707
[SPEAKER_18]: There are Catholic organizations, there are all kinds of Tea Party organizations that have the same designation.

508
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:21,330
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be recognized when it's time for you to spoke.

509
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Max.

510
00:44:22,471 --> 00:44:33,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just wondering maybe if I can ask the gentleman, is this a bill that was introduced this year only or has this been before the state legislature previous years?

511
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,182
[SPEAKER_18]: It was before the state legislature last session.

512
00:44:38,182 --> 00:44:39,003
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't

513
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:43,186
[SPEAKER_18]: really have a chance to push it last session hard.

514
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:46,449
[SPEAKER_18]: This session, we had more information.

515
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:49,411
[SPEAKER_18]: We had more parents who were very upset.

516
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:52,734
[SPEAKER_18]: So it really got its legs this session.

517
00:44:53,675 --> 00:45:01,241
[SPEAKER_18]: It also got many more signers on this session of both parties once they saw what happened.

518
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:05,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you aware of any other states that have similar state laws?

519
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:08,893
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I haven't really looked into that.

520
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:26,438
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems to me that there is a federal law similar, but that it doesn't, it's not as, you know, we're looking into that too, whether there's a federal law that, you know, may or may not cover certain school programs.

521
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:33,540
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we haven't looked into other states on this, no.

522
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,041
[SPEAKER_18]: All we can say is that there's a tremendous amount

523
00:45:37,957 --> 00:45:40,298
[SPEAKER_18]: emotion on parents when they see this.

524
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,200
[SPEAKER_18]: So just present also.

525
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:54,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Has there been any discussion with the teachers associations or administrative associations throughout the Commonwealth?

526
00:45:56,344 --> 00:46:01,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I've only spoken with teachers and administrators informally.

527
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:04,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Many of them are uncomfortable about this.

528
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:13,747
[SPEAKER_18]: I've spoken with two or three teachers who really don't like having to do this, but feel almost forced to.

529
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:17,948
[SPEAKER_18]: But I haven't had formal discussions with teachers' organizations.

530
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,229
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd be interesting to do.

531
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,329
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a good idea.

532
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:31,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, just if I could, you know, I think at the very least, and I know I think my council colleagues are looking for at least

533
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:42,362
[SPEAKER_12]: an intent vote tonight, but I would feel more comfortable, I'll be quite frank, I didn't read the piece of legislation, although my council colleague just referred to it.

534
00:46:42,522 --> 00:46:47,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see this maybe come before a subcommittee so we can have some dialogue and discussion.

535
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:59,926
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an important issue and I'm not prepared tonight to take any type of vote on whether it's intent or whether it's the actual language here tonight.

536
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:02,514
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

537
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:08,417
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask that it be sent to a subcommittee, Mr. President, for discussion.

538
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:10,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Knight.

539
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:18,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, we also run into the situation right now where we have an elected body, the Medford School Committee, that sets school policy.

540
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:29,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder if this very issue of being able to opt in and opt out of a survey could be handled by way of policy at the local level as opposed to state legislation and the state legislature taking action.

541
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:35,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if, in fact, our elected school committee feels as though there's a need to stop this, our elected school committee would implement a policy thereof.

542
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

543
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:40,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

544
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Pentland here.

545
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:48,834
[SPEAKER_17]: The gentleman at the podium, you indicated, sir, that the city of Medford in 2013 gave up that survey, correct?

546
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:55,298
[SPEAKER_18]: It gave a similar survey, which I read from, which I have here.

547
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:58,680
[SPEAKER_17]: And that survey that was given out, parents weren't advised ahead of time.

548
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:07,795
[SPEAKER_18]: The parent that I spoke to said that they were advised in a very general way, but not specifically that these kinds of questions would be asked.

549
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:10,777
[SPEAKER_17]: And they didn't see that survey before their child took it?

550
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:10,837
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

551
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:15,280
[SPEAKER_18]: This parent was able to do it through extraordinary means, I was told.

552
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:17,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counselor Penta.

553
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:18,723
[SPEAKER_05]: You've made your point.

554
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Knight, thank you.

555
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:21,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Ma'am, you wish to address us?

556
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

557
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:25,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

558
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:30,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that the schools don't want to do this.

559
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:35,615
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something, this is thrown upon them because kids are behaving in these ways.

560
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:39,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to say is it's up to the parents to get more proactive.

561
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gentleman, this is reactive.

562
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,862
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools react when the kids are behaving in certain ways.

563
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:52,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it goes on in buses, it goes on in parks, it goes on, you know, whether it's a drug activity, whether it's sexual activity, whatever it might be.

564
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is, the onus is on the parents.

565
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:58,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like the gentleman there to get all parents.

566
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:04,474
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be a good parent, but there's a lot of parents out there that aren't talking to their kids about these topics.

567
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:09,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the parents don't do their job, what happens is it ends up being thrown on the school system.

568
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:15,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a burden on the school system, and it shouldn't be on the school system, to raise the kids with these kind of issues.

569
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:16,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to put that out there.

570
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:17,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

571
00:49:17,678 --> 00:49:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

572
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:20,977
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

573
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:24,078
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair is in doubt.

574
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,540
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion, Councilor Penta.

575
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,722
[SPEAKER_17]: The lady that just spoke, I wholeheartedly disagree with her because number one, to say that the responsibility is on the parent.

576
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:37,483
[SPEAKER_17]: The responsibility can be not be on the parent if the parent doesn't know what's going on.

577
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:40,125
[SPEAKER_17]: The responsibility is within the public school system.

578
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:46,407
[SPEAKER_17]: If that's where these surveys are being disseminated through by the State Department of Education and they disseminate it to a public school,

579
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,311
[SPEAKER_17]: And then that has to go down to the student.

580
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:53,875
[SPEAKER_17]: The parents should be informed ahead of time that this type of a survey, and they should be able to read it ahead of time.

581
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:56,176
[SPEAKER_17]: So that way, their decision is informed.

582
00:49:56,377 --> 00:50:02,621
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't take a fourth, a fifth, or a sixth grader and have them sign a survey or take a survey without a parent knowing it.

583
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:03,842
[SPEAKER_17]: That's wrong.

584
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:09,425
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the whole intent behind this piece of legislation, to inform the parent ahead of time.

585
00:50:09,685 --> 00:50:13,088
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what the law is, Chapter 71, Section 32A.

586
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:14,949
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it says, and unfortunately,

587
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Cities and towns are not following the rules as they should.

588
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:21,232
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion before us.

589
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:23,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

590
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:33,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, just for the gentlemen, um, I believe, I don't know if it was you or one of my council colleagues said that Medford did notify the parents, but it was vague.

591
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:36,235
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I was told by the parent.

592
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,096
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very vague.

593
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:38,556
[SPEAKER_15]: So Medford is following the law.

594
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:40,516
[SPEAKER_15]: If, if that's the case, we don't know.

595
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:41,577
[SPEAKER_15]: You're getting told secondhand.

596
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:42,737
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting told third hand.

597
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:45,625
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think the problem is that the law is vague.

598
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:48,908
[SPEAKER_18]: The law just says you have to notify in some way.

599
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:52,150
[SPEAKER_18]: And so these parents are told, well, it's a health survey.

600
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:54,312
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not told about these questions.

601
00:50:55,073 --> 00:51:00,437
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what really infuriates them is because once they find out, they're very, very upset.

602
00:51:01,398 --> 00:51:03,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the problem, unfortunately.

603
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Counselor Camuso.

604
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:05,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

605
00:51:05,842 --> 00:51:06,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Caviello.

606
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:07,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

607
00:51:07,663 --> 00:51:10,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, you know, while I am opposed to the survey,

608
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:22,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see if Councilor Penta wouldn't mind changing this to just removing the mass resistance group here because I'm not familiar with the group either.

609
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:25,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Though like I say, I am in opposition to the sex survey.

610
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:35,193
[SPEAKER_13]: But I say, and I say, I'm not familiar with this group and I don't want to give a voice of support to a group I'm not familiar with.

611
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:38,716
[SPEAKER_13]: But I am in favor of not doing the survey.

612
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:44,004
[SPEAKER_05]: going to remove what word from your motion?

613
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:55,517
[SPEAKER_17]: I can revert to it, and support the intent of House Bill 382, which is to protect children from obscene, sexually graphic, and psychologically intrusive service.

614
00:51:56,638 --> 00:51:57,439
[SPEAKER_17]: I have it here for you, Eddie.

615
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:01,964
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, the chair is in doubt.

616
00:52:03,956 --> 00:52:05,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to respond.

617
00:52:06,037 --> 00:52:07,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not for the survey.

618
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:24,469
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's inappropriate and over the top, but I'm just, the reason why these surveys come about is because the schools know what's going on more times than some of the parents and they need to be more involved with their kids because kids talk to other kids and then word gets around in the school systems.

619
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:25,639
[SPEAKER_00]: of who's doing what.

620
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,280
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted to say.

621
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:30,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of those questions are over the top.

622
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:31,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you there.

623
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't be in the schools.

624
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:40,868
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why it ends up in the schools is because parents aren't following up and talking to their kids about these inappropriate topics.

625
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:41,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

626
00:52:42,169 --> 00:52:42,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

627
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: We now, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion by Councilor Penta.

628
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:50,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, should we read that motion again?

629
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:51,854
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I can't.

630
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:53,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't?

631
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:58,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll read it.

632
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:02,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, let me see.

633
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:21,721
[SPEAKER_17]: City, the city of Memphis city council go on record to support house bill three eight two, which is to protect chill school children from obscene sexually graphic

634
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:30,394
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 283.

635
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:30,654
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 283.

636
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:36,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it?

637
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:46,687
[SPEAKER_17]: House Bill 283, to protect school children from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without parental knowledge.

638
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

639
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,031
[SPEAKER_17]: To support the intent.

640
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:53,653
[SPEAKER_17]: To support the intent, not to support the bill.

641
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:59,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, it's House Bill 283?

642
00:53:59,530 --> 00:53:59,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

643
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was it filed by, and was it filed by request?

644
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,798
[SPEAKER_18]: It was filed by Representative Colleen Gary.

645
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:18,580
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe she's from Dracut, a Democrat.

646
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Not by request.

647
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:22,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Not by request, you said?

648
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:23,983
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not by request.

649
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:34,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I would just respectfully ask my colleague to send this to a subcommittee.

650
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:42,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to personally have some dialogue and discussion with members of the school committee, the administration, to see what their thoughts are behind this.

651
00:54:44,883 --> 00:54:59,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see the face value on it, but I'm not quite sure I'm prepared tonight to vote on this because once we take a stance on the intent, Mr. President, as Councilor Camuso mentioned, this legislation could go in a number of

652
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:11,794
[SPEAKER_12]: different directions, and I don't know if, as a body, I want to be on record, depending on how this legislation comes out and how it may be revised.

653
00:55:12,695 --> 00:55:13,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Counselor.

654
00:55:13,555 --> 00:55:14,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Counselor Knight.

655
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:16,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

656
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:26,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we have recently voted to meet with the Medford School Committee to discuss a couple of topics.

657
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:31,744
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe this is a topic that we can put on that agenda.

658
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:32,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

659
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pinto, there have been several requests of you to withdraw the motion.

660
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:39,386
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

661
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Pinto's motion stands.

662
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

663
00:55:46,648 --> 00:55:47,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

664
00:55:47,788 --> 00:55:49,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one more question.

665
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one more question for the gentleman.

666
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,611
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe, was this the same group that I believe you were successful

667
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:03,990
[SPEAKER_15]: in the early 2000s, blocking Governor Cellucci's ambassadorship.

668
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:08,093
[SPEAKER_18]: His ambassadorship wasn't blocked.

669
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:17,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, no, but it was until he agreed to no longer do anything that would protect the rights of homosexual activity in the Commonwealth.

670
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:21,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember a landmark, something to do with that.

671
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,023
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a human foreign relations subcommittee at the time, and I believe it was

672
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:28,620
[SPEAKER_15]: The group might be the national group.

673
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:31,441
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't recall.

674
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:35,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Senator Jesse Helms at the time.

675
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:36,484
[SPEAKER_15]: That's who it was.

676
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:37,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

677
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:41,726
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to address this issue of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

678
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:56,994
[SPEAKER_18]: That group has been debunked on all sides of the political spectrum because of their activities of designating anybody on the conservative side

679
00:56:57,592 --> 00:56:59,053
[SPEAKER_18]: on certain issues as a hate group.

680
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:16,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Catholic groups, tea parties, immigration groups, people like Glenn Beck, Michelle Bachman, members of Congress, over 1,000 groups and hundreds of people have been designated by this ridiculous organization.

681
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:26,608
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's very insulting to use that as anything that makes, you know, with any credibility.

682
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:28,370
[SPEAKER_05]: This is it.

683
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,071
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be taking our vote now, sir.

684
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:30,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

685
00:57:34,514 --> 00:57:44,680
[SPEAKER_04]: The reasoning behind the southern poverty law center's designation of mass resistance as a hate group is because of the position they took.

686
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:53,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it would say that suicide prevention programs aimed at gay youth were put together by homosexual activists to normalize homosexuality.

687
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the quote from the website, Mr. President.

688
00:57:57,177 --> 00:57:58,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's a roll call vote.

689
00:57:58,297 --> 00:58:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be voting in opposition to this resolution, and I'd ask that the clerk record me for the reasons stated previously.

690
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:05,040
Thank you.

691
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

692
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:10,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso?

693
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:10,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

694
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:10,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello?

695
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:10,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

696
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello?

697
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:16,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

698
00:58:18,124 --> 00:58:18,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye?

699
00:58:18,664 --> 00:58:18,764
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

700
00:58:18,904 --> 00:58:20,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Laura Kern?

701
00:58:23,523 --> 00:58:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Penta.

702
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:24,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

703
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:26,167
[SPEAKER_06]: President Del Rosso.

704
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:26,748
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

705
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:36,783
[SPEAKER_05]: With three in the negative, two in the affirmative, four in the negative, one absent.

706
00:58:37,103 --> 00:58:37,604
[SPEAKER_05]: One absent.

707
00:58:37,744 --> 00:58:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion fails.

708
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for suspension of the rules, all those in favor?

709
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:01,774
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

710
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:08,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Suspension of the rules for the citizen to address the community on the library.

711
00:59:08,697 --> 00:59:16,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you for the opportunity to talk for just a moment.

712
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.

713
00:59:18,462 --> 00:59:18,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

714
00:59:19,282 --> 00:59:20,503
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Tamar Siegel.

715
00:59:20,563 --> 00:59:22,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 155 Forest Street here in Medford.

716
00:59:23,715 --> 00:59:29,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could just talk for one minute about the library line item in the budget.

717
00:59:29,744 --> 00:59:32,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the budget is on the agenda.

718
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:38,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my understanding that in order for libraries to be accredited by their governing board

719
00:59:38,717 --> 00:59:43,883
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to get a percentage, a specific percentage of the city budget allotted to them.

720
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is not getting that kind of money to be accredited.

721
00:59:49,009 --> 00:59:52,713
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the opportunity to get a waiver and there are other cities that do that.

722
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:59,241
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some years ago when there were budget cuts across the board, many cities in the area in the Minutemen system

723
00:59:59,903 --> 01:00:05,025
[SPEAKER_01]: went under budget, they got this waiver, and they were accredited for a certain period of time.

724
01:00:05,385 --> 01:00:09,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those cities and towns are now back up to full funding.

725
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:11,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is not one of them.

726
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:19,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is still well below the, I tried to do the math, I don't know the exact number, but well below the percentage to get their accreditation.

727
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:24,577
[SPEAKER_01]: The percentage that is missing of money is for staffing.

728
01:00:24,977 --> 01:00:26,379
[SPEAKER_01]: The library is understaffed.

729
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:30,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they're missing at least two staffing positions that used to be there.

730
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:34,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a library person, I love the library.

731
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:35,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it a great deal.

732
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:37,446
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids use it.

733
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:47,134
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Medford Library is not accredited, what that does for them, my understanding, is they lose their connection to the Minuteman system.

734
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:50,596
[SPEAKER_01]: They lose all their online resources.

735
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:57,893
[SPEAKER_01]: The referencing that you can do online, they lose the ability to do interlibrary loan.

736
01:00:57,913 --> 01:01:03,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically makes the library sort of an island with no connection to any other libraries in the area.

737
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be a shame.

738
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:09,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to just make sure it was brought to your attention.

739
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:16,515
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's an issue as you discuss numbers for the budget and just hope that that would be something that you all could take into account.

740
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:20,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the library is something that's incredibly important in Medford.

741
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:29,138
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my fifth grader reminded me today that even in the public schools, they log into the Medford Public Library from school and use the resources there.

742
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:34,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that if we lost that, it would be a real shame for the city of Medford.

743
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:37,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

744
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

745
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:41,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming down tonight, ma'am.

746
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Marks, does your button not work?

747
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:48,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

748
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:53,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Tamar brings up some very interesting points.

749
01:01:53,239 --> 01:02:08,602
[SPEAKER_12]: We all received an email with a letter that was written to the mayor dated January 20, 2015, and I think your concerns about our library falling through the cracks and not being part of

750
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:16,267
[SPEAKER_12]: the Minuteman network because we are not meeting the required funding levels of valid concerns.

751
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:21,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would ask that we take a vote here tonight, Mr. President, over the next several weeks.

752
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:26,678
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have pre-budget hearings with all the different department heads.

753
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:32,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And Brian Boutelier, who is the department head for the library, we'll be meeting with shortly.

754
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:42,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's only appropriate that we ask him the question whether or not Method is in risk of losing its certification with the Mass Board of Library Commissioners.

755
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:51,232
[SPEAKER_12]: And if so, a similar amount is needed for appropriation to make sure that we provide the same funds

756
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:58,746
[SPEAKER_12]: that is needed to keep us within the Minuteman network and allowing Meffitt cardholders.

757
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:00,407
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that you mentioned.

758
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:09,313
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a Meffitt cardholder now, you can go anywhere in the Minuteman network to that library and pull out a book or pull out a video and utilize the library.

759
01:03:09,813 --> 01:03:15,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Without this particular certification, Meffitt residents can no longer have that access.

760
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:18,338
[SPEAKER_12]: And to me that's a very important issue

761
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:19,828
[SPEAKER_12]: that needs to be addressed.

762
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:35,874
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we could put that in the form of a resolution asking the director, Mr. Buddha, Leah, uh, if we are in jeopardy, what the dollar amount would need to be to bring us up to, uh, the, uh, levels that the city needs to be at to be part of, uh, the network for minute men.

763
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:42,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And also if we can approach the issue of, uh, the lack of, as which was mentioned,

764
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:51,311
[SPEAKER_12]: personnel of the library, one the children's position and the other one the reference librarian, which we're down right now at the library.

765
01:03:52,552 --> 01:04:04,063
[SPEAKER_12]: It was mentioned the other night that potential use of the public library, not just at its current capacity, but also potentially building a second floor in the library

766
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,003
[SPEAKER_12]: to have community gathering space, to have an art area.

767
01:04:09,503 --> 01:04:11,345
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be used for a host of issues.

768
01:04:11,905 --> 01:04:28,516
[SPEAKER_12]: So I see a rosy vision in the future for our library, and we have to maintain the funding and make sure that it doesn't get to a point where people no longer want to go to the library because of the periodics and the equipment is outdated.

769
01:04:29,016 --> 01:04:31,558
[SPEAKER_12]: And we may be getting close to that, Mr. President.

770
01:04:31,978 --> 01:04:40,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would ask that that be put in the form of a motion and voted tonight, uh, that the director present that information when we meet with them in pre-budget meetings.

771
01:04:40,946 --> 01:04:41,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

772
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:42,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

773
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:43,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Marks.

774
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:44,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Knight.

775
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:47,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mr. President can't say much more than that.

776
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:49,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Took the words right out of my mouth by arrest.

777
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:50,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

778
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:51,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Knight.

779
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:52,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Penta.

780
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:55,798
[SPEAKER_17]: If I understand this correctly, I'm speaking with Mr. Baudelaire.

781
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,621
[SPEAKER_17]: We're short about $70,000.

782
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:59,902
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the dollar amount we need to get to.

783
01:05:00,623 --> 01:05:24,458
[SPEAKER_12]: So if that's the case, and you know, we have a library reimbursements and also at the same time, um, if, if, if, with the argument that has been saying about refurbishing and put information, just if I could, according to the research you did in your letter here, it says that it's about 270,000 below the appropriation requirement for certification.

784
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that's just based on,

785
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:27,673
[SPEAKER_12]: what you provided.

786
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:29,954
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a hard number.

787
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:31,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little research.

788
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:33,456
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me digging around online.

789
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:34,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the exact number.

790
01:05:34,776 --> 01:05:40,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a percentage of the city budget that is what's supposed to be appropriated for the library.

791
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we're going to take a vote on tonight.

792
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,441
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to ask.

793
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,222
[SPEAKER_17]: The inclusion of the 70, whatever the amount might be.

794
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:48,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's nothing to be voted on tonight.

795
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:49,884
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have a number to be taken.

796
01:05:49,944 --> 01:05:50,685
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to get a report.

797
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:52,746
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to ask the director.

798
01:05:53,226 --> 01:05:56,548
[SPEAKER_17]: But if I remember correctly, I think it's the city's portion of it.

799
01:05:56,918 --> 01:06:12,831
[SPEAKER_17]: And if, in fact, any major development does take place to put that second floor on, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, the $70,000 would be more than enough to be included, or whatever the dollar amount might be, because the purpose of using it for the city and the city's usefulness will far exceed, you know, the dollar amount.

800
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,954
[SPEAKER_17]: The dollar amount will be included because that's the work that'll have to be done.

801
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:20,057
[SPEAKER_17]: So I support it, but I just, see, that's the unfortunate part.

802
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:22,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever the number might be, you need to have the exact number.

803
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,482
[SPEAKER_17]: And that just goes to show you, once again,

804
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:38,397
[SPEAKER_17]: The city council asked, we've asked each and every year that when a budget is presented to us, we get the information ahead of time or we sit down with department heads and ask them for what their wish list is as to why.

805
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:53,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other day, most recently the mayor's publicist who works up at the high school as a teacher sends out a press release that said the city council school committee have been hearing from department heads over the past several weeks in a series of pre-budget meetings

806
01:06:53,753 --> 01:06:55,474
[SPEAKER_17]: The entire budget will be before the council.

807
01:06:55,854 --> 01:06:57,415
[SPEAKER_17]: We've never met with the school committee.

808
01:06:57,455 --> 01:06:59,035
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't even met with a department head.

809
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:11,200
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what you get when you have an administration that is so out of control as his own personal publicist was a teacher up at the high school with her own private newspaper writing stuff like that.

810
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And when people read that, that's what's wrong.

811
01:07:13,441 --> 01:07:14,782
[SPEAKER_17]: This is wrong information.

812
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,162
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't met with anybody.

813
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,723
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't even met amongst ourselves.

814
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:19,604
[SPEAKER_17]: We just got the numbers tonight.

815
01:07:20,524 --> 01:07:22,745
[SPEAKER_17]: So how can you put in a newspaper article,

816
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:26,256
[SPEAKER_17]: that we've been meeting for weeks with the school committee and with department heads.

817
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:28,417
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish that were the case, but it's not.

818
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:34,501
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why this city gets itself in trouble, a huge lack of communication and miscommunication.

819
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

820
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, councillor.

821
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:38,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Karafiello.

822
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:39,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Mr. President.

823
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:50,830
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could amend councillor Mark's paper to ask the question to librarian Brian Boulier, which I've asked him the last two budgets, I'd like to see his five year plan for the library.

824
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Just can't, we're just,

825
01:07:53,308 --> 01:07:55,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I want to know where the library is going.

826
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:56,170
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going in.

827
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,630
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just standing still.

828
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:04,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is the, where is his plan to show us where the library is going or where, where his vision of where the library is going?

829
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:06,055
[SPEAKER_13]: They say, yes, that last year.

830
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,556
[SPEAKER_13]: They say, I'd like to make it part of council.

831
01:08:08,596 --> 01:08:09,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark's paper.

832
01:08:09,157 --> 01:08:09,717
[SPEAKER_13]: If he doesn't mind.

833
01:08:10,998 --> 01:08:12,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, president council.

834
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:15,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it may be appropriate.

835
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,223
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be appropriate to bring it up at this point, but we received the budget this evening with a $5 million increase.

836
01:08:21,608 --> 01:08:24,790
[SPEAKER_15]: $5 million increase from the previous year's budget.

837
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:31,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, Tamar said that the additional money needed for the accreditation is not included in that line item.

838
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:44,181
[SPEAKER_15]: But more importantly, the city council has been asking for months now for the transfers of all the transfers of municipal funds in to and from accounts.

839
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,082
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have not received that yet.

840
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:55,527
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we look at the budget realistically if we don't know how much money was transferred to and from line items that they're being presented to us in the next month and a half?

841
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:58,988
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't make sense.

842
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:04,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the end of the year, we're going to get another slew of transfers to balance this year's budget.

843
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:05,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

844
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:08,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised we haven't had them already.

845
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:14,531
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a paper tonight from Ann Baker answering us the projected revenues

846
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:20,043
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the B paper to my original transfer paper request.

847
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:29,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So they answered the B paper because they wanted to, but the transfer paper that was the original paper that was brought up that that amendment was put on.

848
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:38,272
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a beautiful report tonight on the amendment, but the amendment doesn't tell us a picture on how much money is being transferred to and from accounts.

849
01:09:40,513 --> 01:09:43,355
[SPEAKER_15]: This is simple for the regular person viewing at home.

850
01:09:44,362 --> 01:10:04,375
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have a checking account, a savings account, and another checking account, and you transfer the money in between accounts by doing online banking, unless you actually look where the money came from, where it's going, and for what intent it's spended for, you're not going to know the actual balances.

851
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,057
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's the budget we got tonight.

852
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:11,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Without the transfers, take the fiscal year budget we're in and throw it out the window.

853
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:12,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Throw it out the window.

854
01:10:14,312 --> 01:10:16,835
[SPEAKER_15]: We know what's been encumbered, what's projected to be spent.

855
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:22,921
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, and we know there are accounts that are in the arrears right now.

856
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:26,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know exactly which ones, but I'm assuming it's overtime accounts.

857
01:10:27,006 --> 01:10:28,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm assuming it's other accounts out there.

858
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:36,156
[SPEAKER_15]: And unless we have a full accounting of all the transfers, it's unrealistic budget.

859
01:10:37,218 --> 01:10:42,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I talked about a few weeks ago, we have $6 million, $6 million plus in certified free cash.

860
01:10:43,163 --> 01:10:52,049
[SPEAKER_15]: It's certified because we didn't expend that money that was raised in previous fiscal years.

861
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And the DOR certified us to go ahead and put it in certified free cash.

862
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:03,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So that $6 million that was appropriated on the backs of the taxpayers for several years,

863
01:11:06,611 --> 01:11:17,096
[SPEAKER_15]: to get a savings, to put the city in a financially good spot for debt consolidation and other wonderful things that have happened over the past few years.

864
01:11:18,117 --> 01:11:26,701
[SPEAKER_15]: But the transfer paper is a very, very important piece of my moving forward in either supporting or not supporting a budget.

865
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:38,118
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and this budget's going to be very, very interesting in particular, too, because with a new administration, we don't know, this is where we can craft where we think the city should be going.

866
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,401
[SPEAKER_15]: OCD, I think, should be boosted up.

867
01:11:43,063 --> 01:11:47,927
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to give the new administration the tools to do their vision.

868
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:55,413
[SPEAKER_15]: They may say that certain officers don't need X amount of people, and other areas need it.

869
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:57,263
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know.

870
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:59,304
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know who's going to be in that corner office.

871
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:04,187
[SPEAKER_15]: But the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, I think we need to have those transfers.

872
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:24,559
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the transfers tell us exactly how much money of — and I want to say this the correct way — how much money that was put aside for a specific purpose at the end of June last year was actually spent on that specific purpose.

873
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And just for the viewing public, too,

874
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:48,394
[SPEAKER_15]: The city council has to make transfers, and according to Massachusetts finance law, the only time the city council has to make the transfers, if it's from one account that's totally different from another account, if it's from the police to the fire, or from information technology to the city clerk, interdepartmental transfers.

875
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:54,876
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have any control or any say, and nor does the administration need any vote.

876
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:57,924
[SPEAKER_15]: regarding transfers internally.

877
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:07,650
[SPEAKER_15]: So they could put money in an account that's called water cooler for $5,000 say, and they can take that out and use it for something else without the city council needing to approve it.

878
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:19,699
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hopefully that gives a good picture to people out there on how the budget actually works, where the certified free cash that we all talk about comes from, and more importantly,

879
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:32,261
[SPEAKER_15]: the budget that we pass, if it indeed is being spent in the areas where we put our stamp of approval on by a majority vote of the duly elected members of the Medford City Council year after year after year.

880
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:44,171
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would say, Mr. President, that I think you have to send the message to the city administration that without that paper, don't even bother showing up to a budget hearing, honestly, because we've been asking for it.

881
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,553
[SPEAKER_15]: And to get the B paper answered,

882
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:48,262
[SPEAKER_15]: and not the original paper.

883
01:13:48,702 --> 01:13:50,743
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's kind of humorous.

884
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's insulting and insulting.

885
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You said it, not me.

886
01:13:54,904 --> 01:13:57,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor on the motion of counselor marks for approval.

887
01:13:57,144 --> 01:14:06,126
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor in the form of a motion for a five year plan, five year plan.

888
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:07,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And also that, uh, the director, Brian Buddha, Leah,

889
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:38,997
[SPEAKER_12]: report back to the council what additional appropriation is needed in the FY16 budget to make sure we meet certification for matching funds and that we don't lose our standing with the Massachusetts border library commissioners and also that we don't lose our standing, Mr. President, in the minute man network.

890
01:14:39,878 --> 01:14:41,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are three big issues.

891
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:44,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask that Brian report when he reports to us, Mr. President.

892
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:48,582
[SPEAKER_15]: And now, Mr. President, one last question.

893
01:14:49,962 --> 01:14:51,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it comes up during budget hearing, but Ms.

894
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:54,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Siegel this evening as well referenced it.

895
01:14:54,945 --> 01:15:03,129
[SPEAKER_15]: If we also could see where the status is, if any, of the waiver going forward as well, because we don't know.

896
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:09,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I know in the past years we've had one after the waiver, but is that the intention this year to go after the waiver again?

897
01:15:09,912 --> 01:15:11,933
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that's part of the question that should be answered.

898
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:16,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

899
01:15:16,129 --> 01:15:17,070
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

900
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:20,613
Motion carries.

901
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:33,942
Filed under suspension, foundation, 15.451, Richard Cormier, recipient of the Stars of Life Award.

902
01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:37,124
Councilor Pinchas, you will be left.

903
01:15:37,144 --> 01:15:38,125
Ready for the presentation.

904
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cormier, who was joined by his lovely family.

905
01:16:06,637 --> 01:16:09,819
[SPEAKER_17]: A $154 million budget and we have to use a portable mic.

906
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:10,960
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

907
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Transfer some money, buy a new one.

908
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:16,804
[SPEAKER_17]: The gentleman that's in the, it was the last time, it's been fixed.

909
01:16:17,725 --> 01:16:23,369
[SPEAKER_17]: The gentleman that's gonna receive this award also is one of our two videographers for the Memphis City Council.

910
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,832
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's coming out now in full regalia.

911
01:16:31,214 --> 01:16:31,975
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, here he comes.

912
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:47,367
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this is the best part about being an elected official, because you don't take a vote on something like this and you can't get hurt.

913
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,931
[SPEAKER_17]: You're here to give a commendation to someone who really deserves it.

914
01:16:51,331 --> 01:16:53,333
[SPEAKER_17]: He's worked hard since 2007.

915
01:16:53,373 --> 01:17:00,259
[SPEAKER_17]: He got himself involved in paramedics, EMT, Cataldo Ambulance Company, and he's worked his way up.

916
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:06,945
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's recognized at work, especially for being a hard worker, conscientious, dedicated, and a true example to his fellow

917
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:12,590
[SPEAKER_17]: workers, male and female, and there's the Star of Life right there.

918
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:19,035
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an award, it's not local, this is a national award, so this is what makes this very, very important.

919
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:31,383
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the resolution offered by the city council to Richard Cormier, Star of Life recipient and award from the American Ambulance Association, national.

920
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Paramedic Ricky Cormier, receiving nominations

921
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:41,053
[SPEAKER_17]: For both his work in the field and in the dispatch center, Ricky is sometimes someone who mirrors professionalism.

922
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:44,314
[SPEAKER_17]: He's well respected, experienced, and dependable.

923
01:17:44,895 --> 01:17:52,498
[SPEAKER_17]: He works proactively to resolve issues and constantly seeks improvement for himself, those around him, and Catalgo Ambulance Service.

924
01:17:53,779 --> 01:17:59,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Ricky has a positive attitude while collaborating with coworkers and customers to deliver quality patient care

925
01:18:00,352 --> 01:18:03,374
[SPEAKER_17]: and customer service, both as a medic and dispatcher.

926
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:12,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Often he can be seen responding to requests to fill a difficult shift on a truck or in a dispatch or on weekends and late evenings to help out.

927
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:21,787
[SPEAKER_17]: The Memphis City Council congratulates Ricky Cormier on being the 2015 recipient of the Stars of Life Award by the American Ambulance Association.

928
01:18:23,608 --> 01:18:29,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, he's one of many that just seems to keep surfacing week in and week out

929
01:18:29,775 --> 01:18:43,841
[SPEAKER_17]: of individuals in our community that are just not only well respected, they're recognized for what they do, and I would hope that this becomes, Mr. Newspaper Man, wherever you are, a front page story, because this is what you call a true recognition for an award.

930
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thank all the city councilors.

931
01:19:05,313 --> 01:19:06,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate this award.

932
01:19:06,894 --> 01:19:07,755
[SPEAKER_10]: We went down to Washington.

933
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,736
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good time down there.

934
01:19:10,637 --> 01:19:11,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a paramedic.

935
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:13,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I work mostly in the city of Malden.

936
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:14,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank everybody.

937
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,400
[SPEAKER_10]: My parents are here tonight.

938
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:15,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming.

939
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:17,762
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

973
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:42,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

974
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, Mr. President, I've reviewed the documents.

975
01:23:44,907 --> 01:23:45,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I find them all in order.

976
01:23:45,928 --> 01:23:51,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you want to give us a little brief about your restaurant, I mean, I know you're moving into the old diner, or you're going to be the new diner.

977
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:54,080
[SPEAKER_13]: You're changing the name, changing the food.

978
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,091
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife is Ying Kee Hsu.

979
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:01,471
[SPEAKER_09]: She does the English too.

980
01:24:02,592 --> 01:24:03,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try my best.

981
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to be serving the same kind of food there?

982
01:24:07,614 --> 01:24:15,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We plan to keep most of the items on the menu and just try to plate it a little nicer so the customers can enjoy it more.

983
01:24:16,058 --> 01:24:26,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll probably be kicking in maybe a few Chinese food inside, like Chinese breakfast, so that will kind of give it a little difference.

984
01:24:26,022 --> 01:24:27,183
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to do some dim sum?

985
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Not dim sum.

986
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,611
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be different.

987
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:32,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure.

988
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:34,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen it yet.

989
01:24:34,172 --> 01:24:36,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

990
01:24:36,612 --> 01:24:39,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good luck and hope to come by and have lunch with you one day.

991
01:24:40,233 --> 01:24:40,513
Thank you.

992
01:24:40,733 --> 01:24:41,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

993
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:44,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

994
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:44,854
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

995
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:46,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Those opposed?

996

[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

999
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:55,817
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one more taxi, Mr. President.

1000
01:24:56,507 --> 01:24:56,747
[SPEAKER_13]: do we?

1001
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:57,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1002
01:24:58,169 --> 01:25:00,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is a table table.

1003
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:01,872
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a table of his presence.

1004
01:25:03,193 --> 01:25:04,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, 15, four, three, three.

1005
01:25:04,654 --> 01:25:14,163
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could take it up the table on the motion of council, Cavill to take 15, four, three, three off the table, miss a cab exchange of two cabs, number 47 and 48.

1006
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:21,630
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor of those opposed motions off the table and before us, uh, council Cavill, we, uh,

1007
01:25:22,344 --> 01:25:25,346
[SPEAKER_05]: read the motion, I don't have the text in front of me.

1008
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:29,428
[SPEAKER_13]: I find the papers in order, Mr. President, and move approval.

1009
01:25:29,448 --> 01:25:33,290
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion is approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

1010
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:51,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was just also for people to understand, this is an application that when somebody switches to a new physical taxi cab, a different car, to transfer the license from one to the other, they must seek approval of the council because

1011
01:25:52,328 --> 01:26:01,975
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, to, uh, record the fact that, uh, the license go is going from one vehicle to the other and that the new vehicle is compliant with all regulations.

1012
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:04,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, we're aware of that being compliant.

1013
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:07,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we have a motion for approval and it is passed.

1014
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:08,140
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

1015
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

1016
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passed.

1017
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

1018
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:11,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive safely.

1019
01:26:11,823 --> 01:26:14,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, Mr. Counselor, why we're under suspension.

1020
01:26:14,745 --> 01:26:16,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we take 15 dash four, five, six.

1021
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:18,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's some, um, viewers at home.

1022
01:26:19,535 --> 01:26:22,177
[SPEAKER_15]: in the Grove Street area on the mausoleum?

1023
01:26:23,318 --> 01:26:38,690
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take paper out of order, 15456, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that since some time ago the Council had discussions regarding a public mausoleum, the subject needs to be addressed.

1024
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:39,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

1025
01:26:40,331 --> 01:26:45,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I think on April 8th we received a document from the Cemetery Board of Trustees regarding the meeting.

1026
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:58,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And inclusive of that meeting, there was a notation from Louise Miller that indicated that a bid for construction for a public mausoleum at Oak Grove Cemetery had three responders.

1027
01:26:58,489 --> 01:27:00,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Memphis City Council for years has been talking about this.

1028
01:27:01,931 --> 01:27:10,937
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just really feel to some degree, once again, it's the administration just ignoring the council, keeping us not only out of the loop, but completely unaware of what's going on in the loop.

1029
01:27:11,537 --> 01:27:29,182
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact of the matter is, now that you're down to three bidders and evaluating these firms, I think the council wanted to have a discussion on mausoleums, where they would be in the cemetery, having an open public forum for people to come and then also meet with the Board of Cemetery Trustees about this.

1030
01:27:29,902 --> 01:27:32,043
[SPEAKER_17]: This seems like it's almost like it's a done deal.

1031
01:27:32,643 --> 01:27:33,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, nobody has any idea.

1032
01:27:34,063 --> 01:27:37,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, people, when I go to the cemetery, ask me where the mausoleum is.

1033
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:38,364
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say, what mausoleum?

1034
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:39,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know anything about it.

1035
01:27:40,565 --> 01:27:41,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what started this whole thing.

1036
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:51,050
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when I went back through my papers and I saw this thing, which is dated April 8, I just think, you know, there was something wrong.

1037
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:56,973
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, why is this council not being told on issues which generated from them?

1038
01:27:57,734 --> 01:28:00,455
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't even something that we have never even talked about.

1039
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,356
[SPEAKER_17]: This has been on here for years.

1040
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,737
[SPEAKER_17]: We've asked, and it was going to be considered.

1041
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,979
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we were going to get total that would be brought back to us.

1042
01:28:08,311 --> 01:28:10,832
[SPEAKER_17]: We have our discussions every time during our budget.

1043
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:18,296
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we have the trustees will now read the proposals, evaluate them, and rank them, and then a follow-up meeting will be discussed, which is in May.

1044
01:28:19,656 --> 01:28:30,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to have, Mr. President, I'd like to move that the Board of Trustees meet with the Memphis City Council for the purposes of discussing the mausoleums that are being suggested for Oak Grove Cemetery.

1045
01:28:32,324 --> 01:28:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fine motion, Councilor, but the Board of Trustees is the governing authority of the cemetery.

1046
01:28:38,168 --> 01:28:39,429
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't really care who's the governing.

1047
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:51,538
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think the City Council, where this was all initiated from, deserves at least some kind of respect in return to saying, as a follow-up, it's quite similar to what Councilor Camuso just talked about.

1048
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,780
[SPEAKER_17]: The answer is B paper before the A paper.

1049
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we talk about the mausoleums and the city goes ahead and do it.

1050
01:28:58,043 --> 01:29:00,385
[SPEAKER_17]: They have bids that go out and they have proposals to come back.

1051
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,723
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not to say there's anything wrong with it, but where is it going to be?

1052
01:29:03,783 --> 01:29:04,844
[SPEAKER_17]: What part of the cemetery?

1053
01:29:05,224 --> 01:29:11,427
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we are an integral part of this community, and we do fund the cemetery through our budget.

1054
01:29:11,967 --> 01:29:15,349
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think there is a duty of respect that's owed to the council.

1055
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:16,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1056
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I discussed the matter with John Morgan some 27 years ago.

1057
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:22,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1058
01:29:23,772 --> 01:29:28,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I do believe that the Board of Cemetery Trustees will be meeting on June 2nd at 7 p.m.

1059
01:29:28,414 --> 01:29:29,495
[SPEAKER_04]: to discuss this very issue.

1060
01:29:30,017 --> 01:29:33,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I certainly have no problem meeting with the trustees of the cemetery.

1061
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:44,469
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I think that if we are, in fact, going to have a productive session, that this meeting should wait until after the June 2nd meeting that the cemetery trustees have with the Director of Purchasing slash Budget Director to go over the RFPs and the RFQs.

1062
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:53,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem having a meeting with the Board of Trustees, but I want this meeting to take place after they have their regular deliberations on the June 2nd meeting.

1063
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:54,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1064
01:29:54,937 --> 01:29:55,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

1065
01:29:56,608 --> 01:29:58,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1066
01:29:58,328 --> 01:30:05,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe, first of all, this was initiated by Councillor Marks about four or five years ago?

1067
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:07,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Four years ago.

1068
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was on the end of the agenda ever since.

1069
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:18,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And just till recently, I believe we received the request for the $30,000 for the feasibility study from the city administration.

1070
01:30:19,012 --> 01:30:25,133
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, I think we really got to get a good understanding, too, on how the mausoleums actually work.

1071
01:30:27,105 --> 01:30:28,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta brought up a very valid point.

1072
01:30:29,105 --> 01:30:30,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Where exactly is it going to be?

1073
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:41,448
[SPEAKER_15]: The second piece of the puzzle is, I'm not quite sure if public cemeteries are in the business normally of managing a mausoleum.

1074
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:48,190
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of the private cemeteries, it seems, has them more than, is that fair to say, Councilor, based upon your professional?

1075
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:53,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that is true, that it's the private

1076
01:30:53,838 --> 01:31:19,949
[SPEAKER_15]: cemeteries that seem to have Management of these a lot more than the other thing is to I want to get an idea how much it's gonna cost for a Medford family Some of the numbers that you hear are pretty significant For this so I just think we should have a meeting and I agree with councillor Penta just to find out Where we're going with this as a whole as councillor night did say though the and I agree with him.

1077
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:21,330
[SPEAKER_15]: This is strictly a

1078
01:31:22,312 --> 01:31:24,593
[SPEAKER_15]: under the jurisdiction of the Cemetery Board of Trustees.

1079
01:31:26,254 --> 01:31:32,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless they're looking for bonding through the City Council, that is where our official action would be needed.

1080
01:31:33,677 --> 01:31:35,978
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm glad we're talking about it.

1081
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councillor.

1082
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councillor Penta, Councillor Marks.

1083
01:31:44,182 --> 01:31:46,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Councillor Penta for bringing this up tonight.

1084
01:31:47,003 --> 01:31:51,165
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was a resolution offered by myself a few years back.

1085
01:31:51,957 --> 01:32:09,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the time, it was in direct relationship to the board, the cemetery board, stating that within a matter of 15 to 20 years that there were going to be no more burials because of a lack of burial space at the cemetery.

1086
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:21,183
[SPEAKER_12]: And one way of rejuvenating and allowing for residents for the next 35 to 40 years to be buried right within their hometown was to

1087
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:25,769
[SPEAKER_12]: look at limited space and the use of a mausoleum.

1088
01:32:26,509 --> 01:32:35,455
[SPEAKER_12]: And potentially maybe several mausoleums, depending on the size and the nature and the proximity and the cemetery that they'll be located.

1089
01:32:35,495 --> 01:32:37,276
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is a great idea.

1090
01:32:37,296 --> 01:32:38,257
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on board.

1091
01:32:38,297 --> 01:32:40,178
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with my council colleagues.

1092
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:44,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should do their own deliberation, their own due diligence.

1093
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:50,025
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also believe, as Councilor Penta mentioned, that we should have some input and some say

1094
01:32:50,752 --> 01:32:55,977
[SPEAKER_12]: on behalf of the residents of this community on what takes place within that community.

1095
01:32:55,997 --> 01:33:10,329
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize they're an autonomous board, and they make their own decisions, but we're here as a legislative body, and I think it would be prudent to have the entire community, as well as this body, involved in the process.

1096
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:14,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1097
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:15,733
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1098
01:33:17,254 --> 01:33:17,935
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1099
01:33:18,315 --> 01:33:18,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1100
01:33:21,558 --> 01:33:26,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Report back to the regular order of business, 15-452 offered by Council Penta.

1101
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:37,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that a public ascertainment hearing for Comcast held last week be discussed.

1102
01:33:37,303 --> 01:33:38,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Penta.

1103
01:33:39,044 --> 01:33:48,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, last Thursday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in this council chamber, an ascertainment hearing took place and it's related to the Comcast contract.

1104
01:33:49,773 --> 01:34:05,257
[SPEAKER_17]: that I believed everybody in the room that day, except the gentleman, Mr. Epstein, who was sitting up conducting the hearing, knew that the hearing or the date of April 18th, which was the ending date of the city's contract with Comcast, had been extended to July.

1105
01:34:05,917 --> 01:34:11,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, unbeknownst to all of us until we were speaking at the podium on that day, oh, let me preface this by saying there wasn't one person.

1106
01:34:12,259 --> 01:34:16,440
[SPEAKER_17]: There wasn't one person here from the city administration to speak on the contract.

1107
01:34:17,007 --> 01:34:24,533
[SPEAKER_17]: to defend it, to defend the taxpayers, the ratepayers within this community, to the concerns that they might have as it relates to all of these particular issues.

1108
01:34:24,874 --> 01:34:27,876
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a result of that, there was seven or eight citizens.

1109
01:34:27,936 --> 01:34:28,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Some spoke.

1110
01:34:28,557 --> 01:34:29,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Some didn't speak.

1111
01:34:29,317 --> 01:34:30,378
[SPEAKER_17]: I think six of them did speak.

1112
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:33,921
[SPEAKER_17]: And a lot of the major concerns were as follows.

1113
01:34:33,961 --> 01:34:41,948
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just want to, you know, there was a certified mail sent by the mayor of this community on April 16th, two days before, two days before,

1114
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:45,330
[SPEAKER_17]: the deadline, which was April 18.

1115
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:53,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And according to the federal law, which supersedes state law, this continuance takes place until July 3 of this year coming up.

1116
01:34:54,472 --> 01:35:05,435
[SPEAKER_17]: So residents who have any concerns as it relates to Comcast, the renewal of the cable contract, have up until May 21 to submit their formal complaints to the mayor of this community.

1117
01:35:05,475 --> 01:35:10,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And they will be officially forwarded to the State Cable Commission in Boston and to Mr. Peter Epstein

1118
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:16,401
[SPEAKER_17]: who is the paid legal consultant for the city.

1119
01:35:16,861 --> 01:35:22,265
[SPEAKER_17]: But some of the comments that were made, number one, the 10-year contract, way, way, way too long.

1120
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:30,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Another part of the comments were the issuing authority taking it out of the mayor's hands and putting it into the legislative body, like it is in some other cities and towns.

1121
01:35:30,651 --> 01:35:32,393
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no senior citizen discount.

1122
01:35:32,773 --> 01:35:37,196
[SPEAKER_17]: The increase in cost just keeps going up each and every year as it relates to Comcast.

1123
01:35:37,296 --> 01:35:38,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And with the new addition,

1124
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:49,617
[SPEAKER_17]: of the technology that's out there between Amazon and Apple and a whole host of other individuals in this business, a 10-year contract would serve no purpose for the city of Medford.

1125
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:59,285
[SPEAKER_17]: A three to a five-year contract seems to be something that would be palatable and it would be something that could possibly be written that could find itself with renewable terminology.

1126
01:35:59,825 --> 01:36:08,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there was no explanation because it never took place of any survey that ever took place here in the city of Medford.

1127
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:14,977
[SPEAKER_17]: with Comcast customers over the past 10 years, whether they were satisfied, dissatisfied, or what they would like to see.

1128
01:36:15,617 --> 01:36:30,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there was no mention of the fact that the mass cable division indicates that ascertainment hearings need to take place within 12 months prior to the expiration date, but no later than six months prior to.

1129
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:35,183
[SPEAKER_17]: We never had that within 12 months, and we never had that within six months.

1130
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:36,324
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not from me.

1131
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:37,624
[SPEAKER_17]: That's from the cable division form

1132
01:36:38,302 --> 01:37:04,962
[SPEAKER_17]: 100 and that's part of their proceeding operating procedures Also, we have the discussion on the particular perks are in kind benefits that this mayor has received as a result of having this contract with Comcast what was indicated at that meeting there were 52 cities and towns throughout the country or 52 mares for which we were one of them that wrote a letter in support of having a merger between Time Warner and Comcast

1133
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:27,737
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor was quoted in picture form in the magazines that proffer the cable industry as being a shill for Comcast, because number one, he received on an annual basis $2,500 for his annual golf tournament, and he got $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee.

1134
01:37:28,618 --> 01:37:29,599
[SPEAKER_17]: That in and of itself

1135
01:37:29,992 --> 01:37:35,954
[SPEAKER_17]: was a concern because no one else, no rate payer has that opportunity to get that for whatever it might be.

1136
01:37:36,634 --> 01:37:46,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there needed to be a complete review of the records of the public access corporation, minutes of the meeting, financial records, bank accounts, and all of that.

1137
01:37:47,258 --> 01:37:48,558
[SPEAKER_17]: That has never taken place.

1138
01:37:48,899 --> 01:37:52,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Comcast themselves have never taken the opportunity to review it.

1139
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:58,762
[SPEAKER_17]: They've never taken an inventory of the PEG facilities, and they haven't looked at the lifespan of the equipment that they have at the same time.

1140
01:37:59,135 --> 01:38:04,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was no strategic plan to be presented for the PEG programming as a result of that.

1141
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:15,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And the access corporation, in and of itself, needs to be in good standing by having its annual reports and its financial filings and its proper forms in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for which they don't have.

1142
01:38:16,309 --> 01:38:19,892
[SPEAKER_17]: These are all things that Comcast has not done as it relates to this.

1143
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:26,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Comcast has not had any public hearings themselves to encourage commentary from people, from the citizens.

1144
01:38:26,858 --> 01:38:30,480
[SPEAKER_17]: It was brought up at that meeting that the city council voted on two separate occasions.

1145
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:38,484
[SPEAKER_17]: One, to have the public hearing and two, to have the public hearing at a reasonable time, which would have been two o'clock in the afternoon.

1146
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:51,671
[SPEAKER_17]: What the mayor decided to do was to have, he canceled out the first meeting on a Thursday and forwarded to the next Thursday meeting, which was last week, and still had it at two o'clock in the afternoon because there was hardly anybody here.

1147
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:52,411
[SPEAKER_17]: People were working.

1148
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:56,014
[SPEAKER_17]: And some people who were here, including myself, felt that that was a slight.

1149
01:38:56,415 --> 01:38:57,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was a slight.

1150
01:38:57,135 --> 01:38:59,076
[SPEAKER_17]: It was slight to the rate payers within this community.

1151
01:38:59,576 --> 01:39:08,620
[SPEAKER_17]: There was nothing by way of a document that would indicate that a survey was taken by Comcast for the purposes of ascertaining community needs.

1152
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:16,223
[SPEAKER_17]: And the results of the survey were not included or submitted to the issuing authority in this particular case was the mayor.

1153
01:39:16,931 --> 01:39:30,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually the way it will go, the town usually sends out an RFP, or in this particular case, if we're talking about a renewal to the contract, then that renewal to the contract generally takes about 30 to 90 days for the issuing authority to review it.

1154
01:39:31,155 --> 01:39:41,098
[SPEAKER_17]: And then four months after the issuing authority reviews it, the proposal from the cable contractor or the operator at that point in time can once again be received.

1155
01:39:42,098 --> 01:39:43,638
[SPEAKER_17]: The city does not have to accept it.

1156
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:44,739
[SPEAKER_17]: The city can send it back.

1157
01:39:44,779 --> 01:39:45,699
[SPEAKER_17]: The city can reject it.

1158
01:39:46,223 --> 01:39:50,644
[SPEAKER_17]: or they can consider the contract in a shorter term of period and time.

1159
01:39:51,104 --> 01:40:00,225
[SPEAKER_17]: The new legislative landscape on this particular negotiation on long-term contracts has now been considered to be anywhere from three to five to seven years.

1160
01:40:00,986 --> 01:40:14,848
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that would be something that could be palatable if the terminology was written in there that, inclusive of that language, there would be a review done by Comcast for the things that we talked about that they haven't been doing.

1161
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,860
[SPEAKER_17]: The commercial districts were brought up.

1162
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:21,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks' indication relative the lack of connectivity to certain parts of the square.

1163
01:40:22,382 --> 01:40:26,383
[SPEAKER_17]: That was brought up, that was a point brought up I believe by two other individuals as well as myself.

1164
01:40:27,064 --> 01:40:32,505
[SPEAKER_17]: That in and of itself really showed that Comcast has not gone out of its way for the purposes of connectivity.

1165
01:40:32,885 --> 01:40:39,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it's another failing on their part to make sure that the city was completely and totally hooked up for Comcast.

1166
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:41,808
[SPEAKER_17]: They indicated also too,

1167
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:58,228
[SPEAKER_17]: that the reducing of INET expenses or negotiating for cable modem installations, which is more and the least costly, could be challenged by the 6 megahertz channels, which are high-definition channels to the cable operator.

1168
01:40:58,668 --> 01:41:05,570
[SPEAKER_17]: There was also the request that we could avoid agreeing with the cable operator's right to reclaim unused channel time.

1169
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:09,291
[SPEAKER_17]: That's one thing I believe that Comcast has done through the years.

1170
01:41:09,471 --> 01:41:12,072
[SPEAKER_17]: If a cable channel is not being used,

1171
01:41:12,385 --> 01:41:14,646
[SPEAKER_17]: They've reclaimed it, and they've put it into a higher tier.

1172
01:41:15,427 --> 01:41:19,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are some of the issues in an overview that took place in that particular meeting.

1173
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:24,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Once again, if anybody — oh, yeah, strike that.

1174
01:41:24,572 --> 01:41:34,158
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, lastly, performance review hearings, a request to hold hearings on an annual or as-needed basis, contractually obligate the cable operator's attendance.

1175
01:41:34,503 --> 01:41:36,984
[SPEAKER_17]: That has never been done by Comcast.

1176
01:41:37,565 --> 01:41:42,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So these were the things, these were the nuts and bolts, these were the ingredients that were talked about and presented.

1177
01:41:42,628 --> 01:42:04,300
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a stenography here, and I don't know if I'm gonna wait to make sure that you recorded everything, because I will be submitting a copy of what I just got through talking about, but anyone who might be watching who has a displeasure or a pleasure, whether you like them or don't like them, you can write to the mayor of the city as the issuing authority, and tell them what you think on or before May 24th, because that will then be submitted,

1178
01:42:04,803 --> 01:42:06,724
[SPEAKER_17]: to the Mass Cable Regulatory Agency.

1179
01:42:07,284 --> 01:42:13,086
[SPEAKER_17]: And then at that point in time, I believe the city will then go into the process of negotiating.

1180
01:42:13,726 --> 01:42:27,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Another part of the comment that was made to Mr. Epstein was the fact that since the mayor will no longer be the mayor, that we ask that no contract become operative and effective until next year after a new mayor has been selected to give that person the opportunity.

1181
01:42:27,612 --> 01:42:30,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Gave the example of the same situation taking place right now.

1182
01:42:31,357 --> 01:42:36,398
[SPEAKER_17]: where the Director of Public Works, when they went through the whole process, they're now not hiring a Director of Public Works.

1183
01:42:36,438 --> 01:42:40,379
[SPEAKER_17]: They're waiting for the new mayor to come on board so that mayor can do the hiring of the Public Works.

1184
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:47,720
[SPEAKER_17]: With that being said, Mr. President, I believe that's somewhat of a general overview of what took place at the hearing.

1185
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:56,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And once again, I just think it was an out and out shame that the mayor refused to have that hearing at nighttime to give many citizens an opportunity to come and speak.

1186
01:42:56,918 --> 01:42:58,739
[SPEAKER_17]: and to relate their concerns.

1187
01:42:58,759 --> 01:43:05,081
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if you're going out of office and you really want to leave the ship, why would you want to do that to the taxpayers of this community?

1188
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:07,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why, but unfortunately he did.

1189
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:09,483
[SPEAKER_17]: But at least some of us had an opportunity.

1190
01:43:09,903 --> 01:43:22,428
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will leave by saying the following, not one person who represents this city, administration or otherwise, came to that meeting to express their concerns, complaints, compliments, or what have you,

1191
01:43:22,801 --> 01:43:26,102
[SPEAKER_17]: in behalf of the cable TV subscribers, and that was a damn shame.

1192
01:43:26,482 --> 01:43:26,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1193
01:43:29,103 --> 01:43:29,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I was there, yes.

1194
01:43:31,223 --> 01:43:34,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Pentich to receive in place on file?

1195
01:43:34,224 --> 01:43:34,884
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no.

1196
01:43:35,004 --> 01:43:50,448
[SPEAKER_17]: The motion is going to be to have anybody who has a concern as it relates to Comcast, whether they're for it or against it, for or against the 10-year contract, to write their concerns to the issuing authority as it presently stands, which is the mayor, for the purposes of having them duly recorded before any contract is signed.

1197
01:43:52,663 --> 01:43:56,564
[SPEAKER_05]: The clerk has that before any contract is signed.

1198
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:58,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Or negotiated for.

1199
01:43:59,305 --> 01:44:00,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Or negotiated for.

1200
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:03,386
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, Councilor Caravaglio.

1201
01:44:03,846 --> 01:44:04,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1202
01:44:04,147 --> 01:44:07,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Penta for being the only council to be there.

1203
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:12,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I had intended to be there last week, but I'm on another committee that I had to be in Boston for another meeting with something else.

1204
01:44:12,989 --> 01:44:21,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a shame that when Councilor Penta told me, nobody from the city showed up to represent us there other than Councilor Penta.

1205
01:44:22,026 --> 01:44:22,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody from the office.

1206
01:44:24,727 --> 01:44:29,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was just unheard of that no one, not even a token person, showed up.

1207
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:31,631
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a shame, Mr. President.

1208
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:32,632
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a shame.

1209
01:44:33,212 --> 01:44:34,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counselor Caraviello.

1210
01:44:37,454 --> 01:44:38,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, sir.

1211
01:44:38,135 --> 01:44:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1212
01:44:40,376 --> 01:44:40,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1213
01:44:42,137 --> 01:44:46,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1214
01:44:46,359 --> 01:44:48,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Counselor Penta and Counselor Caraviello.

1215
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,221
[SPEAKER_14]: His heart was in the right place.

1216
01:44:50,781 --> 01:44:51,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Penta did show up.

1217
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:58,441
[SPEAKER_14]: As Councilor Camuso just noted, and it's true, we had one representative from the city and I appreciate that.

1218
01:45:00,802 --> 01:45:01,783
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a second hearing.

1219
01:45:02,023 --> 01:45:05,145
[SPEAKER_14]: We really do because I went door to door prior to the hearing in Haines Square.

1220
01:45:06,026 --> 01:45:08,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Businesses did not know, people did not know.

1221
01:45:09,768 --> 01:45:11,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Woman at one of the banks was like, I want to be there.

1222
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,050
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't know.

1223
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:14,892
[SPEAKER_14]: And Comcast is a big issue.

1224
01:45:14,932 --> 01:45:16,693
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not about public access per se.

1225
01:45:17,373 --> 01:45:18,174
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about the whole thing.

1226
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:24,384
[SPEAKER_14]: As you may know, Verizon paid $4.4 billion for AOL.

1227
01:45:24,404 --> 01:45:25,725
[SPEAKER_14]: This went down yesterday, today.

1228
01:45:25,745 --> 01:45:28,667
[SPEAKER_14]: AOL was part of Time Warner.

1229
01:45:28,707 --> 01:45:29,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Comcast was part of Time Warner.

1230
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:31,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you know, they're all trading secrets.

1231
01:45:31,769 --> 01:45:33,350
[SPEAKER_14]: They all know what each other is doing.

1232
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:37,212
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a whole new world, and 10 years is just not appropriate.

1233
01:45:37,252 --> 01:45:38,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need a second hearing.

1234
01:45:39,014 --> 01:45:41,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, people out there, after the hearing,

1235
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:45,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Our sports host, Johnny Byers, and myself went over to Mary Merrill's office.

1236
01:45:45,503 --> 01:45:46,924
[SPEAKER_14]: She's such a good person.

1237
01:45:47,945 --> 01:45:53,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And we submitted the letters, which Mr. Epstein took, and City Hall time stamped them.

1238
01:45:54,269 --> 01:45:57,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just making sure that they got the letter.

1239
01:45:57,991 --> 01:46:03,475
[SPEAKER_14]: You can bring letters to City Hall, either to Linda Colletti's office or Mary Merrill's office.

1240
01:46:03,695 --> 01:46:08,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, people, write your letters about Comcast, good or bad.

1241
01:46:09,858 --> 01:46:12,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Note to the mayor that we want a public access station.

1242
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:15,462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very important the citizens of this community get a little proactive.

1243
01:46:15,662 --> 01:46:17,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone in this room, just write a letter.

1244
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:18,464
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to be there.

1245
01:46:18,784 --> 01:46:24,788
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need a second hearing, and I thank the city council for your vote, 7-0, to have it at 6-30.

1246
01:46:25,308 --> 01:46:31,852
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the problem with giving the people some time to talk to Comcast?

1247
01:46:32,192 --> 01:46:33,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim Kelly was sitting here.

1248
01:46:33,813 --> 01:46:36,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to him after the presentation.

1249
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:39,158
[SPEAKER_14]: the fellow from Comcast.

1250
01:46:39,258 --> 01:46:42,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just very important for the citizens to know the landscape.

1251
01:46:42,559 --> 01:46:43,659
[SPEAKER_14]: They want a 10-year deal.

1252
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:44,880
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got to get to know us.

1253
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:56,923
[SPEAKER_14]: So Comcast, shame on them for not demanding the mayor have it at 6.30 because other towns in this Commonwealth had the meeting at an appropriate hour, 7 o'clock, 6.30.

1254
01:46:57,403 --> 01:46:59,423
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why that didn't happen.

1255
01:47:02,444 --> 01:47:05,505
[SPEAKER_14]: The equipment, equipment for TV 3, where is it?

1256
01:47:06,165 --> 01:47:07,005
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council.

1257
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:10,489
[SPEAKER_14]: can ask this for another hearing.

1258
01:47:10,509 --> 01:47:11,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the hearing with Comcast.

1259
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:13,410
[SPEAKER_14]: We asked for an accounting of the equipment.

1260
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:15,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And keep this in mind.

1261
01:47:15,891 --> 01:47:18,453
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a long meeting tonight, so I'm going to end with this.

1262
01:47:19,453 --> 01:47:22,094
[SPEAKER_14]: 175 days to Election Day.

1263
01:47:22,355 --> 01:47:22,635
[SPEAKER_14]: 175 days.

1264
01:47:23,335 --> 01:47:25,016
[SPEAKER_14]: No public access TV station.

1265
01:47:25,596 --> 01:47:28,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. D'Antonio said to me, Joe, that's three elections.

1266
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:29,718
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, no, that's more than that.

1267
01:47:30,058 --> 01:47:32,840
[SPEAKER_14]: That's three mayoral elections if we don't have one this time around.

1268
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,600
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the elections in between?

1269
01:47:35,121 --> 01:47:37,642
[SPEAKER_14]: So candidates want to get their word out.

1270
01:47:38,517 --> 01:47:47,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Citizens want to speak and I know Johnny wants to do a sports show and hey, I've got all sorts of shows You know that I'm producing all the time Come on Medford.

1271
01:47:47,801 --> 01:47:56,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time If for approval Concept Penta one quick thing.

1272
01:47:56,585 --> 01:48:02,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I also included as part of the documents resolutions 15 306 15 393 and 15 434 these are the three resolutions from the council and

1273
01:48:06,548 --> 01:48:18,912

1274
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:42,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And a roll call has been requested.

1275
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:44,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1276
01:48:45,130 --> 01:49:09,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the amendment to the paper is that, uh, uh, any, uh, any concerns for or against, uh, uh, during the hearing for the hearing, uh, before to, to the mayor before any negotiation or contract be signed.

1277
01:49:14,197 --> 01:49:15,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You want the public to forward any?

1278
01:49:15,598 --> 01:49:18,879
[SPEAKER_17]: The public to forward to the mayor's office.

1279
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:19,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Any concerns for or against.

1280
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:24,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Any compliments for or against issues as it relates to the Comcast renewal.

1281
01:49:24,622 --> 01:49:25,002
[SPEAKER_06]: To the mayor.

1282
01:49:25,282 --> 01:49:30,944
[SPEAKER_17]: On or before May 21st and before any contract negotiations.

1283
01:49:30,964 --> 01:49:31,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Negotiations.

1284
01:49:32,005 --> 01:49:33,005
[SPEAKER_06]: A contract be signed.

1285
01:49:33,145 --> 01:49:33,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1286
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:36,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And attached to that were the three motions.

1287
01:49:36,947 --> 01:49:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

1288
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:38,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That were submitted before us.

1289
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:42,329
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all related to the matter of Councilor Knight.

1290
01:49:44,427 --> 01:49:55,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week's motion was that we all voted on the past 7-0, I believe, was that the mayor not enter into a new contract until, not enter a contract, a tenure contract with Comcast, until a new mayor is selected and sworn in.

1291
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And now this resolution is?

1292
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:12,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the reason why the resolution is coming up now, because the extension that, um, the extension that Mr., um, that the mayor sent out on April 16th, he sent this by certified mail and facsimile.

1293
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:17,332
[SPEAKER_17]: and this is an addendum to that for which it took place.

1294
01:50:18,132 --> 01:50:23,955
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Mr. Kelly said, any and all information, they welcome it because this is what they have to negotiate on.

1295
01:50:25,116 --> 01:50:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, roll call has been requested.

1296
01:50:29,638 --> 01:50:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just explain to me how the A portion is to provide the information to the mayor's office, correct?

1297
01:50:35,281 --> 01:50:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: The B portion of the paper, can you read that back just one more time, please?

1298
01:50:39,683 --> 01:50:41,864
[SPEAKER_06]: The B portion is the pre-resolution

1299
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:44,843
[SPEAKER_02]: 15.306, 15.

1300
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:44,843
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1301
01:50:44,863 --> 01:50:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You said the first part was that all the citizens send their emails and everything else to the mayor.

1302
01:50:50,307 --> 01:50:52,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro concern, yeah, to the mayor and at the mayor.

1303
01:50:55,432 --> 01:50:55,972
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to forward them.

1304
01:50:55,992 --> 01:51:02,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Not negotiate or enter in the contract before these papers are received for May 21st hearing, is that it?

1305
01:51:03,258 --> 01:51:04,479
[SPEAKER_17]: No, he can't do that anyway.

1306
01:51:04,759 --> 01:51:04,919
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1307
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:10,304
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, all papers for or against have to be submitted to the mayor on or before

1308
01:51:10,782 --> 01:51:13,585
[SPEAKER_17]: May 21st, that's the deadline for filing, okay?

1309
01:51:13,865 --> 01:51:15,647
[SPEAKER_17]: This contract goes to July 3rd.

1310
01:51:16,048 --> 01:51:26,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Subsequent to May 21st and after July 3rd, that's when the mayor, who are, if he so chooses, to go forward and negotiate a contract, this is all the information we want included.

1311
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:27,620
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what Mr. Kelly said.

1312
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,784
[SPEAKER_17]: As much as you give them and send forth between now and then, they have to consider that.

1313
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:35,491
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're adding July date to this.

1314
01:51:36,372 --> 01:51:38,453
[SPEAKER_17]: July 3rd is the extension date.

1315
01:51:39,754 --> 01:51:46,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with providing the information, Mr. President, or giving the residents a problem to provide the information.

1316
01:51:46,317 --> 01:51:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I haven't moved off my position that I don't think that we should enter into a new 10 year contract as we voted on last week.

1317
01:51:52,941 --> 01:51:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, you know, maybe we let the resolution stand from last week because they're contradictory at this point in time.

1318
01:51:58,724 --> 01:51:59,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.

1319
01:52:00,245 --> 01:52:00,845
[SPEAKER_16]: That's your opinion.

1320
01:52:01,512 --> 01:52:05,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of them says for the mayor not to enter into a contract, and the other one says to let the mayor enter into a contract, so.

1321
01:52:06,115 --> 01:52:07,636
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're not letting him enter into a contract.

1322
01:52:07,656 --> 01:52:12,919
[SPEAKER_17]: What you're doing is you have to read the law, and the law is very specific as it relates to this particular contract.

1323
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,500
[SPEAKER_17]: He has now signed the extension.

1324
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:22,786
[SPEAKER_17]: By having the extension signed and having the ascertainment hearing after the fact, not before the fact, that has presented multiple of issues.

1325
01:52:23,146 --> 01:52:26,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Before, you or I or nobody had any opportunity

1326
01:52:26,581 --> 01:52:28,622
[SPEAKER_17]: to explain or express ourselves.

1327
01:52:29,122 --> 01:52:34,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, since they had the ascertainment hearing, even though it's after the fact, this all has to be taken in consideration.

1328
01:52:34,724 --> 01:52:35,964
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you don't want to vote for it, vote.

1329
01:52:36,024 --> 01:52:36,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll vote for it.

1330
01:52:36,384 --> 01:52:36,944
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm saying that's fine.

1331
01:52:36,964 --> 01:52:38,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it be taken into consideration.

1332
01:52:38,185 --> 01:52:40,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But has this council moved off its position that they don't want the mayor?

1333
01:52:40,645 --> 01:52:44,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe they're reaffirming its position because nobody came here.

1334
01:52:44,266 --> 01:52:45,667
[SPEAKER_17]: So at least we want to reaffirm.

1335
01:52:45,867 --> 01:52:46,507
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't want to vote for it?

1336
01:52:46,527 --> 01:52:47,568
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to vote for it.

1337
01:52:47,648 --> 01:52:49,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be clear as to what we're voting for.

1338
01:52:49,228 --> 01:52:50,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just reaffirming my position.

1339
01:52:50,969 --> 01:52:54,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to vote for four separate resolutions that are all contradictory to each other

1340
01:52:56,005 --> 01:53:00,246
[SPEAKER_04]: direct contradiction to the rules that we have where we disposed of an item that's substantially similar.

1341
01:53:00,366 --> 01:53:01,407
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not being disposed.

1342
01:53:01,427 --> 01:53:06,268
[SPEAKER_17]: What you're doing is you're amending the original one and it's an entirely different resolution.

1343
01:53:07,609 --> 01:53:09,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1344
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:11,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

1345
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:18,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we're still waiting on an opinion from the city solicitor that we asked for probably several months ago.

1346
01:53:18,852 --> 01:53:25,574
[SPEAKER_15]: This whole thing could be moot if the Medford city council injects, um, a recension of the original vote.

1347
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:27,651
[SPEAKER_15]: that was taken way back when.

1348
01:53:29,152 --> 01:53:41,534
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked for a ruling, whether it was a new contract or an extension of the contract, or if it was by home rule petition, or if it was by a separate law.

1349
01:53:42,394 --> 01:53:45,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe we're still waiting for that opinion from the solicitor.

1350
01:53:45,655 --> 01:53:47,695
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been very busy providing us other opinions.

1351
01:53:48,315 --> 01:53:54,917
[SPEAKER_15]: But that one, I think, should be put to the front of the list, where this is something that's ongoing right now.

1352
01:53:57,487 --> 01:54:01,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of council Penta for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1353
01:54:06,369 --> 01:54:08,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to sever by council and night.

1354
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:09,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1355
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:11,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're severing the comment section.

1356
01:54:11,571 --> 01:54:12,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1357
01:54:16,492 --> 01:54:24,274
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're calling the role on the, well, did the chair rule that this is contradictory to the vote last week?

1358
01:54:24,354 --> 01:54:25,454
[SPEAKER_15]: You did say that you agreed.

1359
01:54:28,618 --> 01:54:30,578
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just asking a question of the chair, counselor.

1360
01:54:35,139 --> 01:54:36,099
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not reaffirming.

1361
01:54:36,139 --> 01:54:36,659
[SPEAKER_15]: It's changing.

1362
01:54:36,679 --> 01:54:38,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we've disposed of it already.

1363
01:54:49,122 --> 01:54:49,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1364
01:54:50,902 --> 01:54:53,862
[SPEAKER_15]: The extension was signed on April 15, right?

1365
01:54:55,723 --> 01:54:57,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the ascertainment hearing was May

1366
01:55:00,346 --> 01:55:12,091
[SPEAKER_17]: So the vote on the comment section first.

1367
01:55:13,652 --> 01:55:15,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Please call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

1368
01:55:15,613 --> 01:55:15,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1369
01:55:17,433 --> 01:55:17,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1370
01:55:18,814 --> 01:55:19,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1371
01:55:25,657 --> 01:55:25,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1372
01:55:26,497 --> 01:55:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

1373
01:55:29,526 --> 01:55:30,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1374
01:55:31,908 --> 01:55:33,048
[SPEAKER_05]: The second vote is on.

1375
01:55:39,552 --> 01:55:41,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Reaffirming the three prior resolutions.

1376
01:55:43,835 --> 01:55:45,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1377
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:50,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1378
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:52,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1379
01:55:58,437 --> 01:55:59,838
[SPEAKER_04]: based on the issue of redundancy.

1380
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, so noted.

1381
01:56:12,749 --> 01:56:12,970
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1382
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:20,176
[SPEAKER_05]: With a vote of 4 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, 1 absent, the motion passes.

1383
01:56:34,976 --> 01:56:48,879
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 for 54 offered by counselor Penta be it resolved that the mayor and city engineers failure to respond to council resolution regarding the EPA proposed Ms for permitting be reviewed for passage.

1384
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Penta.

1385
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:03,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, 15 Oh 83 was, it was, was presented before the city council some two months ago and the unfortunate part about it,

1386
01:57:04,282 --> 01:57:07,583
[SPEAKER_17]: as we're starting to go through all these resolutions that are not being responded to.

1387
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:14,805
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why either the mayor or the city engineer has refused to do this, refused to respond to it.

1388
01:57:15,065 --> 01:57:17,706
[SPEAKER_17]: 85 cities and towns have now signed on to this.

1389
01:57:18,546 --> 01:57:31,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Today I attended a mass municipal board meeting and one of their highlights is this MS for permitting part of this permitting process that the EPA is forthcoming.

1390
01:57:32,246 --> 01:57:52,313
[SPEAKER_17]: As a matter of fact, today it was recognized for the first time that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is complementing cities and towns who are taking a stand on this particular position and challenging the EPA, the federal EPA, on this particular mandate, which is not only going to be costly, it's going to be almost prohibitive for the city and town to do this within the next five years.

1391
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:56,134
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an excess of 13, I believe, over $20 billion

1392
01:57:58,968 --> 01:58:02,029
[SPEAKER_17]: entity as it's going to relate upon the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1393
01:58:03,569 --> 01:58:10,910
[SPEAKER_17]: This is nothing more than having our city engineer write a letter in support of our community, sister communities.

1394
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:12,991
[SPEAKER_17]: She doesn't believe what I'm saying.

1395
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:14,591
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a member of MMA.

1396
01:58:14,651 --> 01:58:17,732
[SPEAKER_17]: She can call them up and ask them, you know, what it's all about.

1397
01:58:17,792 --> 01:58:19,652
[SPEAKER_17]: She can check in with their environmental committee.

1398
01:58:20,352 --> 01:58:25,733
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, all we're doing is requesting the APA that since the proposed MS4 stormwater

1399
01:58:26,213 --> 01:58:38,762
[SPEAKER_17]: sewer system permit would require communities to institute more advanced stormwater testing, monitoring, and management programs, but is completely silent on funding or mitigation of the additional costs to communities.

1400
01:58:39,143 --> 01:58:55,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And since there is no flexibility in the compliance portion of the requirements, and since communities are grappling with these huge financial challenges, with preliminary projections to be in excess of $800,000 per year per community, we ask the EPA to defer action on their submission

1401
01:58:56,437 --> 01:59:07,703
[SPEAKER_17]: of a notice of intent until municipalities have had the opportunity to engage the regulatory agencies in an open dialogue regarding these onerous and unaffordable permit requirements.

1402
01:59:07,743 --> 01:59:10,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it goes on and explains and it gives a whole list of these things.

1403
01:59:11,205 --> 01:59:13,887
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just don't understand why we have not received.

1404
01:59:13,927 --> 01:59:14,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was Councilor Knight.

1405
01:59:15,228 --> 01:59:21,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in the beginning you sort of like okayed with that and you said, can we just send it upstairs and let's see if we can get an answer back.

1406
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:22,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we haven't gotten an answer back from her.

1407
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:25,281
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is too important of an issue.

1408
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:27,883
[SPEAKER_17]: They did a survey of Massachusetts cities and towns.

1409
01:59:28,303 --> 01:59:32,526
[SPEAKER_17]: This was their second highest priority through Mass.

1410
01:59:32,566 --> 01:59:38,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Municipal Association, for which we are a paid dues member within that community.

1411
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:39,630
[SPEAKER_17]: This is huge.

1412
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:49,336
[SPEAKER_17]: This is huge as it relates to an infrastructure problem here in the city of Medford, as it relates to our water and sewer, especially our stormwater and sewer provisions.

1413
01:59:50,157 --> 01:59:51,778
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a very aggressive attitude.

1414
01:59:52,682 --> 01:59:54,103
[SPEAKER_17]: being taken by the EPA.

1415
01:59:55,023 --> 02:00:11,334
[SPEAKER_17]: What the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is doing, and the Baker administration, and the Commonwealth's EPA program, they're asking for a long-term, at least a minimum, of a 20-year program that forecasts out cities and towns to go at this at a reasonable pace and at a reasonable cost.

1416
02:00:11,714 --> 02:00:16,837
[SPEAKER_17]: The city of Medford cannot afford $800,000 a year to correct all its stormwater provisions.

1417
02:00:16,917 --> 02:00:17,558
[SPEAKER_17]: That's minimum.

1418
02:00:17,958 --> 02:00:19,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Could even be more on that.

1419
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:21,320
[SPEAKER_17]: We have things going on upstairs.

1420
02:00:22,463 --> 02:00:29,549
[SPEAKER_17]: in our water and sewer department that's going to be costing us probably into the millions with a new program that they're going to be coming up on a leak detection program.

1421
02:00:30,049 --> 02:00:32,972
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when we look at that, how's the priority run against that against this?

1422
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:48,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I'm asking that we as a city or our Memphis City Council go forward with a letter of support, forward this to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts EBA and letting them know that we support their proposal

1423
02:00:49,233 --> 02:01:05,962
[SPEAKER_17]: for forecasting this over a longer period of time, having an educational program for which there is none being offered by the federal EPA, and at the same time, give cities and towns an opportunity to forecast their financial program to engage in this program.

1424
02:01:06,503 --> 02:01:17,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there are five coalitions of eastern Massachusetts towns, which make up over 85 communities that surround us that are looking into combining their services, their expertise,

1425
02:01:17,972 --> 02:01:23,415
[SPEAKER_17]: and whatever it takes to reduce the individual city and town burden to get through this process.

1426
02:01:24,036 --> 02:01:29,479
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, going through all our resolutions that haven't been answered, there's a whole host of them.

1427
02:01:29,899 --> 02:01:38,284
[SPEAKER_17]: If this is the mayor's intent to just leave and just ignore this council or have a department head ignore this council on this most important issue, shame on all of them.

1428
02:01:38,344 --> 02:01:39,545
[SPEAKER_17]: This is too important an issue.

1429
02:01:40,005 --> 02:01:44,568
[SPEAKER_17]: It affects every single taxpayer, water and soil projection, water and soil rate payer,

1430
02:01:45,087 --> 02:01:46,309
[SPEAKER_17]: in this particular community.

1431
02:01:46,349 --> 02:01:48,070
[SPEAKER_17]: So I ask approval, Mr. President.

1432
02:01:49,111 --> 02:01:50,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you want, I'll read the entire resolution.

1433
02:01:51,614 --> 02:01:52,055
[SPEAKER_17]: No thanks.

1434
02:01:52,235 --> 02:01:53,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Approval by Councillor Pinto.

1435
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:55,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Knight.

1436
02:01:56,539 --> 02:02:00,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the text of the resolution the text that the gentleman proposes be included in the letter?

1437
02:02:02,005 --> 02:02:02,686
[SPEAKER_17]: In the resolution.

1438
02:02:03,627 --> 02:02:05,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's the exact text.

1439
02:02:18,067 --> 02:02:18,667
[SPEAKER_05]: on that motion?

1440
02:02:20,108 --> 02:02:25,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I certainly can understand the councilor's concern, and I can understand where he's coming from.

1441
02:02:25,252 --> 02:02:29,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is also going to be a very costly, costly endeavor.

1442
02:02:31,055 --> 02:02:42,162
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm reading the language of the letter, and I think that we might be better served coming across as a unanimous body that sits down and drafts a letter to the EPA as a group for something that we can all wholeheartedly support.

1443
02:02:42,742 --> 02:02:45,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on the language that's in the underlying resolution,

1444
02:02:46,109 --> 02:03:01,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't support it, however, I'm more than willing to sit down maybe in committee or in committee of the whole and we can come down and put a draft together, Mr. President, or maybe even go in a step further where there are five stormwater coalitions that have gotten together and that have actually done some work on this together.

1445
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we have one of them come in and share their expertise with us and help us draft a letter that's going to really hit the points, the high points that we need to hit.

1446
02:03:08,148 --> 02:03:15,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, and number two, also provide us with a little bit more information as to how a regional stormwater coalition would work and whether or not that's in the best interest of the city of Medford.

1447
02:03:15,652 --> 02:03:25,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it would be helpful to have our city engineer as part of that conversation, because there might be something going on about it that we haven't been apprised of for whatever reason.

1448
02:03:26,358 --> 02:03:34,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, with all due respect to the city engineer who's had this for over two months and not being responsive to it, as well as other issues that are sitting up there, I just think, and I don't understand

1449
02:03:35,339 --> 02:03:38,600
[SPEAKER_17]: If Counsel Knight has a problem with the words, what's the problem with the words?

1450
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I find them to be somewhat inflammatory.

1451
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I got a letter like that sitting on my desk when I was at work, I'd look at the thing and I'd scratch my head and I'd say, who are these nuts that are sending it to me?

1452
02:03:46,941 --> 02:03:51,402
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you look at the language in there, and it's very divisive.

1453
02:03:51,442 --> 02:03:52,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems very argumentative.

1454
02:03:52,723 --> 02:03:54,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems very, um.

1455
02:03:54,783 --> 02:03:55,263
[SPEAKER_17]: How can it be?

1456
02:03:55,463 --> 02:03:56,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, read the language.

1457
02:03:56,383 --> 02:03:57,784
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just using terminology.

1458
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,684
[SPEAKER_17]: What words don't you like?

1459
02:03:59,224 --> 02:04:00,404
[SPEAKER_17]: What sentence don't you like in here?

1460
02:04:01,925 --> 02:04:03,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The aggressive schedule the EPA poses

1461
02:04:05,115 --> 02:04:05,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It is aggressive.

1462
02:04:05,936 --> 02:04:07,837
[SPEAKER_04]: In absence of EPA leadership.

1463
02:04:10,959 --> 02:04:14,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, in the federal government, there is an absence of leadership.

1464
02:04:14,681 --> 02:04:17,703
[SPEAKER_17]: There is nobody there at the helm for the purposes of making this a direction.

1465
02:04:18,064 --> 02:04:20,265
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is coming from Washington down.

1466
02:04:20,325 --> 02:04:21,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you talk to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1467
02:04:21,886 --> 02:04:25,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's translated into another harmful and unfunded mandate on cities, towns, and taxpayers.

1468
02:04:25,628 --> 02:04:25,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1469
02:04:25,869 --> 02:04:27,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel as though the tone's argumentative.

1470
02:04:27,470 --> 02:04:28,510
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like it starts to soften more.

1471
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:30,151
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got to move, Mr. President, move on the question.

1472
02:04:30,732 --> 02:04:31,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Move the question.

1473
02:04:31,953 --> 02:04:33,013
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it's argumentative.

1474
02:04:33,053 --> 02:04:34,014
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it needs to be done.

1475
02:04:34,781 --> 02:04:38,023
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Council of Penta for approval, all those in favor.

1476
02:04:38,043 --> 02:04:39,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1477
02:04:39,444 --> 02:04:41,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1478
02:04:41,686 --> 02:04:43,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
02:04:49,752 --> 02:04:50,472
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mr. President.

1480
02:04:50,492 --> 02:04:51,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Please record me in opposition.

1481
02:04:52,033 --> 02:04:54,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason being I oppose the language, but I agree in principle.

1482
02:05:05,565 --> 02:05:05,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1483
02:05:07,386 --> 02:05:07,586
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1484
02:05:08,426 --> 02:05:13,048
[SPEAKER_05]: The vote of four in the affirmative, two in the negative, and one absent.

1485
02:05:13,328 --> 02:05:14,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1486
02:05:21,852 --> 02:05:24,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for suspension of the rules to take the budget.

1487
02:05:24,833 --> 02:05:25,613
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1488
02:05:26,414 --> 02:05:28,194
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1489
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:29,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1490
02:05:30,908 --> 02:05:32,329
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget is before us.

1491
02:05:32,669 --> 02:05:34,630
[SPEAKER_05]: We had presented to us the budget, 15460.

1492
02:05:35,090 --> 02:05:37,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

1493
02:05:41,012 --> 02:05:45,134
[SPEAKER_15]: As a result of not having our answers for the transfers, motion to table the budget.

1494
02:05:45,854 --> 02:05:48,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion to table the budget is undebatable.

1495
02:05:49,656 --> 02:05:50,436
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1496
02:05:50,456 --> 02:05:51,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote.

1497
02:05:51,917 --> 02:05:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call has been requested.

1498
02:05:53,878 --> 02:05:57,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to table the budget, 15460 as presented

1499
02:05:59,902 --> 02:06:13,148
[SPEAKER_05]: to the Medford City Council on the motion of Councilor Camuso to table the budget for the reason being the failure of the administration to update the council on the proper financial requests.

1500
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:17,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1501
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:19,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1502
02:06:20,191 --> 02:06:20,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1503
02:06:24,333 --> 02:06:24,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1504
02:06:26,065 --> 02:06:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, in the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion carries.

1505
02:06:31,051 --> 02:06:32,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back.

1506
02:06:32,913 --> 02:06:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion by Councilor Camuso to revert back to the regular order of business.

1507
02:06:37,639 --> 02:06:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1508
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1509
02:06:39,161 --> 02:06:39,862
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1510
02:06:41,766 --> 02:06:43,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Carafiello.

1511
02:06:46,688 --> 02:06:55,653
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're into suspension, ma'am, would you please present yourself to the podium, and please state your name and address for the record.

1512
02:06:55,833 --> 02:06:56,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1513
02:06:56,573 --> 02:06:57,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Sharon Diaso.

1514
02:06:57,674 --> 02:07:01,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a resident of Medford, and I live at the corner of Mass Ave and Circuit Road.

1515
02:07:02,596 --> 02:07:03,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for a few minutes.

1516
02:07:03,637 --> 02:07:07,839
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize you were going to have an elongated meeting, but they certainly are important issues.

1517
02:07:08,607 --> 02:07:18,149
[SPEAKER_11]: On a lighter note from all of this business that's been going on, I came down for a couple of thank yous to some people who work in the city.

1518
02:07:18,849 --> 02:07:22,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the thank yous has sort of a prelude.

1519
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:24,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a story.

1520
02:07:25,671 --> 02:07:35,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Five years ago, at the corner of Mass Ave and Governors Avenue, there's a very kind of unique lot of woods and boulders.

1521
02:07:35,153 --> 02:07:38,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone who goes up Governors Avenue, I'm sure, has seen it.

1522
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:43,578
[SPEAKER_11]: We residents know it very well, although I'm a long-time resident of Judkins Road.

1523
02:07:43,598 --> 02:07:45,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I go walking there now.

1524
02:07:45,842 --> 02:07:51,292
[SPEAKER_11]: It's loaded with trash, barrels, debris, doggy

1525
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:56,862
[SPEAKER_11]: dead trees, glass, poison ivy growing out all into the street.

1526
02:07:57,423 --> 02:08:12,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So five years ago, I wrote a letter and went down to the safety meeting at the police station because my friend's husband's car was totaled by a motorist coming around the corner.

1527
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:18,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they were cutting across Hutchins Road past governors and almost causing accidents.

1528
02:08:18,908 --> 02:08:23,090
[SPEAKER_11]: A few of us almost hit children on bicycles because you couldn't see through the trees.

1529
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:33,154
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like a mute point, but one of the comments tonight was made by a couple of the councillors about other things that are much larger than this.

1530
02:08:33,655 --> 02:08:34,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Medford.

1531
02:08:35,115 --> 02:08:40,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does it take five years to clear a lot out like that, posing a hygienic

1532
02:08:41,531 --> 02:08:44,973
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, hazard and also a safety hazard.

1533
02:08:45,253 --> 02:08:51,115
[SPEAKER_11]: We're even told in the classrooms, even at the college, that what's the first thing that happens when you come in the door as an instructor?

1534
02:08:51,356 --> 02:08:52,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Safety first.

1535
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:53,497
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the first thing.

1536
02:08:54,984 --> 02:08:56,385
[SPEAKER_11]: With that in mind, we waited.

1537
02:08:56,505 --> 02:08:57,466
[SPEAKER_11]: We wrote more letters.

1538
02:08:57,546 --> 02:08:58,186
[SPEAKER_11]: We went down.

1539
02:08:58,506 --> 02:09:06,491
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told at one of the safety meetings that we had to run it by, the letter had to go before the tree people.

1540
02:09:07,471 --> 02:09:14,255
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, you know, is a dead tree equated with the life of a little kid on a bike?

1541
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:16,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're waiting for, someone to really get hurt?

1542
02:09:17,157 --> 02:09:18,478
[SPEAKER_11]: So time went by.

1543
02:09:18,558 --> 02:09:19,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Winters came, went.

1544
02:09:20,099 --> 02:09:24,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, last year, I went to City Hall to Mike Nestero's department.

1545
02:09:24,765 --> 02:09:25,925
[SPEAKER_11]: He happened to be there.

1546
02:09:26,426 --> 02:09:28,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that anger creates more anger.

1547
02:09:28,486 --> 02:09:31,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was trying to be my best behave that day.

1548
02:09:32,327 --> 02:09:33,868
[SPEAKER_11]: The secretary was taking notes.

1549
02:09:33,948 --> 02:09:37,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Nestor said, I'm overhearing what you're saying.

1550
02:09:37,149 --> 02:09:39,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had no idea this problem existed up there.

1551
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:43,331
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mr. Nestor and your assistant.

1552
02:09:43,371 --> 02:09:44,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I think his name is Dennis.

1553
02:09:45,071 --> 02:09:45,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it Dennehy?

1554
02:09:46,592 --> 02:09:48,853
[SPEAKER_11]: They met me two weeks later with the group.

1555
02:09:48,913 --> 02:09:50,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they were prisoners.

1556
02:09:50,393 --> 02:09:52,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And those guys are real happy to be out that day.

1557
02:09:53,374 --> 02:09:55,475
[SPEAKER_11]: They asked me, how's this look?

1558
02:09:55,495 --> 02:09:56,116
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that look?

1559
02:09:56,136 --> 02:10:03,000
[SPEAKER_11]: They cleared everything out to the point where the poor lady over there got all her kitchen windows exposed.

1560
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:08,543
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, she said she's loving it because she doesn't have to look out on smell horrible stuff.

1561
02:10:08,963 --> 02:10:09,884
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Medford.

1562
02:10:10,264 --> 02:10:11,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does it take five years?

1563
02:10:12,245 --> 02:10:14,347
[SPEAKER_11]: We said, well, maybe the city trucks are busy.

1564
02:10:14,707 --> 02:10:17,408
[SPEAKER_11]: We were giving every kind of naive, you know, um,

1565
02:10:18,874 --> 02:10:20,835
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, benefited the drought.

1566
02:10:20,935 --> 02:10:22,576
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like, we don't see city trucks.

1567
02:10:22,817 --> 02:10:25,598
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not look busy to us, but he sent them out there.

1568
02:10:25,638 --> 02:10:26,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Mr. Nestor.

1569
02:10:26,879 --> 02:10:31,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we now can see through the corner with what he removed.

1570
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:37,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And I go there myself once a week now, and I take out any type of extra debris that's gone.

1571
02:10:37,365 --> 02:10:38,546
[SPEAKER_11]: The neighbors are loving it.

1572
02:10:39,487 --> 02:10:42,949
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note of safety last year, you know,

1573
02:10:43,476 --> 02:10:48,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I came down here only on the suggestion of a friend who saw me weeks later.

1574
02:10:48,258 --> 02:10:57,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I fell so hard on Forest Street on the sidewalk that I broke my two front teeth and I sprained my shoulder and had to wear a leg brace for two months.

1575
02:10:57,741 --> 02:11:00,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I fell so hard that a constable coming by

1576
02:11:00,942 --> 02:11:04,184
[SPEAKER_11]: was kind enough to get me off the sidewalk because I couldn't get up.

1577
02:11:04,844 --> 02:11:15,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank you for reviewing that case for me and for going in consideration with what I had to pay to reconstruct my front teeth.

1578
02:11:16,791 --> 02:11:21,194
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, when I came to visit, I think it was Councilwoman Biona Luongo,

1579
02:11:21,736 --> 02:11:24,197
[SPEAKER_11]: there was supposed to be an audit to the sidewalks.

1580
02:11:24,797 --> 02:11:30,018
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm coming here tonight to find out if that audit indeed was ever begun.

1581
02:11:30,599 --> 02:11:41,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Because since I fell, I've heard on talk radio, and also two other cases before this council, of older people who have fallen, have had to have shoulder surgery.

1582
02:11:42,002 --> 02:11:42,722
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Medford.

1583
02:11:43,343 --> 02:11:45,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't we fix the sidewalks?

1584
02:11:45,683 --> 02:11:51,145
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bad enough the poor policemen have to live in a bad hygiene situation

1585
02:11:52,582 --> 02:11:53,102
[SPEAKER_11]: station.

1586
02:11:53,402 --> 02:11:54,783
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't even walk at night.

1587
02:11:54,823 --> 02:12:00,766
[SPEAKER_11]: My neighbor won't walk the dogs at night anymore because he's too afraid of tripping over the broken sidewalks.

1588
02:12:01,526 --> 02:12:14,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So I happened to read in the newspaper that the state legislature recognized the adverse effect the past winter had on our city's infrastructure as well in the DPW budget, said Donato.

1589
02:12:15,272 --> 02:12:20,715
[SPEAKER_11]: These funds will go a long way in helping Medford residents see necessary street and road repairs.

1590
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:24,880
[SPEAKER_11]: costly damage caused by this winter's weather.

1591
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:36,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So does this mean that the, the budget money that you were questioning before Mr. President, um, if it does come, I've never read another piece of news since this was announced.

1592
02:12:37,463 --> 02:12:46,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that only for, um, weather beaten streets in sidewalks or is this going to be a combination of hazardous walking?

1593
02:12:46,805 --> 02:12:47,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for your time.

1594
02:12:47,966 --> 02:12:48,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to bother you.

1595
02:12:49,532 --> 02:12:50,353
[SPEAKER_05]: No bother at all.

1596
02:12:50,433 --> 02:12:51,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming up.

1597
02:12:52,714 --> 02:13:02,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to send the question to the DBW regarding the audit of the sidewalks and the supplemental funds and their disbursement for the purpose of.

1598
02:13:04,063 --> 02:13:14,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So the resolution is the resolution by Councilor Camuso to get an update on the sidewalk assessment and audit for repairs and

1599
02:13:16,782 --> 02:13:32,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And the supplemental funds are delivered by Representative Donato, how they're being dispersed and in what areas for repairs of streets and sidewalks due to the excessive damage from the past record-breaking winter.

1600
02:13:34,714 --> 02:13:35,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1601
02:13:35,334 --> 02:13:42,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that mean that also, President Jaloruso, that they also would address just weather-beaten sidewalks?

1602
02:13:42,556 --> 02:13:46,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Or what happens to all the sidewalks that are causing all the falls in the city, sir?

1603
02:13:46,937 --> 02:13:47,537
[SPEAKER_11]: What would happen?

1604
02:13:47,818 --> 02:13:49,218
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be covered under the audit?

1605
02:13:49,698 --> 02:13:49,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1606
02:13:50,658 --> 02:13:51,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, thanks.

1607
02:13:51,859 --> 02:13:52,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was important.

1608
02:13:53,479 --> 02:13:55,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, in the light of this, with the spending,

1609
02:13:57,437 --> 02:14:00,338
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very fine engineering department, I'm sure.

1610
02:14:00,358 --> 02:14:03,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Would they participate in this repair?

1611
02:14:03,999 --> 02:14:05,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Do these jobs go out on bids?

1612
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:12,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it seems to me that we have very apt people as personnel who can work on this.

1613
02:14:12,643 --> 02:14:17,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just hoping it doesn't go out for a huge bid and that every penny of this is spent.

1614
02:14:18,145 --> 02:14:24,087
[SPEAKER_11]: When we have people on the payrolls who are very capable of doing this, I compliment them again.

1615
02:14:24,167 --> 02:14:24,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1616
02:14:24,917 --> 02:14:25,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1617
02:14:26,258 --> 02:14:29,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

1618
02:14:29,301 --> 02:14:29,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1619
02:14:29,982 --> 02:14:30,722
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1620
02:14:30,802 --> 02:14:31,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1621
02:14:31,883 --> 02:14:32,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

1622
02:14:32,624 --> 02:14:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Sharon, for coming up tonight.

1623
02:14:34,566 --> 02:14:44,595
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're on to suspension, motions, orders, and resolutions 15-459, petition by Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, to speak on community policing.

1624
02:14:45,056 --> 02:14:45,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1625
02:14:45,276 --> 02:14:47,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin, please state your name and address for the record.

1626
02:14:47,858 --> 02:14:48,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1627
02:14:48,419 --> 02:14:49,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street,

1628
02:14:50,081 --> 02:14:54,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to follow somebody that's very grateful because that very seldom happens here.

1629
02:14:54,105 --> 02:15:04,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank that lady for coming forward and I hope more people come forward when things are done right in the city and they give us compliments or give you guys compliments when things go right.

1630
02:15:06,339 --> 02:15:09,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Community policing is what I'd like to talk about.

1631
02:15:10,837 --> 02:15:21,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a believer in the broken windows theory of policing, which is to say that if I see one word of graffiti on a wall, I can bet that shortly thereafter it'll be covered with graffiti.

1632
02:15:23,585 --> 02:15:29,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are much less likely to litter on a well-kept lawn than on a yard that has one foot of high grass.

1633
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:36,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people maintain their property, it is less likely that somebody's just gonna throw a can of soda on that lawn if it's well-kept.

1634
02:15:38,803 --> 02:15:41,265
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, though, is what to do with these offenders.

1635
02:15:42,705 --> 02:15:47,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Booking someone and creating a record for them is detrimental to their future employment and housing.

1636
02:15:48,549 --> 02:16:00,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once just a punk who spray-painted a wall soon snowballs into a real criminal, especially if he or she spent any time in more seasoned criminals in a prison system.

1637
02:16:00,885 --> 02:16:18,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that we look at new reforms in the city to keep small criminals from becoming a full-blown criminal by making the punishment fit the crime, i.e., if someone spray paints on a wall, we make him or her paint a bathroom in one of our many city buildings.

1638
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:20,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get the punishment.

1639
02:16:20,690 --> 02:16:30,013
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to clean up the wall that they spray painted, if we catch them, and they also have to do something else on top of that to pay for the crime that they committed so that they're held accountable and yet

1640
02:16:30,788 --> 02:16:40,575
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't get a record because once the person gets a record, then it just snowballs into more inappropriate behavior and the negativity just rolls on.

1641
02:16:41,115 --> 02:16:43,197
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's different than violent crimes.

1642
02:16:43,677 --> 02:16:47,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't mistake this for violent criminal activity.

1643
02:16:47,119 --> 02:16:49,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about small stuff like broken windows.

1644
02:16:49,881 --> 02:16:57,827
[SPEAKER_00]: If a kid breaks a window and then you see another kid break a window, if you catch them, I think that we should make them wash all these windows in the city hall.

1645
02:16:58,543 --> 02:17:03,868
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do they have to pay for the window that they broke, but make them wash the city windows in the city hall.

1646
02:17:04,368 --> 02:17:09,853
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way they pay society back, they don't get a record, and we hopefully keep them from doing other stupid stuff.

1647
02:17:11,775 --> 02:17:13,877
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many components to community policing.

1648
02:17:14,317 --> 02:17:18,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighborhood watches, having police walk the beat in the squares and parks.

1649
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:22,224
[SPEAKER_00]: The police officers, not just the chief of police,

1650
02:17:22,833 --> 02:17:36,477
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be invited to churches, community centers, clubs, rotary, and every other formal and informal setting so that we see the police as part of the community and part of the solution, not the problem.

1651
02:17:37,817 --> 02:17:39,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers are human.

1652
02:17:39,878 --> 02:17:40,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a shock.

1653
02:17:41,379 --> 02:17:46,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't personally know a police officer, we tend to forget that.

1654
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:54,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers also have husbands, wives, and children that are affected by the unique work that a police officer has and does.

1655
02:17:55,577 --> 02:17:58,839
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we advocate for the police, we are also advocating for their families.

1656
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:04,423
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress officers suffers from a bad day is often felt by his or her family.

1657
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:08,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Another component to community policing is the need for more women officers.

1658
02:18:09,506 --> 02:18:15,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Women officers can be extremely helpful in cases of domestic violence, prostitution, rape of men, women, and children.

1659
02:18:15,690 --> 02:18:17,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Women officers are needed

1660
02:18:17,512 --> 02:18:22,734
[SPEAKER_00]: for women detainees to ensure women detainees' safety remains intact.

1661
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:31,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Women are also much more better at verbal skills to de-escalate a situation between two parties.

1662
02:18:32,119 --> 02:18:34,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And that skill is going to be needed more in the future.

1663
02:18:37,061 --> 02:18:46,505
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, women officers must stay above reproach in order to hold that public trust in these most sensitive of areas like family disputes and physical assault.

1664
02:18:47,327 --> 02:18:57,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Our police in general must also stand tall and be held to a higher standard than the general population, for they are the only ones given the charge and power to hold someone against their will.

1665
02:18:58,190 --> 02:19:03,291
[SPEAKER_00]: They not only carry a weapon of deadly force, but are trained in deadly force.

1666
02:19:03,551 --> 02:19:05,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Their body, hence, is a weapon of deadly force.

1667
02:19:06,952 --> 02:19:17,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this topic is not an easy one, but as for the black community, I am not sure that just hiring black officers will change the status of the black community in law enforcement and criminal justice.

1668
02:19:17,563 --> 02:19:33,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I am proposing the following, that the city agrees to appoint three volunteers from the black community and at least two volunteers from the white community to hold the official office of advocate whenever a black person is punished off the books or arrested for any charge.

1669
02:19:34,169 --> 02:19:41,871
[SPEAKER_00]: These volunteers must, however, and I do stress must, be viewed by the entire city as valid representatives on behalf of the city and black people of Medford.

1670
02:19:42,491 --> 02:19:46,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Their role is to ensure the fair treatment of the system within the law enforcement community.

1671
02:19:47,432 --> 02:19:55,138
[SPEAKER_00]: These advocates' intentions will not be questioned because they will have no monetary gain from their positions.

1672
02:19:55,959 --> 02:20:03,785
[SPEAKER_00]: The names of the five advocates must be listed on the MEDFED website and seen by every officer from top to bottom as legitimate.

1673
02:20:04,866 --> 02:20:11,651
[SPEAKER_00]: A minister or other leaders in the NAACP and possibly one from the Haitian community could be a beginning start for that.

1674
02:20:12,412 --> 02:20:15,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a minister in the West MEDFED church that's a

1675
02:20:16,545 --> 02:20:23,290
[SPEAKER_00]: white guy, and he's very, very good, and I would recommend his name for one of the two positions.

1676
02:20:23,410 --> 02:20:26,372
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in that West Medford Baptist Church over there.

1677
02:20:27,973 --> 02:20:39,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of community policing which needs to be explored is communication during power outage, like organizing ham radio civilian operators, thinking outside the box.

1678
02:20:40,261 --> 02:20:44,644
[SPEAKER_00]: If our cell towers go down for a weather event or electricity goes down,

1679
02:20:46,035 --> 02:20:54,197
[SPEAKER_00]: HIM operators could become one of the only forms of communication that we have, so they could be included.

1680
02:20:55,037 --> 02:21:00,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything must be on the table to overcome an assault by weather events, mass events, or local crimes.

1681
02:21:01,239 --> 02:21:13,122
[SPEAKER_00]: The arts and a bike trail, like you said, Mr. Marks, using the library as a shared space for the arts, because I believe that we need to create new ways of looking at old problems.

1682
02:21:13,633 --> 02:21:15,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that can do that is the arts community.

1683
02:21:15,855 --> 02:21:17,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really am on that.

1684
02:21:18,517 --> 02:21:19,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in the Springstep thing.

1685
02:21:20,258 --> 02:21:27,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that the library could be elevated or reused completely for that purpose or shared with the library.

1686
02:21:29,125 --> 02:21:33,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Community policing is a much larger concept than the old way of just catch-a-thief policing.

1687
02:21:34,089 --> 02:21:39,534
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an increased population who, when they commit a small crime, end up living a life of crime.

1688
02:21:40,074 --> 02:21:42,136
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are methods to stop this from happening.

1689
02:21:42,705 --> 02:21:44,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to work together as a community.

1690
02:21:45,728 --> 02:21:58,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the bike path, I would like to actually see a bike path from Tufts University down to Mecklen Square to help because the young people from there could actually add energy to this problem as well.

1691
02:21:58,718 --> 02:21:59,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1692
02:21:59,639 --> 02:22:00,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1693
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:00,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin.

1694
02:22:02,361 --> 02:22:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1695
02:22:04,223 --> 02:22:05,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1696
02:22:06,084 --> 02:22:06,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1697
02:22:06,265 --> 02:22:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin, I did want to touch on something that you opened up with, and that was

1698
02:22:09,705 --> 02:22:19,449
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the theory or the situation where if someone gets caught spray painting on the street that they'd be responsible to come back into the community and do some painting or something like that.

1699
02:22:19,769 --> 02:22:25,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to make you aware of a bill that's pending before the Massachusetts State Legislature that was filed by our representative, Sean Garvely.

1700
02:22:26,472 --> 02:22:30,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And this bill would authorize what's called restorative justice.

1701
02:22:30,734 --> 02:22:34,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And the principles behind restorative justice are rather interesting.

1702
02:22:35,396 --> 02:22:38,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way that it works is, you know, the people that are

1703
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:48,236
[SPEAKER_04]: most affected by the crime, the graffiti, would actually benefit collectively from the correction of action that's taken by the perpetrator after they're caught.

1704
02:22:49,017 --> 02:22:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to get into too much detail about restorative justice and the pros and cons and the theories behind it, but I did want to make you aware of the fact that there is some legislation pending at the House of Representatives.

1705
02:22:57,823 --> 02:23:04,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Representative Gobley is the lead sponsor on the bill in the House, and I believe Senator Eldridge is the lead sponsor in the Senate.

1706
02:23:05,138 --> 02:23:11,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suggest if you're really interested in doing a little bit more research, you give Representative Gobley a call, and I'm sure he'd be happy to talk with you about it.

1707
02:23:11,739 --> 02:23:12,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1708
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1709
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:17,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight that the paper be received and placed on file.

1710
02:23:18,321 --> 02:23:19,021
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1711
02:23:19,041 --> 02:23:19,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1712
02:23:19,941 --> 02:23:20,681
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1713
02:23:20,701 --> 02:23:21,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion carries.

1714
02:23:23,202 --> 02:23:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a couple of papers in the hand of the president, and we're getting to yours, offered by President De La Russo.

1715
02:23:31,264 --> 02:23:32,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the mayor

1716
02:23:33,229 --> 02:23:36,631
[SPEAKER_05]: further update the police patrol fleet with new vehicles.

1717
02:23:37,191 --> 02:23:40,192
[SPEAKER_05]: If I might, from the chair, it's pretty clear.

1718
02:23:40,672 --> 02:23:41,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more police cars.

1719
02:23:41,973 --> 02:23:43,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We need new police cars.

1720
02:23:44,354 --> 02:23:54,998
[SPEAKER_05]: 343 has had a dent on it for several months incurred from an altercation the automobile had during the blizzard.

1721
02:23:56,319 --> 02:23:58,240
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more new police cars.

1722
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, Mr. Mayor.

1723
02:23:59,801 --> 02:24:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

1724
02:24:01,401 --> 02:24:02,882
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1725
02:24:03,578 --> 02:24:04,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1726
02:24:04,919 --> 02:24:25,328
[SPEAKER_05]: By Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, headmaster, teachers, staff, and Medford community be recognized for recently receiving a full accreditation for a 10-year period from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

1727
02:24:25,708 --> 02:24:27,209
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to call it NEASC.

1728
02:24:27,609 --> 02:24:29,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1729
02:24:30,368 --> 02:24:31,489
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct, Mr. President.

1730
02:24:31,529 --> 02:24:32,870
[SPEAKER_12]: They still call it Neask.

1731
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:43,938
[SPEAKER_12]: In September of 2014, Neask, which is the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, visited Meffitt High School and Meffitt Vocational Technical High School.

1732
02:24:44,719 --> 02:24:51,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And Meffitt received the best possible rating by the association for a full 10-year accreditation.

1733
02:24:52,705 --> 02:24:59,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that we thank Dr. Perrella, the headmaster, who has done yeoman's work

1734
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:11,493
[SPEAKER_12]: up at that high school and gaining the confidence and improving the curriculum at the high school, and also the new director of the vocational school, who has also done Yeoman's work.

1735
02:25:12,313 --> 02:25:19,415
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers, what all good teachers and teachers that care, this accreditation wouldn't be what it was, Mr. President.

1736
02:25:20,075 --> 02:25:28,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And the parents and the Meffitt community as a whole really had the whereabouts to make sure that

1737
02:25:28,938 --> 02:25:29,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Issues were addressed.

1738
02:25:30,778 --> 02:25:43,481
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we addressed the science labs, which were prior to new science labs, we were in fear of accreditation or being reaccredited, and that came to fruition.

1739
02:25:44,121 --> 02:25:56,483
[SPEAKER_12]: New computers back, I think it was two and a half, three years ago, throughout the school system, and a host of initiatives that have been put forward by Dr. Peralo, the teachers, and the Meffitt community at large.

1740
02:25:57,202 --> 02:26:08,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to congratulate everyone in the system, including the superintendent of schools, Mr. President, who has been at the forefront for many years in public education.

1741
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:11,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a new day and a new dawn in this community.

1742
02:26:11,531 --> 02:26:25,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And I look forward to a future bright and one that attracts students back from outside placements and outside settings, back to where they belong within our own Meffitt Public Schools, Mr. President.

1743
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:26,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that resolution.

1744
02:26:26,581 --> 02:26:32,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, on that motion, Councilor Penta.

1745
02:26:33,186 --> 02:26:44,354
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing that up, but I would also like to, we haven't got a response back to the scuttlebutt that seems to be now emanating more and more of some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school.

1746
02:26:45,175 --> 02:26:46,776
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we need to report back from that.

1747
02:26:46,796 --> 02:26:48,357
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a school committee person here tonight.

1748
02:26:48,857 --> 02:26:50,719
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought she was going to talk on it, but I don't know.

1749
02:26:50,759 --> 02:26:52,780
[SPEAKER_17]: She left, but that's neither here or there.

1750
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:55,062
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's very important to note if in fact,

1751
02:26:55,817 --> 02:27:00,538
[SPEAKER_17]: And from what I understand, this is emanating from the high school side, not from the vocational school side.

1752
02:27:01,138 --> 02:27:05,919
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of the teachers in the vocational school are pretty upset over the fact that, you know, they haven't been put into the loop.

1753
02:27:05,939 --> 02:27:07,299
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't been part of the discussions.

1754
02:27:07,859 --> 02:27:12,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So if vocational education is going to survive in the city of Medford, it just needs to take place.

1755
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:14,600
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the community needs to know what's going on.

1756
02:27:15,221 --> 02:27:19,841
[SPEAKER_17]: For whatever the proposal might be and the discussions that might be going on, you have to put all the parties together.

1757
02:27:20,462 --> 02:27:22,142
[SPEAKER_17]: We asked for a joint meeting with the school committee.

1758
02:27:22,162 --> 02:27:23,042
[SPEAKER_17]: They've yet to respond.

1759
02:27:23,763 --> 02:27:26,904
[SPEAKER_17]: They probably won't respond because they don't want to answer the questions when we ask them.

1760
02:27:27,324 --> 02:27:28,224
[SPEAKER_17]: These are hard questions.

1761
02:27:29,064 --> 02:27:31,985
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it's a proposal and it sounds good, well, let's all hear about it.

1762
02:27:32,485 --> 02:27:45,547
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't think in a maze of an executive decision or executive administrators, they make this decision, and the whole vocational school now becomes an entirely different territory, so to speak, as compared to what the high school has to offer.

1763
02:27:46,328 --> 02:27:48,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, Mr. Clark, I know you have it on there.

1764
02:27:48,728 --> 02:27:53,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll probably repeat my request again, that we get a report back, what, if anything,

1765
02:27:54,353 --> 02:28:06,042
[SPEAKER_17]: is the issue regarding a merger use between the high school and the vocational school as it relates to an incorporation of these classes, because that's what it is.

1766
02:28:06,982 --> 02:28:19,672
[SPEAKER_17]: The word seems to be they're only going to keep three of the vocational school courses that are certified by the Commonwealth, and the rest just become electives to some degree that a kid from the high school can take and have it merge.

1767
02:28:19,712 --> 02:28:21,553
[SPEAKER_17]: And that, to me, would just destroy the whole

1768
02:28:21,943 --> 02:28:23,064
[SPEAKER_17]: idea of vocational school.

1769
02:28:23,084 --> 02:28:26,025
[SPEAKER_17]: And then what are you going to do about all these kids that go to Minuteman?

1770
02:28:26,345 --> 02:28:35,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, where's the increased cost that they're going to take place if we start shipping kids to another vocational school because we're not going to be offering them the full-time services of a vocational school?

1771
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:38,291
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's paramount we get an answer back.

1772
02:28:39,812 --> 02:28:41,033
[SPEAKER_17]: They can have the certification.

1773
02:28:41,053 --> 02:28:42,674
[SPEAKER_17]: They deserve the certification.

1774
02:28:42,714 --> 02:28:43,314
[SPEAKER_17]: They work for it.

1775
02:28:43,834 --> 02:28:47,056
[SPEAKER_17]: But now if it's a new day dawn coming up to be, I think we need to know.

1776
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:52,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, amended by Councilor Penta.

1777
02:28:53,322 --> 02:28:57,883
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, Mr. President, during this past week, there was a fire up at the high school.

1778
02:28:58,743 --> 02:29:09,366
[SPEAKER_17]: And to the best of my knowledge, unfortunately, the fire department does not have a knock spark system that they used to have, which would have enabled them to get into the building without breaking windows and going through.

1779
02:29:10,126 --> 02:29:16,108
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, if we're on this whole issue of the high school, why is there a full time

1780
02:29:17,117 --> 02:29:23,379
[SPEAKER_17]: fireperson there because the fire alarm system still is inoperative, I believe, on the third floor of the building.

1781
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:25,640
[SPEAKER_17]: These are important questions.

1782
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:38,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you realize what the cost is to put a fireman there every single day to be a watchdog because the alarm systems aren't working or isn't working like it's supposed to concurrently, you know, within the whole building?

1783
02:29:38,465 --> 02:29:43,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we get a report back on this, Mr. President, if we make these side papers, if you want B and C papers?

1784
02:29:44,402 --> 02:29:46,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll do them as amendments.

1785
02:29:46,502 --> 02:29:47,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

1786
02:29:48,123 --> 02:29:57,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, just if I could, and I appreciate what Councilor Penta just mentioned about the separation of the vocational school and the high school.

1787
02:29:57,664 --> 02:30:07,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can tell you there's not a stronger advocate in the city as a former graduate of Meffitt Vocational Technical High School for a vocational education in this city.

1788
02:30:08,686 --> 02:30:11,367
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can tell you what I experienced back so many years ago,

1789
02:30:12,872 --> 02:30:17,994
[SPEAKER_12]: As a member of the vocational or student at the vocational school, there was always a clear separation.

1790
02:30:18,074 --> 02:30:24,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Vocational kids never went past a certain set of doors, never mingled with high school kids.

1791
02:30:24,796 --> 02:30:26,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Our lunches were separate.

1792
02:30:26,436 --> 02:30:29,717
[SPEAKER_12]: The outside activities, the recesses were separate.

1793
02:30:30,058 --> 02:30:31,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything was always separate.

1794
02:30:31,978 --> 02:30:40,841
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's a movement now, and I'm not privy to any more information than anyone else is, but there's a movement underway starting from the new science labs, which

1795
02:30:41,445 --> 02:30:56,815
[SPEAKER_12]: the initiative took place about two years ago, to incorporate vocational education somewhat outside of the confines of the vocational school, which we all know is pretty much two hallways on two floors in the entire building.

1796
02:30:57,596 --> 02:31:10,444
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see it as a very positive initiative to include vocational kids with the new science labs, to possibly open the curriculum to

1797
02:31:10,974 --> 02:31:14,375
[SPEAKER_12]: vocational kids that never had an option, Mr. President.

1798
02:31:15,015 --> 02:31:22,958
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, as one, worked in the trade for a period of time and decided a trade wasn't for me, and went back to school and got a degree.

1799
02:31:23,598 --> 02:31:30,040
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's what they're trying to instill within our vocational school.

1800
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:40,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd rather see three or four shops in the vocational school that are solid shops attracting students than to have

1801
02:31:40,492 --> 02:31:44,574
[SPEAKER_12]: a host of shops that really don't attract many students.

1802
02:31:45,275 --> 02:31:51,538
[SPEAKER_12]: And you don't want to go into them because there's no future in what the offerings are.

1803
02:31:52,078 --> 02:31:54,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's a need to expand up there.

1804
02:31:54,580 --> 02:31:58,722
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a need to offer state-of-the-art equipment.

1805
02:31:59,042 --> 02:32:02,184
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a need to look at the current offerings up there.

1806
02:32:02,724 --> 02:32:04,345
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's what they're doing now.

1807
02:32:05,046 --> 02:32:07,487
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, as one person, welcome that.

1808
02:32:08,352 --> 02:32:13,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I know when I was at the vocational school, we used to have a week of shop and a week of related.

1809
02:32:14,115 --> 02:32:25,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think over the years, you know, the people much more educated than I said, you know what, we can no longer really have kids in the shop for one week because they're not getting the education that they need.

1810
02:32:26,382 --> 02:32:30,404
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, people think you go into a vocational education, you don't need the education.

1811
02:32:30,824 --> 02:32:34,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me tell you, a lot of kids I went to school with, they opened their own business.

1812
02:32:34,386 --> 02:32:34,787
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

1813
02:32:34,827 --> 02:32:37,228
[SPEAKER_12]: When you open your own business, it's not just a matter of,

1814
02:32:37,875 --> 02:32:39,877
[SPEAKER_12]: turning a screw or hammering a nail.

1815
02:32:40,537 --> 02:32:42,578
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a matter of doing the finances.

1816
02:32:42,939 --> 02:32:45,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a matter of doing the bookkeeping.

1817
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:53,626
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a matter of doing the workers' compensation, health care, and everything else involved with opening a business, especially a small business.

1818
02:32:54,207 --> 02:33:06,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have to make sure we educate these students, not just on the trade aspect, but also in the educational aspect and the aspect of opening a business or working in a company and so forth.

1819
02:33:06,777 --> 02:33:35,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's what the vocational school's poised to do, and I hope there's gonna be a lot of dialogue, but I see it as a very positive thing, and I'm sure my council colleague does too, but we haven't heard the nuts and bolts of this, but there is something coming forward, and I think we're gonna see some changes, and change is healthy, in my opinion, and from what I see, it's necessary within our vocational school to keep it up to the 21st century,

1820
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:45,768
[SPEAKER_12]: provide the state-of-the-art offerings, and take back the 100 or so kids that go to Lexington Minute Man because the offerings that we have are inadequate, to be quite honest with you.

1821
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:54,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see it as positive, and I look forward to the discussion and dialogue, and I'm sure the school committee is something they're working on.

1822
02:33:54,555 --> 02:34:03,382
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is a positive thing, and the interaction of vocational students with high school students and the use of

1823
02:34:04,295 --> 02:34:08,618
[SPEAKER_12]: The equipment and the technology, vice versa, works both ways.

1824
02:34:08,678 --> 02:34:12,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see this as a win-win, Mr. President, and I look forward to it.

1825
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1826
02:34:15,342 --> 02:34:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counselor Mox.

1827
02:34:16,142 --> 02:34:16,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Knight.

1828
02:34:17,363 --> 02:34:18,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1829
02:34:19,084 --> 02:34:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And Counselor Mox, thank you for your words, because I, too, remember that imaginary line down the middle of Medford High School that, you know, if you opened the doors and stepped into the vocational school for Medford High, you'd think that alarms were going to go off and someone was going to come and put you in detention.

1830
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:39,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a firm believer in integration and inclusion, Mr. President, and I think that it adds a lot to education.

1831
02:34:39,954 --> 02:34:43,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it adds a lot to the experience, number one.

1832
02:34:43,456 --> 02:35:00,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, I think that it's important when we look at what direction our vocational school is going in, which really, you know, should be established by the policy makers at the school department, we need to really put a focus on the fact of what our state's driver is, what our state's economy is, and that's really the life sciences and stem-based occupations, Mr. President.

1833
02:35:03,258 --> 02:35:14,065
[SPEAKER_04]: providing a vocational education to our students and this vocational education isn't changing with the times, isn't changing with the actual economy that's out there for them to be employed in in the future, then we're not doing our job.

1834
02:35:14,885 --> 02:35:32,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, again, I certainly am not scared to see the walls, those imaginary walls at Medford High School come down so that the children in the vocational school and the children in the high school can integrate and be included with each other, develop good friendships, develop a sense of community, a sense of rapport, Mr. President, and then become strong contributing members to our society here in Medford.

1835
02:35:33,627 --> 02:35:37,911
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would like to see these papers separated.

1836
02:35:38,511 --> 02:35:42,014
[SPEAKER_04]: On April 29th, we took a vote, and that vote stands.

1837
02:35:42,174 --> 02:35:44,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been 90 days since that vote's gone through.

1838
02:35:44,276 --> 02:35:46,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on our rules, it's a paper that should be ruled out of order.

1839
02:35:47,318 --> 02:35:49,640
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'll leave it up to you to make a judgment on the paper.

1840
02:35:50,181 --> 02:35:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'd support Councilor Moxley's resolution wholeheartedly to congratulate the administrators, faculty, staff, members of the school committee, and so on.

1841
02:35:58,727 --> 02:35:59,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1842
02:35:59,128 --> 02:36:01,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion to sever the resolutions,

1843
02:36:03,379 --> 02:36:08,562
[SPEAKER_05]: On the main motion of Councillor Marks of congratulations, all those in favour?

1844
02:36:08,582 --> 02:36:09,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1845
02:36:10,343 --> 02:36:11,043
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1846
02:36:13,404 --> 02:36:13,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1847
02:36:14,245 --> 02:36:14,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1848
02:36:15,385 --> 02:36:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1849
02:36:16,886 --> 02:36:24,651
[SPEAKER_05]: On the second part, the B paper of Councillor Penta reiterating previous requests to get an update.

1850
02:36:25,551 --> 02:36:26,372
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favour?

1851
02:36:26,392 --> 02:36:26,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1852
02:36:27,352 --> 02:36:28,073
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1853
02:36:28,573 --> 02:36:28,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1854
02:36:30,674 --> 02:36:31,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1855
02:36:33,436 --> 02:36:39,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, reverting back to the regular order of business under the motion of Councilor Camuso.

1856
02:36:39,882 --> 02:36:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1857
02:36:40,582 --> 02:36:41,303
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1858
02:36:42,284 --> 02:36:45,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular order of business, 15-455 offered by Councilor Penta.

1859
02:36:46,427 --> 02:36:59,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved, since the mayor has yet to update the citizens, businesses, community of West Medford and this council on the contaminated West Medford parking lot underground soil

1860
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: a public hearing before the council be called with all parties invited.

1861
02:37:04,683 --> 02:37:05,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

1862
02:37:07,685 --> 02:37:20,975
[SPEAKER_17]: On March 11th of this past year, just two months, we had a resolution that was passed unanimously by this council for the purposes of getting an update as to what's going on as it relates to the remediation of the parking lot in West Medford.

1863
02:37:22,156 --> 02:37:23,056
[SPEAKER_17]: We still haven't heard anything.

1864
02:37:23,577 --> 02:37:26,579
[SPEAKER_17]: As Councilor Caviello will attest to, we've heard numbers range anywhere

1865
02:37:27,101 --> 02:37:31,182
[SPEAKER_17]: from $2 million to almost $7, $8, $9 million to have this thing remediated.

1866
02:37:32,142 --> 02:37:56,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Come to find out that supposedly on March 14, two days later, excuse me, on March 13, a meeting did take place with the Director of Energy and Environment as it relates to the brownfields, the dirt contamination, the cleanup efforts, and the buildings that have been affected in West Medford in that particular area.

1867
02:37:57,530 --> 02:37:59,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we know we have a mayor that's going out of office.

1868
02:37:59,931 --> 02:38:02,513
[SPEAKER_17]: He's made that announcement.

1869
02:38:02,553 --> 02:38:09,756
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a budget director that's going to be leaving at the end of the week, because that person is deciding to try to go to other places.

1870
02:38:10,277 --> 02:38:16,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have a multimillion-dollar issue facing us right here, again, with no resolution.

1871
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:18,901
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not making any sense at all.

1872
02:38:19,842 --> 02:38:23,704
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a time schedule that was proposed way back when as to what would take place.

1873
02:38:24,424 --> 02:38:26,165
[SPEAKER_17]: We were told that we would be kept into the loop.

1874
02:38:26,545 --> 02:38:28,586
[SPEAKER_17]: We were told the public hearings that would take place.

1875
02:38:29,847 --> 02:38:44,276
[SPEAKER_17]: And part of the report that was submitted on March 13th indicates there was additional work that must be done to meet EPA requirements before a preferred work plan can be presented to the occupants of the buildings and to the general public in that particular parking lot.

1876
02:38:45,196 --> 02:38:46,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we haven't seen or heard anything.

1877
02:38:48,038 --> 02:38:50,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just not making any sense at all, Mr. President.

1878
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:53,381
[SPEAKER_17]: The last time we got an update was August 11, 2014.

1879
02:38:56,217 --> 02:39:05,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we're talking about March of 2015, and we still have no response as to what's going on.

1880
02:39:06,162 --> 02:39:08,843
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know where we're going with all of this, Mr. President.

1881
02:39:09,143 --> 02:39:12,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I really think we need to be apprised as to what is going on.

1882
02:39:13,985 --> 02:39:14,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, I apologize.

1883
02:39:15,386 --> 02:39:16,066
[SPEAKER_17]: It's March of 2014.

1884
02:39:17,106 --> 02:39:20,788
[SPEAKER_17]: The last time we had any communication was August of 2014.

1885
02:39:22,569 --> 02:39:25,230
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're well over six, seven, eight months

1886
02:39:26,033 --> 02:39:27,454
[SPEAKER_17]: and not getting any response.

1887
02:39:27,614 --> 02:39:32,696
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not getting anything as with the state DEP or the EPA.

1888
02:39:32,996 --> 02:39:35,037
[SPEAKER_17]: We're getting no cost proposals or anything.

1889
02:39:35,077 --> 02:39:39,460
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, why are the department heads just refusing to answer us?

1890
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:41,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is the mayor doing this?

1891
02:39:42,381 --> 02:39:42,921
[SPEAKER_17]: He's leaving.

1892
02:39:42,941 --> 02:39:43,642
[SPEAKER_17]: He doesn't care.

1893
02:39:44,022 --> 02:39:46,543
[SPEAKER_17]: It's quite obvious he hasn't cared for a long period of time.

1894
02:39:47,443 --> 02:39:50,845
[SPEAKER_17]: But the taxpayers need to know because this is going to cost them.

1895
02:39:50,885 --> 02:39:54,607
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be out of their pocket one way or the other if we don't get any bonds

1896
02:39:55,263 --> 02:39:57,324
[SPEAKER_17]: or we don't get any federal, we don't get any state money.

1897
02:39:59,445 --> 02:40:00,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, Mr. President.

1898
02:40:01,946 --> 02:40:02,506
[SPEAKER_17]: You know something?

1899
02:40:02,946 --> 02:40:04,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to move that we have Alicia Hunt.

1900
02:40:05,387 --> 02:40:06,988
[SPEAKER_17]: She's the environmental person.

1901
02:40:07,128 --> 02:40:14,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Come down and meet with us and give us an update as to what's going on, because it's obvious that our city engineer is not doing that.

1902
02:40:14,591 --> 02:40:15,872
[SPEAKER_17]: We've asked for her to come down.

1903
02:40:15,952 --> 02:40:20,534
[SPEAKER_17]: She responds and, you know, I don't even know who to talk to around here anymore.

1904
02:40:21,494 --> 02:40:23,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anybody know who's in charge?

1905
02:40:24,775 --> 02:40:27,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Fidel Russo, in a few weeks, will be in charge.

1906
02:40:28,717 --> 02:40:28,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah?

1907
02:40:29,698 --> 02:40:31,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you said it, Councilor Camuso.

1908
02:40:31,559 --> 02:40:33,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, loud and clear, and I agree with you.

1909
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:34,680
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the rumor.

1910
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:41,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me tell you, if that rumor comes to fruition, if that rumor comes to fruition, shame on this city.

1911
02:40:41,764 --> 02:40:42,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Shame on this city.

1912
02:40:43,005 --> 02:40:44,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Shame on this city?

1913
02:40:44,485 --> 02:40:46,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Shame on this city, because you know something?

1914
02:40:46,447 --> 02:40:47,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even know if you want the job.

1915
02:40:47,627 --> 02:40:48,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you're up for it.

1916
02:40:50,128 --> 02:40:51,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you have a hard time with this job.

1917
02:40:51,649 --> 02:40:52,890
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what you would do as being mayor.

1918
02:40:54,659 --> 02:41:01,061
[SPEAKER_17]: So, well, let's say, listen, why would he mix 500,000 in another job?

1919
02:41:01,301 --> 02:41:02,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would you want to pay for 141?

1920
02:41:05,482 --> 02:41:07,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if you don't like me here, then what do you want me to do?

1921
02:41:08,143 --> 02:41:09,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't tell me what to do.

1922
02:41:09,083 --> 02:41:09,503
[SPEAKER_17]: You run.

1923
02:41:09,804 --> 02:41:12,464
[SPEAKER_17]: If you think it's such a great job, it's personal.

1924
02:41:12,504 --> 02:41:13,565
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very comfortable too.

1925
02:41:13,645 --> 02:41:14,585
[SPEAKER_17]: So don't tell me what to do.

1926
02:41:16,058 --> 02:41:17,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

1927
02:41:17,139 --> 02:41:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Pinto that the Director of Environmental Affairs meet with the City and meet with us and give us an update.

1928
02:41:28,586 --> 02:41:31,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Meet with, an update, present themselves before the Council for an update.

1929
02:41:31,347 --> 02:41:36,891
[SPEAKER_17]: You know something, you better enclose the Office of Community Development because they had something to do with this with Brown and Carlwell as it relates to that.

1930
02:41:36,991 --> 02:41:44,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We will also invite not only the City Engineer, the Head of Environmental Affairs and the OCD Director.

1931
02:41:47,768 --> 02:41:51,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, on the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Caviello.

1932
02:41:52,029 --> 02:42:01,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I was notified by one of the businesses down there in the west side today that the mayor is going ahead with his injection plan.

1933
02:42:05,312 --> 02:42:13,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just, I was, that they were informed that he was going to go away, he was going ahead with, they were going to dig up some dirt and inject the chemicals under the building.

1934
02:42:14,175 --> 02:42:15,715
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the plans that was talked about.

1935
02:42:16,653 --> 02:42:20,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know, but let's say I found that out today through one of the businesses.

1936
02:42:21,636 --> 02:42:23,217
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe that's true.

1937
02:42:23,257 --> 02:42:23,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's not true.

1938
02:42:23,897 --> 02:42:24,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1939
02:42:26,699 --> 02:42:27,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, counselor Penta.

1940
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:38,626
[SPEAKER_17]: As it relates to council, um, cover yellows terminology, March of last year, they were supposed to establish a quality assurance plan made in June of last year.

1941
02:42:38,646 --> 02:42:43,249
[SPEAKER_17]: They were supposed to collect all the data that was needed to refine, to refine phase three.

1942
02:42:43,743 --> 02:42:48,586
[SPEAKER_17]: July and August last year, they're supposed to write the phase three plan, which would be four to six weeks out.

1943
02:42:48,887 --> 02:42:51,088
[SPEAKER_17]: In September, there was supposed to be a public comment period.

1944
02:42:51,108 --> 02:42:51,729
[SPEAKER_17]: We never had it.

1945
02:42:52,049 --> 02:42:54,130
[SPEAKER_17]: October, the city was supposed to respond to the comments.

1946
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:55,451
[SPEAKER_17]: We never heard anything about it.

1947
02:42:55,711 --> 02:42:59,454
[SPEAKER_17]: In late fall and winter final, they will have the final remediation design.

1948
02:43:00,234 --> 02:43:02,436
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the city signed off on.

1949
02:43:04,878 --> 02:43:05,858
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't seen any of that.

1950
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:09,821
[SPEAKER_17]: And now you're telling me he's going to be digging holes and sticking liquid in there?

1951
02:43:19,130 --> 02:43:27,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they inject chemicals under the buildings and the chemical is supposed to dissipate.

1952
02:43:27,637 --> 02:43:30,780
[SPEAKER_17]: That was something that was discussed but it wasn't decided upon.

1953
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:33,862
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't decide on anything when you haven't had the public hearing.

1954
02:43:34,683 --> 02:43:37,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I was informed by one of the building owners today.

1955
02:43:39,347 --> 02:43:41,128
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion, Councilor Camuso.

1956
02:43:41,328 --> 02:43:42,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1957
02:43:42,529 --> 02:43:44,591
[SPEAKER_15]: You know who I really feel bad for in this whole debacle?

1958
02:43:45,394 --> 02:43:53,099
[SPEAKER_15]: is the business owners on those three properties that are affected by a contaminated lot that is owned by the city of Medford.

1959
02:43:53,759 --> 02:44:09,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that the administration was doing their due diligence to see if there was insurance policies in place to go back and go after whoever contaminated this land 80 years ago, but the fact of the matter is these businesses are suffering.

1960
02:44:09,508 --> 02:44:11,790
[SPEAKER_15]: You go into any of those businesses and

1961
02:44:13,411 --> 02:44:20,594
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the breathing, sorry, they have the equipment in them to make sure that they're breathing quality air.

1962
02:44:20,614 --> 02:44:22,975
[SPEAKER_15]: They're having the levels tested.

1963
02:44:23,455 --> 02:44:24,135
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, you know what?

1964
02:44:25,476 --> 02:44:29,817
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to have some sort of a plan for this as a community, you know?

1965
02:44:30,378 --> 02:44:34,819
[SPEAKER_15]: If indeed it's gonna be costing the amount of money they're saying to do this, you know what?

1966
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:41,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Take all three properties by eminent domain, do a whole development, and at the same time you clean it up.

1967
02:44:42,493 --> 02:44:45,614
[SPEAKER_15]: You clean it up, and you give these people back somehow, some way.

1968
02:44:45,634 --> 02:45:00,778
[SPEAKER_15]: You know you work it out that the current owners would be paid for the value of their land, but they'd also be given an opportunity in the new development, whatever it may be, to do the same type of establishment.

1969
02:45:02,038 --> 02:45:02,318
[SPEAKER_15]: You know?

1970
02:45:03,639 --> 02:45:05,499
[SPEAKER_15]: First right of refusal and things like that.

1971
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:09,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, enough is enough.

1972
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:10,941
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the vision comes into play.

1973
02:45:11,779 --> 02:45:15,823
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to, it's like Locust Street, when people say, we gotta do some rezoning down there.

1974
02:45:16,163 --> 02:45:16,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, guess what?

1975
02:45:17,064 --> 02:45:19,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Locust Street in that area can be reconfigured.

1976
02:45:19,506 --> 02:45:23,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have to remain Locust Street, a straight shot from Mystic Valley Parkway to Riverside Avenue.

1977
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:25,130
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be called the Saks.

1978
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:28,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be a shopping area on the Mystic River.

1979
02:45:29,975 --> 02:45:34,638
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of options down there, but this is where vision comes into place, Mr. President.

1980
02:45:35,139 --> 02:45:38,702
[SPEAKER_15]: But the business owners, I'm sorry, the property owners,

1981
02:45:39,374 --> 02:45:44,839
[SPEAKER_15]: It's coming to a point now where they're lucky that this hasn't put some of them out of business.

1982
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:50,003
[SPEAKER_15]: The amount of money and funding and time and energy that they've put into this project.

1983
02:45:54,805 --> 02:46:23,187
[SPEAKER_05]: through councillor yeah but thank you last but not least has the city ever looked into working out some arrangement where they could take over the whole thing buy it by the property from the owners and do a development which will pay for the cleanup essentially hopefully we'll get those questions answered when we have those department heads before us this is a good issue for an update it's an important issue so on the motion of councillor Penta

1984
02:46:23,618 --> 02:46:24,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Pentland.

1985
02:46:24,539 --> 02:46:34,104
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion, Councilor Camuso is alluding to, I know one in particular is just having a hard time, can't even refinance because the bank is aware of the fact of the chemical problem over there.

1986
02:46:34,524 --> 02:46:39,287
[SPEAKER_17]: But you must have been reading my notes because we had this discussion a couple of years ago as it relates to that.

1987
02:46:40,067 --> 02:46:43,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's where a perfect public-private partnership could take place.

1988
02:46:43,609 --> 02:46:44,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1989
02:46:44,149 --> 02:46:52,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, you could take that whole area over there, ask all the business people to put in whatever the X amount is, the city puts in X amount of money, the state, I mean, he has his

1990
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:55,571
[SPEAKER_17]: He has the ability to do all the parks over three times.

1991
02:46:55,611 --> 02:46:57,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Let him find out some money for business.

1992
02:46:57,492 --> 02:46:59,353
[SPEAKER_17]: You're killing them with the land over there.

1993
02:46:59,594 --> 02:47:09,219
[SPEAKER_17]: You killed them with a 10-year contract for the trash, a 10-year contract for the kiosk, a 10-year contract with Comcast, and then you're going to leave town with this mess.

1994
02:47:09,499 --> 02:47:11,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Councilor Pinto, let me just talk a little bit more about vision.

1995
02:47:13,121 --> 02:47:14,982
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no vision there when you're talking about 10 years.

1996
02:47:15,002 --> 02:47:18,084
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm talking about Paul Camuso's vision, not the mayor or anyone else.

1997
02:47:18,204 --> 02:47:19,344
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Paul Camuso's vision.

1998
02:47:21,475 --> 02:47:22,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Think about this.

1999
02:47:23,195 --> 02:47:27,056
[SPEAKER_15]: We have money that's set aside right now in a transportation bond bill for the garage in Medford Square.

2000
02:47:28,397 --> 02:47:42,660
[SPEAKER_15]: We could put some sort of parking down there that could abut the train station, where it currently exists on the other side of the tracks, so the train doesn't even have to stop anymore and basically cause the confusion that it does, and it stops for 20 minutes when it's an inbound train.

2001
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:48,961
[SPEAKER_15]: There's stuff to be done down there, potentially, by using some of these monies and capital that's put aside.

2002
02:47:50,278 --> 02:47:59,844
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, but unless you get engaged in the conversation and talk about bringing a real solution to the table, we're just going to keep having conversations about this.

2003
02:48:00,284 --> 02:48:08,609
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is a real good opportunity for a public-private partnership to get together for the city to purchase the land in question.

2004
02:48:08,989 --> 02:48:14,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, the buildings that's directly around the land.

2005
02:48:17,294 --> 02:48:18,195
[SPEAKER_15]: You clean up the site.

2006
02:48:19,134 --> 02:48:21,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you turn around and you put it up for bid.

2007
02:48:22,916 --> 02:48:25,718
[SPEAKER_15]: And here's the other thing, too.

2008
02:48:26,438 --> 02:48:29,981
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're doing that, a developer can come in and put a garage underground.

2009
02:48:30,681 --> 02:48:32,262
[SPEAKER_15]: A garage underground in West Medford.

2010
02:48:32,322 --> 02:48:34,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Add another 200 spots to West Medford Square.

2011
02:48:36,405 --> 02:48:38,726
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all stuff that should be talked about.

2012
02:48:39,006 --> 02:48:39,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Or bury the train.

2013
02:48:40,847 --> 02:48:41,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

2014
02:48:41,508 --> 02:48:44,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you look at that specific land, it's perfect.

2015
02:48:44,409 --> 02:48:45,310
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a triangle.

2016
02:48:45,769 --> 02:48:51,953
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got the building where Snappy Patty's is, you have the liquor store and the hair salon, and then you have the building out behind it.

2017
02:48:52,213 --> 02:48:58,277
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got a good acre, acre and a half of land there if you put it all together with very, very, very good potential.

2018
02:48:58,777 --> 02:48:59,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, what is it?

2019
02:49:00,698 --> 02:49:04,160
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a sick area that is going to cost us millions of dollars to clean.

2020
02:49:04,180 --> 02:49:07,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's try to come up with something to clean it up

2021
02:49:07,756 --> 02:49:15,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure the business owners too, and we certainly can't speak to them, file them, because this is just quick thoughts.

2022
02:49:15,912 --> 02:49:18,156
[SPEAKER_15]: But the liquor store, for instance.

2023
02:49:21,484 --> 02:49:23,905
[SPEAKER_15]: They get a brand new site to operate his current business.

2024
02:49:23,925 --> 02:49:26,286
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to have more environmentally friendly coolers.

2025
02:49:26,306 --> 02:49:29,367
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to have more environmentally friendly business.

2026
02:49:29,787 --> 02:49:37,490
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to have more environmentally friendly cooling systems, heating and HVAC air conditioners, and just the regular heating.

2027
02:49:38,010 --> 02:49:44,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, monthly expenses will go down with a new development there for the current landowners.

2028
02:49:44,773 --> 02:49:46,753
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is where you have to have a vision.

2029
02:49:49,142 --> 02:49:52,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, Locust Street, I think we're missing the boat on Locust Street.

2030
02:49:53,404 --> 02:49:58,447
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why I didn't support another auto body shop down there a year and a half ago.

2031
02:49:59,067 --> 02:50:04,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Locust Street is a premier spot to get a good development like a Stations Landing.

2032
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:08,412
[SPEAKER_15]: No one ever thought Stations Landing would be as beautiful as it is today.

2033
02:50:09,232 --> 02:50:09,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody.

2034
02:50:09,892 --> 02:50:12,034
[SPEAKER_15]: What was Stations Landing previously known for?

2035
02:50:12,314 --> 02:50:17,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Going down to get your Christmas trees, going to Bickford's, and then going to Strawberries to get a new record of tape when it came out.

2036
02:50:17,356 --> 02:50:17,876
[SPEAKER_15]: That was about it.

2037
02:50:19,318 --> 02:50:19,698
[SPEAKER_15]: What was it?

2038
02:50:19,878 --> 02:50:20,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard's car.

2039
02:50:21,199 --> 02:50:21,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard's car hop.

2040
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:22,681
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a little bit older.

2041
02:50:23,441 --> 02:50:35,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but with that being said, uh, that, that, that had some vision and there's no reason why some other of these other areas in our community that are blighted somewhat or environmentally sick can't be done in the same way.

2042
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:36,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at the DPW yard.

2043
02:50:36,851 --> 02:50:38,633
[SPEAKER_15]: The DPW yard looks beautiful now.

2044
02:50:40,274 --> 02:50:40,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

2045
02:50:41,034 --> 02:50:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2046
02:50:41,355 --> 02:50:43,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Musil.

2047
02:50:44,137 --> 02:50:45,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caravaglia.

2048
02:50:45,438 --> 02:50:48,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what Councilor Pinter and Councilor Camuso are looking for,

2049
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:52,863
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the Office of Redevelopment, which we do not have in this building.

2050
02:50:53,303 --> 02:50:54,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Redevelopment Authority.

2051
02:50:54,204 --> 02:50:56,886
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Redevelopment, not OCD or anything.

2052
02:50:56,946 --> 02:50:58,307
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Redevelopment.

2053
02:50:58,948 --> 02:50:59,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

2054
02:50:59,608 --> 02:51:05,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope that the new mayor has that vision to put that into the new administration.

2055
02:51:05,673 --> 02:51:07,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, he will.

2056
02:51:07,154 --> 02:51:09,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

2057
02:51:10,297 --> 02:51:10,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2058
02:51:10,997 --> 02:51:11,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

2059

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

[SPEAKER_05]: The records, the tabled records of the April 20th meeting were passed by Councilor
